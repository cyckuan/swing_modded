Amnesty accuses Sri Lankan military of human rights abuses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Amnesty International accused the Sri
Lankan military and an allied Tamil paramilitary group on Thursday
of being responsible for the disappearances of eight civilians in
northern Sri Lanka.
	   The eight Tamil men, including four teenagers, disappeared after
being arrested in the Vavuniya district between Oct. 27 and Dec.
21, Amnesty said in a statement.
	   Six of them are believed to have been abducted by the Peoples'
Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam and two by government
troops, Amnesty said.
	   Both PLOTE and the military denied knowledge of the arrests,
although witnesses reported seeing members of PLOTE and the army
arresting them.
	   An Amnesty team visited Vavuniya in October and accused PLOTE of
running three torture camps in the area, 240 kilometers (150 miles)
north of the capital, Colombo.
	   ``Amnesty delegates found evidence of severe torture at two
places run by the PLOTE in which about 40 prisoners were estimated
to be held,'' Amnesty said.
	   PLOTE, a former guerrilla group that fought the military until
1987 for a homeland for the country's ethnic Tamil minority, says
the camps only house its members and aren't used to detain people.
	   PLOTE and five other former rebel groups, all of which accepted
promises of more freedom for Tamils within Sri Lanka, are helping
the military against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the only
group still fighting for a separate homeland.
	   The missing civilians were refugees from the northern war zone.
PLOTE is active in hunting for LTTE infiltrators among the
refugees.
	   More than 56,000 people have been killed in the war.

Government inaction may lead to AIDS explosion in Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT KEITH-REID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SUVA, Fiji (AP) _ Widespread complacency and ignorance among
many Pacific Island leaders could result in an explosion of AIDS in
the region, two of Oceania's leading anti-AIDS workers said
Thursday.
	   Steven Vete, the Tongan director of the Suva-based AIDS project
run by the U.N. Development Program, said many political leaders
``can't grasp or get to grips with the problem'' of emerging
infection in island communities.
	   He said governments had been inactive or ineffective in
following up on the establishment of AIDS task force committees
formed in the region in recent years.
	   Jane Tyler, director of an Australian-funded non-government
organization AIDS Task Force in Fiji, said: ``There is enormous
complacency, there is no political will and throughout the region
there is no true understanding of the nature and treatment of
HIV-AIDs.''
	   She said the small number of reported AIDS cases in the Pacific
Islands compared to other nations belies the extent of the inroads
the disease has made in the region.
	   According to the Pacific Community, a regional economic and
social development agency, the number of reported cases in a region
of 7 million people in 22 Pacific countries rose from 26 HIV and
three AIDS cases in 1986 to 1,757 HIV and 584 AIDS cases in October
1998.
	   ``From the time of infection to the time the disease becomes
evident is about eight years, and this in a region where the level
of sexual activity involving young people is very, very high,''
Tyler said.
	   Vete said governments were claiming there was no money to combat
AIDS, and that awareness propaganda couldn't be printed or
broadcast without violating strong cultural taboos against
discussion of sexual matters.
	   But experience with anti-AIDS projects in Samoa, the Solomon
Islands and Tonga had shown people there were highly receptive to
explicit information, Vete said.
	   ``For leaders to say `It is against our tradition' is just an
excuse for inaction,'' he said.
	   Tyler, whose task force fostered strong regional interest
through its previous work with prostitutes and homosexuals, said it
was still seeking funding for work planned for 1999 on building a
network of regional non-government organizations alerted to the
AIDS menace.
	   Kiribati, a country of 34 atolls inhabited by 84,000
Micronesians, is rated by AIDS experts as being exceptionally
exposed to the AIDS threat due to infection carried home by
thousands of Kiribati seamen employed aboard foreign cargoships.
	   President Teburoro Tito told The Associated Press: ``I don't
know what to do with this AIDS. I don't know how it is coming.
	   ``Maybe it is the wind that brings it, or whatever, or maybe the
seamen, or maybe the visitors coming in, the visitors or guests.''

No Christmas morning sleep-in for English
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Santa Claus has arrived early for
the English cricket team, bringing wives and girlfriends to join
the players on their beleagured tour of Australia.
	   Otherwise, England will be sweating through fielding training on
Christmas morning at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in preparation
for Saturday's fourth Ashes test against Australia.
	   The holiday marks another day on the touring calendar for
England, although morale has been lifted by the arrival of wives
and girlfriends for the festive season.
	   From England's point of view, Friday also happens to be the eve
of one of cricket's biggest days, the opening of the Dec. 26 test.
	   More than 70,000 people are expected to follow tradition and
flock to cricket's oldest test venue on Saturday regardless of the
Ashes already having been decided in Australia's favor after three
tests.
	   Australia's test squad will gather at the team hotel Saturday
before a low-key training session in the afternoon to run off the
Christmas lunch.
	   One man certain not to over-indulge is fast bowler Glenn
McGrath, who will be required to prove his fitness after missing
training Thursday with a virus.
	   England will name its team after the Christmas Day fielding
session.
	   The Australian team: Mark Taylor (captain), Steve Waugh, Michael
Slater, Justin Langer, Mark Waugh, Darren Lehmann, Ian Healy,
Damien Fleming, Stuart MacGill, Matthew Nicholson, Glenn McGrath,
Colin Miller (12th man to be named). (djp)

Former official escapes jail in Japan bribe case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former official at a state-run company avoided a
jail term Thursday after being found guilty of taking bribes, part
of a string of scandals tainting Japan's bureaucracy and several
top banks and brokerages.
	   Takehiko Isaka, 55, a director of the Japan Public Highway
Corp., was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison, suspended
for three years, and fined 6.8 million yen (dlrs 59,000).
	   The suspension means he will not serve time in jail if he stays
out of trouble for three years.
	   Isaka accepted some 7.2 million yen (dlrs 60,000) in bribes in
the form of wining and dining by companies such as Nomura
Securities Co. and Fuji Bank in exchange for helping them win
business from the corporation, according to a Tokyo District Court
ruling.
	   Prosecutors had sought a prison term of three years and asked
that he be made to pay a fine of 6.84 million yen (dlrs 59,000).
	   Isaka was treated to lavish dinners or expensive golf outings
113 times between July 1994 and April 1997.
	   In addition to Nomura and Fuji, he was also entertained by
officials from The Industrial Bank of Japan, the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan, Sakura Bank, Daiwa Securities Co. and Nikko
Securities Co.
	   In exchange for the bribes, Isaka helped the companies win
contracts to underwrite bond sales for the highway corporation, the
court said. The highway corporation operates a network of
expressways across Japan, which it funds through bond sales.
	   Isaka, who is also a former Finance Ministry official, admitted
he was frequently entertained by the companies but denied doing
them any favors. His lawyers asked for a suspended sentence,
arguing that such entertaining is common practice.
	   Presiding Judge Kohei Ikeda said the outings were so frequent
and lavish that they went beyond the bounds of conventional
practice.
	   Six people, including Finance Ministry and Bank of Japan
officials, have been found guilty in the past year of bribery for
accepting lavish entertainment from banks and brokerages. All have
received suspended sentences.

In Venezuela, it isn't Christmas without contagious Gaita music
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ When a radio disk jockey urged the
public to stop listening to ``Gaita'' music last Christmas because
he thought it was too rowdy, residents of the oil-rich city of
Maracaibo boycotted the station and scrawled pro-Gaita slogans on
their car windows.
	   The deejay quickly became persona non grata in Maracaibo,
birthplace of the hip-swinging, foot-stomping music that is as
basic to Christmas in Venezuela as ``Silent Night'' is in the
United States.
	   ``Christmas without Gaita isn't Christmas,'' said Hereberto
Molina, one of the kings of Gaita (GUY-tah) with 500 songs to his
credit.
	   Long confined to steamy Zulia state, Gaita is spreading
throughout Venezuela and to Colombia, Miami, Aruba and Puerto Rico.
Songs have been published in English, Italian, Portuguese and the
local Indian language of Guajira.
	   With its thundering African drums and irreverent lyrics, Gaita
developed over the last two centuries partly as homage to the
supposed apparition of the Virgin Mary near Lake Maracaibo.
	   Today, it's a craze among young and old alike. Teen-agers attend
Gaita concerts until sunrise. Their parents and grandparents dance
to the music on tape or in clubs.
	   ``We've got Gaita in our blood,'' said clothes salesman Henrique
Serrano, 24.
	   In addition to the ever-present drums, Gaita musicians use
maracas, a small four-string guitar and a strange instrument called
a ``furruco,'' in which the player rubs a stick inside a drum for a
deep, pulsing, heartbeat-like sound.
	   They've added organs and electric guitars in recent decades,
creating a highly danceable salsa-like rhythm but infuriating Gaita
traditionalists.
	   The lyrics are as important as the beat. Gaita songs are about
corrupt politicians, Caribbean beaches, economic crises, saints,
cities, love, jokes and even Lake Maracaibo, which sits atop one of
the world's largest oil deposits.
	   One song commemorates the crash of an Esso oil tanker into the
bridge spanning the lake. This year, the song ``Viagra'' pokes fun
at 82-year-old President Rafael Caldera.
	   Most Gaita songs feature protest themes in a country where more
than half the population is mired in poverty. The classic Gaita
anthem, ``The Zuliano People'' written by Ricardo Aguirre in 1968,
says that ``Maracaibo has given so much it should have streets
filled with stacks of gold coins.''
	   The origins of Gaita aren't clear, but it may have come from
traditional Christmas songs called ``aguinaldos'' brought to Latin
America by the Spanish conquistadors, said Gaita expert Humberto
Rodriguez.
	   It may have been given the name Gaita, which means ``bagpipe,''
because it evokes deep feelings in Venezuelans the way bagpipes do
for the Scots, he said.
	   ``If a Zulia resident is in the United States or Japan and you
play a gaita song, he'll cry,'' said Eduardo Fernandez, city editor
of Maracaibo's Panamora newspaper.
	   Many songs pay homage to ``The Virgin of La Chinita,'' the
patron saint of Zulia. Legend has it that on Nov. 18, 1709, an old
woman washing clothes on Lake Maracaibo's shores found a plank of
floating wood and took it home.
	   One day a brilliant light suddenly illuminated the plank,
revealing the image of the Virgin Mary. Her face was similar to
that of an Asian-looking Guajira Indian.
	   Many Venezuelans consider the event a miracle, though some
believe the wood was stolen from a church by pirates who later
tossed it overboard.
	   Today, the wood is preserved in a gold-framed glass case in St.
John of God Basilica in Maracaibo. Every Nov. 18, the city of 1.5
million people comes to a halt as La Chinita is ushered through the
streets by worshippers singing Gaita.

Legal or not, relatives head to Cuba to celebrate Christmas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS HAWLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Cuban exiles call it the
``Christmas disease'' _ a wave of ``serious'' illnesses that
relatives cite each year in requesting U.S. government permission
to visit loved ones in Cuba during the holidays.
	   Since Cuban President Fidel Castro decided to reinstate
Christmas, the epidemic has only become worse.
	   ``It's amazing how everyone gets sick around this time _ there
are more serious cases of sickness in Cuba than there are hospital
beds,'' said Raul Alzaga, one of three travel agents in Puerto Rico
licensed to arrange trips to Cuba.
	   The phenomenon seemed to intensify last year, after Castro
granted a one-time Christmas holiday as a favor to Pope John Paul
II and the United States moved to loosen travel restrictions,
Alzaga said.
	   This year, Castro decided to make the holiday permanent on the
communist island, and the number of Alzaga's customers traveling in
December to visit their supposedly sick relatives has risen by
about a third to 160, he said.
	   The U.S. Treasury Department, which regulates travel to Cuba,
does not track individual passengers visiting sick relatives unless
they make more than one trip per year. That makes it difficult to
estimate the number of travelers, an agency spokeswoman said.
	   However, Cuba claims about 70,000 emigrants in the United States
and elsewhere visited the island last year. It is unclear how many
entered to visit relatives.
	   The yuletide disease is well-known in Miami, where thousands of
Cuban emigrants live, said Ramon Saul Sanchez, a delegate of the
exile group Democracy Movement.
	   ``I know it goes on,'' he said. ``What's unfortunate is that a
government exists in our country that forces its citizens into
exile for having different views than the government _ and that in
the United States there exists a policy that turns the genuine
practice of returning to one's country into a covert action.''
	   Joaquin Lima, 67, a Cuban now living in Puerto Rico, said he was
leaving Thursday to visit a sister with hypertension. But he said
he was loaded down with Christmas gifts _ ``Things they can't
afford there, like clothing and shoes and towels.''
	   He said hundreds more are probably heading to Cuba illegally,
buying tickets to Havana in the Dominican Republic or Panama City.
	   The United States declared an economic embargo of Cuba in 1963,
and since then has barred Americans from traveling to Cuba, with
only a few exceptions.
	   This year, about 800 people in Puerto Rico traveled legally
through travel agencies, Alzaga estimated.
	   There have never been enough travelers from Puerto Rico to
warrant direct flights like the periodic charters in Miami, Alzaga
said. Most trips he arranges have connections in other countries.
	   Lima, who waited 10 years for permission to leave Cuba and
finally emigrated with his 70-year-old wife, Magda, in 1994, said
an easing of U.S. travel laws _ not Castro's announcement _ has
caused the surge in travel.
	   It was the reason he decided to return home for the first time.
	   ``People have always gotten together around Christmas _ before
the revolution and after,'' he said. ``The tradition is stronger
than that.''
	   Earlier this year, the U.S. government allowed the resumption of
direct flights to Cuba, banned in 1996 after Cuban jets shot down
two light airplanes flown by the Miami exile group Brothers to the
Rescue.
	   Since the pope's visit to Cuba in 1997, the U.S. restrictions
have eased somewhat, Alzaga said. Charter flights to Cuba from
Miami were allowed to resume in May, wire transfers to family
members of dlrs 300 every three months were allowed to resume in
March, and pharmaceutical and medical companies can send executives
to Cuba in connection with sales there.
	   And as long as U.S. officials do not require proof of a
relative's illness, Christmas illness may continue unchecked,
Alzaga said.
	   ``I have a lot of regular customers,'' he said. ``People whose
relatives get sick every year'' _ around Christmas.

Shares close higher on U.S., European gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong ended higher, with
the key index gaining 1.3 percent in a shortened pre-Christmas
trading session Thursday following gains in U.S. and European
markets.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 133.45 points at
10,292.20. It fell 1.6 percent Wednesday. But a holiday mood kept
trading volume among the lowest levels in more than two years.
	   Turnover at the midday close was a mere 1.51 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 193.6 million), compared with 1.36 billion Hong
Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 174.4 million) at midday Wednesday, and
2.23 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 285.9 million) for all of
Wednesday.
	   ``We're just marking up on the back of overseas markets,'' said
Miles Remington, a trader at SG Securities Ltd.
	   The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 157.57 points to
9,202.03 Wednesday, and several European markets were up strongly.
	   There was no local news to trade on, and with markets thin, it
was hard to spot clear trends, traders said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong was closed at midday for
Christmas. Financial markets reopen on Monday.
	   On the Hang Seng Index, the top performers included Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. and Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., controlled by tycoon
Li Ka-shing.
	   Both stocks were battered Wednesday in response to comments Li
made that the political environment in Hong Kong discouraged him
from investing in the city, a criticism apparently aimed at
pro-democracy legislators.
	   Hutchison ended up 1.75 Hong Kong dollars, or 3.2 percent, to
55.75. Cheung Kong gained 1.3 percent, or 75 Hong Kong cents, to
close at 58.0.
	   China Telecom (Hong Kong) Ltd. also rose slightly, after
dropping more than 10 percent since Tuesday, after the company's
mobile phone calling rates were cut. It gained 10 Hong Kong cents
to 13.10.
	   HSBC Holdings PLC., which dominates the Hang Seng Index, gained
1 percent, or 2.0, to end at 199.0 Hong Kong dollars.

Defense calls for playing tape in court to prove conspiracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with court comment
 &UR; By R. MAGESWARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Lawyers defending Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister in a sex and corruption trial failed
Thursday to win permission to play a tape-recording of a
conversation they say will show a conspiracy against him.
	   But the trial judge, Augustine Paul said he would allow the tape
to be played if defense lawyers could point to inconsistencies in
the weeklong testimony of Ummi Hafilda Ali, the prosecution's star
witness.
	   Excerpts of the recording were read Wednesday but Paul barred
the press from reporting the conversation that the defense claimed
involved Ummi.
	   Paul had said initially he would rule Thursday on whether the
transcript of the conversation was admissible as evidence. But the
decision was put off when the court adjourned until Monday at the
defense's request.
	   Anwar turned to reporters during a court recess and said
smilingly: ``Be optimistic against all odds.''
	   ``Have confidence in the system,'' he said quietly.
	   As the court convened Thursday, defense lawyer Gurbachan Singh
sought permission to play the tape so that he could get Ummi to
agree to having made all the statements contained in the recording.
	   Later, Anwar's chief defense attorney, Raja Aziz Addruse, said
the defense could produce proof of Ummi's inconsistent testimony if
granted time to interview her alleged partner in the taped
conversation, Malaysian businessman Sng Chee Hua.
	   Ummi, a 31-year-old advertising executive, is the prime mover of
all the charges against Anwar. She wrote a letter to Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and distributed copies of it last year. It
contained allegations that Anwar was sleeping with his secretary's
wife.
	   Much of the prosecution case hinges on Ummi's testimony and her
credibility since she also helped Azizan Abu Bakar, a former driver
in Anwar's household, write out a declaration that Anwar repeatedly
sodomized him.
	   Anwar's lawyers have accused Ummi of acting out of jealousy
because of her unreciprocated love for the 51-year-old politician.
She denied that she was crazy about Anwar and kept a photograph of
him under her pillow.
	   Singh had read out bits of a conversation that Ummi was alleged
to have had in June with Malaysian businessman Sng. It was unclear
if Ummi knew their conversation had been recorded.
	   Raja Aziz informed the court that Sng had been summoned to
police headquarters Wednesday evening for questioning.
	   ``While this case is going on and he is a relevant witness in
this matter, the police cannot do such a thing,'' Raja Aziz told
the court. The judge rejected a request to restrain the police.
	   The defense hoped to use the conversation to prove its theory of
a government conspiracy involving several senior cabinet ministers
to destroy Anwar's career.
	   Anwar has denied all 10 charges of illegal sex and corruption,
saying they were fabricated.

Tokyo shares down after bank sell-off, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon bond and dollar
rates &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stocks fell moderately Thursday amid worries
about the strength of the country's banks. The dollar moved lower
against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 72.72 points,
or 0.53 percent, to close at 13,706.73. On Tuesday, the average
finished down 373.50 points, or 2.64 percent.
	   The dollar bought 116.28 yen in mid-afternoon trading, down 0.80
yen from its level of 117.08 late in Tokyo on Tuesday but above
115.96 yen late in New York on Wednesday.
	   Tokyo markets were closed Wednesday for a national holiday.
	   Investors sold bank shares on fears that a recent drop in bond
prices would hurt profits, analysts said.
	   Bond prices tumbled, and interest rates rose Tuesday following
the Japanese government's announcement that it would issue new
bonds to pay for massive stimulus spending next fiscal year.
	   The government has been going deeper into debt as it spends more
to kickstart economic growth.
	   The bond market was also hurt buy an announcement from the
Finance Ministry that it would stop buying back some bonds itself,
a practice that has supported prices by limiting supply.
	   ``Until bond prices settle down, the stock market is going to
remain unstable,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, manager at Chuo
Securities.
	   Profits from bond trading and investments have been one of the
only bright spots for many of Japan's debt-plagued banks and
traders worry that a fall in bond prices will wipe out many of
those gains.
	   Bank shares were also lower after U.S. ratings agency Standard
and Poor's said it lowered certain ratings on Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank,
Daiwa Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan, Sakura Bank, Sanwa Bank,
Sumitomo Bank, and Tokai Bank.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 8.28 points, or 0.76 percent, to 1,074.18. On
Tuesday the market closed down 16.66 points, or 1.52 percent, to
1,082.46.
	   Stocks fell despite a strong gain overnight on Wall Street.
	   There, the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 157.57, or 1.7
percent, to close at 9,202.03, extending its gains to 411 points
over the past five sessions and nearing the Nov. 23 record of
9,374.27.
	   In currency trading, the dollar fell from its level Wednesday in
Tokyo as banks sold the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   But with little activity ahead of the Christmas holiday, the
market lacked direction, traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.890 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.900 percent,
pushing the price up to 99.27 yen from 99.19 yen.

Jailed American files suit in Japan to protest alleged abuse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Lawyers for a U.S. citizen serving a 6-year prison
sentence said they filed suit Thursday to protest alleged
mistreatment of their client, including physical abuse by prison
guards and more than four years in solitary confinement.
	   The suit, filed with the Tokyo District Court, seeks 10 million
yen (dlrs 86,000) in compensation from the Japanese government for
causing undue mental and physical suffering to Johnny Crittenden, a
39-year old native of Georgia.
	   ``It is a very symbolic case about Japan's prison situation,''
said Yuichi Kaido, an attorney representing the American plaintiff,
adding that the problems highlighted in the case are widespread in
the prison system.
	   Prison officials were unavailable for immediate comment.
	   Crittenden, who is scheduled to be released on January 7, claims
he was subjected to a beating, use of a leather restraining belt
which restricted normal breathing for a 24-hour period and unjust
solitary confinement.
	   All of the alleged mistreatment stemmed from Crittenden's
refusal of a haircut and shave, lawyer Kaido said.
	   Crittenden refused the haircut given to all new Japanese prison
inmates on the basis of his religious beliefs as a Rastafarian and
failed to shave as instructed one day due to a linguistic
misunderstanding, his lawyer said.
	   Practitioners of Rastafarianism, which originated in Jamaica,
are known for their faith's embracement of long, dreadlock-style
hair-braids.
	   As a result, attorney Kaido said his client was unable to speak
with other inmates at Fuchu prison outside Tokyo, one of three
which holds foreign nationals, or participate in any group
activities for more than 4 1/2 years.
	   ``It is not a matter of money. It is a matter of justice and
rights,'' Crittenden was quoted as saying by his attorney, who
declined to specify the crimes for which his client was convicted.
	   Kaido was unable to provide Crittenden's hometown.
	   Earlier this month, a Japanese court ordered the state to pay
150,000 yen (dlrs 1,290) in compensation to an American who was
beaten up by guards at another Japanese prison. Keith Dickerson,
33, of Santa Barbara, Calif., had sought 3.3 million yen (dlrs
28,380).
	   In November, the United Nations Human Rights Committee issued a
report saying it was ``deeply concerned at many aspects of the
prison system in Japan,'' including harsh rules of conduct, severe
punishment measures and the frequent use of restraining devices.

Seven killed in battle in Indian Kashmiri capital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ An overnight battle that ended with the
army shelling a house in the capital of Indian-held Kashmir left
seven people dead, police said Thursday.
	   The fighting began late Wednesday when police acting on a tip
surrounded a house in a Srinagar neighborhood in a search for
anti-India guerrillas. The people inside opened fire from the
house, killing two police officers. Police returned fire and called
in army reinforcements.
	   The gun battle lasted several hours, ending early Thursday when
the army fired a shell, destroying the three-story house and
damaging several neighboring homes.
	   Five bodies were found inside. Police said two were identified
as guerrillas, while three could not immediately be identified.
	   For the past nine years, nearly a dozen Muslim groups have been
fighting for independence or a merger with neighboring, officially
Islamic Pakistan. Kashmir is the only Muslim-majority state in
predominately Hindu, officially secular India.

Ford sells stake in Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. said Thursday it has
sold part of its stake in South Korea's Kia Motors Corp.
	   ``A business opportunity presented itself and we took it,'' John
Spelich, a spokesman at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
	   Spelich said Ford sold a 9-percent stake in Kia early this week
but still controls 8 percent in the Korean carmaker through Mazda
Motor Corp. of Japan. Ford is Mazda's largest shareholder.
	   Spelich declined to reveal the buyer and price of the sale.
	   The sale came after Ford had failed to take over Kia in an
international auction in October. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co.
won the bid to acquire Kia and its commercial vehicle arm, Asia
Motors Co.
	   Officials at Hyundai and Kia declined to comment on the sale.

Japan automaker Isuzu to cut 4,000 jobs in restructuring drive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese carmaker Isuzu Motors Ltd. announced
Thursday it will slash 4,000 jobs and reduce interest-bearing debt
as part of a restructuring drive to shore up profitability.
	   Isuzu, an affiliate of U.S.-based General Motors Corp., said the
plan will help it achieve its goal of 710 billion yen (dlrs 6.1
billion) in domestic auto sales and a pretax profit of 10 billion
yen (dlrs 86 million) in fiscal 2000.
	   The announcement comes amid a wave of consolidation within
Japan's auto industry, which has been battered by flagging domestic
demand and Asia's financial crisis.
	   Isuzu, one of the world's leading truck-makers, said the job
reductions will be accomplished through attrition. It said it
hasn't set a time frame for the cuts.
	   The company said it aims to reduce its interest-bearing debt
worth 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.6 billion) by around 300 billion yen
(dlrs 2.58 billion) by March 2000.
	   Isuzu also said it will scale back its marketing subsidiaries to
30 companies from the current 68 by March 2001.
	   General Motors, the world's biggest automaker, said last week it
will increase its stake in Isuzu to 49 percent from the current
37.5 percent

WFP appeals for food for flood victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The World Food Program urgently appealed Thursday
for 195,000 tons of wheat to help 5.8 million victims of
devastating summer floods in China make it through the winter.
	   The WFP said the wheat, worth about dlrs 60 million, was needed
to feed the flood victims until they can plant crops in March.
Without it, the U.N. agency warned its four-month emergency
operation will have to close down six weeks early.
	   ``We are running out of food in the last weeks of what was so
far a remarkably successful operation,'' said Else Larsen, the
WFP's country director for China. ``After doing so well to rebuild
their lives with great energy and organization, the last thing
these people need is a six-week gap just before the start of
planting.''
	   At least 3,656 people were killed in the unusually severe floods
that ravaged much of central, southern and northeastern China this
summer.
	   The WFP's emergency operation, its first in China, was due to
end Feb. 28, but food supplies will run out by Jan. 15 without more
donations, the WFP said.
	   In November, the first month of the operation, the WFP provided
free food to 5.8 million flood victims in the southern and central
provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Anhui and Jiangxi, among the hardest hit
areas.
	   As the floods receded, aid recipients were put to work building
shelters, repairing wells, renovating roads and clearing land and
irrigation channels.
	   The 195,000 tons of wheat will be swapped for 140,000 tons of
rice that the Chinese government has agreed to release immediately
to flood victims once pledges of donations are received. When the
wheat actually arrives, it will be given to the government to
compensate for the rice.

China's auto production growth slows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China produced 1.49 million automobiles and sold
1.43 million of them in the first 11 months of 1998, but growth in
both areas slowed from the year before, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported Thursday.
	   China's Automotive Industry Development Research Institute said
output growth declined 4 percent and sales growth declined 5
percent compared with the first 11 months of 1997, Xinhua said. The
report gave no actual growth figures for 1998 or 1997.
	   The Chinese auto research organization said state enterprise
restructuring has cut into demand and measures to lift private car
sales have not yet had any real impact.
	   However, a government campaign to boost infrastructure and
construction spending has generated increased demand for heavy-duty
trucks, the report said without providing details.

Survey: Worries about economy curtail Japanese holiday spending
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ With Japan's economy mired in recession, families
here will likely spend less on travel and gifts this holiday
season, according to a survey released Thursday.
	   More Japanese families plan to spend the New Year's holiday at
home this year, while those that travel will spend less, according
to a poll of 350 households by Sanwa Bank.
	   The people surveyed said their families would spend an average
of 163,000 yen (dlrs 1,405) during the three-day New Year's
holiday, including money for travel and gifts. That amount was
18,000 yen (dlrs 155) less than a year before, the bank said.
	   According to the poll, 37.7 percent of households were planning
to travel an average of just under three days during the holiday
season and spend an average of 110,000 yen, the lowest in five
years.
	   The bank didn't give a margin of error for its survey.
	   New Year's is one of Japan's biggest holidays, and many people
travel to their home towns to spend the first few days of the year
with their families.
	   Many children look forward to the holiday because of the
Japanese custom of giving kids gifts of cash.
	   But some children may be disappointed this year as families were
budgeting less for such gifts.
	   Those surveyed said they planned to give the junior-high kids on
their gift-lists an average of 5,852 yen (dlrs 50), 1,618 yen (dlrs
14) less than last year.

Primakov says he will resign if budget isn't passed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Thursday he
and his government would resign if Russia's parliament doesn't pass
a 1999 budget, a news report said.
	   Russia's lower house of parliament, the State Duma, was to begin
debating the budget Thursday. Primakov has widespread support in
the Duma, and it was expected to pass the document with less
trouble than in previous years.
	   In a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin,
Primakov said he and his deputies ``would not remain in our posts''
if the Duma doesn't pass the budget, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``The budget must be severe,'' he said. ``We can't lie to
anyone.''
	   ``What do you think, can a country live without a budget in such
a time? Of course not. It must be passed,'' he said.
	   Russia is gripped by its worst economic crisis since the Soviet
collapse. Foreign lenders froze aid to the country after the
government defaulted on some debts and devalued the currency in
August.
	   The proposed budget ran into trouble Wednesday, when a number of
parliamentary factions reversed course and said they would demand
that a vote on the document be postponed.
	   They were responding to a letter from the upper house of
parliament, the Federation Council, which disapproves of the
government's plans to change the way tax revenues are distributed
between the regions and the federal government.
	   The Federation Council, made up of regional governors fiercely
protective of funds to their regions, usually passes the budget
without much debate.
	   Primakov was to hold closed-doors meeting with leaders from both
the upper and lower houses Thursday to determine whether the budget
can be passed in a first reading before next week.
	   The budget must pass four readings by the Duma before going to
the Federation Council.
	   Primakov wants a budget in place as soon as possible so the
government can tackle massive wage debts to state workers and jump
start the economy. Foreign lenders have said they will not resume
aid without a budget.

China's foreign reserves inch upward as controls tighten
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's foreign exchange reserves grew 0.6
percent to dlrs 144.59 billion at the end of November from a month
earlier as the government stepped up efforts to stop illegal
outflows of hard currency, central bank officials said Thursday.
	   A Beijing-based spokesman for the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, said reserves are steadily building again.
	   They had plateaued earlier this year and then began to shrink
this summer as dlrs 10 billion left the country through illicit
channels from July to September, Shanghai's central bank chief, Wu
Xiaoling, told reporters.
	   Chinese bank officials are anxious to show that reserves are not
sliding, a trend that could lead to a weakening of the currency,
the yuan. The government has made a stable yuan the foundation of
policies to counter the economic turmoil that has afflicted the
rest of Asia.
	   The government has launched a sustained campaign against illegal
foreign exchange trading and currency counterfeiting, making many
such activities subject to criminal laws.
	   China's yuan is only convertible for a limited range of uses,
such as trade. But companies and individuals have often
circumvented restrictions through phony trade invoices.
	   Efforts to exploit foreign exchange loopholes increased amid
fears that Beijing would devalue the yuan to support exports.
	   In south China's Guangdong province, fake customs clearance
forms accounted for 55 percent of such declarations above dlrs
200,000 in value, the newspaper People's Daily reported Thursday.
In August, Guangdong police and financial regulators discovered
fake customs clearance forms worth dlrs 370 million, it said.
	   As part of the clampdown, Beijing has ordered stronger scrutiny
of all customs documents and letters of credit from foreign banks.
	   Wu of the People's Bank of China conceded that tighter checks on
foreign exchange have hindered some overseas businesses seeking to
import equipment and repatriate profits. But officials say the
controls are needed to support foreign reserve levels.
	   ``Foreign reserves are a country's strategic resource. They can
ensure overseas payments, stabilize the exchange rate and safeguard
our international reputation,'' the People's Daily said in a
commentary.

Indonesia's Christian churches appeal for religious tolerance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's Christian leaders, shaken
by recent attacks by Muslim mobs on Christian churches, appealed
for racial and religious harmony in a Christmas Eve message.
	   In a joint statement, the Christian Churches Association and the
Catholic Churches Conference vowed to encourage peaceful relations
among religious groups in predominately Muslim Indonesia.
	   ``We promise... to encourage solidarity among the sufferers
regardless of their racial or group differences,'' read the
statement.
	   The world's fourth most populous nation has endured sporadic
riots in recent months as social and religious tensions rise amid
the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Muslim mobs burned or ransacked more than a dozen churches on
Nov. 22 in the capital, Jakarta. Fourteen people were killed and
the violence sparked revenge attacks on mosques in other places.
	   Ninety percent of Indonesia's 200 million people are Muslim.
Most of the rest are Christian, Buddhist or Hindu. Tolerance of
religious diversity is enshrined in the national philosophy,
Pancasila.
	   Many Christians are ethnic Chinese, who have often been targeted
in riots because of their relative wealth and perceived links to
corrupt government officials.
	   In their statement, the church leaders also urged their
followers to fight graft and back political reforms that are being
promoted by President B.J. Habibie.
	   ``We believe God will always be with our society and nation as
it undergoes the period of big reforms,'' the statement said.
	   Habibie has pledged to overhaul the rigid political system left
by his authoritarian predecessor, Suharto, who quit in May after a
nationwide wave of riots and protests.
	   However, students who have staged sometimes violent protests
against security forces say Habibie is not serious about democratic
reform.
	   The students have temporarily halted their protests to mark the
Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which started Dec. 20.

No Christmas-card look for Bethlehem this year

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Mohammed Abu Radap sells shiny,
fresh apples from cartons atop a meter- (3-feet-) wide cement
cylinder that will one day be part of Bethlehem's new sewage
system.
	   Abu Radap has no complaints about the construction project in
Bethlehem's open-air market. Pointing to an almost-completed
building, he said proudly, ``I'll have a new store inside there.''
	   Like Manger Square half-kilometer (quarter-mile) away,
Bethlehem's market is being rebuilt with funds raised to give the
traditional birthplace of Jesus a facelift in time for millennium
celebrations. Some improvements will be ready for Christmas this
year, but most will not. Bethlehem, hardly picturesque even in the
best of times, is resigned to a messy holiday.
	   A brisk, cold wind swept Manger Square on Wednesday, whipping
sand into people's hair and eyes as workers laid rectangular stone
tiles while others mixed cement. A yellow tractor dumped a load of
sand in the middle of the square, where tourists and pilgrims
gather on Christmas eve in front of the Church of the Nativity.
	   The dreary scene was relieved a little Wednesday evening when
Soha Arafat, wife to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, lit the
Christmas tree in the square. She and her daughter Zahwa were
dressed in matching red outfits.
	   City officials hope the paving will be done in time for
Christmas. But there will be holes filled with sand where lights
and benches are supposed to be.
	   Though Bethlehem's mayors have had detailed renovation plans
ready for 25 years, it took the approach of the millennium to bring
in millions of dollars in contributions from foreign governments to
allow the project to begin.
	   The cost of renovating Manger Square is estimated at dlrs 12
million. The budget for redoing the rest of the city is more than
dlrs 200 million, said Mayor Hanna J. Nasser.
	   The goal is to finish most of it next year in time for the
millennium, when a million tourists are expected to visit the city.
	   Until then, projects like replacing Bethlehem's ancient, leaky
sewage system, repaving main roads, burying electric and telephone
cables and rebuilding the open-air market mean temporary
inconvenience for the 24,000 Palestinian residents.
	   A small woman wearing a brown head scarf picked her way over a
mound of rubble, carefully making her way toward a merchant selling
potatoes from a makeshift stand.
	   Open-air markets with merchants shouting out their prices as
people squeeze the fruit and vegetables are a central feature of
most Middle East cities. Bethlehem's plan is to replace the noisy
but friendly chaos with order and esthetics.
	   ``Of course it will be good to have a civilized market here,''
Mahmoud Rahhab said as he watched the construction from the door of
his small grocery store.
	   When it's completed, the outdoor tables will be replaced by
small, neat stalls facing out from two new stone buildings, a wide
walkway between the rows of shops.
	   Now it's mostly rubble, piles of sand, open trenches and sewer
pipes strewn around.
	   Rahhab, 62, owns the apartment building above his little store
and has been at this location for 50 years. The slim, neatly
dressed merchant was concerned only that the city keeps the place
clean when the renovations are finished.
	   ``Look around the corner, you'll see how dirty it was before,''
he suggested.
	   Around the corner, against the wall of one of the new buildings
going up at the market site, plastic crates were piled high with
live chickens about to be slaughtered.
	   The smell was as noticeable as the squashed vegetables and trash
on the ground. Before construction began, most of the Bethlehem
market looked like that. The plan is to eliminate the mess, if not
the noise and the smell.
	   City officials admit openly that they're taking advantage of the
millennium to remake their city for the benefit of their people,
long after tourists finish celebrating Christmas this week and the
millennium next year.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Relations with the Palestinians are crumbling
and an agreement not to harm civilians along the Lebanese border is
collapsing _ just as Israel goes to elections over how to shape its
security into the next century.
	   Reflecting widespread security concerns, a bevy of retired
generals are among the candidates for prime minister. And each
seems to have different ideas about bringing peace to the country.
	   On Wednesday, Lebanese guerrillas showered towns on Israel's
northern border with Katyusha rockets, retaliation for an Israeli
air raid a day earlier that killed a woman and six of her seven
children. Israel vowed further retaliation.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Palestinian authorities released
the spiritual leader of Hamas, two months after placing him under
house arrest when a member of the militant Islamic movement
attempted to blow up a schoolbus full of Israeli children.
	   Israel accused its Palestinian partners and Lebanese enemies of
violating agreements.
	   Government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinians showed
bad faith by releasing Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   Yasser Arafat's government has ``conducted a high-profile policy
of ostensibly taking actions against Hamas ... but in reality,
quietly acquiescing to Hamas activities,'' he said.
	   Palestinian leaders are frustrated with a slowdown in Israel's
fulfillment of the peace accords reached in Wye River, Maryland, in
October, and have said they will not meet any new Israeli demands.
	   Israel has frozen a number of its Wye commitments, including a
small pullback from the West Bank, accusing the Palestinians of
failing to contain anti-Israel violence.
	   Yassin, frail and confined to a wheelchair, said his release
showed that his movement _ which calls for the destruction of
Israel _ had triumphed over Wye.
	   `Today, after the sound of Wye has become inaudible, it is
inevitable that other voices will be heard,'' Yassin told reporters
after followers greeted him with kisses.
	   In the north, Israel accused the Hezbollah guerrilla movement of
breaking a two-year-old agreement to avoid attacks on civilians.
	   The Lebanese guerrillas countered that Israel had broken the
agreement with the deadly air raid on Tuesday.
	   In Baalbek, Lebanon, hundreds of mourners gathered Wednesday for
the funeral of Nada Othman and her children, aged 2 to 13.
	   ``Murderers must pay the price of their crimes,'' Hezbollah
said.
	   Israeli chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz expressed his
regrets and said the attack on the family home was the result of
pilot error. The target had been a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   He said Hezbollah's retaliatory rocket attack was inexcusable.
	   ``We reserve the right to decide when and where we will
respond,'' Mofaz said.
	   The rockets struck early Wednesday just as Israeli
schoolchildren were emerging from bomb shelters, where families had
spent the night in anticipation of an attack. Sixteen people
suffered light to moderate injuries.
	   The Katyusha attacks and Yassin's release came two days after
Israel's parliament voted to hold elections more than a year ahead
of schedule.
	   The early elections, expected by April, were prompted by
widespread opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Hard-liners in his governing coalition are angry with his Wye
concessions to Palestinians, while the dovish opposition says
Netanyahu is scuttling the agreement with his demands of the
Palestinians.
	   On Wednesday, Lebanon became an election issue as well. Dovish
legislators revived their claim that Israel's occupation in
southern Lebanon _ meant to protect northern villages _ is
counterproductive.
	   ``Staying there is a trap and, unfortunately, a death trap,''
said Labor legislator Yossi Beilin. ``Leaving there gives us a
chance.''
	   No less than three potential candidates toured northern border
towns Wednesday in their capacities as ministers in the outgoing
government _ but looking a lot more like campaigners.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu told residents of
Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react.''
	   Also touring were Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who is
likely to challenge Netanyahu within their Likud Party, and
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, who is likely to run for prime
minister as head of a small rightist party.
	   Mordechai and Eitan are former generals _ as are Netanyahu's two
likeliest challengers from the left: Labor Party leader Ehud Barak
and Amnon Shahak, a former military chief who formally retired from
the army on Thursday and announced his intention to enter politics.
	   Shahak is expected to form his own centrist party and run for
prime minister.
	   The former military men represent the spectrum of Israeli
opinion, but their identical backgrounds reflect the
security-related anxieties among Israelis.
	   They also reflect a troubling attraction by voters to outsiders,
said Hebrew University political scientist Yaron Ezrahi.
	   ``There is a despair of politics and politicians in Israel,''
Ezrahi told Israel television. ``It's not a symptom of healthy
democracy.''

	   VAN, Turkey (AP) _ A female Kurdish rebel threw herself in front
of a military bus and ignited bombs strapped around her waist,
killing herself, a passerby and wounding 21 officers Thursday,
police said.
	   The attack in downtown Van, a southeastern city bordering Iran
and Iraq, was the third suicide bombing by the Kurdish rebels over
the past three months. The rebels are fighting for autonomy in the
southeast.
	   A police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
15-year-old passerby was killed. None of the injured was in
critical condition, he said.
	   The rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have staged
suicide bombings in the past but have increased such attacks since
their leader Abdullah Ocalan was detained in Italy in Nov. 12.
	   Italy later released Ocalan but refused to extradite him to
Turkey, where he could face the death penalty on charges of
terrorism.
	   In the two previous attacks, two female suicide bombers were
killed and a total of 11 people were wounded.
	   The fighting has claimed some 37,000 lives since 1984.

Hyundai preferred over LG in chipmaker merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's Hyundai Electronics
Industry Co. was chosen on Thursday to take a controlling stake in
a proposed merger with LG Semicon, but LG said it couldn't accept
the decision.
	   U.S. consulting company Arthur D. Little Inc. made the
recommendation that Hyundai become the majority shareholder after
the two chipmakers asked the company to help them break an impasse
in their stalled merger talks.
	   But LG said Thursday that it couldn't agree with the consultants
recommendation, a position that threatened to derail President Kim
Dae-jung's efforts to restructure the country's debt-ridden
industries through mergers.
	   Kim has already threatened to order state-controlled banks to
call in loans from big businesses resisting reform, a policy
reaffirmed by the Financial Supervisory Commission on Thursday.
	   After failing in November to work out details of the proposed
merger on their own, Hyundai and LG agreed to a government
suggestion that they hire Arthur D. Little to study who should take
control of the new company.
	   The merger, if realized, would create the world's second largest
memory chip maker with 17 percent of the world market. South
Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. would remain the biggest with a 20
percent global share.
	   ``LG Semicon does not regard the report by Arthur D. Little Inc.
as a proper evaluation,'' said CEO Koo Bon-joon in a statement.
	   Koo said the Massachusetts-based consulting firm was biased in
favor of Hyundai and didn't take into consideration LG's opinions
during its month-long research.
	   Hyundai and LG, the nation's largest and third largest
conglomerates, agreed in principle in September to merge their chip
making subsidiaries, but talks have stalled because of a dispute
over management control.
	   ``In our judgment, Hyundai is better equipped to lead and
develop the merged company, and we have concluded it is Hyundai,''
Arthur D. Little said in a news release.
	   It said its researchers concluded that the chipmakers must merge
to remain competitive. Both have borrowed heavily to expand their
semiconductor facilities. Hyundai Electronics is dlrs 8.2 billion
in debt, or 9.3 times its equity, while LG Semicon's debt totals
dlrs 5 billion, or six times its equity.
	   South Korean conglomerates have been accused of overexpanding
during the country's boom years, sowing the seeds for the current
financial crisis. A typical South Korean conglomerate has 40 to 50
subsidiaries.

Japanese city hit by atomic bomb makes concession to ethnic Koreans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hiroshima, one of two Japanese cities decimated by
atomic bombs in the closing days of World War II, has decided to
allow the relocation of a monument dedicated to Korean victims of
the bombing to a central memorial park, a local official said
Thursday.
	   Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka's decision to relocate the
cenotaph was widely seen as a gesture of outreach to Japan's Korean
community, which has long complained of a pervasive bias against
them
	   The stone monument, which was built in 1970, will be moved
inside the city's Peace Memorial Park next summer, said the city
official, who declined to be named. The official was unable to say
who would fund the move, but local media reported a Korean
residents group would pay the expenses.
	   The five-meter-high (16.5-foot) monument was built three years
after the city banned construction of new edifices in the park,
which is located at the epicenter of the blast that killed 140,000
people on Aug. 6, 1945.
	   But Koreans living in Japan have viewed the ban as a slight
because the park is home to many other monuments commemorating
those who died in the bombing of the city.
	   About 640,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of whom are the
descendants of workers and conscripts brought over during Japan's
1910-1945 colonial rule on the Korean peninsula. The Korean
community says it often faces discrimination in hiring and
marriage.
	   Three days after the destruction of Hiroshima, another atomic
bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, killing 70,000 people. Japan
surrendered unconditionally on Aug. 15.

Popular former chief of staff leaves military, enters politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After 36 years as a soldier, former army
chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak left the military Thursday to
enter politics and likely challenge Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as a centrist candidate.
	   Looking relaxed in an open-neck green shirt and blue slacks,
Shahak turned in his uniform at an army induction center and smiled
at the surrounding mob of reporters. ``What, am I so important?''
he joked.
	   Then, leaving the induction center, Shahak gave his first news
conference as a civilian, calling on Israelis to ``unite different
parts of our society.''
	   ``We must make peace among ourselves before we make peace with
our neighbors,'' he said. Shahak was on his way to a meeting with
President Ezer Weizman Thursday, the first of a marathon of
meetings inaugurating his political career.
	   In an interview in Thursday's editions of the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz, Shahak rejected opposition leader Ehud Barak's call to
join his left-wing Labor party. The newspaper quoted Shahak as
saying if polls showed centrist candidate Dan Meridor leading, he
would be willing to join him in the No. 2 slot.
	   Meridor broke away from Netanyahu's conservative Likud party and
announced his candidacy Tuesday after Israel's parliament voted for
early elections.
	   Labor leaders called Shahak's decision irresponsible.
	   ``Shahak is likely to cause the splitting of the peace camp,''
Labor legislator Yossi Beilin told Israel radio, referring to
Israelis who support land-for-security agreements with the
Palestinians. ``If we were able to present one peace camp under
Ehud Barak's leadership, victory in the elections would be
assured.''

Turkish appeals court orders retrial for 33 Islamic extremists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ An appeals court on Thursday ordered a
second retrial for 33 Islamic extremists, sentenced to death for
seeking to impose Islamic rule in this predominantly Muslim but
secular country.
	   The defendants have been on trial for killing 37 left-wing
intellectuals in a 1993 arson attack.
	   Prosecutor Demirel Tavil said the second retrial was ordered on
technical grounds. Private NTV television said the court ruled
there was insufficient documentation on the defendants' identities.
	   The 33 were originally sentenced to 15 years in prison but a
retrial switched the prison terms to capital punishment last year.
	   Despite issuing death penalties, Turkey has not carried out
executions since 1984.
	   The arson attack targeted a hotel in the central city of Sivas
where the victims had gathered to commemorate a 16th century poet
who was hanged for his opposition to religious oppression.
	   The attackers chanted slogans of an illegal radical Islamic
group while the hotel was ablaze. They barred firefighters from
approaching the scene.

Popular former chief of staff leaves military, enters politics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After 36 years as a soldier, former army
chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak left the military Thursday to
enter politics and likely challenge Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu as a centrist candidate.
	   Looking relaxed in an open-neck green shirt and blue slacks,
Shahak turned in his uniform at an army induction center and smiled
at the surrounding mob of reporters. ``What, am I so important?''
he joked.
	   Then, leaving the induction center, Shahak gave his first news
conference as a civilian, calling on Israelis to ``unite different
parts of our society.''
	   ``We must make peace among ourselves before we make peace with
our neighbors,'' he said. Shahak was on his way to a meeting with
President Ezer Weizman Thursday, the first of a marathon of
meetings inaugurating his political career.
	   In an interview in Thursday's editions of the Israeli newspaper
Haaretz, Shahak rejected opposition leader Ehud Barak's call to
join his left-wing Labor party. The newspaper quoted Shahak as
saying if polls showed centrist candidate Dan Meridor leading, he
would be willing to join him in the No. 2 slot.
	   Meridor broke away from Netanyahu's conservative Likud party and
announced his candidacy Tuesday after Israel's parliament voted for
early elections.
	   Labor leaders called Shahak's decision irresponsible.
	   ``Shahak is likely to cause the splitting of the peace camp,''
Labor legislator Yossi Beilin told Israel radio, referring to
Israelis who support land-for-security agreements with the
Palestinians. ``If we were able to present one peace camp under
Ehud Barak's leadership, victory in the elections would be
assured.''

Date set for first Philippine execution in 22 years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A poor house painter convicted of
raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter will be executed on Jan. 4, the
first execution in the Philippines in 22 years, according to court
documents Thursday.
	   The documents give the first public announcement of the date of
the execution of Leo Echegaray, who is among 844 inmates on death
row.
	   Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court
earlier set the date for Echegaray's execution by lethal injection.
	   She had initially ordered prison authorities not to announce the
date in advance, in accordance with government rules. But the
attention attracted by the execution brought pressure to release
the date ahead of time.
	   The planned execution has triggered a debate among Filipinos
over capital punishment.
	   In a resolution Wednesday, at least 35 members of the House of
Representatives urged President Joseph Estrada to declare a
``moratorium'' on the execution of death convicts pending a review
of the death penalty law.
	   Several countries, including the European Union, the Vatican and
Canada, have also appealed to Estrada to cancel Echegaray's
execution and repeal the death penalty.
	   Estrada, however, has refused to pardon Echegaray, saying his
execution will deter similar crimes.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option to restore it for ``heinous'' crimes such as
murder, ransom kidnapping, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, brought back the death
penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos believe that the death penalty will deter crime
and that crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.

Tokyo shares down after bank sell-off, dollar lower against yen
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede; UPDATES with late-afternoon bond and dollar
rates

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Worries that rising interest rates could deliver
another blow to Japan's ailing banks drove Tokyo stocks lower
Thursday. The dollar sank against the yen in light trading.
	   The dollar bought 116.12 yen in late-afternoon trading, down
0.96 yen from its level of 117.08 late in Tokyo on Tuesday but
slightly above 115.96 yen late in New York on Wednesday.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 72.72 points,
or 0.53 percent, to close at 13,706.73. On Tuesday, the average
finished down 373.50 points, or 2.64 percent.
	   Tokyo markets were closed Wednesday for a national holiday.
	   Stocks fell for a third straight session as investors worried
that the dramatic plunge in the price of Japanese government bonds
this week, and a corresponding jump in interest rates, would hurt
corporate profits, especially at the country's already badly-shaken
banks.
	   Interest rates began rising Tuesday following the Japanese
government's announcement that it would issue a record amount of
new bonds next year to pay for an increase in spending.
	   The government has been going deeper into debt as it spends more
to kickstart economic growth.
	   The bond market was also hurt buy an announcement from the
Finance Ministry that it would stop buying back some of those bonds
itself, a practice that has supported prices by limiting supply.
	   ``Until bond prices settle down, the stock market is going to
remain unstable,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, manager at Chuo Securities
Co.
	   Profits from bond trading have been one of the only bright spots
for many of Japan's debt-plagued banks, and traders worry that a
fall in bond prices will wipe out many of those gains.
	   Bank shares were also lower after U.S. ratings agency Standard
and Poor's said it lowered certain ratings on Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank
Ltd., Daiwa Bank Ltd., the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Sakura
Bank Ltd., Sanwa Bank Ltd., Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section lost 8.28 points, or 0.76 percent, to 1,074.18. On
Tuesday the market closed down 16.66 points, or 1.52 percent, to
1,082.46.
	   Trading on the main section of the Tokyo exchange was estimated
at 320.80 million shares, down from 361.73 million shares Tuesday.
	   Declines outnumbered advances 778 to 318, while 208 issues were
unchanged.
	   In currency trading, the dollar fell from its level Wednesday in
Tokyo as banks sold the U.S. currency, traders said.
	   But with little activity ahead of the Christmas holiday, the
market lacked direction.
	   The U.S. currency traded in a range between 115.05 yen and
116.60 yen in Tokyo.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.885 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.900 percent,
pushing the price up to 99.31 yen from 99.19 yen.

Round-the-world balloonists soar over Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with speed, position, concerns about
weather &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A trio of balloonists soared over the Pacific
Ocean on Thursday at high speed, bound for the halfway point in
their attempt at the first nonstop balloon voyage around the world.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden caught the jetstream after
their passage over China on Wednesday and quickly gathered speed.
	   By 0815 GMT their helium and hot air ICO Global balloon was
moving at 150 mph (240 kph), and about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) into
the Pacific, said ground crew director Mike Kendrick.
	   Kendrick sounded ``a note of concern'' about a weather pattern
developing over the ocean Pacific. ``We are a bit nervous,'' he
said.
	   ``We're not panicking yet,'' he told Sky TV, explaining that a
trough of high pressure was about 2,000 miles (3,000) from the
balloonists.
	   ``If we can average about 125 knots (145 mph, 230 kph) over the
next 12 hours, or maybe 24 hours, we should be okay,'' he said.
	   Kendrick has described the Pacific leg of the journey as the
most hazardous, saying the frequency of shipping is not very high,
so that if the balloonists had to ditch their craft the rescue
would be more difficult.
	   He said ground crew were tracking the position of all ships that
would be under the balloon in the Pacific.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, and cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   The ground crew said that the balloon might cross into North
America at Washington State or southern Canada.
	   Kendrick said getting to America on Christmas Day would give the
balloonists a good chance to cross the continent on a fast
jetstream.
	   The halfway point on the voyage, which began in Morocco on Dec.
18, is in the Pacific Ocean. When the balloon reaches the coast of
North America it will be well into the final third of the journey.
	   The trip is expected to last from eight days to nearly three
weeks and finish in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile
(38,000 kms) flight.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Thailand's top brewer set to uncork new wine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's biggest brewery is set to
uncork the country's second domestically-produced wine, even though
company executives say an economic crisis has made it anything but
a vintage year for launching new products.
	   The first lot of 100,000 bottles of Boon Rawd Brewery's new Khao
Yai wine is expected to hit the market early next month, Isara
Khaosa-ad, the company's brewery manager, said on Thursday.
	   Red wine dominates the lot, but Boon Rawd, the maker of
Thailand's top-selling Singha beer, will also be offering rose and
white, he said.
	   ``Thais like red wine because of the color,'' said Isara.
	   Drinking wine became fashionable among the Thai middle class
when money was easy and the economy was the fastest growing in the
world from 1985-95.
	   Thailand's Interior Minister Sanan Kachornprasart has been known
to favor 100,000 baht (dlrs 2,777) bottles of wine, and other
politicians lavish rare wines on their colleagues as gifts.
	   But many Thais have been forced to cut back on expensive habits
since an economic crisis hit the country in July 1997.
	   Unfortunately for Boon Rawd, which began planning Khao Yai six
years ago and has invested 200 million baht (dlrs 5.5 million) in
it, the company could not foresee the coming recession.
	   They have scaled back on how much wine they will release on to
the market, Isara said, but he believes that the economic crisis
may in fact work to Khao Yai's benefit.
	   Most wines are imported and subject to tariffs that make them
fairly expensive by Thai standards. But domestically-produced Khao
Yai won't be subject to those taxes.
	   ``The affordable price will be a good selling point to compete
with imported wines,'' Isara said, while declining to say how much
the wine will sell for.
	   ``We are expecting to do just fine during the hard times when
people are tightening the belt. For future expansion we need to see
the reaction of the market to our product,'' he said.
	   Boon Rawd's vintages are the second domestically-grown wines,
following Chateau d'Loei, launched in 1996 by Ital-Thai, a
construction conglomerate.
	   Boon Rawd's grapes are cultivated on a vineyard in Pak Chong
district of Nakorn Ratchasima Province, 210 kilometers (130 miles)
northeast of Bangkok, where the land and climate is acceptably
cool, Isara said.
	   The company has a small winery equipped with technology imported
from Italy and under the supervision of a winemaker from Germany.
	   ``Our wine tastes as good as imported wines,'' insisted Prayuth
Piangbunta, one of Boonrawd's Thai winemakers.
	   He said the company does not expect strong competition from
Chateau d'Loei, which produces at small scale. Right now, however,
the goal is to become accepted in the market and have the product
survive the current hard times.
	   Prayuth said he also hoped a government-sponsored campaign to
buy Thai products, called the Thai-Help-Thai campaign, will
encourage locals to give Khao Yai a try.
	   ``We hope that the economic crisis will turn attitudes around
and Thais will opt to drink locally produced wines,'' he said.

Number of new autos built in Japan falls again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The number of new cars and trucks to roll off
Japanese assembly lines fell in November, an industry group said
Thursday, as recession at home and in neighboring Asian nations
continued to hurt demand.
	   The number of new vehicles built last month was 848,266, down
1.3 percent from the same time a year ago, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association said.
	   The number has fallen or broken even for 13 of the last 14
months, the association said. It recorded its only rise of the year
in October.
	   While robust exports to the United States helped the number of
passenger cars built in November rise 5.6 percent, the number of
new trucks plunged by a quarter.
	   In total, Japanese carmakers have built 8.5 percent less cars
and trucks so far this year compared to the same 11-month period
the year before.

Jailed American files suit in Japan to protest alleged abuse

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Lawyers for a U.S. citizen serving a 6-year prison
sentence said they filed suit Thursday to protest alleged
mistreatment of their client, including physical abuse by prison
guards and more than four years in solitary confinement.
	   The suit, filed with the Tokyo District Court, seeks 10 million
yen (dlrs 86,000) in compensation from the Japanese government for
causing undue mental and physical suffering to Johnny Crittenden, a
39-year old native of Georgia.
	   ``It is a very symbolic case about Japan's prison situation,''
said Yuichi Kaido, an attorney representing the American plaintiff,
adding that the problems highlighted in the case are widespread in
the prison system.
	   Atsushi Kasuga, a prison spokesman, declined to comment on the
case.
	   Crittenden, who is scheduled to be released on Jan. 7, claims he
was subjected to a beating, restraint with a leather belt that
restricted normal breathing for a 24-hour period and unjust
solitary confinement.
	   All of the alleged mistreatment stemmed from Crittenden's
refusal of a haircut and shave, lawyer Kaido said.
	   Crittenden refused the haircut given to all new Japanese prison
inmates on the basis of his religious beliefs as a Rastafarian and
failed to shave as instructed one day due to a linguistic
misunderstanding, his lawyer said.
	   Practitioners of Rastafarianism, which originated in Jamaica,
are known for their faith's embracement of long, dreadlock-style
hair-braids.
	   As a result, attorney Kaido said his client was unable to speak
with other inmates at Fuchu prison outside Tokyo, one of three that
hold foreign nationals, or participate in any group activities for
more than 4 1/2 years.
	   ``It is not a matter of money. It is a matter of justice and
rights,'' Crittenden was quoted as saying by his attorney.
	   Both prison officials and Crittenden's legal council declined to
specify the crimes for which he was convicted or provide the name
of his hometown.
	   Earlier this month, a Japanese court ordered the state to pay
150,000 yen (dlrs 1,290) in compensation to an American who was
beaten up by guards at another Japanese prison. Keith Dickerson,
33, of Santa Barbara, Calif., had sought 3.3 million yen (dlrs
28,380).
	   In November, the United Nations Human Rights Committee issued a
report saying it was ``deeply concerned at many aspects of the
prison system in Japan,'' including harsh rules of conduct, severe
punishment measures and the frequent use of restraining devices.

Russians confiscate smuggled tigers, deer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian customs officials in the Far East seized
the carcasses of endangered tigers and deer during an inspection of
a boat headed to South Korea, a news report said Thursday.
	   Authorities in the port of Vladivostok confiscated the remains
of three tigers, 14 musk deer, the hide of a lynx and a collection
of antlers, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   In many Asian countries, animal parts are used in traditional
medicines. But the tigers and other animals have been largely wiped
out, and international treaties bar trading in the animal parts,
though smuggling remains a widespread problem.

French maritime authorities abandon hunt for missing boat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French maritime authorities abandoned the search
Thursday for a Spanish fishing boat with eight men aboard that
vanished when a storm hit the southwestern French coast six days
ago.
	   The ``Marero'' is registered in the port of Pasajes in Spain's
Basque province of Guizpoca. The 23-meter (yard) vessel disappeared
Saturday about 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of the French port of
Bayonne during a fierce storm.
	   French authorities searched for the boat for the past two days.
	   France's Center for Monitoring and Sea Rescue coordinated the
search effort. All fishing boats in the area were asked to watch
out for signs of the crew but no trace of them was found.

Dutch researchers hope to pioneer impotence pill for women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Three Dutch university hospitals
have joined forces in an effort to pioneer a Viagra-style impotence
pill for women.
	   Pfizer, the U.S. pharmaceutical company that makes Viagra, is
funding the effort by researchers at the principal teaching
hospitals in Amsterdam, the northern city of Groningen and the
southern city of Maastricht, Dutch media reported Thursday.
	   One target of such a pill would be treating the vaginal dryness
that can make intercourse painful, particularly for older women, a
spokesman for the study said.
	   Viagra, while stimulating sexual desire in men, has little or no
effect on increasing a woman's sexual appetite, the researchers
said.

Ukrainian bus driver immolates himself over unpaid wages
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian bus driver doused himself with
gasoline and set himself on fire outside his boss's office,
exasperated that he hadn't received his wages in more than a year,
a newspaper said Thursday.
	   The driver, identified only as Ivan, sustained severe burns to
most of his body before colleagues managed to put out the flames,
the daily Segodnya said.
	   He was hospitalized in critical condition, and was given little
chance of survival, doctors said.
	   The man worked at a municipal transport enterprise in the
southern city of Mykolaiv. He had not been paid for 13 months,
according to Segodnya.
	   Ukraine's economy has contracted sharply since the 1991 Soviet
collapse, and many government and private enterprises do not pay
workers on time.
	   Ukraine's wage debts have been steadily increasing for the past
several years, and now totals about 6.5 billion hryvna (dlrs 1.9
billion), according to government estimates.

Dutch researchers hope to pioneer impotence pill for women
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Three Dutch university hospitals
have joined forces in an effort to pioneer a Viagra-style impotence
pill for women.
	   Pfizer, the U.S. pharmaceutical company that makes Viagra, is
funding the effort by researchers at the principal teaching
hospitals in Amsterdam, the northern city of Groningen and the
southern city of Maastricht, Dutch media reported Thursday.
	   One target of such a pill would be treating the vaginal dryness
that can make intercourse painful, particularly for older women, a
spokesman for the study said.
	   Viagra, while stimulating sexual desire in men, has little or no
effect on increasing a woman's sexual appetite, the researchers
said.

Koirala sworn in as prime minister

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala was
sworn in by King Birendra Thursday to head Nepal's sixth government
in four years, the state-run Radio Nepal said.
	   His Nepali Congress party has the support of the United
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal and Nepal Goodwill Party
in parliament. His partner parties are expected to join the
government by the weekend.
	   Koirala resigned on Monday after his coalition partner _ the
Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Nepal _ withdrew its support
and he lost a majority in Parliament.
	   He came back to power with the help of another communist group.
The new coalition will oversee general elections the government
plans to hold by April.
	   Until 1990, Nepal was an absolute monarchy, but a pro-democracy
movement forced constitutional reforms that reduced King Birendra
to a figurehead. Since then, no party has won a clear majority in
Parliament and successive governments have been short-lived.

Three tourists ejected from movie theater over anthem
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Three tourists who refused to stand when
the Kenyan national anthem was played in the Kenya Cinema were
ejected from the theater, the customer service manager said
Thursday.
	   In all movie theaters in Kenya, a message is flashed on the
screen before the film informing the audience that standing is
mandatory when the anthem is played.
	   ``It is not a case of they did not know,'' said manager David
Mwaura.
	   Mwaura said the German and two Americans who had intended to see
``Antz'' Wednesday were seen sitting during the playing of the
anthem by the hall manager who approached them and told them to
leave.
	   Once outside, Mwaura said, the tourists tried to argue, but when
the hall manager told them he would summon the police, they left.
	   The tourists' names were not available.
	   Under Kenyan law, everyone is required to stand wherever the
national anthem is played.

Iraq fears more strikes, vows not to allow U.N. arms inspections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's state-run newspapers on Thursday
said Iraqis will not be intimidated by U.S. threats of strikes to
force Iraq to allow the resumption of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   The weapons inspection teams now exist only ``in the sick dreams
entertained by America,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said in a
front page editorial.
	   The U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, began work in 1991 to
dismantle Iraq's programs to build mass destruction weapons. It
withdrew its inspectors Dec. 16, saying Iraq was scuttling their
work. That night, the United States and Britain launched punishing
airstrikes, and Iraq this week said UNSCOM will never be allowed to
resume its work.
	   ``To say ... UNSCOM still exists ... is like chasing a mirage,''
the official al-Iraq newspaper said in a front-page editorial.
	   ``The vicious role of this American and British commission is
over and their treacherous aggression was the final bullet,'' the
paper said.
	   Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has dismantled its programs to
build nuclear, chemical and biological weapons along with
long-range missiles, U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its
1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted.
	   Iraq says more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers were killed in
the U.S.-British strikes on some 100 targets described as military
and defense related sites. Iraq says civilian sites also were hit.
	   The Babil newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son Odai, warned that the United States and Britain might use force
again.
	   ``The possibility of military action which they wave as a means
of psychological terror will not be more than what our people and
military units have already seen,'' the paper said.
	   The government has kept the military on alert.
	   Road junctions, strategic sites and main roundabouts in Baghdad
are still patrolled by militia of the ruling Baath party, a move
taken just before the airstrikes began. Air defenses remain active.
	   Iraq has not taken foreign reporters to military sites hit
during the four-day bombing.
	   But the impact of the bombing on civilian life is evident.
Telephone lines between Baghdad and the rest of the country remain
cut.
	   The popular Shebab Channel, or youth television, run by Odai, is
off the air. Iraq's satellite television channel also no longer
broadcasts.
	   Radio and television stations that can still transmit are not
clear and apparently only cover Baghdad and the surrounding areas.
	   Iraq has repaired some of the damage in residential areas. Water
and sewage pipes hit in the Karada neighborhood have been fixed.
	   Reconstruction teams, however, have not yet been seen at the
former defense ministry complex, which housed the military
intelligence, or the headquarters of the General Security
Directorate. Both were badly damaged.
	   On Wednesday, Iraq ordered the U.N. observer force that monitors
the Iraq-Kuwait border to cancel a scheduled flight to Iraq.
	   U.N. officials said they hoped the move was temporary.

Troubles on two fronts as Israel gears for elections

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Relations with the Palestinians are crumbling
and an agreement not to harm civilians along the Lebanese border is
collapsing _ just as Israel goes to elections over how to shape its
security into the next century.
	   Reflecting widespread security concerns, a bevy of retired
generals are among the candidates for prime minister. And each
seems to have different ideas about bringing peace to the country.
	   On Wednesday, Lebanese guerrillas showered towns on Israel's
northern border with Katyusha rockets, retaliation for an Israeli
air raid a day earlier that killed a woman and six of her seven
children. Israel vowed further retaliation.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Palestinian authorities released
the spiritual leader of Hamas, two months after placing him under
house arrest when a member of the militant Islamic movement
attempted to blow up a schoolbus full of Israeli children.
	   Israel accused its Palestinian partners and Lebanese enemies of
violating agreements.
	   Government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinians showed
bad faith by releasing Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   Yasser Arafat's government has ``conducted a high-profile policy
of ostensibly taking actions against Hamas ... but in reality,
quietly acquiescing to Hamas activities,'' he said.
	   Palestinian leaders are frustrated with a slowdown in Israel's
fulfillment of the peace accords reached in Wye River, Maryland, in
October, and have said they will not meet any new Israeli demands.
	   Israel has frozen a number of its Wye commitments, including a
small pullback from the West Bank, accusing the Palestinians of
failing to contain anti-Israel violence.
	   Yassin, frail and confined to a wheelchair, said his release
showed that his movement _ which calls for the destruction of
Israel _ had triumphed over Wye.
	   `Today, after the sound of Wye has become inaudible, it is
inevitable that other voices will be heard,'' Yassin told reporters
after followers greeted him with kisses.
	   In the north, Israel accused the Hezbollah guerrilla movement of
breaking a two-year-old agreement to avoid attacks on civilians.
	   The Lebanese guerrillas countered that Israel had broken the
agreement with the deadly air raid on Tuesday.
	   In Baalbek, Lebanon, hundreds of mourners gathered Wednesday for
the funeral of Nada Othman and her children, aged 2 to 13.
	   ``Murderers must pay the price of their crimes,'' Hezbollah
said.
	   Israeli chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz expressed his
regrets and said the attack on the family home was the result of
pilot error. The target had been a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   He said Hezbollah's retaliatory rocket attack was inexcusable.
	   ``We reserve the right to decide when and where we will
respond,'' Mofaz said.
	   The rockets struck early Wednesday just as Israeli
schoolchildren were emerging from bomb shelters, where families had
spent the night in anticipation of an attack. Sixteen people
suffered light to moderate injuries.
	   The Katyusha attacks and Yassin's release came two days after
Israel's parliament voted to hold elections more than a year ahead
of schedule.
	   The early elections, expected by April, were prompted by
widespread opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Hard-liners in his governing coalition are angry with his Wye
concessions to Palestinians, while the dovish opposition says
Netanyahu is scuttling the agreement with his demands of the
Palestinians.
	   On Wednesday, Lebanon became an election issue as well. Dovish
legislators revived their claim that Israel's occupation in
southern Lebanon _ meant to protect northern villages _ is
counterproductive.
	   ``Staying there is a trap and, unfortunately, a death trap,''
said Labor legislator Yossi Beilin. ``Leaving there gives us a
chance.''
	   No less than three potential candidates toured northern border
towns Wednesday in their capacities as ministers in the outgoing
government _ but looking a lot more like campaigners.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu told residents of
Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react.''
	   Also touring were Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who is
likely to challenge Netanyahu within their Likud Party, and
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, who is likely to run for prime
minister as head of a small rightist party.
	   Mordechai and Eitan are former generals _ as are Netanyahu's two
likeliest challengers from the left: Labor Party leader Ehud Barak
and Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former military chief who formally
retired from the army on Thursday and announced his intention to
enter politics.
	   Shahak is, 29th graf pvs.

State oil companies to compete with private firms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's state-owned oil companies will
have to compete with foreign firms in exploration bidding under a
liberalized policy outlined by the petroleum minister Thursday.
	   Petroleum Minister V. Ramamurthy was quoted by Dow Jones News
Wires as saying the new policy comes into effect in January, when
government officials begin trips to London, Houston, Calgary,
Singapore and Perth to tell entrepreneurs about 48 planned on- and
offshore exploration projects.
	   Earlier, licenses for such projects were offered only to foreign
companies who linked up with state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp. or
Oil India Ltd. Now, both ONGC and OIL will compete with private
companies for exploration licenses through international bidding.
	   Licensed companies will also be able to sell crude oil and gas
in India.
	   The royalty will be fixed at 12.5 percent for onshore areas and
10 percent for offshore areas and the government will credit half
of the royalty from offshore areas to a hydrocarbon development
fund.
	   To encourage deep water exploration, the royalty on such
projects will be charged at half the rates for the first seven
years after production starts.
	   An earlier tax on crude production was scrapped and companies
will be exempt from import duty on goods imported for exploration
activities under the new policy.
	   The government has also offered a seven-year tax holiday from
the date of commencement of commercial production under the new
policy.

His mentor jailed, China democracy campaigner vows to soldier on
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ His friend and political mentor is jailed,
robbing their budding opposition political party of its most potent
organizer, but Zha Jianguo is not afraid.
	   A bag packed with toothbrush, toothpaste and medicine lies ready
at his Beijing home for the day Chinese police take him away. He
has told police interrogators he expects to be jailed, likely for a
few years less than the 13 given China Democracy Party leader Xu
Wenli on Monday.
	   ``Democracy is a process, and in that process a small number of
people will be sacrificed,'' Zha, a 47-year-old former manager of a
computer design company and vice chairman of the party's Beijing
branch, told The Associated Press in an interview Thursday.
	   ``We want to use our sacrifice to arouse the people, and we
believe that sacrifice is worthwhile.''
	   With a mixture of defiance and cool clarity about the chances
for success, Zha said he and other China Democracy Party members
will continue organizing and campaigning for change.
	   His tenacity holds despite the summary trials and harsh
punishments for Xu, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin _ prominent party
principals from the provinces who were sentenced to 11 and 12 years
_ and despite threatening signs from the ruling Communist Party.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin warned in a speech published
Wednesday that political subversives threatened what he called
China's fragile social order.
	   ``Whenever any element that undermines stability raises its
head, it must be resolutely nipped in the bud,'' Jiang said.
	   Zha maintains that such tactics are unnecessary. In its
manifestoes, the Democracy Party espoused peaceful means to target
``the undemocratic system, not the political power of the Communist
Party.''
	   ``We believe elections held after the establishment of a
democratic system should decide who has the power,'' said Zha.
	   What many the world over consider democracy is legally
subversive in China for threatening the Communist Party-led system.
	   In the past month, authorities have arrested and convicted Xu,
Qin and Wang and detained or interrogated at least 29 other party
members. Police took Zha from his home Sunday afternoon and held
him for nearly 24 hours to keep him from Xu's trial.
	   Until the crackdown, the China Democracy Party distinguished
itself from past attempts at opposition by its openness. Organizers
publicly announced their intention to set up the party. They tried
to register with authorities. Statements were faxed to foreign
media and human rights groups to circumvent China's
state-controlled media.
	   Now, the party's members _ about 500 by Zha's count _ are being
driven underground. Party members will concentrate on increasing
ranks and will be more guarded in the use of telephones and faxes
and their occasional meetings, Zha said.
	   ``If Xu and the other two were the first round, then the second
round is very likely and it will be bigger,'' Zha said. ``In such
an unbalanced contest, we are forced to use more secretive means.''
	   The arrests of Xu, Wang and Qin deprive the party of its more
influential members, Zha said. All had proven track records, Xu and
Qin as dissident editors in the Democracy Wall era movement 20
years ago, Wang as a student leader of the Tiananmen Square
democracy demonstrations in 1989.
	   ``But from another aspect, this has strengthened the resolve of
even more party members to struggle on,'' Zha said of the arrests.
	   Zha got interested in politics as a radical youth, following Mao
Tse-tung's appeals to go to the countryside in 1968. When he
returned to Beijing in 1989, he marched in the Tiananmen protests
and continued his activism.
	   Friends introduced him to Xu Wenli in 1995. Having been released
from prison two years before, Xu was still not openly involved in
dissident politics, but he held court in his Beijing home to
discuss China's future.

Regulator: Chinese stimulus plan won't lead to more bad debt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A dlrs 1 trillion infrastructure spending
plan to stimulate China's economy won't result in troubled banks
being saddled with more bad debt, a top regulator said Thursday.
	   The Finance Ministry will supply most of the money itself and
monitor spending closely to minimize unproductive outlays, said Wu
Xiaoling, head of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese central bank.
	   The three-year spending plan for new highways, bridges and other
projects is meant to boost a slowing economy. At 7.5 percent to 8
percent this year, growth is robust for Asia but not enough to
create jobs for millions of workers laid off in reforms of
state-owned industry.
	   The government also has tried to spur the economy by easing
lending restrictions on state banks, leading to fears that would
increase uncollectible loans.
	   Wu insisted regulators were watching to make sure that didn't
happen and said only about 1 percent of spending on the
infrastructure program was expected to wind up in unproductive
assets.
	   Wu was named head of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of
China last month in a restructuring meant to create a regulatory
agency modeled on the U.S. Federal Reserve System.
	   She said the government was gradually reducing bad assets by
injecting capital into the banking system.
	   Uncollectible bank debts or loans on which payments are
temporarily suspended are equal to 25 percent of bank assets
nationwide, Wu said. In Shanghai, she said, that figure stands at
about 10 percent.

Troubles on two fronts as Israel gears for elections

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Relations with the Palestinians are crumbling
and an agreement not to harm civilians along the Lebanese border is
collapsing _ just as Israel goes to elections over how to shape its
security into the next century.
	   Reflecting widespread security concerns, a bevy of retired
generals are among the candidates for prime minister. And each
seems to have different ideas about bringing peace to the country.
	   On Wednesday, Lebanese guerrillas showered towns on Israel's
northern border with Katyusha rockets, retaliation for an Israeli
air raid a day earlier that killed a woman and six of her seven
children. Israel vowed further retaliation.
	   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, Palestinian authorities released
the spiritual leader of Hamas, two months after placing him under
house arrest when a member of the militant Islamic movement
attempted to blow up a schoolbus full of Israeli children.
	   Israel accused its Palestinian partners and Lebanese enemies of
violating agreements.
	   Government spokesman Moshe Fogel said the Palestinians showed
bad faith by releasing Sheik Ahmed Yassin.
	   Yasser Arafat's government has ``conducted a high-profile policy
of ostensibly taking actions against Hamas ... but in reality,
quietly acquiescing to Hamas activities,'' he said.
	   Palestinian leaders are frustrated with a slowdown in Israel's
fulfillment of the peace accords reached in Wye River, Maryland, in
October, and have said they no longer feel totally bound by their
own promises.
	   Israel has frozen a number of its Wye commitments, including a
small pullback from the West Bank, accusing the Palestinians of
failing to contain anti-Israel violence.
	   Yassin, frail and confined to a wheelchair, said his release
showed that his movement _ which calls for the destruction of
Israel _ had triumphed over Wye.
	   `Today, after the sound of Wye has become inaudible, it is
inevitable that other voices will be heard,'' Yassin said as
enthralled followers showered him with kisses.
	   In the north, Israel accused the Hezbollah guerrilla movement of
breaking a two-year-old agreement to avoid attacks on civilians.
	   The Lebanese guerrillas countered that Israel had broken the
agreement with the deadly air raid on Tuesday.
	   In Baalbek, Lebanon, hundreds of mourners gathered Wednesday for
the funeral of Nada Othman and her children, aged 2 to 13.
	   ``Murderers must pay the price of their crimes,'' Hezbollah
said.
	   Israeli chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz expressed his
regrets and said the attack on the family home was the result of
pilot error. The target had been a Hezbollah radio transmitter.
	   He said Hezbollah's retaliatory rocket attack was inexcusable.
	   ``We reserve the right to decide when and where we will
respond,'' Mofaz said.
	   The rockets struck early Wednesday just as Israeli
schoolchildren were emerging from bomb shelters, where families had
spent the night in anticipation of an attack. Sixteen people
suffered light to moderate injuries.
	   The Katyusha attacks and Yassin's release came two days after
Israel's parliament voted to hold elections more than a year ahead
of schedule.
	   The early elections, expected by April, were prompted by
widespread opposition to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Hard-liners in his governing coalition are angry with his Wye
concessions to Palestinians, while the dovish opposition says
Netanyahu is scuttling the agreement with his demands of the
Palestinians.
	   On Wednesday, Lebanon became an election issue as well. Dovish
legislators revived their claim that Israel's occupation in
southern Lebanon _ meant to protect northern villages _ is
counterproductive.
	   ``Staying there is a trap and, unfortunately, a death trap,''
said Labor legislator Yossi Beilin. ``Leaving there gives us a
chance.''
	   No less than three potential candidates toured northern border
towns Wednesday in their capacities as ministers in the outgoing
government _ but looking a lot more like campaigners.
	   ``We can't let this pass quietly,'' Netanyahu said, gladhanding
residents of Kiryat Shemona. ``We will react.''
	   Also touring were Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who is
likely to challenge Netanyahu within their Likud Party, and
Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, who is likely to run for prime
minister as head of a small rightist party.
	   Mordechai and Eitan are former generals _ as are Netanyahu's two
likeliest challengers from the left: Labor Party leader Ehud Barak
and Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, a former military chief who formally
retired from the army on Thursday and announced his intention to
enter politics.

<TEXT>
	   VAN, Turkey (AP) _ A Kurdish rebel threw herself in front of a
military bus Thursday and ignited bombs strapped around her waist,
killing herself, a passerby and wounding 22 people, police said.
	   The attack in downtown Van, a southeastern city bordering Iran
and Iraq, was the third such suicide bombing in three months by
rebels fighting for autonomy in the southeast.
	   Gov. Abdulkadir Sari said a passerby, reportedly a 15-year-old
student, was killed. None of the injured, including officers and
civilians employed by the military, was in critical condition, Sari
added.
	   The explosion shattered building windows, including those of a
military residence and the governor's office, the Anatolia news
agency said.
	   The rebels from the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, have
stepped up suicide bombings since their leader Abdullah Ocalan was
detained in Italy on Nov. 12. In two previous attacks, two suicide
bombers were killed and a total of 11 people were wounded.
	   Italy later released Ocalan but refused to extradite him to
Turkey, where he could face the death penalty on charges of
terrorism.
	   The fighting in Turkey has claimed some 37,000 lives since 1984.

Cambodian investigation into waste scandal proceeding slowly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ An investigator into the illegal
importation of 3,000 tons of mercury-tainted waste from Taiwan said
Thursday that it is still unclear who authorized the shipment.
	   The local newspaper Koh Santepheap also reported that a second
dump of thousands of tons of waste had been found near the port of
Sihanoukville. The waste, resembling videotape, was packed in bags
with Korean writing.
	   Pol Lim, deputy chairman of the committee assigned to
investigate the waste from Taiwanese giant Formosa Plastics Corp.,
said the probe is proceeding slowly because import papers do not
show who approved the shipment.
	   ``There are several irregularities in the processing of the
papers,'' Pol Lim said. ``We cannot say now who or how many people
were involved because we have not been able to establish any
concrete evidence.''
	   His comments contradicted previous assertions from Environment
Minister Mok Mareth that the signature of one government official
was found on papers seized at the port.
	   The waste has been blamed for five deaths _ a dockworker who
died mysteriously after cleaning the hold of the ship that brought
it, and four people killed in road accidents as frightened
residents fled the port.
	   The appearance of foreign waste near Cambodia's only major
seaport underscores the long-standing problem of developed nations,
which tend to have stronger environmental laws, using poor
countries as dumps.
	   In Taiwan, Lee Chih-chun, general manager of Formosa Plastics,
disputed allegations that the company paid bribes of dlrs 3
million.
	   Lee said the Cambodian agent was paid dlrs 300,000 for transport
and disposal. The company has said it had Cambodian government
approval to import the waste.
	   Taiwanese Prime Minister Vincent Siew ordered officials to
investigate and clear up any misunderstandings.
	   Cambodia's prime minister, Hun Sen, has demanded that the waste
be sent back to Taiwan.
	   Taiwan's Environmental Protection Bureau has said it will send a
team to Cambodia with officials from a third country and will order
Formosa Plastics to take back the waste if proved hazardous.
	   Initial tests have shown the waste contains the poisonous metal
mercury, but the level of toxicity has yet to be determined. More
samples have been sent to Thailand for analysis.
	   Soldiers armed with shovels and protective rubber suits began
packing the waste into plastic-lined oil drums Wednesday. The
cleanup is expected to last more than a week.
	   Twenty-nine customs officials from Sihanoukville were suspended
in the scandal, but so far there has been only one arrest.
	   A court has detained the president of the local import-export
company that negotiated the passage of the waste through customs,
Sam Moeurn. He faces up to five years in prison for importing a
hazardous substance.

Habibie wants to meet East Timor's bishops to discuss peace efforts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ President B.J. Habibie wants to meet
East Timor's Roman Catholic bishops to discuss efforts to make
peace in the troubled territory, an Indonesian official said
Thursday.
	   Talks on how to end the conflict in the former Portuguese colony
have gained ground since the resignation of authoritarian President
Suharto in May after 32 years in power.
	   Suharto ordered the Indonesian military to invade East Timor in
1975, triggering a separatist guerrilla war and widespread human
rights abuses.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has taken a more
conciliatory approach and soon wants to meet East Timor's bishops,
Carlos Belo and Basilio Do Nascimento.
	   ``If possible, (the meeting) could take place before or just
after the New Year,'' Lopes Da Cruz, Indonesia's ambassador for
East Timor, said after a meeting with the president.
	   Habibie met Belo six months ago in Jakarta.
	   Jakarta has offered greater autonomy to East Timor in exchange
for international recognition of its sovereignty. Pro-independence
activists, however, say any autonomy deal must be transitional and
that a vote on self-determination must eventually take place.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesian rule over the
half-island territory and is sponsoring peace talks between
Indonesia and Portugal, which it considers the administering power.
	   East Timor Gov. Abilio Osorio Soares, who also attended the
meeting with Habibie, said the president wants the bishops and
other public figures to promote the idea of autonomy.
	   Belo, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel peace prize, has been a harsh
critic of Indonesian policy in East Timor but has been supportive
of negotiations.
	   Jamsheed Marker, the U.N. envoy for East Timor, left Indonesia
on Wednesday after meetings with pro- and anti-independence
figures.

Iranian court reduces sentence of former mayor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An appeals court has reduced the sentence of
a former Tehran mayor convicted of corruption from five years to
two years in jail, a judiciary statement said Thursday.
	   The court also reduced the period Gholamhossein Karbaschi was
banned from assuming public office from 20 to 10 years.
	   It replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of 10 million
rials (dlrs 3,000), statement said. This would be in addition to
the original fines he was ordered to pay: 1 billion rials (dlrs
330,000) as punishment and 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) that he
must pay back the city.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
had been a target of hard-line political rivals, and many Iranians
saw the trial as a political settling of scores. The judiciary in
Iran is controlled by hard-liners.
	   Karbaschi was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his
eight years as Tehran's mayor. He filed an appeal in August.
	   It was not immediately clear when Karbaschi, who has been out on
bail, will begin serving his sentence.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted to making mistakes, but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi won wide respect for his work as mayor. He built parks
and social centers and reduced pollution and traffic congestion.
But he also made enemies among the merchant class which resented
his taxes and his support for Khatami, a moderate cleric who
believes in relaxing the Islamic social code. His pro-Khatami
stance also incurred the enmity of hard-liners.
	   Riots erupted in Iran soon after Karbaschi's arrest in April.
	   For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first insight
into Iran's judicial process and moderates saw it more as an
indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.

Teen-age girl freed after 11-day abduction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RICHMOND, British Columbia (AP) _ Canadian police have freed an
18-year-old girl kidnapped from her home 11 days ago for ransom.
	   The teen-ager was found bound and gagged in the trunk of a car
Tuesday night, the same night two men were arrested while driving
around in separate cars in the Vancouver suburb of Richmond.
	   Gary Chong, 21, and Chi Wai Chan, 24, appeared in provincial
court Wednesday charged with kidnapping, unlawful confinement and
sexual assault.
	   It was unclear how police found the teen-ager. A publication ban
has been placed on the proceedings.
	   Police said they were still looking for at least one other
suspect.
	   After she was found, the teen-ager was taken to Richmond
Hospital and later transferred to Vancouver General Hospital. She
was released Wednesday.
	   ``She's in terrible shape,'' said police spokesman Sgt. Willy
Laurie. ``She was very seriously traumatized ... she was treated
poorly.''
	   The teen-ager was kidnapped Dec. 11 when a group of armed men
forced themselves into her home in Richmond. She is the only child
of a Hong Kong couple who immigrated to Canada four years ago.
	   The men dragged the girl out of the house and warned her mother
not to call police or they would harm the girl, Laurie said.
Despite the threat, the family called police.
	   A few hours later, the kidnappers called the family back and
demanded a ransom in ``the mid six-figures,'' Laurie said. The
amount demanded was more than the family could pay, he said.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ When Father Ignatius Fidgeon
holds services at a Roman Catholic Church in Johannesburg, some
members of the audience barely stop scratching and yawning.
	   It's not a sign the parishioners are bored _ the scratchers and
yawners are Bella and Sasha, two cocker spaniels who accompany
Fidgeon everywhere. They're even near the altar when he delivers
his sermons.
	   There haven't been howls of complaints from Fidgeon's
congregation. In fact, the dogs have become as regular a part of
the church as Bible reading and the singing of hymns, which _ to
almost everyone's relief _ the dogs haven't tried to participate
in.

Russia's Primakov says he'll resign if budget isn't passed

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov urged parliament
to swiftly approve an austere budget for next year, and threatened
Thursday to resign along with his Cabinet if the document is
rejected.
	   Lawmakers began debating the 1999 budget Thursday, and were
expected to pass it with less commotion than in previous years
because of their broad support of Primakov's government.
	   Before heading into parliament, Primakov met with President
Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin to discuss the budget, which is
designed to help stabilize Russia's shrinking economy.
	   ``If the budget isn't approved, we will not stay on our posts,''
Primakov said.
	   ``The budget must be very severe, we can't lie to anyone,'' he
told Yeltsin, who nodded in agreement.
	   Primakov then told parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
that a lean budget was essential for getting new loans from the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders. Russia badly needs
the aid to help pay off its huge debts.
	   ``Quickly passing the budget will strengthen our stance in the
talks with international financial organizations,'' Primakov said.
	   Despite their support for Primakov, some lawmakers criticized
the budget as being too dependent on foreign help.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that the budget
relies on dlrs 7.2 billion in foreign loans that may not come.
	   Also, the budget earmarks only dlrs 9.5 billion to pay off
Russia's foreign debt, which will total dlrs 17.5 billion next
year. The budget planners are seeking to reschedule the remaining
debts.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar, and forecasts inflation of 30 percent next year.
	   Alexander Zhukov, the chairman of the Duma's budget committee,
dismissed both targets as overly optimistic now that the ruble has
fallen below 20 rubles to the dollar and inflation this year is
expected to top 70 percent.
	   But Zhukov asked the Duma to approve the plan anyway.
	   ``The budget rejection or a significant delay in its passage
would bring our country to such situation that the economic crisis
of August and September would seem a time of economic prosperity,''
he said.
	   The previous government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some
of its domestic debts in August, triggering Russia's worst economic
crisis since the Soviet collapse and prompting foreign lenders to
freeze further loans.
	   Primakov also planned to meet Thursday with members of
parliament's upper house, the Federation Council, who have balked
on the budget because it would cut into regional tax revenues.
	   The Federation Council, made up of regional governors fiercely
protective of their funds, has put up little fight in budget
proceedings in the past.
	   Before the meeting, Primakov told the Duma that he is willing to
compromise, but wouldn't allow bloated spending.
	   The budget forecasts spending of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29
billion) and revenues of 474 billion rubles (dlrs 24 billion),
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   It must pass four readings by the Duma before going to the
Federation Council, and is unlikely to be approved before the new
year.

Serb forces launch new offensive, Kosovo Albanian sources claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian sources claim Serb
forces launched a strong offensive Thursday on a Kosovo rebel
stronghold in the north of the province. The report could not be
immediately confirmed.
	   The Kosovo Albanian Information Center said heavy Serb military
and police forces began a sweeping attack at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT),
targeting six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles)
north of provincial capital Pristina.
	   The Center said that the focus of the attack was near Lapastica,
a stronghold of the guerrilla secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army,
just west of Podujevo. The report said tanks had already entered
Lapastica.
	   It claimed that Serb army and police, including special police
forces, were shelling the region's villages across a 17-kilometer
(11 miles) stretch of terrain and that several ethnic Albanian
houses were set ablaze.
	   The Center also said that so far, one ethnic Albanian villager
from Sekiraca village was reported killed in the attack but
indicated it had no conclusive casualty toll.
	   An ethnic Albanian spokesman told reporters in Pristina Thursday
that the latest attack was planned in advance by Belgrade
authorities.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' spokesman
Xemail Mustafa said.
	   Mustafa called on urgent action by the international community
and Kosovo's verifiers to pressure Belgrade into halting the
offensive.
	   The head of Kosovo Information Center, Enver Maloku, told
reporters that shelling could be heard on the outskirts of
Podujevo.

China to put labor rights activist on trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With China-Dissidents

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ After swiftly convicting three democracy
campaigners, Chinese authorities will put on trial Sunday a labor
rights activist who tried to set up a group to assist unemployed
workers.
	   Zhang Shanguang is accused of endangering state security by
passing on intelligence to overseas groups, the Hong Kong-based
Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement reported
Thursday. He faces from three years to life imprisonment if
convicted.
	   His wife said the court in southern Hunan province's Huaihua
city told Zhang's lawyer about the trial on Tuesday, less than the
10 days notification families are supposed to receive under Chinese
law.
	   Zhang's case mirrors the handling of the trials for Xu Wenli,
Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin. The three, among China's most
prominent dissidents, were arrested last month and charged with
endangering state security. They were sentenced this week to 13, 12
and 11 years in prison for trying to organize the China Democracy
Party.
	   Amid the arrests and trials, Chinese leaders have made strident
speeches threatening to destroy challengers to Communist Party
rule. Chinese President Jiang Zemin ordered law enforcement
officials Wednesday to eliminate any threats to ``social
stability.''
	   Zhang spent seven years in prison in the nationwide crackdown
that followed the crushing of democracy demonstrations in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square in 1989. After his release, Zhang informed
overseas groups about labor protests in Hunan, the Information
Center reported.
	   Zhang decided in July to set up The Association to Guarantee the
Rights and Interests of Laid-off Workers. He was detained shortly
afterwards and has not been let out since.
	   The Huaihua court has decided to try him on Sunday to clear a
backlog of cases before year's end, the Information Center
reported.

Yeltsin discourages early campaigning by potential successors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who bristles at the notion of being
a lame duck, scolded his potential successors Thursday for acting
as if they were already president.
	   ``There is still a year-and-a-half until the presidential
election, and we already have people who think they are the
president,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.
	   The next presidential election is set for the middle of 2000,
but Yeltsin's health problems have spurred some politicians to
launch informal campaigns in case he leaves office early.
	   The president did not mention any names, but appeared to be
referring to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who recently launched his
own political movement and has been speaking out about national
economic policies and Russia's foreign relations.
	   Yeltsin, 67, says he has no serious illnesses and will serve out
his full term. He has been unable to work full-time for months,
though he has been more active since recovering from a bout of
pneumonia earlier this month.
	   Other leading presidential contenders are Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, Siberian governor Alexander Lebed and liberal
politician Grigory Yavlinsky.

Revelations of more payoffs to gangsters by top Japanese firms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Dlrs 100 million in 3rd graf is correct
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Leading Japanese financial institutions caught in a
scandal involving payoffs to a self-confessed corporate racketeer
also funneled millions of dollars to dozens of other gangsters,
news reports said Thursday.
	   Five companies _ Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and brokerages Nomura
Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and the
now-defunct Yamaichi Securities Co. _ paid a total of 1.1 billion
yen (dlrs 9.5 million) to 35 other ``sokaiya'' racketeers, national
broadcaster NHK said, quoting the Tokyo Regional Tax Office.
	   Public trust in Japan's financial firms plummeted last year
following revelations that the five companies made almost dlrs 100
million in illegal payments and questionable loans to a single
corporate extortionist, Ryuichi Koike.
	   Dozens of executives resigned and were arrested in the Koike
scandal. Koike has admitted to taking the payoffs.
	   On Thursday, Japanese tax officials _ who have been
investigating the companies' books in the wake of the scandal _
revealed that Koike was but one of several racketeers demanding
hush money from Japan's top financial executives.
	   Japan's sokaiya buy shares in companies and solicit cash
payments by threatening to disrupt or make embarassing revelations
at shareholder meetings. The practice has been rife in Japan for
decades, but it is only recently that authorities have cracked
down.
	   The bribes revealed Thursday were reportedly made over a five
year period up to March 31, 1997. The companies made the payments
by funneling trading profits to the racketeers or by buying luxury
goods, such as art-works or golf club memberships, from them at
inflated prices.
	   The tax bureau declined to reveal details of its probe.
	   The investigation reportedly showed that Nomura paid 370 million
yen (dlrs 3.19 million) to nine other sokaiya; Daiwa paid 70
million (dlrs 630,000) yen to five; Yamaichi paid 280 miilion yen
(dlrs 2.4 million) to five; and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank paid 300
million yen (dlrs 2.59 milion) to 12.
	   Tax officials on Thursday also ordered all of the financial
institutions involved in the scandal _ aside from failed Yamaichi _
to pay a total of 900 million yen (dlrs 7.76 million) in corporate
taxes and penalties for hiding income, which included kickbacks to
Koike.
	   It was unclear what further legal action may be taken against
the companies following Thursday's reports of payoffs to several
corporate racketeers.
	   The main figure behind the sokaiya scandal _ Koike _ has pleaded
guilty to taking bribes of dlrs 5.3 million from Nomura, Daiwa,
Nikko and Yamaichi.
	   He also has admitted taking hidden loans worth dlrs 91 million
from Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, one of the world's largest. He is
believed to have used the money to buy the shares needed to gain
admission to the brokerages' annual shareholders' meetings.

Asian markets close mostly higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended mostly higher in
largely muted trading ahead of the Christmas holiday.
	   In Tokyo, Asia's largest market, share prices bucked the trend,
falling for a third straight session. Investors were worried that
the dramatic plunge in the price of Japanese government bonds this
week, and a corresponding jump in interest rates, would hurt
corporate profits, especially at the country's already badly-shaken
banks, analysts said.
	   The Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 72.72 points, or
0.5 percent, to 13,706.73.
	   The dollar, weakened against the yen, bought 116.12 yen in
late-afternoon trading, down 0.96 yen from its level of 117.08 late
in Tokyo on Tuesday but slightly above 115.96 yen late in New York
on Wednesday.
	   Tokyo markets were closed Wednesday for a national holiday.
	   Interest rates began rising Tuesday following the Japanese
government's announcement that it would issue a record amount of
new bonds next year to pay for an increase in spending.
	   Hong Kong shares ended higher, following gains in the U.S. and
European markets, in subdued trading.
	   The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong closed at midday for the
Christmas holiday after morning trading volume stayed at one of the
lowest levels in more than two years. Volume was worth 1.51 billion
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 193 million), compared with 1.36
billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 174 million) at midday
Wednesday, and 2.23 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 286
million) for all of Wednesday.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 133.45 points, or 1.3
percent, at 10,292.20 after trading in a narrow range.
	   In Singapore, the key Straits Times Index closed higher at
1392.75, up 8.22 points, or 0.6 percent, from Wednesday, also
buoyed by Wall Street's gains. Like many markets in the region,
trading closed at midday for Christmas Eve.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher in thin trading, with
the key SET index ending 2.66 points, or 0.8 percent higher at
346.93
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed marginally higher in light
trading ahead of the Christmas holiday. The JSX composite index
ended up 1.336 points, or 0.3 percent, at 401.855.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares finished mixed, with the
benchmark Composite Index gaining 1.21 points, or 0.2 percent, to
end at 552.32.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares finished higher, buoyed by overnight
gains on Wall Street and buying by fund managers before the year
ends, dealers said. The PSE rose 21.69 points, or 1.1 percent, to
end at 1932.15.
	   SEOUL: South Korean shares closed slightly higher. The key Kospi
index gained 1.83 points, or 0.3 percent, to 555.36 on continued
expectations that the country's ratings will be upgraded soon,
analysts said.
	   SYDNEY: Australian shares ended marginally higher, propped up by
Wall Street's rise in a shortened trading session before the
Christmas holiday. The All Ordinaries index of share prices closed
midday at 2764.0, up 9.0 points, or 0.3 percent.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares finished slightly lower for the second
straight session. The Weighted Price Index closed down 5.65 points,
or 0.08 percent, to 6683.00.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices ended higher for the eighth
consecutive session. The NZSE-40 capital index closed up 33.51
points, or 1.6 percent, higher at 2123.41.

Complaint filed against Duvalier for illegal residence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French citizen has filed a complaint against
former Haitian dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier for
illegal residence on French territory.
	   The complaint, filed by a leftist former regional council member
in the Picardy region, demands that Duvalier _ widely believed to
be in France _ be legally compelled to appear in court in March,
judicial officials said. If he didn't, he could be judged in
absentia.
	   Jacques Samyn said he filed the complaint as a citizen, ``to
compel the French state to come out in the open'' about Duvalier's
whereabouts.
	   Although police sources have confirmed to The Associated Press
that Duvalier is in France, the Interior Ministry said recently it
has lost track of the former dictator, and that he probably has
left French territory.
	   ``While we expel illegal immigrants, we leave `Baby Doc' in
peace, Samyn was quoted as saying in Thursday's France-Soir
newspaper.
	   Named president-for-life at age 19 following the death of his
father in 1971, Duvalier, 47, has lived in France since February
1986, when a popular uprising forced him into exile.
	   Recently, a Haitian-born photographer, Gerard Bloncourt,
encouraged by the arrest in Britain of former Chilean dictator Gen.
Augusto Pinochet, started a committee in Paris to bring Duvalier to
trial for crimes committed during his regime.
	   Samyn's move came after he learned Duvalier never had the proper
papers to reside in France.
	   Duvalier, who has recently given several media interviews
without revealing his whereabouts, has admitted living in France
without proper papers, but with special permission from the Foreign
Ministry.
	   Samyn's lawyer says that if Duvalier refuses to appear before a
court on March 14, the date cited in the complaint, he could be
judged in absentia. But first prosecutors have to decide whether to
accept Samyn's complaint.
	   Illegal residence is punishable by a maximum one year in prison
and a 25,000 franc (about dlrs 4,500) fine, as well as expulsion.

Police in north Indian city cracking down on gays following
</HEADLINE>
complaints &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Police are preventing gays from going to a
park in the north Indian city of Lucknow following protests from
the public that they were having sex there, an official said
Thursday.
	   Policemen have been posted at the GPO Park, a popular rendezvous
for the city's gays, said police spokesman R.S.Tomar.
	   ``Police will not allow male couples into the park if they know
they are gays. ... Policemen will ask them if they are gay. If they
hold hands or are demonstrative about their affection, we'll
suspect them of being gay,'' he said in an interview.
	   State prosecutor S.K. Saluja said keeping gays out of parks
violates their rights, although police are within their rights to
prosecute those having sex or behaving in an obscene manner in
public. Sodomy is illegal in India, but prosecutions are rare.
	   Despite legal opinion, Tomar said police are determined to
prevent gays from frequenting the park.
	   ``The rights of others are as important as those of the gays,''
Tomar said.
	   Over the last three months, police have arrested five male
prostitutes on charges of soliciting, he said.
	   Anuj Mishra, a spokesman of Dost, an association of gays, said
meeting in the park is not a crime.
	   The group plans to hold demonstrations and sit-ins to protest
the police action, he said.
	   Public displays of affection even between men and women are rare
in India, where many believe homosexuals exists only in Western
nations.

Ethnic Albanians claim Serb forces launch lightening attack on

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
rebel stronghold &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery launched a strong attack Thursday on a rebel stronghold
north of here, setting fire to houses and killing at least one
person, ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military were targetting
six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed. If the report
is true, the attack would represent a significant setback to the
already shaky cease-fire which ended the worst of the fighting here
in October.

PRISTINA: in October.

<TEXT>
	   According to the report, Serb tanks had already entered one of
the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The report said at least one ethnic Albanian villager was killed
in the sweep and several houses were set ablaze. There was no
comment from Serb sources.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Mustafa urged American and European governments and the
international monitors sent to the province to verify a
two-month-old cease-fire agreement to intervene with Yugoslav
authorities to halt the attacks.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides in the
separatist province against launching more attacks. The alliance's
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly
aggressive Serb military and police activities.''
	   Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said NATO is
watching closely to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement reached
with U.S. envoy Richard HBolbrooke to halt the bloodshed.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed those concerns,
saying in Brussels that the escalating violence and killings in
recent days ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   The continuing spiral of violence threatens to revive the war
that raged between secessionist ethnic Albanians and Serb security
forces from February to October. During that time 1,000 people were
killed and another 300,000 lost their homes.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities did not conform to
Milosevic's pledges in an Oct. 12 agreement. He reiterated that
Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade have been told
they ``must comply with their promises made to NATO.''
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on a visit to
the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed in Macedonia
in case international monitors in Kosovo are threatened.
	   But in a sign of continuing defiance, the main board of
Milosevic's Socialist Party met Wednesday and said it supports
Serbian forces' continuing efforts and ``destruction of the
terrorist gangs.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery launched a strong attack Thursday on a rebel stronghold,
setting fire to houses and killing at least one person, ethnic
Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military were targeting
six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed. If the report
is true, the attack would represent a significant setback to the
already shaky cease-fire which ended the worst of the fighting here
in October.

Ba deal scuppered after medical
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEWCASTLE, England (AP) _ Newcastle withdrew a 5.2 million pound
(dlrs 8.7 million) bid to hire AC Milan winger Ibrahim Ba on
Thursday after the Frenchman failed a medical at St. James'Park.
	   Magpies manager Ruud Gullit said Newcastle and AC Milan had
agreed terms for the 25-year-old international but the deal was
scuppered when medical tests on Wednesday detected Ba had a
long-standing knee injury.
	   Gullit, under fire this week when a club executive questioned
his commitment to Newcastle and said he spent as much time in the
Netherlands as he did on the Tynside, revealed his latest trip
abroad was a smokescreen as he attempted to sign Ba.
	   ``We had a player we had worked very hard to get as quickly as
possible but then he failed his medical,'' Gullit said.
	   ``It's a very big disappointment. We worked very hard to get him
here for his medical in secret.
	   ``In the past we had a lot of stories in the newspapers but we
saw already with Duncan Ferguson that it was kept a secret and we
got him.
	   ``Now again with Ba, it was kept a secret. Nobody knew what was
going on and unfortunately I was the target for that.
	   ``But if you can get a player in and be the target, then so be
it.''
	   Gullit, a former Dutch international and Chelsea manager,
replaced Kenny Dalglish as manager at Newcastle in August and has
guided the Magpies into 10th place in the standings in the
meantime.
	   His biggest outlay since taking the job was signing Duncan
Ferguson from Everton in November in a 7-million-pound (dlrs 11.5
million) deal to partner England captain Alan Shearer.

PRISTINA: in October.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   According to the report, Serb tanks had already entered one of
the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation
Army. The KLA is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The report said at least one ethnic Albanian villager was killed
in the sweep and several houses were set ablaze.
	   There was no comment from Serb sources.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Mustafa urged American and European governments and the
international monitors sent to the province to verify a
two-month-old cease-fire agreement to intervene with Yugoslav
authorities to halt the attacks.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides in the
separatist province against launching more attacks. The alliance's
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly
aggressive Serb military and police activities.''
	   Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said NATO is
watching closely to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement reached
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to halt the bloodshed.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed those concerns,
saying in Brussels that the escalating violence and killings in
recent days ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   The continuing spiral of violence threatens to revive the war
that raged between secessionist ethnic Albanians and Serb security
forces from February to October. During that time, 1,000 people
were killed and another 300,000 lost their homes.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities did not conform to
Milosevic's pledges in an Oct. 12 agreement. He reiterated that
Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade have been told
they ``must comply with their promises made to NATO.''
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on a visit to
the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed in Macedonia
in case international monitors in Kosovo are threatened.
	   But in a sign of continuing defiance, the main board of
Milosevic's Socialist Party met Wednesday and said it supports
Serbian forces' continuing efforts and ``destruction of the
terrorist gangs.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery launched a strong attack Thursday on a rebel stronghold,
setting fire to houses and killing at least one person, ethnic
Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military were targeting
six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed. If the report
is true, the attack would represent a significant setback to the
already shaky cease-fire which ended the worst of the fighting here
in October.
	   According to the report, Serb tanks had already entered one of
the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation
Army. The KLA is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The report said at least one ethnic Albanian villager was killed
in the sweep and several houses were set ablaze.
	   There was no comment from Serb sources.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Mustafa urged American and European governments and the
international monitors sent to the province to verify a
two-month-old cease-fire agreement to intervene with Yugoslav
authorities to halt the attacks.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides in the
separatist province against launching more attacks. The alliance's
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly
aggressive Serb military and police activities.''
	   Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said NATO is
watching closely to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement reached
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to halt the bloodshed.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed those concerns,
saying in Brussels that the escalating violence and killings in
recent days ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   The continuing spiral of violence threatens to revive the war
that raged between secessionist ethnic Albanians and Serb security
forces from February to October. During that time, 1,000 people
were killed and another 300,000 lost their homes.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities did not conform to
Milosevic's pledges in an Oct. 12 agreement. He reiterated that
Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade have been told
they ``must comply with their promises made to NATO.''
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on a visit to
the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed in Macedonia
in case international monitors in Kosovo are threatened.
	   But in a sign of continuing defiance, the main board of
Milosevic's Socialist Party met Wednesday and said it supports
Serbian forces' continuing efforts and ``destruction of the
terrorist gangs.''

Anti-Basque separatist 'dirty war' convicts leave prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A former interior minister and his deputy
left prison Thursday, five months after receiving 10-year jail
terms for their role in a ``dirty war'' against Basque separatists,
and a day after the government granted them a partial pardon.
	   Ex-minister Jose Barrionuevo and his former chief of state
security Rafael Vera were hailed by dozens of relatives and
supporters outside the prison at Guadalajara, 50 kilometers (30
miles) northeast of Madrid.
	   ``We don't feel bitterness, but that does not mean we forget
what has happened,'' Barrionuevo said in a short statement read
outside the prison and interrupted by chants of ``Innocent,'' from
the crowd.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were convicted in July of orchestrating the
1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was mistaken for a
hitman of the armed separatist group ETA. The began to serve their
ten-year jail terms in September.
	   The conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
on Wednesday followed a recommendation from the Supreme Court of
Justice and granted the two former officials a partial pardon that
reduced their sentences by two-thirds.
	   Following the announcement of the pardon, the prison authorities
said the convicted men would be allowed the serve the remainder of
their sentences under a semi-open prison regime that began with
permits to spend Christmas at home.
	   In his statement Barrionuevo thanked his supporters and the
Socialist party for standing by both him and Vera, and hailed what
he called the ``generosity and civic courage'' of the Supreme Court
for recommending the pardon.
	   He also thanked the government for ratifying the court's
argument in favor of a partial pardon on the grounds that the
kidnapping took place 15 years ago, and that those convicted had
not been seeking personal benefit.
	   But Barrionuevo also announced future action aimed at achieving
an even more relaxed prison regime, adding ``We will fight for the
recognition of our innocence.''
	   The 1983 abduction was the first action attributed to the
self-styled Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, that went on
to kill 27 people over the next five years in its anti-ETA
campaign. Many GAL victims were mistaken targets.
	   Revelations about the GAL in the early 1990s contributed to the
1996 electoral defeat of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
after nearly 14 years in office.
	   Gonzalez has long denied that Barrionuevo, Vera, or any of his
governments had anything to do with the GAL.
	   The partial pardon also affects eight other government and
security officials also convicted for the 1983 kidnapping, and
sentenced to between two and ten years in jail.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain. It has
been observing a unilateral cease-fire since Sept. 18, and there
are moves afoot for negotiations to resolve the conflict.

Indonesian human rights groups studies allegations against Mobil

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An Indonesian government-backed human
rights group on Thursday said it was assessing allegations that
Mobil Oil knew about military atrocities in an Indonesian province
in the early 1990s.
	   Mobil Oil Indonesia, a subsidiary of the U.S. oil giant, has big
operations in Aceh province, where the government recently ended a
decade-long campaign against separatist guerrillas.
	   Local human rights workers have alleged that hundreds of
civilians died during the fighting in the northwestern region and
have unearthed several mass graves. The military has apologized and
has pledged to reduce its presence in Aceh.
	   Muhammad Salim, a member of the National Human Rights
Commission, said it had received witness reports that Mobil
managers were allegedly aware of abuses in Aceh and even provided
equipment to soldiers involved in atrocities.
	   ``We have to learn whether this information is accurate and
clarify these reports,'' Salim said. Mobil denies the charges.
	   The human rights panel was set up by the government but has
developed a reputation for independent decision-making. It often
issues highly publicized reports but does not have the power to
take legal action.
	   Indonesian human rights workers have said that Mobil must have
known about atrocities in Aceh and also provided earth-moving
equipment to soldiers who used it to dig mass graves.
	   The accusations were originally contained in an article this
month in the U.S. magazine BusinessWeek.
	   In a Dec. 18 statement, Mobil said allegations that it was
complicit in human rights abuses were misleading and that it had
cooperated fully with the magazine's inquiries.
	   ``Despite these efforts, the magazine chose to sensationalize
the story by emphasizing unsubstantiated allegations and rumor,''
the statement read.
	   ``Mobil does not condone human rights abuses, and if
substantiated claims linking its activities to such abuses were
brought to its attention, the company would aggressively respond to
and denounce such actions,'' the company said from its Fairfax,
Va., headquarters.
	   Critics say Mobil provided camps, electricity, communications
and other facilities to the armed forces at a time when it was
widely known that a military campaign was underway.
	   ``They have helped since the beginning of the operation,'' said
Abdurahman Jacob, chairman of the legal aid foundation in
Lhokseumawe, an oil and gas center in Aceh.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery launched a strong attack Thursday on a rebel stronghold
north of here, setting fire to houses and killing at least one
person, ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military were targeting
six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital Pristina.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed that international observers
had reported shelling and machine gun fire in the area.
	   Grunnet said a convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including
several T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases in Pristina and
Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west of Podujevo.
	   He said the OSCE, which is trying to verify the Oct. 12
cease-fire accord, had no reports of casualties or further details.
Grunnet said Yugoslav authorities described the attack as a
``limited search operation'' for suspects in Monday's killing of a
Serb policeman in the area.
	   Nevertheless, the operation marks a significant setback to the
already shaky cease-fire agreement which ended the worst of the
fighting here in October.
	   According to the report, Serb tanks had already entered one of

Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main

	   Mustafa urged American and European governments and the
international monitors sent to the province to verify a
two-month-old cease-fire agreement to intervene with Yugoslav
authorities to halt the attacks.
	   Lapastica is a KLA command post for the north-central region of
Kosovo, including Pristina. Rebel commanders are based in a
protective, walled compound, and new recruits are trained there.
	   The initials ``UCK'' -- the Albanian language abbreviation for
the KLA -- is painted in large black letters on a wall at the
entrance to the village, and rebel fighters had been guarding the
dirt road leading to the village.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides in the
separatist province against launching more attacks. The alliance's
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly

Army captures weapons, says 150 rebels in from Sudan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The army captured an anti-aircraft gun
during clashes last weekend with rebels who had crossed into
northern Uganda from bases in southern Sudan, the New Vision
newspaper said Thursday.
	   Brigade commander Brig. Katumba Wamala told the government-owned
daily that more than 150 rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army are
believed to have entered Uganda in the past week.
	   He said the army captured the anti-aircraft gun during fighting
in the northern town of Agoro, 370 kilometers (230 miles) north of
the capital Kampala, near the Sudanese border.
	   He also said they had found a rebel weapons cache that included
guns, ammunition and grenade launchers.
	   Wambala displayed the captured weapons for journalists in his
office in Gulu, 265 kilometers (165 miles) north of Kampala. he
said most of them had been brought into Uganda over a month ago,
and some had been dropped from an airplane.
	   He accused the Sudanese government of arming the LRA rebels.
	   Wambala said most of the 150 rebels who entered Uganda during
the past week were young children.
	   The LRA has been operating in northern Uganda for 12 years,
attacking government and civilian targets and often abducting
children or young adults to use as bearers, fighters or sex slaves.
Its objectives are vague.
	   On Dec. 18, about 25 rebels attacked a Kampala-bound bus about
55 kilometers (35 miles) south of Gulu, killing four people and
injuring 20, the newspaper said.
	   It was unclear whether the assailants were among the 150 recent
rebel arrivals.

Security tight on German rails despite arrest of extortion suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ The German railway plans to keep a
close eye on its tracks through the holidays despite the arrest of
an alleged extortionist who confessed to three acts of sabotage,
officials said Thursday.
	   A court on Thursday ordered the 46-year-old suspect, nabbed at a
highway rest area Tuesday night, to remain jailed pending probable
charges of attempted extortion.
	   Federal agents say the man confessed to trying to extort 10
million marks (dlrs 6 million) from the German railway by
sabotaging rail lines near Berlin.
	   In the most serious incident, a cargo train derailed on Dec. 18
after passing over tracks where the bolts had been loosened. No one
was hurt, but damage was put in the millions.
	   German rail officials said copycat threats continued even after
the arrest of the suspect and an alleged accomplice on Wednesday.
The accomplice, who allegedly provided the main suspect with an
auto, was later released but still faces charges.
	   Spokesman Reiner Latsch said train traffic had returned ``to a
certain normality,'' but that border police or other security
agencies would be called in immediately at the first sign of any
trouble.
	   A stretch of high-speed tracks in western Germany between
Goettingen and Kassel was shut for two and a half hours late
Wednesday after a phoned-in threat. Federal border police searched
the tracks but no problems were discovered.

Paper: BA's decision to fly Rushdie `a great risk'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ British Airways is taking ``a great risk''
by allowing author Salman Rushdie to fly on its aircraft after a
nine-year ban, the Tehran Times newspaper said Thursday.
	   The airline announced Wednesday that it was lifting the ban on
the Indian-born British author after receiving assurances from the
British Foreign Office that there was no risk in flying him.
	   Tehran Times, a conservative English-language paper, questioned
that judgment.
	   ``The Foreign Office should not give assurances and should
respect the beliefs of over one billion Muslims,'' it quoted
unidentified experts as saying
	   Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic
republic, ruled that his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was
blasphemous to Islam.
	   In September, Britain restored full diplomatic relations with
Iran after the Iranian government said it would not take any action
to threaten Rushdie's life.
	   But the move has been fiercely opposed by hard-line critics of
the government of President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate.
	   ``British Airways has taken a great risk. Such an announcement
confirms that BA has no respect for the feelings of one billion
Muslims,'' the Times, which supports the hard-liners, quoted the
experts as saying.
	   In September, a semi-government hard-line foundation in Iran
raised the bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs
2.8 million. The move followed the government's distancing itself
from the reward.
	   A few weeks later, residents of a northern Iranian village
offered land and carpets to anyone who kills Rushdie.
	   In making the announcement, British Airways said it would be
happy to carry Rushdie starting Jan. 1.
	   ``The only reason why we have been unwilling to carry Mr.
Rushdie has been concern for the safety and security of our
passengers, our staff and our operations,'' an airline spokesman
said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said the Foreign Office assured BA that ``our nationwide
operation would not be at any risk as a result of this decision.''

Paper: British Airway's decision to fly Rushdie `a great risk'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ British Airways is taking ``a great risk''
by allowing author Salman Rushdie to fly on its aircraft after a
nine-year ban, the Tehran Times newspaper said Thursday.
	   The airline announced Wednesday that it was lifting the ban on
the Indian-born British author after receiving assurances from the
British Foreign Office that there was no risk in flying him.
	   Tehran Times, a conservative English-language paper, questioned
that judgment.
	   ``The Foreign Office should not give assurances and should
respect the beliefs of over one billion Muslims,'' it quoted
unidentified experts as saying.
	   Rushdie was condemned to death in 1989 after the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, the founding spiritual leader of the Islamic
republic, ruled that his book, ``The Satanic Verses,'' was
blasphemous to Islam.
	   In September, Britain restored full diplomatic relations with
Iran after the Iranian government said it would not take any action
to threaten Rushdie's life.
	   But the move has been fiercely opposed by hard-line critics of
the government of President Mohammad Khatami, a political moderate.
	   ``British Airways has taken a great risk. Such an announcement
confirms that BA has no respect for the feelings of one billion
Muslims,'' the Times, which supports the hard-liners, quoted the
experts as saying.
	   In September, a semi-government hard-line foundation in Iran
raised the bounty on Rushdie's head from dlrs 2.5 million to dlrs
2.8 million. The move followed the government's distancing itself
from the reward.
	   In making the announcement, British Airways said it would be
happy to carry Rushdie starting Jan. 1.
	   ``The only reason why we have been unwilling to carry Mr.
Rushdie has been concern for the safety and security of our
passengers, our staff and our operations,'' an airline spokesman
said on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He said the Foreign Office assured BA that ``our nationwide
operation would not be at any risk as a result of this decision.''

Round-the-world balloonists soar over Pacific
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes on balloon status, details, editing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A trio of balloonists soared over the Pacific
Ocean on Thursday at high speed, bound for the halfway point in
their attempt at the first nonstop balloon voyage around the world.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden caught the jetstream after
their passage over China on Wednesday and quickly gathered speed.
	   By 0815 GMT their helium and hot air ICO Global balloon was
moving at 150 mph (240 kph), and about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) into
the Pacific, said ground crew director Mike Kendrick.
	   Kendrick sounded ``a note of concern'' about a weather pattern
developing over the ocean Pacific. ``We are a bit nervous,'' he
said.
	   ``We're not panicking yet,'' he told Sky TV, explaining that a
trough of high pressure was about 2,000 miles (3,000) from the
balloonists.
	   ``If we can average about 125 knots (145 mph, 230 kph) over the
next 12 hours, or maybe 24 hours, we should be okay,'' he said.
	   Kendrick has described the Pacific leg of the journey as the
most hazardous, saying the frequency of shipping is not very high,
so that if the balloonists had to ditch their craft the rescue
would be more difficult.
	   He said ground crew were tracking the position of all ships that
would be under the balloon in the Pacific.
	   ``If we fall out of the jetstream into this trough over the
Pacific then there is only one way, and that is back to Hawaii and
they are going to go for a swim,'' Kendrick told Sky TV later.
	   He said the crew had been told to ascend to 30,000 feet (9,000
meters) to try to pick up the speed needed to avoid this.
	   ``The situation is that the higher you go, the more fuel is
used. So usually you trade speed for fuel,'' he said. ``At the
moment I am not interested in fuel. I need speed because we want to
try and keep them dry.''
	   ``We are not that concerned at the moment, but we are just
driving it very hard,'' Kendrick said. ``It is a very dangerous
place and we are not taking any chances.''
	   The ground crew said that the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high)
balloon might cross into North America at Washington State or
southern Canada.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, and cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   The halfway point on the voyage, which began in Morocco on Dec.
18, is in the Pacific Ocean. When the balloon reaches the coast of
North America it will be well into the final third of the journey.
	   The trip is expected to last from eight days to nearly three
weeks and finish in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile
(38,000 kms) flight.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Ukraine plans to keep currency in trading band in 1999
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's central bank will cut interest
rates and maintain a currency trading band in 1999 if the
government meets its budget targets and keeps inflation under
control, a bank official said Thursday.
	   National Bank deputy chief Oleksandr Kyreyev said a 1999 trading
band for the national currency, the hryvna, should be set for at
least six month periods to help businesses better plan ahead and
prevent unexpected currency devaluations, the independent Ukrainian
News agency said.
	   Kyreyev did not say what range the new trading band should have.
	   The hryvna is trading at 3.42 to the U.S. dollar. It has held
stable for more than a month within the government-set trading band
of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar.
	   The currency was sharply devalued in the wake of economic crisis
in neighboring Russia this fall. After the National Bank drained
most of its reserves to defend the currency, some observers said
the hryvna ought to float freely.
	   But the National Bank has since managed to calm down the
markets, and even lowered its key interest rate from 82 percent to
60 percent last week.
	   Kyreyev said the interest rate could come down to 17 percent by
the end of 1999 if the government meets its revenue targets and
does not allow uncontrolled inflation to occur.
	   But the National Bank's optimistic plans could be jeopardized by
the government's chronic inability to implement reforms, which have
resulted in continued economic decline and poor tax collection.
	   With no big improvements forecast for 1999, many analysts have
said the National Bank will have a tough time holding the hryvna
stable if the Cabinet decides to pay off wage arrears by borrowing
or printing money.
	   The former Soviet republic's huge foreign debt presents another
danger. Ukraine's debt obligations for 1999 are now twice as large
as its hard currency reserves, which total dlrs 1 billion.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ After 36 years as a soldier, Israel's
former army chief of staff Amnon Lipkin-Shahak left the military
Thursday to enter politics and likely challenge Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu as a centrist candidate. In his first news
conference as a civilian, urged Israelis to ``unite different parts
of our society.'' ``We must make peace among ourselves before we
make peace with our neighbors,'' he said. Shahak was on his way to
a meeting with President Ezer Weizman Thursday, the first of a
marathon of meetings inaugurating his political career. In an
interview in Thursday's editions of the newspaper Haaretz, Shahak
rejected opposition leader Ehud Barak's call to join his left-wing
Labor party. The newspaper quoted Shahak as saying if polls showed
centrist candidate Dan Meridor leading, he would be willing to join
him in the No. 2 slot. Meridor broke away from Netanyahu's
conservative Likud party and announced his candidacy Tuesday after
Israel's parliament voted for early elections. (ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ State-run newspapers on Thursday said
Iraqis will not be intimidated by U.S. threats of strikes to force
Iraq to allow the resumption of U.N. weapons inspections. The
weapons inspection teams now exist only ``in the sick dreams
entertained by America,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said in a
front page editorial. The U.N. Special Commission, or UNSCOM, began
work in 1991 to dismantle Iraq's programs to build weapons of mass
destruction. It withdrew its inspectors Dec. 16, saying Iraq was
scuttling their work. That night, the United States and Britain
launched airstrikes, and Iraq this week said UNSCOM will never be
allowed to resume its work. Until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
dismantled its programs to build nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons along with long-range missiles, U.N. trade sanctions
imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted.
Iraq says more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers were killed in the
U.S.-British strikes. (IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Any censure deal in the Senate in lieu of
impeachment is unlikely to include an admission by President Bill
Clinton that he committed perjury, Vice President Al Gore says.
With the nation's second presidential impeachment trial looming
next month, key senators acknowledged Wednesday that bipartisan
talks were under way on how to decide the president's fate. Gore,
in comments to CNN on Wednesday, made clear that the president was
unlikely to admit to lying under oath as part of any censure deal
that would avoid his conviction in the Senate and removal from
office. ``The president has said he did not lie under oath. He has
acknowledged that he gave statements that were less than helpful to
his interrogators, and he said that was misleading,'' Gore said.
``But that is a very different proposition.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery launched a strong attack Thursday on a rebel stronghold
in Kosovo, setting fire to houses and killing at least one person,
ethnic Albanian sources said. The Kosovo Information Center, close
to the province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said Serb police and
military were targeting six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers
(20 miles) north of the provincial capital, Pristina. Jorgen
Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe which is trying to verify the Oct. 12
cease-fire accord, had no reports of casualties or further details.
Yugoslav authorities described the attack as a ``limited search
operation'' for suspects in Monday's killing of a Serb policeman in
the area, Grunnet said. Nevertheless, the operation marks a
significant setback to the already shaky cease-fire agreement which
ended the worst of the fighting here in October.

	   HOUSTON (AP) _ While the world waits for news of improving
health and the public debut of the only living octuplets and their
parents, the Nigerian community in Houston is ready to lend a hand.
At least 300 people have offered to assist in child-rearing when
Nkem Chukwu and father Iyke Louis Ubogi bring home their eight
newborns. ``Now we have the American family _ the African family _
the eight wonders of the world. It cannot be handled by one
family,'' said Chido Nwangwu, a prominent leader of the local
Nigerian community. ``It will take a village to baby-sit eight kids
in the middle of the night.'' All of the infants remained in
critical condition Thursday at Texas Children's Hospital. On
Wednesday, the eight babies received names. The couple said they
named the children in the tradition of the Igbo (EE-boh) tribe, a
major ethnic group in their native Nigeria. (US-OCTUPLETS)

	   --
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The army captured an anti-aircraft gun
during clashes last weekend with rebels who had crossed into
northern Uganda from bases in southern Sudan, the New Vision
newspaper said Thursday.
	   Brigade commander Brig. Katumba Wamala told the government-owned
daily that more than 150 rebels of the Lord's Resistance Army are
believed to have entered Uganda in the past week.
	   He said the army captured the anti-aircraft gun during fighting
in the northern town of Agoro, 370 kilometers (230 miles) north of
the capital Kampala, near the Sudanese border.
	   He also said they had found a rebel weapons cache that included
guns, ammunition and grenade launchers.
	   Wambala displayed the captured weapons for journalists in his
office in Gulu, 265 kilometers (165 miles) north of Kampala. He
said most of them had been brought into Uganda over a month ago,
and some had been dropped from an airplane.
	   He accused the Sudanese government of arming the LRA rebels.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Three tourists who refused to stand when
the Kenyan national anthem was played in the Kenya Cinema were
ejected from the theater, the customer service manager said
Thursday.
	   In all movie theaters in Kenya, a message is flashed on the
screen before the film informing the audience that standing is
mandatory when the anthem is played.
	   ``It is not a case of they did not know,'' said manager David
Mwaura.
	   Mwaura said the German and two Americans who had intended to see
``Antz'' Wednesday were seen sitting during the playing of the
anthem by the hall manager who approached them and told them to
leave.
	   Once outside, Mwaura said, the tourists tried to argue, but when
the hall manager told them he would summon the police, they left.
	   The tourists' names were not available.
	   Under Kenyan law, everyone is required to stand wherever the
national anthem is played.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ When Father Ignatius Fidgeon
holds services at a Roman Catholic Church in Johannesburg, some
members of the audience barely stop scratching and yawning.
	   It's not a sign the parishioners are bored _ the scratchers and
yawners are Bella and Sasha, two cocker spaniels who accompany
Fidgeon everywhere. They're even near the altar when he delivers
his sermons.
	   There haven't been howls of complaints from Fidgeon's
congregation. In fact, the dogs have become as regular a part of
the church as Bible reading and the singing of hymns, which _ to
almost everyone's relief _ the dogs haven't tried to participate
in.

	   PARIS (AP) _ French maritime authorities abandoned the search
Thursday for a Spanish fishing boat with eight men aboard that
vanished when a storm hit the southwestern French coast six days
ago.
	   Spanish authorities, however, were still looking for the
``Marero,'' which is registered in the port of Pasajes in Spain's
Basque province of Guizpoca.
	   Helicopters, a patrol plane, and two tugboats were being used in
the Spanish search Thursday.
	   The 23-meter (yard) vessel disappeared Saturday about 90
kilometers (55 miles) north of the French port of Bayonne during a
fierce storm.
	   French authorities searched for the boat for the past two days.
	   France's Center for Monitoring and Sea Rescue coordinated the
search effort. All fishing boats in the area were asked to watch
out for signs of the crew but no trace of them was found.

	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungarian customs officers found over
20 kilograms (44 lbs) of heroin in a car driven by a German
citizen, crossing into Austria Thursday, the state news agency MTI
reported,
	   The 36-year-old German citizen was not named, but has been taken
into custody by police at the Hegyeshalom border crossing, 200
kilometers (125 miles) west of Budapest.
	   Forty bags of heroin, with an estimated street value of 120
million forints (dlrs 600,000), were hidden behind the door panels
of the car, according to National Customs spokesman Laszlo Laczo.
	   This was the 151st drug catch this year, Laczo told MTI. So far,
authorities have confiscated a total of 750 kilograms (1,650 lbs)
of illegal drugs, 80 percent of which was heroin. Marijuana,
cocaine, and various amphetamines made up the rest.

Russia's Primakov says he'll resign if budget isn't passed

 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov urged swift
parliamentary approval of an austere budget for next year, and
threatened Thursday to resign along with his Cabinet if the
document is rejected.
	   Lawmakers began debating the 1999 budget Thursday, and were
expected to pass it with less commotion than in previous years
because of their broad support for Primakov's government.
	   Before heading into parliament, Primakov met with President
Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin to discuss the budget, which is
designed to help stabilize an economy that's been contracting
rapidly since the summer.
	   ``If the budget isn't approved, we will not stay on our posts,''
Primakov said.
	   ``The budget must be very severe, we can't lie to anyone,'' he
told Yeltsin, who nodded in agreement.
	   Yeltsin, who has sidelined by a string of illnesses, has said
little about the country's economic turmoil, leaving Primakov to
deal with the worst financial crisis since the 1991 Soviet
collapse.
	   ``We must gradually arrange things to get rid of foreign (aid)
injections,'' Yeltsin told Primakov.
	   Primakov then told parliament's lower house, the State Duma,
that a lean budget was essential for getting new loans from the
International Monetary Fund and other lenders. Russia badly needs
the aid to help pay off its huge debts.
	   ``Quickly passing the budget will strengthen our stance in the
talks with international financial organizations,'' Primakov said.
	   Despite their support for Primakov, some lawmakers criticized
the budget as being too dependent on foreign help.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that the budget
relies on dlrs 7.2 billion in foreign loans that may not come.
	   Also, the budget earmarks only dlrs 9.5 billion to pay off
Russia's foreign debt, which will total dlrs 17.5 billion next
year. The budget planners are seeking to reschedule the remaining
debts.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar, and forecasts inflation of 30 percent next year.
	   Alexander Zhukov, the chairman of the Duma's budget committee,
dismissed both targets as overly optimistic now that the ruble has
fallen below 20 rubles to the dollar and inflation this year is
expected to top 70 percent.
	   But Zhukov asked the Duma to approve the plan anyway.
	   ``The budget rejection or a significant delay in its passage
would bring our country to such situation that the economic crisis
of August and September would seem a time of economic prosperity,''
he said.
	   The previous government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some
of its domestic debts in August, triggering Russia's worst economic
crisis since the Soviet collapse and prompting foreign lenders to
freeze further loans.
	   Parliament leaders agreed to hold their first vote on the budget
Thursday afternoon, saying delays would inflict ``enormous'' damage
on Russia.
	   Regional governors, who make up the upper chamber, the
Federation Council, have urged the Duma to postpone the vote,
saying the budget cutbacks will reduce the money going to the
regions.
	   Primakov sought to ease their concerns, saying that the regions
would continue to receive no less than half of all tax revenues.
	   The budget forecasts spending of 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29
billion) and revenues of 474 billion rubles (dlrs 24 billion),
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   It must pass four readings by the Duma before going to the
Federation Council, and is unlikely to be approved before the new
year.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets ended mostly higher in
largely muted trading ahead of the Christmas holiday. In Tokyo,
Asia's largest market, share prices bucked the trend, falling for a
third straight session. Investors were worried that the dramatic
plunge in the price of Japanese government bonds this week, and a
corresponding jump in interest rates, would hurt corporate profits,
especially at the country's badly shaken banks, analysts said. The
Nikkei average of 225 selected issues fell 72.72 points, or 0.5
percent, to 13,706.73. Hong Kong shares ended higher, following
gains in the U.S. and European markets, in subdued trading. The
blue-chip Hang Seng Index ended up 133.45 points, or 1.3 percent,
at 10,292.20 after trading in a narrow range. In Singapore, the key
Straits Times Index closed higher at 1392.75, up 8.22 points, or
0.6 percent, from Wednesday, also buoyed by Wall Street's gains.
The dollar, weakened against the yen, bought 116.12 yen in
late-afternoon trading, down 0.96 yen from its level of 117.08 late
in Tokyo on Tuesday but slightly above 115.96 yen late in New York
on Wednesday. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov urged parliament
to swiftly approve an austere budget for next year, and threatened
Thursday to resign along with his Cabinet if the document is
rejected. Lawmakers began debating the 1999 budget Thursday, and
were expected to pass it with less commotion than in previous years
because of their broad support of Primakov's government. Before
heading into parliament, Primakov met with President Boris Yeltsin
in the Kremlin to discuss the budget, which is designed to help
stabilize Russia's shrinking economy. ``If the budget isn't
approved, we will not stay on our posts,'' Primakov said. Primakov
then told parliament's lower house, the State Duma, that a lean
budget was essential for getting new loans from the International
Monetary Fund and other lenders. Russia badly needs the aid to help
pay off its huge debts. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Leading Japanese financial institutions caught in a
scandal involving almost dlrs 100 million in payoffs to a
self-confessed corporate racketeer also funneled almost millions to
dozens of other gangsters, news reports said Thursday. Five
companies _ Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. and brokerages Nomura
Securities Co., Daiwa Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co. and the
now-defunct Yamaichi Securities Co. _ paid a total of 1.1 billion
yen (dlrs 9.5 million) to 35 other ``sokaiya'' racketeers, national
broadcaster NHK said, quoting the Tokyo Regional Tax Office.
Japan's sokaiya buy shares in companies and solicit cash payments
by threatening to disrupt or make embarassing revelations at
shareholder meetings. The practice has been rife in Japan for
decades, but it is only recently that authorities have cracked
down. (JAPAN-RACKETEERS)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A Cambodian investigator into the
illegal importation of 3,000 tons of mercury-tainted waste from
Taiwan said Thursday that it is still unclear who authorized the
shipment. A local newspaper reported that a second dump of
thousands of tons of waste had been found near the port of
Sihanoukville. The waste, resembling videotape, was packed in bags
with Korean writing. Pol Lim, deputy chairman of the committee
assigned to investigate the waste from Taiwanese giant Formosa
Plastics Corp., said the probe is proceeding slowly because import
papers do not show who approved the shipment. The waste has been
blamed for five deaths. The appearance of foreign waste near
Cambodia's only major seaport underscores the long-standing problem
of developed nations, which tend to have stronger environmental
laws, using poor countries as dumps. (CAMBODIA-GARBAGE RIOT)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Chase Manhattan Bank and J.P. Morgan and Co.
readily joined the Nazis in the plunder of millions of dollars in
Jewish assets during World War II, a lawsuit has alleged. The
class-action suit filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn against those banks and seven French banks accuses them of
seizing accounts and safe deposit boxes from Jewish customers, then
keeping the assets after the war. Chase Manhattan and J.P. Morgan
became the first U.S. institutions to be named in the dozen
lawsuits still pending on behalf of Holocaust victims who were
exploited or who lost assets during the Nazi era. Chase Manhattan
``collaborated with the German authorities and displayed an
excessive zeal in its enforcement of anti-Jewish laws,'' the suit
alleged. A similar attitude by J.P. Morgan earned it the reputation
of an ``international Aryan organization,'' it adds. The suit does
not seek specific damages. But it accuses all the banks of being
involved in ``the systematic plunder'' of ``countless millions of
dollars.'' (US BANKS-NAZIS)

Rising actress stabs Qatari husband 30 times
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A rising Egyptian actress killed her Qatari
husband by stabbing him 30 times, accusing him of being cruel,
jealous and possessive, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Habiba Mohammed Saeed, 23, confessed to killing her husband
during a quarrel but claimed he tried to kill her first with a
knife, the Al-Gomhuria daily reported.
	   It did not say when the killing occurred or when Saeed was
arrested. She has been charged with premeditated murder, which
carries the death sentence.
	   Saeed told the police that after stabbing Atallah Jaafer
Mohammed, a 33-year-old Qatari businessman, she tied his hands and
legs with a telephone cord. She covered the body with a mattress
and ransacked the flat in a bid to make the police think that he
was killed during a robbery. She then fled.
	   The murder was discovered five days ago when neighbors notified
the police after smelling the odor of Mohammed's decomposing body,
the reports said.
	   Saeed told police that she married Mohammed six months ago and
discovered that he was jealous and wanted her to quit her job.
Saeed began her career as a theater artist, and has acted in some
television serials.
	   On the night of the murder, she said, she demanded an end to
their marriage, but Mohammed refused. In an ensuing quarrel,
Mohammed attacked her with a knife, she said, adding that she
managed to wrest it from his hands and began stabbing him
``unconsciously.''

Much-criticized Kenya police force pledges to improve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The much-criticized Kenya police has
pledged to improve its image as it turns 101.
	   ``We want to build a force that is friendly and accountable to
the public _ our employers,'' Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira
said in a New Year's statement issued Thursday.
	   ``Fighting crime can only succeed as a joint venture. Let us
face the new year 1999 with a single mind of fighting crime. Help
the police to help you.''
	   Wachira admitted 1998 has been a difficult one for the force
that celebrated its 100th anniversary this year.
	   Many off-duty officers have been implicated in robberies, either
through renting their service weapons to gangs or direct
participation.
	   Motorists complain of constant demands for bribes by police,
particularly at the end of the month.
	   Wachira said police officers who have engaged in unprofessional
activities have been dealt with according to the law, but there has
been no information on wide-ranging arrests or disciplinary action
against offenders.
	   During an anniversary commemoration, Kenyan religious leaders
prayed that the police force stop being brutal and corrupt and
commit itself to service for all.
	   Two senior police officials have apologized for police excesses
over the years and asked the public to forgive the many atrocities
committed by police, ranging from harassment and demanding bribes
to torture and extra-judicial killings.
	   ``As we welcome the dawn of the second century of police service
in Kenya, we look forward to an atmosphere where there is a free
flow of information between the police and members of the public.
This will do away with the suspicions that exist between us,''
Wachira said.

Western-style Christmas making inroads in Orthodox, Muslim Eritrea
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ A Christmas tree decked with glowing
lights dominates a traffic island on Asmara's main thoroughfare.
Another adorns the central post office where electronic Christmas
jingles play throughout the day.
	   Christmas cards, colored lights, Italian pannettone, baked ham
for sale in shops and a day off from work on Friday _ all signs
that a western version of Christmas is making inroads in this
half-Muslim, half Orthodox Christian capital of 400,000 in the Horn
of Africa.
	   Eritrea's Orthodox Christians traditionally celebrate the birth
of Christ quietly at home on Jan. 7. The exchange of gifts is rare.
	   And Muslims began fasting last week for the holy month of
Ramadan.
	   Those driving the observance of western-style Christmas on Dec.
25 are minority Roman Catholics and Protestants _ and the many
Eritreans who have returned from years of exile in western nations.
	   ``I lived in Piscataway, New Jersey for 11 years, so I'm used to
celebrating on the 25th,'' said Luz Yosief, an Eritrean who now
works for the U.N. Development Program.
	   Eritrea, which became Africa's newest nation in 1993, lies along
the Red Sea. For centuries, it has been a crossroads between Arabia
and Africa, Christianity and Islam, and for 50 years, it was a
colony under Italian control.
	   But whether Christmas is observed Dec. 25 or Jan. 7, this season
it is overshadowed by fears of war.
	   Some 200,000 Eritrean soldiers and young men and women have been
mobilized for the past seven months since the outbreak of fighting
in May sparked by a border dispute with Ethiopia, Eritrea's larger
neighbor to the south.
	   Troops and conscripts remain dug in along the 1,000-kilometer
(620-mile) border, awaiting news of a negotiated settlement.
	   But so far, peace initiatives by the United States and the
Organization of African Unity have proved fruitless.
	   Another 44,000 Eritreans expelled from Ethiopia have dribbled
back to homes and relatives throughout the country. Nearly every
Eritrean in Asmara tells of a deported relative or friend staying
at his house.
	   Eritrea's relations with its other neighbor, Muslim-ruled Sudan,
are tense with occasional reports off cross-border shelling.
	   Eden Zekarias is simply hoping that the true meaning of
Christmas will triumph, whether on Friday or in two weeks.
	   ``We need peace more than celebrations,'' said the 24-year-old.

Italy's justice minister rejects Turkish request for jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's justice minister on Thursday rejected a
Turkish request to order back to jail a Kurdish guerrilla leader
who was widely reported to be on the verge of leaving Italy.
	   A spokesman for the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party said Abdullah
Ocalan was still staying at a villa on the outskirts of Rome, where
he took up residence about a week after he was detained on Nov. 12
at the capital's airport.
	   Ocalan, who showed up in Italy on a flight from Moscow, has been
looking for a safe place to go since Syria expelled him earlier
this year in response to heavy pressure from Turkey.
	   Italy's tolerance of Ocalan has angered the Turkish government
and sparked boycotts there of Italian products. Turkey wants Ocalan
back to try as a terrorist, but Italy has refused to extradite him
on grounds that Turkish courts could sentence him to death.
	   Private Italian TV network Canale 5 quoted an Ocalan spokesman
as saying the leader, who had requested asylum from Rome, had now
definitely decided to leave Italy. But apparently arrangements were
still going on to make sure any country where he would go would
grant him an entry visa.
	   Estonia, Ukraine, Libya and North Korea have been mentioned in
news reports as possible destinations.
	   Justice Minister Oliviero Diliberto, in a brief fax sent to an
Italian appeals court, recommended that Ocalan still be allowed to
come and go as he pleases.
	   Ocalan was arrested here on a since-dropped warrant from
Germany, which fears his presence in that country could inflame
millions of Turkish immigrants, including many Kurds.
	   On Wednesday, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema denied there were
any negotiations to find a country which would take Ocalan.
	   The Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been fighting since
1984 in southeastern Turkey for autonomy for Turkey's Kurds, a
sizeable minority.

Ushering in Christmas fete, Latin patriarch enters Bethlehem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led with color from evening festivities, midnight Mass

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ With a flourish of bagpipes and
drums, the white-robed Latin patriarch of Jerusalem entered
Bethlehem Thursday to usher in Christmas Eve festivities in the
town of Jesus' birth.
	   Patriarch Michel Sabbah, the top Roman Catholic clergyman in the
region, was to preside later at midnight Mass at the 4th-century
Church of the Nativity, built over the cavelike grotto that
tradition holds is Christ's birthplace.
	   Although the Palestinians gained self-rule in Bethlehem three
years ago, Israel still controls surrounding villages and roads
leading in and out of the city.
	   The patriarch's motorcade from nearby Jerusalem, trailed by
Christian pilgrims, cleared an Israeli military checkpoint, where
an Israeli delegation offered holiday greetings. Palestinian police
on horseback and Palestinian boy scouts then escorted the
procession into town.
	   Festivities in Bethlehem this year were somewhat subdued by a
drop-off in tourism and big pre-millennium renovation projects that
have turned the Palestinian town into an open-air construction
site.
	   Although the majority of Bethlehem's residents are Muslims, the
municipality decks out the streets with Christmas lights and puts
up Christmas trees, one of which was decorated last week by U.S.
President Bill Clinton and his family. Banners in English and
Arabic read ``Merry Christmas!''
	   Christmas in Bethlehem is also something of a state occasion;
plastic Palestinian flags flutter in streets and squares, and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and other dignitaries were to
formally welcome the patriarch.
	   Religious rites reflect a diversity of cultures and variety of
Christian sects. In Bethlehem, Christmas-eve services could be
found in English, French, Arabic and Aramaic, the ancient language
of Jesus.
	   In Bethlehem's Manger Square, Christmas eve draws large crowds
of Palestinian locals _ Christians and non-Christians alike _ as
well as foreign tourists. The scene resembles an open-air party,
with pop tunes blasting on loudspeakers and vendors loudly hawking
sweets and steaming ears of corn on the cob.
	   At midnight, the Mass is shown on large television screens for
what is always an overflow crowd outside in the square. On the
outskirts of Bethlehem, quieter observervances are staged at
Shepherd's Field, near the place where the Bible says herders first
learned of the birth of Jesus.
	   Many Palestinians hope that by next Christmas, they will be
marking the holiday in their own independent state. Arafat has said
he has the right to declare statehood in May even if terms have not
yet been negotiated with Israel.
	   Israel has indicated it would respond harshly to any such
declaration, perhaps by annexing parts of the West Bank. Israel has
demanded that Arafat renounce any intention to make a unilateral
claim of statehood, which the Palestinians have refused to do.

Ukraine orders free medicines to HIV, AIDS carriers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government has ordered the free
distribution of medicine to those infected with the HIV virus and
AIDS, a news report said Thursday.
	   In a resolution released Wednesday, the Cabinet also introduced
free medical examinations for people suspected of carrying HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The report did not specify which medicines would be distributed.
	   The number of people infected with HIV in Ukraine, a nation of
50 million people, has soared to 23,000 people, up from 18,500 in
mid-1997, according to government statistics. Eighty percent of the
infected were intravenous drug users.
	   The official figure is larger than in any other former Soviet
republic. Russia, with three times as many people, has reported
10,283 cases, though the actual figure is thought to be higher.
	   In its resolution, the Cabinet also ordered the Foreign Ministry
to make sure that foreign citizens staying in Ukraine for more than
three months have documents certifying they are not infected with
HIV.
	   Some 642 Ukrainians have contracted AIDS over the last decade,
and half of them have died, according to government data.

DaimlerChrysler reports sales up for 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Sales at the newly merged automobile
giant DaimlerChrysler AG were 260 billion marks (dlrs 158 billion)
in 1998, a company spokesman said Thursday.
	   That is about 13 percent higher than combined 1997 of
Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp., which were around 229.3 billion
marks.
	   On Sunday, DaimlerChrysler will release sales figures that
should reveal a ``qualitative trend'' for 1998, the spokesman said.
Further earnings details will be published at the Detroit Auto Show
during the first week of January.
	   Analysts expect DaimlerChrysler to post a net profit of between
10 billion and 11 billion marks (dlrs 6 billion to dlrs 6.7
billion) in 1998, after a combined 8.04 billion by the two separate
companies in 1997.
	   According to the German financial news agency VWD, which
obtained an advance copy of the Sunday release, DaimlerChrysler
said its total unit sales in 1998 were around 4.4 million cars, of
which its Mercedes-Benz and Smart models numbered 850,000.
	   Around 3 million of the total were Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth and
Jeep models, while the company sold about 480,000 commercial
vehicles.
	   Chairmen Juergen Schrempp and Robert Eaton said in that release
that they expect ``the first substantial positive effects of the
merger in 1999,'' VWD reported.
	   ``The integration teams are on the right track,'' they said.
	   The company's total number of employees rose in 1998 by 13,000
to 434,000, with more than half working in Germany, and one third
in the United States.

Kinshasa lifts curfew for Christmas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Government authorities have lifted a
five-month-old dusk-to-dawn curfew in Kinshasa for Christmas, a
senior official said Thursday.
	   ``There was rejoicing when the announcement was made,'' Cabinet
Director Abdoulaye Yerodia told reporters.
	   Military authorities ordered the curfew in August, when an army
of rebel fighters was approaching the outskirts of Congo's capital
and was threatening to topple President Laurent Kabila's
government.
	   The rebels have since been pushed back to eastern Congo, but the
curfew in Kinshasa has remained as a precaution infiltration.
	   The curfew was lifted specifically to allow Kinshasa's
influential Christian community to attend late night Christmas mass
celebrations on Thursday night and Friday.
	   There was no indication whether the curfew's suspension would
extend beyond Christmas.
	   The move came with a word of caution from Yerodia, who said the
city must keep a watchful eye out for suspicious activities.
	   ``I urge our compatriots to be extra vigilant so that the
festivities can go on, but with prudence and vigilance,'' he said.
	   Former government troops and their ethnic Tutsi allies staged a
massive revolt in early August and have since been waging a rebel
war against Kabila, whom they accuse of corruption, abuse of power
and nepotism.

Ethnic Albanians claim Serb forces launch attack on stronghold

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery launched a strong attack Thursday on a rebel stronghold,
setting fire to houses and killing at least one person, ethnic
Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military were targeting
six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital Pristina, and had sealed off all roads leading
to the area.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed that international observers
had reported shelling and machine-gun fire in the area.
	   Grunnet said a convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including
several Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases in
Pristina and Podujevo early today. They converged just west of
Podujevo.
	   He said the OSCE, which is trying to verify the October
cease-fire accord, had no reports of casualties or further details.
Grunnet said Yugoslav authorities described the attack as a
``limited search operation'' for suspects in Monday's killing of a
Serb policeman in the area.
	   Nevertheless, the operation marks a significant setback to the
already shaky cease-fire agreement that ended the worst of the
fighting. On Wednesday, State Department spokesman James Rubin
warned of the increasing violence.
	   ``A large-scale crackdown against the civilian population of
Kosovo would do nothing to improve the security situation and could
spark a cycle of violence that would seriously undermine the cease
fire agreement,'' Rubin said in Washington.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian report, Serb tanks had entered
one of the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The report said at least one ethnic Albanian villager was killed
and several houses were set ablaze. A later report by the ethnic
Albanian center said Serb snipers had taken position at ``strategic
points'' in the area and were firing at civilians, who were fleeing
deeper into rebel territory.
	   There was no comment from Serb sources.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Mustafa urged foreign governments and the international monitors
sent to Kosovo to verify a two-month-old cease-fire to intervene
with Yugoslav authorities to halt the attacks.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides against
launching more attacks. The alliance's supreme commander for
Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly aggressive
Serb military and police activities.''
	   Speaking in neighboring Macedonia, he said NATO is watching
closely to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic keeps
his promises under the October agreement reached with U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke to halt the bloodshed.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed those concerns,
saying in Brussels, Belgium, that the escalating violence and
killings ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   The continuing violence threatens to revive the war that raged
between secessionist ethnic Albanians and Serb security forces from
February to October. During that time 1,000 people were killed and
300,000 lost their homes.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities did not conform to
Milosevic's pledges in the Oct. 12 agreement. He reiterated that
Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade have been told
they ``must comply with their promises made to NATO.''
	   Clark spoke on a visit to the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction
force, deployed in Macedonia in case international monitors in
Kosovo are threatened.
	   But in a sign of continuing defiance, the main board of
Milosevic's Socialist Party met Wednesday and said it supports
Serbian forces' continuing efforts and ``destruction of the
terrorist gangs.''

Union, government sign agreement on pension rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The government and the Solidarity trade
union on Thursday signed an agreement promising to preserve early
retirement privileges for miners, who suspended an underground
protest a day earlier.
	   ``We suspended our protest for humanitarian reasons,'' said
Solidarity mining leader Andrzej Kaczkowski in reference to the
observance of Christmas, one of the holiest holidays in
predominantly Catholic Poland.
	   Under the agreement, the government promised to keep the early
retirement rule that allows miners and others employed in dangerous
conditions to retire, with full pension, after 25 years of work, no
matter their age.
	   The deal was signed by Solidarity leader Marian Krzaklewski and
Labor Minister Longin Komolowski in the presence of Prime Minister
Jerzy Buzek. A special bill including the early retirement rule is
to be adopted by parliament within six months.
	   It signified a victory for miners who protested changes in the
pension system that set the retirement age at 65 for men and 60 for
women to get a full pension. Some 50 mines of the southern
industrial region of Silesia took part in the underground protest
that began Dec. 10.
	   Kaczkowski, however, said union leaders would meet after
Christmas to decide if they should continue the protest then.
Miners voted Monday for a general strike at an unspecified date to
defend their early retirement privileges.
	   ``If the agreement is not satisfying, then nothing can be
excluded,'' Kaczkowski said.
	   The Solidarity-led government is working on restructuring the
bloated mining industry as part of Poland's shift from communism to
a market economy. The plan calls for reducing production from 137
million tons last year to 110 million tons in 2002, as well as
cutting jobs by more than 40 percent _ from 245,000 now to 138,000
in three years.

Jordan approves Viagra as unions call for U.S. drug boycott
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan has approved the sale of the
anti-impotence drug, Viagra, an official said Thursday, a day after
two unions of pharmacists and doctors called for a boycott of U.S.
and British drugs to protest airstrikes on Iraq.
	   A Health Ministry official said the ministry has registered
Viagra, produced by New York-based Pfizer, as a scheduled drug.
	   However, the actual sale will be delayed until the ministry
receives further documentation from Pfizer on the side-effects of
Viagra. This is considered a formality.
	   The drug should be available within eight weeks, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   After initial hesitation, three other Arab countries _ Bahrain,
Kuwait and the United Arab _ approved the sale of Viagra this year.
	   On Wednesday, the Jordanian Pharmacists Association and the
Jordan Medical Association called for a boycott of pharmaceutical
products from the United States and Britain.
	   The boycott is not legally binding and exempts those drugs for
which no substitute is available.
	   Because Viagra is unique, it will be exempt from the boycott,
Abdul Rahim Issa, the chairman of the Jordanian Pharmacists
Association, told The Associated Press.
	   Viagra has been much talked about in Jordan and quantities of
the little blue tablets have already been smuggled into the kingdom
and sold on the black market at high prices.
	   Mohammad Sabbagh, the managing director of Pfizer's local agent,
Sabbagh Drug Company, said Viagra will be sold only on medical
prescription for 36 Jordanian dinars (dlrs 51) for a pack of four
pills, which is similar to the international price.

Western-style Christmas making inroads in Orthodox, Muslim Eritrea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JULIA STEWART &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ A Christmas tree decked with glowing
lights dominates a traffic island on the main thoroughfare of
Eritrea's capital. Another adorns the central post office where
electronic Christmas jingles play throughout the day.
	   Christmas cards, colored lights, Italian panettone, baked ham
for sale in shops and a day off from work on Friday _ all signs
that a western version of Christmas is making inroads in this
half-Muslim, half-Orthodox Christian capital of 400,000 in the Horn
of Africa.
	   Eritrea's Orthodox Christians traditionally celebrate the birth
of Christ quietly at home on Jan. 7. The exchange of gifts is rare.
	   And Muslims began fasting last week for the holy month of
Ramadan.
	   Those driving the observance of western-style Christmas on Dec.
25 are minority Roman Catholics and Protestants _ and the many
Eritreans who have returned from years of exile in western nations.
	   ``I lived in Piscataway, New Jersey, for 11 years, so I'm used
to celebrating on the 25th,'' said Luz Yosief, an Eritrean who now
works for the U.N. Development Program.
	   Eritrea, which became Africa's newest nation in 1993, lies along
the Red Sea. For centuries, it has been a crossroads between Arabia
and Africa, Christianity and Islam, and for 50 years, it was a
colony under Italian control.
	   But whether Christmas is observed in December or January, this
season it is overshadowed by fears of war.
	   Some 200,000 Eritrean soldiers and young men and women have been
mobilized for the past seven months since the outbreak of fighting
in May sparked by a border dispute with Ethiopia, Eritrea's larger
neighbor to the south.
	   Troops and conscripts remain dug in along the 1,000-kilometer
(620-mile) border, awaiting news of a negotiated settlement.
	   But so far, peace initiatives by the United States and the
Organization of African Unity have proved fruitless.
	   Another 44,000 Eritreans expelled from Ethiopia have dribbled
back to homes and relatives throughout the country. Nearly every
Eritrean in Asmara tells of a deported relative or friend staying
at his house.
	   Eritrea's relations with its other neighbor, Muslim-ruled Sudan,
are tense with occasional reports off cross-border shelling.
	   Eden Zekarias is simply hoping that the true meaning of
Christmas will triumph, whether on Friday or in two weeks.
	   ``We need peace more than celebrations,'' said the 24-year-old.

Newspaper offers first glimpse of new Russian jet fighter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A newspaper published the first photos of Russia's
most advanced fighter jet, but reported Wednesday that the country
can't afford to mass produce the plane any time soon.
	   Almost everything about the MFI _ the Russian acronym for the
Multi-Functional Fighter _ has been kept under wraps since
development began in late 1980s.
	   But Nezavisimaya Gazeta published a front-page photo Thursday of
the MFI, known as ``Project 1.42'' in the West.
	   The newspaper claimed the MFI can match the most advanced U.S.
fighter, the F-22 Raptor, and has a ``thrust vectoring'' system
that allows the plane to make sharper turns than current fighters.
	   The single-seat, twin-engined MFI is designed to fly faster than
Mach 2, and can be equipped with custom-designed air-to-air and
air-to-ground missiles.
	   Like its U.S. counterpart, the new aircraft has stealth
capabilities, relying on composite materials and a special shape to
avoid detection by enemy radars.
	   But unlike the F-22, which made its maiden flight last year, the
Russian fighter has yet to fly. The plane's development has been
slowed by severe funding shortages.
	   ``The MFI's faces a difficult future,'' the newspaper said.
``The current economic situation won't allow its production in the
foreseeable future since one plane is expected to cost around dlrs
70 million.''
	   The Russian air force doesn't have enough money to maintain its
current fleet or properly train pilots.
	   Without citing sources, the newspaper claimed that China has
offered to help finance development, but only if it can buy the
aircraft and maybe even the technology.
	   Russian leaders recently raised the prospect of a strategic
partnership including Russia, China and India to counter perceived
U.S. domination in global affairs.
	   China has evolved into a key customer for the Russia's ailing
weapons industries, purchasing combat jets, missiles and navy
ships.

Russian, Kurdish leaders: Ocalan not expected in Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Kurdish rebel chief Abdullah Ocalan is not in
Russia and is not expected in the country any time soon, Russian
officials and sources close to rebel leader said Thursday.
	   ``Abdullah Ocalan is not and will not be on the territory of the
Russian Federation,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin
was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   Rakhmanin was responding to Russian television reports that said
Ocalan, who left Moscow for Rome on Nov. 12, had returned to Russia
seeking asylum again.
	   His November plea for asylum was backed by the Communist-led
Russian parliament, but Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov rejected
the bid.
	   Ocalan has been looking for a place to live since he was
expelled from Syria in response to heavy pressure from Turkey.
Turkey wants to try him as a terrorist.
	   Italy has refused extradition, because Ocalan would face the
death penalty in Turkey. But Italy also has been reluctant to grant
him asylum.
	   Merabi Shamoyev, head of Russia's Kurdish Union, said Kurds
would not try again in the near future to arrange for Ocalan to
come to Russia after the Russian government refused to grant him
political asylum.
	   And officials at Russia's Federal Security Service, a successor
to the KGB, bristled at suggestions that they were working with
Italian secret services to smuggle Ocalan to Russia, news reports
said.
	   ``We categorically refuse to comment on such assertions,''
Federal Security Service spokesman Alexander Zdanovich said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Ocalan's Kurdish Workers' Party has been waging a 14-year war
for autonomy in southeast Turkey. Close to 37,000 people have been
killed during the fighting.

FA Chairman claims he's victim of a plot to remove him
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Under fire English soccer chief Keith Wiseman hit
back Thursday in the Football Association's cash for votes bribery
scandal by claiming he is the victim of a plot to remove him from
office.
	   The FA chairman became embroiled in controversy when it revealed
that he and chief executive Graham Kelly made an unsanctioned 3.2
million pound (dlrs 5 million) grant to the Welsh Football
Association.
	   Kelly and Wiseman promised the money without telling the rest of
the English FA's executive committee and the payment has been
interpreted as a bribe to gain a Welsh vote in Wiseman's favor in
an election for a FIFA post.
	   Kelly resigned Tuesday but Wiseman refused to tender his
resignation despite a unanimous vote of no confidence against him
by his committee.
	   Instead he called for the full 91-member FA Council meeting to
decide the issue Jan. 4.
	   Wiseman has continued to dispute the grant was made in return
for a Welsh vote in his plan to become Britain's FIFA
vice-president.
	   ``I regard it as simply mutually beneficial arrangements,''
Wiseman was quoted saying Thursday.
	   ``There are people, members of the FA council I am quite
certain, who would like to take advantage of the crisis for their
own ends,'' he said.
	   ``There are those who feel it is a time when the whole question
over who has control and power over what within football should be
reviewed _ and that's a mild way of putting it.''
	   Kelly has also insisted the payment was not a bribe and was in
keeping with the F.A.'s policy of helping cash-strapped soccer
federations.
	   ``With hindsight it would have been better to come up front
(with the executive committee) much more quickly than we did,'' he
said. ``That was not a deliberate act and it was something which
didn't get done in the heat of the moment.''

University staff end strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Some 1,500 teachers and 3,000 administrative
workers at a Yemeni university ended a strike after authorities
agreed to give them a 50 percent salary hike, the weekly al-Sahwa
reported Thursday.
	   The San`a University employees in the capital San`a and its
several campuses across the country returned to work on Wednesday
after President Ali Abdullah Saleh asked officials to accept the
strikers' demand for a raise, the Arabic-language paper said.
	   Since the strike began on Dec. 8, some 70,000 students had been
left without classes.
	   The government had agreed to a 50 percent raise after a strike
in June also, but the university employees said the promise was
never fulfilled.
	   University teachers earn between dlrs 300 and dlrs 500 a month
in Yemen.
	   A special government committee had promised a monthly salary
raise of about 170,000 riyals (dlrs 128) in 1995, but that too
never came through.

Yeltsin discourages early campaigning by potential successors

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with additional Yeltsin comments, ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin, who bristles at the notion of being
labeled a lame duck, scolded his potential successors Thursday for
acting as if they were already president.
	   ``There is still a year-and-a-half until the presidential
election, and we already have people who think they are the
president,'' Yeltsin was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies.
``This is unpleasant and it won't help them at the polls.''
	   The next presidential election is set for the middle of 2000,
but Yeltsin's health problems have spurred some politicians to
launch informal campaigns in case he leaves office early.
	   The president did not mention any names, but appeared to be
referring to Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, who recently launched his
own political movement and has been speaking out on national issues
such as economic policy and Russia's foreign relations.
	   Luzhkov has been an ally of Yeltsin for years, but recently the
mayor has been critical of the president.
	   Yeltsin, 67, says he has no serious illnesses and will serve out
his full term. He has been unable to work full-time for months,
though he has been more active since recovering from a bout of
pneumonia earlier this month.
	   The president said there were some candidates he would not like
to see in high office.
	   ``For this reason we shall use the strengths of our official
positions in order to influence the process in a way that would
make the new president worthy of Russia,'' Yeltsin was quoted as
saying by Russian news agencies.
	   Other leading presidential contenders are Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov, Siberian governor Alexander Lebed and liberal
politician Grigory Yavlinsky.
	   Yeltsin met in the Kremlin with the heads of Russia's leading
television channels and told them he would protect press freedoms.
	   ``I am the guarantor of the constitution and it states clearly :
freedom of expression and the media,'' Yeltsin said. ``For this
reason you may keep thinking that you are protected by the
president.''

Ushering in Christmas fete, Latin patriarch enters Bethlehem

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ With a flourish of bagpipes and
drums, the white-robed Latin patriarch of Jerusalem entered
Bethlehem on Thursday to usher in Christmas Eve festivities in the
town of Jesus' birth.
	   Patriarch Michel Sabbah, the top Roman Catholic clergyman in the
region, was to preside later at midnight Mass at the 4th-century
Church of the Nativity, built over the cavelike grotto that
tradition holds is Christ's birthplace.
	   Although the Palestinians gained self-rule in Bethlehem three
years ago, Israel still controls surrounding villages and roads
leading in and out of the city.
	   The patriarch's motorcade from nearby Jerusalem, trailed by
Christian pilgrims, cleared an Israeli military checkpoint, where
an Israeli delegation offered holiday greetings. Palestinian police
on horseback and Palestinian boy scouts then escorted the
procession into town.
	   Festivities in Bethlehem this year were somewhat subdued by a
drop-off in tourism and big pre-millennium renovation projects that
have turned the Palestinian town into an open-air construction
site.
	   Although the majority of Bethlehem's residents are Muslims, the
municipality decks out the streets with Christmas lights and puts
up Christmas trees, one of which was decorated last week by U.S.
President Bill Clinton and his family. Banners in English and
Arabic read ``Merry Christmas!''
	   Christmas in Bethlehem is also something of a state occasion;
plastic Palestinian flags flutter in streets and squares, and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and other dignitaries were to
formally welcome the patriarch.
	   Religious rites reflect a diversity of cultures and variety of
Christian sects. In Bethlehem, Christmas-eve services could be
found in English, French, Arabic and Aramaic, the ancient language
of Jesus.
	   In Bethlehem's Manger Square, Christmas eve draws large crowds
of Palestinian locals _ Christians and non-Christians alike _ as
well as foreign tourists. The scene resembles an open-air party,
with pop tunes blasting on loudspeakers and vendors loudly hawking
sweets and steaming ears of corn on the cob.
	   At midnight, the Mass is shown on large television screens for
what is always an overflow crowd outside in the square. On the
outskirts of Bethlehem, quieter observances are staged at
Shepherd's Field, near the place where the Bible says herders first
learned of the birth of Jesus.
	   Many Palestinians hope that by next Christmas, they will be
marking the holiday in their own independent state. Arafat has said
he has the right to declare statehood in May even if terms have not
yet been negotiated with Israel.
	   Israel has indicated it would respond harshly to any such
declaration, perhaps by annexing parts of the West Bank. Israel has
demanded that Arafat renounce any intention to make a unilateral
claim of statehood, which the Palestinians have refused to do.

Schroeder, pledging discipline, says German coalition safe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his Greens
party allies insisted Thursday that a feud over scrapping nuclear
power won't break up their 2-month-old government.
	   After Schroeder met his Green environment minister, Juergen
Trittin, on Wednesday to clear up the first big coalition crisis,
both were quoted as saying they would seek a common stand.
	   ``But my task also is to ensure discipline in this government,
and that's exactly what I will do,'' Schroeder told Bild, Germany's
most-read daily.
	   Schroeder publicly rebuked Trittin this week for firing two
advisory bodies on nuclear safety without clearing it with him. He
said the move jeopardized talks with utility firms on a timetable
for closing Germany's 19 nuclear plants.
	   Aiming at the Greens, his junior partner, Schroeder warned that
anyone who questioned the need for a consensus with the industry
was endangering the coalition.
	   Trittin, meanwhile, backed off. ``There is no reason to assume
that anyone wants to bolt from this coalition,'' he was quoted
Thursday as telling the newsweekly Der Spiegel.
	   Both he and Schroeder, a Social Democrat, remain committed to an
``irreversible exit'' from nuclear power, he said. But he
criticized the power industry as ``over-sensitive.''
	   ``Christmas peace is not in danger,'' Schroeder told Focus
magazine.
	   Still, other Greens leaders challenged Schroeder's authority,
illustrating the fractiousness of Germany's first national
government including the Greens.
	   Party co-chairwoman Antje Radcke backed Trittin's move, saying
not every government decision had to cross Schroeder's desk.
	   ``The coalition partners have a communication problem in
general,'' she was quoted as saying in the Stuttgarter Nachrichten
daily.
	   The center-left coalition is to meet Jan. 13 to set a common
strategy for talks with the nuclear industry, which begin Jan. 26.
	   If a voluntary timetable for shutting down nuclear power plants
is not agreed to within a year, the government has pledged to
legislate one.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery launched a strong attack Thursday on a rebel stronghold,
setting fire to houses and killing at least one person, ethnic
Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military were targeting
six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital Pristina, and had sealed off all roads leading
to the area.
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels were resisting the
attack and a ``fierce battle'' was underway.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed that international observers
had reported shelling and machine-gun fire in the area but had no
details about the extent of any fighting.

Priest in Sardinia shot to death on way to Mass
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NUORO, Sardinia (AP) _ A gunman pumped a round of bullets into
the chest of a parish priest Thursday as he went to celebrate Mass
in a small town, killing the man who previously was a local
politician, investigators said.
	   The Rev. Graziano Muntoni, 57, was shot to death in a tiny alley
in Orgosolo, about 6:40 a.m. as he walked to the local Roman
Catholic church for the first service of the day, Italian news
reports said.
	   A report on RAI, the Italian state TV, from Orgosolo, which is
about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the inland city of Nuro,
said Muntoni became a priest late in life, in 1990, after years of
being a Christian Democrat politician.
	   It quoted investigators as saying the priest might have been
made to pay for his campaign against crime, including kidnappings,
which are masterminded by gangs of Sardinian bandits.
	   ``He was a holy priest who loved the people of Orgosolo,'' said
the town's pastor, the Rev. Pietro Meloni, telling reporters he
could not give a motive.

Anti-Basque separatist 'dirty war' convicts leave prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spain's former interior minister and his
deputy left prison Thursday, five months after receiving 10-year
jail terms for their role in a ``dirty war'' against Basque
separatists.
	   A day after being partially pardoned, ex-minister Jose
Barrionuevo and his former chief of state security Rafael Vera were
hailed by dozens of relatives and supporters outside the prison.
	   ``We don't feel bitterness, but that does not mean we forget
what has happened,'' Barrionuevo said in a short statement read
outside the prison at Guadalajara, 50 kilometers (30 miles)
northeast of Madrid. His reading was interrupted by chants of
``Innocent!'' from the crowd.
	   Barrionuevo and Vera were convicted in July of orchestrating the
1983 kidnapping of a Basque businessman who was mistaken for a
hitman of the armed separatist group ETA.
	   The 1983 abduction was the first violation attributed to the
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, that killed 27 people
over the next five years in its anti-ETA campaign. Many GAL victims
were mistaken targets.
	   The conservative government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar
on Wednesday followed a recommendation from the Supreme Court of
Justice and granted the two former officials a partial pardon that
reduced their sentences by two-thirds.
	   After the pardon, prison authorities announced a loosening of
their detention that began with permits to spend Christmas at home.
The two convicts began serving their 10-year jail terms in
September.
	   In his statement Barrionuevo thanked his supporters and the
Socialist party for standing by both him and Vera, and hailed what
he called the ``generosity and civic courage'' of the Supreme Court
for recommending the pardon.
	   He also thanked the government for ratifying the court's
argument in favor of a partial pardon on the grounds that the
kidnapping took place 15 years ago, and that those convicted had
not been seeking personal benefit.
	   But Barrionuevo also announced future action aimed at achieving
more freedom. ``We will fight for the recognition of our
innocence,'' he said.
	   Revelations about the GAL in the early 1990s contributed to the
1996 electoral defeat of Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
after nearly 14 years in office.
	   Gonzalez has long denied that Barrionuevo, Vera, or any of his
governments had anything to do with the GAL.
	   The partial pardon also affects eight other government and
security officials also convicted for the 1983 kidnapping, and
sentenced to between two and ten years in jail.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain. It has
been observing a unilateral cease-fire since Sept. 18, and there
are moves afoot for negotiations to resolve the conflict.

Official: Russia carried out five sub-critical nuclear tests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia conducted five sub-critical nuclear tests
at an Arctic testing range from September until this month, a top
official said Thursday, contradicting Russia's previous denials.
	   Such tests are not prohibited by the international Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty because the amount of radioactive plutonium used is
not enough to create a nuclear explosion. But critics warn that
carrying out even limited tests could encourage other countries to
conduct full-scale nuclear tests.
	   Deputy Nuclear Energy Minister Lev Ryabev said the tests on the
Arctic archipelago of Novaya Zemlya were conducted between Sept. 14
and Dec. 13, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Weapons-grade plutonium and enriched uranium were used during
the tests, but ``there was no discharge of nuclear energy,'' Ryabev
was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   Western news reports and environmentalists claimed in September
that Russia was preparing a sub-critical nuclear test on Novaya
Zemlya.
	   But Moscow denied the reports in October, after they had already
begun, according to Ryabev.
	   Gen. Igor Volynkin, who heads a Defense Ministry department
overseeing nuclear weapons, said at that time there were no plans
for nuclear tests at the Novaya Zemlya range and that Russia only
carries out ``various physical modeling experiments'' that do not
qualify as nuclear tests.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A trio of balloonists soared over the Pacific
Ocean on Thursday at high speed, bound for North America in their
attempt at the first nonstop balloon voyage around the world.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden caught the jetstream after

the Pacific, said ground crew director Mike Kendrick.

developing over the ocean Pacific. ``We are a bit nervous,'' he
said.
	   ``We're not panicking yet,'' he told Sky TV, explaining that a
trough of high pressure was about 2,000 miles (3,000) from the
balloonists.
	   ``If we can average about 125 knots (145 mph, 230 kph) over the
next 12 hours, or maybe 24 hours, we should be okay,'' he said.
	   Kendrick has described the Pacific leg of the journey as the
most hazardous, saying the frequency of shipping is not very high,
so that if the balloonists had to ditch their craft the rescue
would be more difficult.
	   He said ground crew were tracking the position of all ships that
would be under the balloon in the Pacific.
	   ``If we fall out of the jetstream into this trough over the
Pacific then there is only one way, and that is back to Hawaii and
they are going to go for a swim,'' Kendrick told Sky TV later.
	   He said the crew had been told to ascend to 30,000 feet (9,000
meters) to try to pick up the speed needed to avoid this.
	   ``The situation is that the higher you go, the more fuel is
used. So usually you trade speed for fuel,'' he said. ``At the
moment I am not interested in fuel. I need speed because we want to
try and keep them dry.''
	   ``We are not that concerned at the moment, but we are just
driving it very hard,'' Kendrick said. ``It is a very dangerous
place and we are not taking any chances.''
	   The ground crew said that the 272-foot-high (83-meter-high)
balloon might cross into North America at Washington State or
southern Canada,
	   Ground crew said the craft is flying at 27,000 to 30,000 feet
(8,000 to 9,000 meters) as jumbo jets do, and could be visible from
the ground if the weather is clear. They said it was hoped the
balloon would reach North America on Christmas Day, most likely in
the evening.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, and cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   The halfway point on the voyage, which began in Morocco on Dec.
18, is in the Pacific Ocean. The trip is expected to last from
eight days to nearly three weeks and finish in Western Europe at
the end of a 24,000-mile (38,000 kms) flight.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.

Italy's justice minister rejects Turkish request for jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Ocalan's lawyer in Germany saying solution to be
found by Friday if not sooner, talks still under way; ADDS Turkish
justice minister reax &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's justice minister on Thursday rejected a
Turkish request to order back to jail a Kurdish guerrilla leader
who was widely reported to be on the verge of leaving Italy.
	   A spokesman for the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party said Abdullah
Ocalan was still staying at a villa on the outskirts of Rome, where
he took up residence about a week after he was detained on Nov. 12
at the capital's airport.
	   And in Berlin, Ocalan's German lawyer, Britta Boehler, told
Berlin Aktuell Radio that the situation, while now ``quite
unclear,'' would be cleared up either later Thursday or Friday.
Ocalan's other lawyers and advisers were talking intensively with
the Italian government to find a solution, she said.
	   Boehler declined to say which country might take him.
	   Ocalan, who showed up in Italy on a flight from Moscow, has been
looking for a safe place to go since Syria expelled him earlier
this year in response to heavy pressure from Turkey.
	   Italy's tolerance of Ocalan has angered the Turkish government
and sparked boycotts there of Italian products. Turkey wants Ocalan
back to try as a terrorist, but Italy has refused to extradite him
on grounds that Turkish courts could sentence him to death.
	   Private Italian TV network Canale 5 quoted an Ocalan spokesman
as saying the leader, who had requested asylum from Rome, had now
definitely decided to leave Italy.
	   Estonia, Ukraine, Libya and North Korea had been mentioned in
news reports as possible destinations.
	   Rejecting a motion filed by a lawyer for Turkey, Justice
Minister Oliviero Diliberto, in a brief fax sent to an Italian
appeals court, recommended that Ocalan still be allowed to come and
go as he pleases.
	   Ocalan was arrested here on a since-dropped warrant from
Germany, which fears his presence in that country could inflame
millions of Turkish immigrants, including many Kurds.
	   In Ankara, Turkish Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu on Thursday
said Italy was ``massacring justice'' by trying to send Ocalan away
even before considering a Turkish request for his extradition.
	   ``All the principles of justice have been violated since Ocalan
arrived in Italy,'' Denizkurdu said, vowing that Turkey will
``follow him where wherever he goes. Turkey's extradition request
remains in place.''
	   On Wednesday, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema denied there were
any negotiations to find a country which would take Ocalan.
	   The Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been fighting since
1984 in southeastern Turkey for autonomy for Turkey's Kurds, a
sizeable minority.

Newspapers suspend publication to mourn colleague's death
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (AP) _ Editors from Burkina Faso's
three independent daily newspapers suspended publication Thursday
to mourn and protest the death of a prominent colleague.
	   The state-controlled daily ``Sidwaya'' in the capital
Ouagadougou was printed, despite a call by the country's
journalists union to halt publication for a day to mark the death
of Norbert Zongo.
	   Zongo, an outspoken government critic and independent
newspaperman, was found dead Dec. 13 in his burned-out car. The
charred remains of two cousins and his driver were also found in
the car.
	   The Burkina Faso Journalists Association has called for an
independent investigation by foreign observers into Norbert's
suspicious death.
	   Only the inside of Zongo's car was burned, while the exterior
was undamaged, raising suspicions that he and the others were the
target of an attack.
	   The French-based Reporters without Borders has questioned the
circumstances of Zongo's death.
	   News of his death triggered several days of mass protests in
Burkina Faso, including a series of clashes between mourners and
police.

Authorities bust largest marijuana haul at Greek border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonian customs officials detected
the largest known single haul of marijuana at the country's border
with Greece, media reported Thursday.
	   Over one ton of the narcotic substance, packed in specially
designed small boxes, was discovered late Wednesday in a secret
compartment under the trailer of a truck with Macedonian plates
arriving from Greece.
	   The bust is reportedly the largest single quantity of marijuana
ever confiscated while being smuggled into Macedonia.
	   The street value of one gram of marijuana is priced around dlrs
3 in Macedonia, bringing the estimated total of the haul's worth to
dlrs 1.5 million.
	   The truck driver was immediately arrested but his identity has
not been revealed, Macedonian state radio reported.
	   Macedonian police announced that Prime Minister Ljubco
Georgievski will hold a press conference later Thursday at the
border crossing where the bust was made.

Angolan rebels launch nighttime attack on central highland city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ In the wake of a U.N. call to peace, UNITA
rebels launched an intensive attack on a central highland city
early Thursday.
	   Rebel forces lobbed artillery shells through the night into
Kuito, some 500 kilometers (310 miles) southeast of the capital
Luanda, the private Radio Eclesia reported.
	   A local state television employee, who was not identified, was
wounded in the attack that began at midnight and lasted until 10
a.m. (0900GMT), the radio said.
	   It was not clear whether the government's Army Chief of Staff
Gen. Joao de Matos, who flew into Kuito Wednesday, was still in the
city.
	   When the attack died down Kuito's 100,000 population _ swollen
by a further third from people fleeing battles in the surrounding
rural highlands _ emerged to stock up on provisions and water,
Radio Eclesia reported.
	   There were no reports Thursday of clashes in the neighboring
Huambo province.
	   Huambo has been the other main focus of the fighting that flared
up earlier this month undermining a peace agreement between the
government and UNITA brokered by the United Nations in 1994.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday blamed UNITA for quashing
the 1994 accord, and demanded an end to the clashes that have
brought months of simmering hostility to the surface.
	   A UNITA spokesman in Lisbon on Thursday accused the U.N. of bias
for failing to denounce government violations of the peace
agreement.
	   ``When the government shelled Andulo and Bailundo, the Security
Council said nothing,'' Carlos Morgado said by phone, referring to
an army attack three weeks ago on UNITA's two central highland
strongholds.
	   Once the rebels, equipped with unforeseen fire power, had
repelled the army from Andulo and Bailundo, they launched a broader
offensive throughout the central highlands.
	   The government has also criticized the U.N. for failing to
guarantee UNITA's compliance with the 1994 agreement that was the
latest of several attempts to seal an end to the civil war that
broke out immediately after independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   The pact required UNITA to disband a 70,000-strong guerrilla
army, and hand over control of almost half the country to the
government.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ is estimated to have about 30,000 guerrilla soldiers hidden in
the vast southwest African nation's bush, compared with the
government's 100,000-strong army.

Ethnic Albanians claim Serb forces launch attack on stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with Rugova spokesman saying fierce battle
underway, statement from chief ethnic Albanian negotiator. No

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery launched a strong attack Thursday on a Kosovo rebel
stronghold, setting fire to houses and killing at least one person,
ethnic Albanian sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military were targeting
six villages near Podujevo and had sealed off all roads leading to
the area, 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the provincial capital,
Pristina.
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels were resisting the
attack and a ``fierce battle'' was underway.
	   The operation marks a significant setback to the cease-fire
agreement that ended the worst of the fighting between secessionist
ethnic Albanians and Serb security forces. Between February and
October, 1,000 people were killed and another 300,000 lost their
homes.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed that international observers
had reported shelling and machine-gun fire in the area but had no
details of fighting.
	   Grunnet said a convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including
several Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen Thursday morning
leaving bases in Pristina and Podujevo.
	   He said the OSCE, which is monitoring the October cease-fire
accord, had no reports of casualties. Grunnet said Yugoslav
authorities described the attack as a ``limited search operation''
for suspects in Monday's killing of a Serb policeman in the area.
	   On Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin warned
of the increasing violence.
	   ``A large-scale crackdown against the civilian population of
Kosovo would do nothing to improve the security situation and could
spark a cycle of violence that would seriously undermine the
cease-fire agreement,'' Rubin said in Washington.
	   On Thursday, the chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi
Agani, called the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and
a ``a bold challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in
October to halt the fighting.
	   According to the report, Serb tanks had already entered one of
the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia, the main
republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The report said at least one ethnic Albanian villager was killed
in the sweep and several houses were set ablaze. There was no
comment from Serb sources.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Mustafa urged U.S. and European governments and international
monitors of the two-month cease-fire to get Yugoslav authorities to
halt the attacks.
	   Lapastica is a KLA command post for the north-central region of
Kosovo, including Pristina. Rebel commanders are based in a walled
compound, and new recruits are trained there.
	   The initials ``UCK'' _ the Albanian language abbreviation for
the KLA _ is painted in large black letters on a wall at the
entrance to the village, and rebel fighters had been guarding the
dirt road leading to the village.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides in the
separatist province against launching more attacks. The alliance's
supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly
aggressive Serb military and police activities.''
	   Speaking to reporters in neighboring Macedonia, he said NATO is
watching closely to ensure that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic keeps his promises under an October agreement reached
with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke to halt the bloodshed.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed those concerns,
saying in Brussels that the escalating violence and killings in
recent days ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities did not conform to
Milosevic's pledges in an Oct. 12 agreement. He reiterated that
Milosevic and top military commanders in Belgrade have been told
they ``must comply with their promises made to NATO.''
	   NATO's supreme allied commander for Europe spoke on a visit to
the alliance's 1,800-strong extraction force, deployed in Macedonia
in case international monitors in Kosovo are threatened.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The number of new cars and trucks to roll off
Japanese assembly lines fell in November, an industry group said
Thursday, as recession at home and in neighboring Asian nations
continued to hurt demand.
	   The number of new vehicles built last month was 848,266, down
1.3 percent from the same time a year ago, the Japan Automobile
Manufacturers Association said.
	   The number has fallen or broken even for 13 of the last 14
months, the association said. It recorded its only rise of the year
in October.
	   While robust exports to the United States helped the number of
passenger cars built in November rise 5.6 percent, the number of
new trucks plunged by a quarter.
	   In total, Japanese carmakers have built 8.5 percent less cars
and trucks so far this year compared to the same 11-month period
the year before.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese carmaker Isuzu Motors Ltd. announced
Thursday it will slash 4,000 jobs and reduce interest-bearing debt
as part of a restructuring drive to shore up profitability.
	   Isuzu, an affiliate of U.S.-based General Motors Corp., said the
plan will help it achieve its goal of 710 billion yen (dlrs 6.1
billion) in domestic auto sales and a pretax profit of 10 billion
yen (dlrs 86 million) in fiscal 2000.
	   The announcement comes amid a wave of consolidation within
Japan's auto industry, which has been battered by flagging domestic
demand and Asia's financial crisis.
	   Isuzu, one of the world's leading truck-makers, said the job
reductions will be accomplished through attrition. It said it
hasn't set a time frame for the cuts.
	   The company said it aims to reduce its interest-bearing debt
worth 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.6 billion) by around 300 billion yen
(dlrs 2.58 billion) by March 2000.
	   Isuzu also said it will scale back its marketing subsidiaries to
30 companies from the current 68 by March 2001.
	   General Motors, the world's biggest automaker, said last week it
will increase its stake in Isuzu to 49 percent from the current
37.5 percent
	   ___
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. said Thursday it has
sold part of its stake in South Korea's Kia Motors Corp.
	   ``A business opportunity presented itself and we took it,'' John
Spelich, a spokesman at Ford's headquarters in Dearborn, Mich.
	   Spelich said Ford sold a 9-percent stake in Kia early this week
but still controls 8 percent in the Korean carmaker through Mazda
Motor Corp. of Japan. Ford is Mazda's largest shareholder.
	   Spelich declined to reveal the buyer and price of the sale.
	   The sale came after Ford had failed to take over Kia in an
international auction in October. South Korea's Hyundai Motor Co.
won the bid to acquire Kia and its commercial vehicle arm, Asia
Motors Co.
	   Officials at Hyundai and Kia declined to comment on the sale.
	   ___
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A dlrs 1 trillion infrastructure spending
plan to stimulate China's economy won't result in troubled banks
being saddled with more bad debt, a top regulator said Thursday.
	   The Finance Ministry will supply most of the money itself and
monitor spending closely to minimize unproductive outlays, said Wu
Xiaoling, head of the Shanghai branch of the Chinese central bank.
	   The three-year spending plan for new highways, bridges and other
projects is meant to boost a slowing economy. At 7.5 percent to 8
percent this year, growth is robust for Asia but not enough to
create jobs for millions of workers laid off in reforms of
state-owned industry.
	   The government also has tried to spur the economy by easing
lending restrictions on state banks, leading to fears that would
increase uncollectible loans.
	   Wu insisted regulators were watching to make sure that didn't
happen and said only about 1 percent of spending on the
infrastructure program was expected to wind up in unproductive
assets.
	   Wu was named head of the Shanghai branch of the People's Bank of
China last month in a restructuring meant to create a regulatory
agency modeled on the U.S. Federal Reserve System.
	   She said the government was gradually reducing bad assets by
injecting capital into the banking system.
	   Uncollectible bank debts or loans on which payments are
temporarily suspended are equal to 25 percent of bank assets
nationwide, Wu said. In Shanghai, she said, that figure stands at
about 10 percent.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Two workers were killed and one was
hospitalized with severe burns after a fire in a pottery plant in
eastern Ukraine, a news agency reported Thursday. A fourth worker
was missing.
	   The fire at the plant in the village of Budy, in the Kharkiv
region, broke out Wednesday evening and raged for more than four
hours in the plant's packing house, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Another plant worker was still missing after firemen put out the
flames, which damaged a 620 square meter (6,674 square yard) area
and cost the plant around 900,000 hryvna (dlrs 263 million).
	   Plant officials have not yet determined the cause of the fire.

Angolan rebels launch nighttime attack on central highland city
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CASIMIRO SIONA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Despite a U.N. call for peace in Angola,
UNITA rebels launched an intensive attack Thursday on a central
highland city.
	   Rebel forces lobbed artillery shells through the night into
Kuito, some 500 kilometers (300 miles) southeast of the capital
Luanda, the private Radio Eclesia reported.
	   A local state television employee, who was not identified, was
wounded in the 10-hour attack that began at midnight, the radio
said.
	   When the attack died down, Kuito's 100,000 poeople _ swollen by
people fleeing battles in the surrounding rural highlands _ emerged
to stock up on provisions and water, Radio Eclesia reported.
	   There were no reports Thursday of clashes in the neighboring
Huambo province, where fighting has also flared this month,
undermining a 1994 peace agreement brokered by the United Nations.
	   The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday blamed UNITA for quashing
the 1994 accord, and demanded an end to the clashes that have
brought months of simmering hostility to the surface.
	   In Lisbon, a UNITA spokesman on Thursday accused the United
Nations of bias for failing to denounce government violations of
the peace agreement.
	   ``When the government shelled Andulo and Bailundo, the Security
Council said nothing,'' Carlos Morgado said by phone, referring to
an army attack three weeks ago on UNITA's two central highland
strongholds.
	   Once the rebels, equipped with unforeseen fire power, had
repelled the army from Andulo and Bailundo, they launched a broader
offensive throughout the central highlands.
	   The government has also criticized the United Nations for
failing to guarantee UNITA's compliance with the 1994 agreement,
the latest attempt to end the civil war that broke out after
independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   The pact required UNITA to disband a 70,000-strong guerrilla
army, and hand over control of almost half the country to the
government.
	   UNITA _ the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
_ has an estimated 30,000 guerrilla soldiers hiding in the vast
southwest African nation. The government has 100,000 troops.

Polish company says it will pay to get out of controversial deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ One of Poland's leading conglomerates
announced Thursday it would pay dlrs 25 million to cancel a
controversial, secret agreement that sparked an investigation by
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
	   Elektrim SA, a founding member of the Warsaw Stock Exchange,
will pay the money to Kulczyk Holdings SA to scrap the 1996 deal
that called for Elektrim to sell Kulczyk a 6.5 percent stake in
Polska Telefonia Cyfrowa, a cellular telephone company, for a
nominal price.
	   Disclosure of the 1996 agreement earlier this month caused
Elektrim's shares to tumble in value and raised questions about the
transparency of Poland's securities dealings. The Securities and
Exchange Commission is investigating why Elektrim failed to reveal
the agreement earlier.
	   On Tuesday, the president and deputy president of Elektrim
resigned under pressure from shareholders and investment houses.
	   Elektrim agreed in 1996 to sell Kulczyk the 6.5 percent stake in
its cellular phone holding, which was being set up, for the
approximate share value at the time. Kulczyk was a financial backer
of Elektrim's entry into the cellular telephone industry.
	   The cellular phone company became one of two that received
licenses to operate a digital network in Poland, causing the value
of the business to increase dramatically. Analysts estimate that
Elektrim's stake in the cellular phone company is now worth as much
as dlrs 150 million, perhaps five times more than Elektrim would
have received under the deal with Kulczyk.
	   Elektrim is a diversified company with holdings in
telecommunications, power generation equipment and other aspects of
electrical engineering.

Afgan, Iraqi cititzens stopped at border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austrian border police stopped a group of
40 illegal aliens trying to cross into the country from Slovakia on
Thursday, media reported.
	   The 12 Afghans and 28 Iraqis caught on the border early Thursday
near the town of Kittsee, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of
Vienna, have all applied for asylum in Austria, the Austria Press
Agency said.
	   The group is reported the largest to date to be caught on
Austria's long, open border shared with Slovakia and Hungary.
	   Since Austria dropped all border controls with European Union
neighbors last April, it is under increased pressure to block
illegal immigration from formerly communist countries to the east.
	   Germany, the destination for many would-be asylum seekers and
economic immigrants, has expressed particular concern about the
influx from the east and urged neighbors to tighten their borders
with non-EU nations.

ending Wednesday, said the 60 major companies' general share prices
index declined by 1.87 percent to 166.54 points.
	   Shares of industrial firms slipped by 3.25 percent, commercial
banks by 1.51 percent and services sector by 1.06 percent.

French Finance Minister skeptical about EU tax alignment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn
reiterated his government's skepticism Thursday about the merits of
Europe-wide tax harmonization.
	   ``I don't know if it's impossible, but I wonder above all if
it's really desirable'' to achieve a general harmonization of tax
and social security charges in Europe in the medium term,
Strauss-Kahn said in an interview with daily newspaper Les Echos.
	   Strauss-Kahn said the principle of giving E.U. states freedom in
setting their own fiscal policy remained important, particularly
given the different quality of social services they provide.
	   However, he said the E.U. should go ahead with harmonization in
the areas of corporate and capital gains taxation and hoped it
would happen by mid-1999.
	   ``Harmonization should take place wherever (fiscal) differences
are likely to create unfair tax competition,'' he said. ``That's
why minor differences in value-added-tax rates, for example, don't
need to be harmonized.''
	   Strauss-Kahn was echoing the conclusion reached by E.U. leaders
earlier this month to delay decisions on the controversial issue of
tax-rate alignment until December 1999.
	   The leaders had agreed that tax coordination does not have to
mean imposing uniform rates across the 15-nation bloc, but they
said they wanted to agree on E.U. rules for taxation of savings,
interest and royalties by next December.
	   The Finance Ministry issued broad guidelines Wednesday for
French government finances for the years 2000 to 2002, predicting a
decline in the level of tax and social security charges.
	   Strauss-Kahn said the decrease would have to be phased in
slowly, depending on how fast the economy grows.
	   The government also aims to trim the public deficit from 2.3
percent of gross domestic product to between 0.8 and 1.2 percent in
1999.

Official: Russia's nuclear exports to exceed dlrs 2 billion in
</HEADLINE>
1998 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's nuclear industry exports are expected to
bring in dlrs 2 billion to dlrs 2.2 billion this year, a four-fold
increase since 1991, a senior official said Thursday.
	   Nuclear technology and materials are among Russia's few
profitable exports, and the cash-strapped government is eager to
continue the deals in spite of uneasiness on the part of the United
States.
	   Washington worries that Russia's nuclear technologies will find
their way to ``rogue'' nations like Iran and Libya. Russia says
those fears are groundless.
	   Russian Deputy Nuclear Energy Minister Lev Ryabev said Thursday
that Moscow's revenues from nuclear exports are likely to further
increase in the future, partly because of lucrative deals to build
nuclear power plants in China, India and Iran.
	   The U.S. government worries that Iran will use its plant _ being
built under a contract said to be worth about dlrs 800 million _ to
develop its potential to make nuclear weapons. Moscow rejects the
suggestion.
	   Ryabev said that Russia is also working on deals with several
unspecified African and Middle Eastern countries to build floating
nuclear power plants, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russia is also selling uranium from decommissioned nuclear
weapons to the United States under deals that bring in dlrs 500
million to dlrs 600 million each year, Ryabev said, according to
Interfax.
	   Russia's nuclear export revenues have quadrupled since 1991,
when the country made dlrs 500 million to dlrs 600 million over the
whole year, he said.
	   This summer, the Clinton administration imposed sanctions on
seven Russian companies, banning them from doing business with U.S.
firms, in an attempt to scare these companies away from deals with
Iran. The companies weren't doing business with America.

Bin Laden says he's innocent of U.S. Embassy bombings
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ In his first public denial of
involvement in the U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa, Osama bin Laden
said he is innocent but not sorry the attacks happened, a Pakistani
news agency reported Thursday.
	   The Saudi millionaire has been living in exile in Afghanistan,
and the Taliban religious army, which rules most of the country,
has until now refused to let him make public statements.
	   The United States has accused bin Laden of masterminding the
August embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224
people. A U.S. court has indicted bin Laden and Washington has
demanded he be extradited.
	   ``I was not involved in the bomb blasts ... but I don't regret
what happened there,'' the Taliban quoted bin Laden as saying, the
independent News Network International reported Thursday.
	   The Taliban said bin Laden made the comment to a reporter from
the Afghan news agency Bakhtar and a Pakistani journalist, the news
agency reported.
	   There was no immediate Taliban comment Thursday about the NNI
report.
	   The Taliban, which rules roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, has
refused to hand over bin Laden, saying he is an honored guest and
will be protected in keeping with Afghan tradition.
	   The Taliban's Supreme Court held an inquiry last month into U.S.
charges that bin Laden led an international terrorist organization
targeting American interests worldwide.
	   The inquiry ended after nearly a month, exonerating bin Laden
and berating the United States for failing to provide evidence of
his guilt.
	   But the Taliban promised that no one, including bin Laden, would
use Afghan territory as a base of terrorist activity.
	   They also said that bin Laden gave a written guarantee to the
Taliban's supreme leader Mullah Mohammed Omar that he would not
participate in any terrorist activity while in Afghanistan.
	   NNI quoted bin Laden as saying ``I am leading my life under the
rules and regulations of Mullah Omar.''
	   The Taliban said that means that bin Laden is not training,
financing or encouraging terrorist activity from his base in
southern Afghanistan.
	   Bin Laden's campaign against the United States is aimed at
forcing Washington to withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia, home to
Islam's two holiest sites, Medina and Mecca. Bin Laden also has
criticized Saudi Arabia for allowing the troops there and has vowed
to see the monarchy in his homeland overthrown.
	   The United States also suspects bin Laden of financing the June
1996 bombing of Khobar Towers, a U.S. military apartment complex in
the Saudi Arabian city of Dhahran. Nineteen U.S. servicemen were
killed and about 500 people were injured in the blast.
	   The Saudi government expelled bin Laden nearly a decade ago. He
sought asylum in Sudan before relocating to Afghanistan along with
an estimated 300 followers.
	   In August, the United States fired several missiles at what the
U.S. administration believed were bin Laden's camps for training
terrorists. The Taliban said the 26 people killed were religious
students and not terrorists-in-training.
	   In his interview, bin Laden also praised the Taliban's hard-line
version of Islamic law, which bans women from work, girls from
school and forces everyone to pray five times a day.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament's lower house gave quick, initial
approval to an austere budget for 1999 after Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov threatened to resign if the document was rejected.
	   The Communist-dominated legislature, which generally backs
Primakov's government, voted 303-65 to approve the 1999 budget
after its first reading.
	   Primakov rallied lawmakers' support in an emotional speech
before the vote, saying that Russia desperately needs the budget to
deal with the worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
	   ``The question is whether we're ready to undertake
responsibility for overcoming the crisis or will again sink in
debates, mutual recriminations and half-steps,'' Primakov said.
	   The State Duma must still vote several more times on the budget
in coming days, and then send it to the upper house. But the budget
appeared likely to pass with far less commotion than in previous
years, when the process dragged on for months.
	   Russia's coffers are so bare that the entire 1999 budget calls
for government spending of just 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29
billion) and revenues of only 474 billion rubles (dlrs 24 billion).
	   By comparison, the United States government collects and spends
more than dlrs 30 billion in an average week.
	   Before heading into parliament, Primakov met with President
Boris Yeltsin in the Kremlin to discuss the budget, which is
designed to help stabilize an economy that's been contracting
rapidly since the summer.
	   ``If the budget isn't approved, we will not stay on our posts,''
Primakov said.
	   ``The budget must be very severe, we can't lie to anyone,'' he
told Yeltsin, who nodded in agreement.
	   Yeltsin, who has been sidelined by a string of illnesses, has
said little about the country's economic turmoil, leaving Primakov
to deal with the crisis.
	   ``We must gradually arrange things to get rid of foreign (aid)
injections,'' Yeltsin told Primakov.
	   Primakov then told parliament's lower house that a lean budget
was essential for getting new loans from the International Monetary
Fund and other lenders. Russia badly needs the aid to help pay off
its huge debts.
	   ``Quickly passing the budget will strengthen our stance in the
talks with international financial organizations,'' Primakov said.
	   Despite their support for Primakov, some lawmakers criticized
the budget as being too dependent on foreign help.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov acknowledged that the budget
relies on dlrs 7.2 billion in foreign loans that may not come.
	   Also, the budget earmarks only dlrs 9.5 billion to pay off
Russia's foreign debt, which will total dlrs 17.5 billion next
year. The budget planners are seeking to reschedule the remaining
debts.
	   The draft budget is based on the average ruble rate of 21.5 to
the dollar, and forecasts inflation of 30 percent next year.
	   Alexander Zhukov, the chairman of the Duma's budget committee,
dismissed both targets as overly optimistic now that the ruble has
fallen below 20 rubles to the dollar and inflation this year is
expected to top 70 percent.
	   But Zhukov asked the Duma to approve the plan anyway.
	   ``The budget rejection or a significant delay in its passage
would bring our country to such situation that the economic crisis
of August and September would seem a time of economic prosperity,''
he said.
	   The previous government devalued the ruble and defaulted on some
of its domestic debts in August, triggering Russia's worst economic
crisis since the Soviet collapse and prompting foreign lenders to
freeze further loans.
	   The budget calls for government spending of 575 billion rubles
(dlrs 29 billion) and revenues of just 474 billion rubles (dlrs 24
billion).
	   By comparison, the United States government collects and spends
more than dlrs 30 billion every week on average.

India says talk of strategic triangle premature
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ASHOK SHARMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ It's too early to talk of an
India-Russia-China strategic triangle since New Delhi's relations
with Bejing are still strained, India's new foreign minister said
Thursday.
	   Reviewing India's foreign policy challenges in 1998, Foreign
Minister Jaswant Singh said India was still trying to normalize
relations with China. India set off five nuclear tests in May,
saying it needed a nuclear defense against threats posed by
neighboring China and Pakistan.
	   Any ``strategic relationship with China is a consequence of
improvement of relations,'' Singh said, adding both sides were
still working out ``concerns.''
	   Last week, China rejected the idea of a ``strategic triangle''
that Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov promoted during his
visit to New Delhi. Foreign affairs experts in all three countries
have proposed such an alliance to check U.S. domination after the
disintegration of the Soviet Union.
	   Primakov said he had not formally proposed the alliance to
Indian leaders.
	   Singh said India would not roll back the nuclear program that
angered China, but noted Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told
the U.N. General Assembly earlier this year he wanted an
international test ban treaty by September.
	   Singh, who took office this month, strongly rejected a
reporter's suggestion that India, one of the poorest countries in
the world, had spent billions of dollars on nuclear weaponry at the
cost of social development.
	   India's nuclear tests also angered the United States, which
urged New Delhi to retreat and imposed economic sanctions. Singh
has led the Indian team in the ongoing talks with U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
	   Singh said differences remained on issues including the test ban
treaty, production of materials needed to make nuclear weapons and
controls on exporting such material. More talks are expected later
this month in New Delhi.

Trial begins against pyramid scheme leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A trial opened Thursday in a southern town against
the leaders of one of Russia's high-risk investment companies that
went bankrupt four years ago, carrying away people's savings, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The Russian House of Selenga was one of the biggest pyramid-type
companies to sprout amid the legal confusion following the Soviet
collapse. It advertised extensively on Russian television and
persuaded some 2 million Russians to invest their money in its
fund, which promised sky-high interest rates.
	   In addition to swindling, the trial in Volgograd against Selenga
leaders Sergei Salomadin and Alexander Gruzin will address the
accusation that they misappropriated about 14 billion rubles (about
dlrs 5 million at the time) through the company's subsidiaries,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   Selenga continued collecting money from unwitting depositors
even after it was banned by Russia's Supreme Arbitration Court.

English soccer fan seeks legal recourse against lazy players
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEST BROMWICH, England (AP) _ An English soccer fan has
attempted to set a precedent which might help the coaches who tear
their hair out when players fail to perform up to expectations.
	   West Bromwich Albion fan Bill Archer became so frustrated with
his team's lackluster performances that he reported the players to
officers of the Trading Standards Authority.
	   Archer complained to Trading Standards on the grounds that he
wasn't getting his money's worth at the games _ Albion's loss to
lowly rated Tranmere in a division one match on the weekend was the
final straw.
	   The leadup to the festive season hasn't brought too much good
cheer for England's batch of professional soccer players this week.
	   Rock legend Sir Elton John, chairman of division one team
Watford, started the backlash when he made national headlines
Wednesday by describing premier league players as lazy and
overpaid.
	   Then Archer demanded some legal recourse against the players who
weren't producing the goods on the field.
	   ``They're playing for 5,000, 10,000 even 20,000 pounds per week
_ surely they should perform on a Saturday. That's all the fans
want,'' Archer told Sky News Thursday.
	   ``(the solution) is simple. If (players) don't perform, they
don't get paid.''
	   West Bromwich is currently middle of the standings in division
one and although manager Dave Smith agrees the team ``can improve
100 percent'', there are plenty of other teams doing worse.
	   A little bit of good news for out-of-form players is that the
Trading Standards authority decided Archer had no case.
	   Buying a ticket enables fans to watch a game, whether or not its
worth watching is not the issue, was the regulatory body's official
line.

Italy's justice minister rejects Turkish request for jail
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS with German laywer saying talks still under way,
solution likely by Friday or sooner; CLARIFIES that justice

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Lawyers and aides to a Turkish Kurdish guerrilla
leader were reported to be working feverishly Thursday to try to
find a country which would accept him.
	   A spokesman for the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party said Abdullah
Ocalan was still staying at a villa on the outskirts of Rome, where
he took up residence about a week after he was detained on Nov. 12
at the capital's airport.
	   In Berlin, Ocalan's German lawyer, Britta Boehler, told Berlin
Aktuell Radio that the situation, while now ``quite unclear,''
would be cleared up either later Thursday or Friday.
	   Ocalan's other lawyers and advisers were in intense discussions
with the Italian government to find a solution, she said.
	   Boehler declined to say which country might take him.
	   Ocalan, who showed up in Italy on a flight from Moscow, has been
looking for a safe place to go since Syria expelled him earlier
this year in response to heavy pressure from Turkey.
	   Estonia, Ukraine, Libya and North Korea had been mentioned in
news reports as possible destinations.
	   Private Italian TV network Canale 5 quoted an Ocalan spokesman
as saying the leader, who had requested asylum from Rome, had now
definitely decided to leave Italy.
	   Italy's tolerance of Ocalan has angered the Turkish government
and sparked boycotts there of Italian products. Turkey wants Ocalan
back to try as a terrorist, but Italy has refused to extradite him
on grounds that Turkish courts could sentence him to death.
	   On Thursday, the Italian justice ministry said that Justice
Minister Oliviero Diliberto, in a fax sent earlier in the week to a
Rome appeals court, had rejected a Turkish request to order Ocalan
back to jail.
	   Ocalan was arrested here on a since-dropped warrant from
Germany, which fears his presence in that country could inflame
millions of Turkish immigrants, including many Kurds.
	   In Ankara, Turkish Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu on Thursday
said Italy was ``massacring justice'' by trying to send Ocalan away
even before considering a Turkish request for his extradition.
	   ``All the principles of justice have been violated since Ocalan
arrived in Italy,'' Denizkurdu said, vowing that Turkey will
``follow him where wherever he goes. Turkey's extradition request
remains in place.''
	   On Wednesday, Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema denied there were
any negotiations to find a country which would take Ocalan.
	   The Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, has been fighting since
1984 in southeastern Turkey for autonomy for Turkey's Kurds, a
sizeable minority.

In troubled Nigeria, eight reasons to smile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ThisDay in 3rd graf is correct. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Amid otherwise bleak news of fuel
shortages and labor tumult, Nigerians this week had eight reasons
to smile.
	   Newspapers in the commercial capital of Lagos for days have been
carrying stories on the birth of the world's first living octuplets
to a Nigerian couple living in the United States.
	   Squeezed in between news stories on protests and strikes, a
headline earlier this week in Nigeria's popular ThisDay newspaper
modestly announced the birth of the eight new compatriots.
	   ``Nigerian woman sets multiple birth record,'' the paper's front
page headline declared.
	   The influential Lagos Guardian on Thursday wrote of efforts by
Nigeria's ambassador to the United States and the Nigerian
community in Texas to help the young parents.
	   Although an ocean away, Nigerians took pride in the birth of the
world's first living octuplets. Born to Nkem Chukwu and Iyke Louis
Udobi, the infants were named along the traditional lines of their
tribal Ibo ethnic heritage from southeastern Nigeria.
	   ``To read about this reminds you of how precious life is,'' said
Peter Duvbiama as he perused a copy of the daily Vanguard, which
also carried news of the record-breaking brood.
	   For most Nigerians, however, news of the remarkable
multiple-birth was a short-lived diversion from daily trials of
life in Africa's most populous and often troubled nation.
	   On Thursday, a typical day, labor groups threatened strike
action, students groups accused the government of corruption and
cars lined up in impossibly long queues for gasoline _ oil-rich
Nigeria faces chronic fuel shortages.
	   ``We're happy for the couple, but we've got problems enough
here,'' said Henry Nwoko, while waiting in line to fill his taxi
with increasingly scarce gasoline.

Celebrating Christmas, John Paul looks forward to new millennium

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Pope John Paul II celebrated this Christmas with his
mind on the next one, looking ahead eagerly to the opening of the
jubilee year that will launch Christianity's third millennium.
	   John Paul was delivering his Christmas Eve Mass homily from St.
Peter's Basilica. From there, on Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will open
2000 celebrations with the traditional jubilee-year opening of the
basilica's usually closed main doors.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, I shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the opening of
the holy door,'' John Paul said in an advance text of his Christmas
Eve homily.
	   ``It will be a truly great holy year. For in a completely unique
way, it will celebrate the 2000th anniversary of the event and
mystery of the incarnation in which humanity reached the apex of
its calling. God became man in order to give man a share in his own
divinity.''
	   ``This is the good news of salvation. This is the message of
Christmas! The church proclaims it tonight by means of my words,
too, for the peoples and nations of the whole Earth to hear.
	   ``Christ is born for us. Come, let us adore him!''
	   John Paul, increasingly frail at 78, has long looked forward to
the Jubilee Year as a culminating event of his papacy, now in its
21st year.
	   The Christmas Eve Mass opens a busy few days for the pope, who
has kept his schedule light to save his strength for the holiday
services. He fell sick with the flu last week, forcing him to
cancel some of his events on his calendar.
	   The pope no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning in St.
Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest up from the
midnight Mass Christmas Eve.
	   He is scheduled to keep up his tradition of appearing before
tourists and pilgrims in the square at noon on Christmas Day when
he reads a Christmas message and gives holiday greetings in dozens
of languages.
	   After Christmas, the pope plans to have his usual few days of
rest at the papal residence in a town outside Rome.

Iranian court reduces sentence of former mayor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 5-7 with lawyer saying Karbaschi will protest
appeals court decision. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An appeals court has reduced the sentence of
a former Tehran mayor convicted of corruption from five years to
two years in jail, a judiciary statement said Thursday.
	   The court also reduced to 10 years from 20 years the period
Gholamhossein Karbaschi was banned from assuming public office.
	   It replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of 10 million
rials (dlrs 3,000), the statement said. This would be in addition
to the original fines he was ordered to pay: 1 billion rials (dlrs
330,000) as punishment and 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) that he
must pay back the city.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
had been a target of hard-line political rivals, and many Iranians
saw the trial as a political settling of scores. The judiciary in
Iran is controlled by hard-liners.
	   Karbaschi's lawyer Bahman Keshavarz later said his client will
protest the decision by the appeals court.
	   ``I do not accept the ruling issued by the appeals court,'' said
Kashavarz.
	   He said he will submit the protest to the prosecutor general on
Saturday.
	   Karbaschi was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his
eight years as Tehran's mayor. He filed an appeal in August.
	   It was not immediately clear when Karbaschi, who has been out on
bail, will begin serving his sentence.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted to making mistakes, but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi won wide respect for his work as mayor. He built parks
and social centers and reduced pollution and traffic congestion.
But he also made enemies among the merchant class which resented
his taxes and his support for Khatami, a moderate cleric who
believes in relaxing the Islamic social code. His pro-Khatami
stance also incurred the enmity of hard-liners.
	   Riots erupted in Iran soon after Karbaschi's arrest in April.
	   For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first insight
into Iran's judicial process and moderates saw it more as an
indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Clouds and showers diminished rapidly over land during the
night. Most of the showers were concentrated over the Caribbean
waters about 20 to 50 miles south of St. Croix and Puerto Rico.
	   Nevertheless, the winds remained very strong over land with San
Juan reporting gusts to more than 25 mph. Doppler radar also
detected winds up to 35 mph over the highlands of Puerto Rico.
	   These windy conditions will continue across Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands today as a surface high over the northeast
Atlantic continues to be the dominant weather system over our area.
	   A wind advisory continues in effect at least through noon. These
winds will also bring scattered to numerous showers, especially
over the U.S. Virgin Islands and the northeast sections of Puerto
Rico.
	   However, most of the showers will be light to moderate, so the
rainfall accumulations will generally be less than a quarter of an
inch.

coastal waters today with occasional gusts to 30 kts, mainly over
the Atlantic waters.

northeast swells. Consequently, a small craft advisory remains in
effect for all our coastal waters.

Cypriot president to visit Greece for talks on missile deployment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY ALEX EFTY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides is to
fly to Athens on Monday for talks on the controversial deployment
of Russian missiles in Cyprus, the government said Thursday.
	   The Cypriot National Council, a body consisting of the leaders
of all the main parties, asked the president to discuss the
deployment with the Greek government after studying Tuesday's U.N.
Security Council resolutions on Cyprus, an official statement said.
	   The Security Council called for the reduction of weapons and
troops in Cyprus and the resumption of talks for the reunification
of the island. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey
invaded after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with
Greece.
	   The Clerides' government welcomed the U.N. resolutions as
expressing a new impetus toward solving the Cyprus problem. But two
National Council members _ centrist Spyros Kyporianou and socialist
Vassos Lyssarides _ criticized the resolutions as seeking to
prevent the missiles' deployment, expected in the new year.
	   Turkey has warned it will take military action to stop the
anti-aircraft missiles from being deployed in Cyprus. Athens, which
is obliged by treaty to support Cyprus in the event of war, has
indicated that Cyprus should install the missiles on the Greek
island of Crete.
	   The United States and the European Union, to which Greece
belongs, have asked Cyprus to cancel the deployment.

Unions, students demand reduction in Nigerian fuel prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Nigerian trade unions teamed up Thursday
with student activists to call on the country's military government
to cut gasoline prices or ``face the wrath of workers.''
	   Union members are threatening massive strikes, while the student
groups say they will disrupt next year's world youth soccer
championships in Nigeria.
	   A statement by the Nigeria Labor Congress, issued at the end of
an emergency meeting in Lagos on Wednesday, said unions ``will not
be held responsible for any actions that may be taken by the 29
industrial unions affiliated to the NLC if the government fails to
reverse the price increase of petroleum products by next Jan. 4.''
	   Last Monday, Nigeria's military government announced a sharp
increase in gasoline prices, lifting them from about 12 cents per
liter to almost 30 cents.
	   Prices for diesel and kerosene also went up as the government
deregulated petroleum products in an effort to cut through recent
chronic fuel shortages in the country.
	   The labor congress says the price increase will wipe out gains
from a recent wage increase for government workers and render
irrelevant the government's poverty alleviation programs.
	   The increase in official prices at the pump have pushed up fares
on public transport in Nigeria by at least 200 percent.

Rangers finally sign German goalkeeper

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Glasgow Rangers ended the long-running
saga of finding a replacement 'keeper for injured Frenchman Lionel
Charbonnier on Thursday by hiring Stafan Klos from Borussia
Dortmund.
	   The 27-year-old German international accepted a four-year
contract worth 700,000 pounds (dlrs 1.2 million) and could make his
Scottish premier league debut against St. Johnstone at Ibrox on
Saturday.
	   Klos was expected to sign with Rangers in the summer but a legal
dispute with Bundesliga club Dortmund forced him to see out his
contract in the German league.

Ambush kills eight soldiers, wounds 15
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Muslim militants ambushed an army patrol
in a mountainous region west of Algiers, killing eight soldiers,
wounding 15 and fleeing with a load of weapons, independent
newspapers reported Thursday.
	   The attack overnight Monday came during the holy month of
Ramadan, when militant activity usually intensifies in a nearly
7-year-old insurgency that has left 75,000 people dead.
	   The militants fired on two military vehicles on patrol in the
Zaccar Mountains near the town of Miliana, 145 kms (90 miles) west
of the capital, reported the newspapers Liberte and El Watan.
	   The attackers made off with six Kalashnikov submachine guns, 32
ammunition clips, as well as military uniforms, Liberte said.
	   Security forces scoured the area on Tuesday, looking for the
militants, said a municipal employee in the Miliana, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The insurgency began after the military-backed government
scrapped a January 1992 parliamentary runoff the Islamic Salvation
Front was expected to win. The Front had promised to fight high
unemployment and corruption in this petroleum-rich nation.

Text of John Paul II's Christmas Eve homily
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EMBARGOED until 2330 gmt &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Pope-Christmas &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The Vatican's English translation of Pope John Paul II's
Christmas homily at midnight Mass in St. Peter's Basilica:
	   1. ``Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you good news of a great
joy. ... For to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior,
who is Christ the Lord'' (Luke 2:10-11)
	   On this Holy Night, the Liturgy invites us to celebrate with joy
the great event of the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem. As we have just
heard in the Gospel of Luke, Jesus is born into a family poor by
material standards, but rich in joy. He is born in a stable, for
there is no place for him in the inn (cf Luke 2:7); he is placed in
a manger, for there is no cradle for him; he comes into the world
completely helpless, without anyone's knowledge, and yet he is
welcomed and recognized first by the shepherds, who hear from the
angel the news of his birth.
	   The event conceals a mystery. It is revealed by the choirs of
heavenly messengers who sing of Jesus' birth and proclaim glory
``to God in the highest and on Earth peace among men with whom he
is pleased'' (Luke 2:14). Through the ages their praise becomes a
prayer which rises from the hearts of the throngs who on Christmas
Night continue to welcome the Son of God.
	   2. Mysterium: event and mystery. A man is born, who is the
Eternal Son of the Almighty Father, the Creator of Heaven and
Earth: In this extraordinary event the mystery of God is revealed.
In the Word who becomes man the miracle of the Incarnate God is
made manifest. The mystery sheds light on the event of the birth: A
baby is adored by the shepherds in the lowly stable, at Bethlehem.
He is ``the Savior of the world,'' ``Christ the Lord,'' (cf Luke
2:11). Their eyes see a newborn child, wrapped in swaddling cloths
and placed in a manger, and in that ``sign,'' thanks to the inner
light of faith, they recognize the Messiah proclaimed by the
Prophets.
	   3. This is Emmanuel, God-with-us, who comes to fill the Earth
with grace. He comes into the world in order to transform creation.
He becomes a man among men, so that in him and through him every
human being can be profoundly renewed. By his birth, he draws us
all into the sphere of the divine, granting to those who in faith
open themselves to receiving his gift the possibility of sharing in
his divine life.
	   This is the meaning of the salvation which the shepherds hear
proclaimed that night in Bethlehem: ``To you is born a Savior''
(Luke 2:11). The coming of Christ among us is the center of
history, which thereafter takes on a new dimension. In a way, it is
God himself who writes history by entering into it. The event of
the Incarnation thus broadens to embrace the whole of human
history, from creation until the Second Coming. This is why in the
Liturgy all creation sings, voicing its own joy: The floods clap
their hands, all the trees of the world sing for joy, and the many
coastlands are glad (cf Ps 98:8, 96:12; 97:1).
	   Every creature on the face of the Earth receives the
proclamation. In the astonished silence of the universe, the words
which the Liturgy puts on the lips on the Church take on a cosmic
resonance: Christus natus est nobis. Venite, adoremus!
	   Christ is born for us. Come let us adore him. My thoughts
already turn to Christmas next year when, God willing, I shall
inaugurate the great jubilee with the opening of the holy door.
	   It will be a truly great holy year, for in a completely unique
way it will celebrate the 2000th anniversary of the event and
mystery of the incarnation in which humanity reached the apex of
its calling. God became man in order to give man a share in his own
divinity.
	   This is the good news of salvation. This is the message of
Christmas! The Church proclaims it tonight by means of my words
too, for the peoples and nations of the whole Earth to hear.
Christu natus est nobis. Christ is born for us. Venite adoremum.
Come, let us adore him.

Ukrainian confectionery inspired by Clinton, Lewinsky
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton sent a letter
of praise a few years back to the Khmelnytsky candy factory after
tasting its products.
	   On Thursday, the factory returned the favor, naming its newest
chocolate confection after Monica Lewinsky, a newspaper reported.
	   The candy is dedicated to a ``sad story of love between Bill and
Monica,'' the chocolate's designer Oksana Kaduk told the daily Den
paper.
	   The rectangular chocolates come in a box decorated with a green
apple. Plant officials told Den that they wanted to support Clinton
in his ``time of crisis'' by letting people eat chocolates bearing
the name of ``the sharp-tongued temptress.''
	   Khmelnytsky plant workers have maintained their friendly
feelings for Clinton since his visit to this former Soviet republic
several years ago, when he tasted the plant's candies.
	   Clinton apparently liked them so well that he wrote a letter of
congratulations after the plant won an international prize.
	   ``We keep this letter as a precious relic,'' factory director
Vasyl Liubovetsky said.
	   The plant is hoping its Monica chocolates will find a huge
market. Its Israeli partner has already ordered a large batch, Den
said.

Blackburn close to agreement with Ward
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLACKBURN, England (AP) _ Struggling Premier League team
Blackburn Rovers is expected to bolster its playing staff in the
New Year after agreeing terms with Barnsley for striker Ashley
Ward.
	   The 28-year-old forward is negotiating personal terms with
Rovers and appears set to accept a deal worth 4.25 million pounds
(dlrs 7.1 million).
	   Ward will be Brian Kidd's second major acquisition since taking
the helm at Ewood Park.
	   Kidd started his bid to avoid relegation by signing Northern
Ireland winger Keith Gillespie from Newcastle in a 2.35
million-pound (dlrs 3.9 million) deal earlier this month.
	   Blackburn spokesman Tom Finn confirmed Thursday that Rovers had
agreed terms with division one team Barnsley but said negotiations
with Ward had just started and were expected to continue after
Christmas.
	   ``(Ward) was suspended from the Boxing Day action and we were
unable to get things sorted to make him eligible for Monday
(against Leicester),'' he said.

in Cyprus and the resumption of talks for the reunification of the
island. Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded
after a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Greece.
	   The government of Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides welcomed
the U.N. resolutions as expressing a new impetus toward solving the
Cyprus problem. But two National Council members _ centrist Spyros
Kyporianou and socialist Vassos Lyssarides _ criticized the
resolutions as seeking to prevent the missiles' deployment,
expected in the new year.
	   Turkey has warned it will take military action to stop the
anti-aircraft missiles from being deployed in Cyprus. Athens, which
is obliged by treaty to support Cyprus in the event of war, has
indicated that Cyprus should install the missiles on the Greek
island of Crete.
	   The United States and the European Union, to which Greece
belongs, have asked Cyprus to cancel the deployment.

Swiss say Chinese pique over Branson team blocks other balloonists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAU D'OEX, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss-based challengers to be
the first balloonists to fly nonstop around the world said Thursday
they have to postpone their attempt because of Chinese irritation
over the U.S.-British-Swedish team.
	   ``The Chinese have made it known to Bertrand Piccard that they
demand the postponement of Breitling Orbiter 3 and other
balloons,'' said a statement.
	   It said the Chinese decision was a ``consequence of the attitude
of the team of Richard Branson, which did not respect the
overflight conditions of China.''
	   British tycoon Branson, American millionaire Steve Fossett and
Per Lindstrand of Sweden picked up speed over the Pacific Wednesday
following their passage across China.
	   The statement did not go into detail about what actions had
provoked the Chinese, but Bejing originally gave the balloonists
permission to cross China below 26 degrees north latitude.
	   The trio, however, drifted further north Monday. After
diplomatic communications between Britain and China, the
balloonists were allowed to continue flying as long as they left
China as quickly as possible.
	   The Breitling Orbiter statement quoted a fax from the Chinese
government as saying, ``In view of the behavior of the Virgin
Global Challenger, the competent Chinese authorities find it
necessary to re-examine your overflight and ask you to postpone the
departure of the balloon.''
	   It said Piccard had to accept the Chinese decision.
	   ``I personally went to China to negotiate our passage and those
of the other competitors,'' Piccard said in the statement. ``Today,
the Chinese have the impression that they were abused because the
conditions they set weren't respected by one of the teams.''
	   Piccard and partner Brian Jones of Britain had previously said
they might take off as soon as Sunday.
	   It would be Piccard's third attempt to become the first person
to pilot a balloon around the world nonstop. Three other teams are
in the sweepstakes.
	   Piccard-Jones would take off from Chateau d'Oex, a Swiss Alpine
resort. Branson-Fossett began Dec. 18 from Morocco. The other
takeoff points are Alice Springs, Australia; Chicago; and
Albuquerque, N.M.

Uzbek president announces military to be slimmed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) _ Uzbek President Islam Karimov told
parliament on Thursday that the country's armed forces would be
trimmed.
	   The size of the army has never been made public, but unofficial
estimates put its size at 600,000.
	   ``Our armed forces today are extremely necessary, but too
swollen for the economy of the young republic,'' Karimov told
parliament.
	   ``The army must be smaller and more professional. A commission
will decide to what extent the army should be reduced.''
	   Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic of 23.5 million, borders on
two strife-torn countries: Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Karimov, who
has repeatedly warned of a rise in Islamic extremism in Central
Asia, said Uzbekistan was primarily interested in peace and
stability in its neighbors, as well as within its own borders.

Ethnic Albanians claim Serb forces launch attack on stronghold

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery attacked a rebel stronghold in Kosovo on Thursday,
burning houses and killing at least one person, ethnic Albanian
sources said.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed shelling and machine-gun fire
in the area. He also confirmed one death and said the operation
ended by late afternoon.
	   In its account, the Kosovo Information Center, close to the
province's ethnic Albanian leadership, said Serb police and
military targeted six villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20
miles) north of the provincial capital, Pristina, and had sealed
off all roads to the area.
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the
attack. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   Grunnet said a convoy of Yugoslav army vehicles, including
several Russian-built T-55 tanks, left bases in Pristina and
Podujevo early Thursday, converged just west of Podujevo and swept
through the area.
	   He said Yugoslav authorities described the attack as a ``limited
search operation'' for suspects in Monday's killing of a Serb
policeman in the area.
	   ``It seems to be more of a normal police operation than you see
in most countries of the world,'' Grunnet said on
CNN-International.
	   The operation marks a significant setback to the already shaky
cease-fire agreement that ended the worst of the fighting. On
Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin warned of
the increasing violence.
	   ``A large-scale crackdown against the civilian population of
Kosovo would do nothing to improve the security situation and could
spark a cycle of violence that would seriously undermine the
cease-fire agreement,'' Rubin said in Washington.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called
the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold
challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to
halt the fighting.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian report, Serb tanks had entered
one of the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   The report said at least one ethnic Albanian villager was killed
and several houses were set ablaze. A later report by the ethnic
Albanian center said Serb snipers had taken up positions at
``strategic points'' in the area and were firing at civilians, who
were fleeing deeper into rebel territory.
	   There was no comment from Serb sources.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Mustafa urged foreign governments and the international monitors
sent to Kosovo to verify a 2-month-old cease-fire to intervene with
Yugoslav authorities to halt the attacks.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides against
launching more attacks. The alliance's supreme commander for
Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly aggressive
Serb military and police activities.''
	   The continuing violence threatens to revive the war that raged
between secessionist ethnic Albanians and Serb security forces from
February to October. During that time 1,000 people were killed and
300,000 lost their homes.
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities did not conform to
Milosevic's pledges in the agreement. He reiterated that Milosevic
and top military commanders in Belgrade have been told they ``must
comply with their promises made to NATO.''

Le Pen seeks court order against rebels
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Seeking a new form of punishment against the rebels
he's kicked out of his party, National Front leader Jean-Marie Le
Pen asked a court Thursday to ban them from using the party name or
emblem.
	   Le Pen's complaint targeted nine people _ chief among them Bruno
Megret, the party's former No. 2 man who is leading the rebellion.
	   On Wednesday, Le Pen formally excluded Megret and six others
from the extreme-right party.
	   The bitter feud between Le Pen and Megret has split the party in
two. Megret plans to form his own slate for European Parliament
elections next June, while Le Pen plans to lead the Front's ticket.
	   A hearing on Le Pen's complaint is scheduled for Jan. 12, less
than two weeks before a planned party congress called by Megret. It
was Megret's call for the congress that led a furious Le Pen to
suspend him earlier this month.
	   Le Pen saw the call for a congress as a ploy to oust him, a
claim Megret never directly denied. A Le Pen loyalist, Samuel
Marechal, reiterated those accusations on Thursday.
	   ``The methods of Mr. Megret and his friends are illegal and
violate party statutes,'' Marechal said in a telephone interview.
	   ``It comes from bad faith ... (They are trying) to brainwash
people and spread disinformation,'' Marechal told The Associated
Press.
	   The National Front, which typically wins 15 percent of the
national vote, advocates sending home France's millions of
immigrants and reserving jobs and welfare for French-born citizens.
It is widely accused of racism and anti-Semitism.

Bolivian police detain killers of a Colombian nun and priest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) _ Bolivian police have arrested a teen-ager
who confessed to killing a Roman Catholic nun and priest who were
delivering Christmas gifts and food to a poor highland village,
officials said Thursday. They were still searching for three
accomplices.
	   A 16-year-old youth in custody confessed to shooting Father
Alvaro Lopez, 39, and Sister Maria Celina Posada, 37, both of
Colombia. They were killed Monday evening in Quiquibey, a tropical
region, 450 miles (700 kilometers) north of the capital, La Paz.
	   A third victim was in stable condition.
	   The teen-ager says he and his friends decided to ambush the
priest since he had complained of the youths' drunken rampage
through their small village.
	   Lopez and Celina, who worked with poor farmers and loggers, were
taking Christmas presents and food to a nearby village when they
were ambushed.
	   The killers stole the religious workers' vehicle and abandoned
it after getting into an accident. The suspects then fled into the
forests that surround Quiquibey.
	   A mob tried to lynch the 16-year-old after he was caught, but
police protected him. Area residents were also helping police in
the search for the three suspects still at large.
	   Father Lopez and Sister Posada were buried Wednesday in the
nearby village of Reyes.

Stern sets Jan. 7 as last day to end labor dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 6th graf to confirm meeting between Stern and Hunter;
TRIMS &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. National Basketball Association players and
owners have set a final date to either end their labor dispute or
cancel the season.
	   Giving new urgency to negotiators trying to settle the dispute,
NBA commissioner David Stern on Wednesday set Jan. 7 as the
so-called ``drop dead'' date for canceling the season.
	   If there's no agreement on a labor contract by the time the
league's Board of Governors meets that day, Stern will recommend
wiping out the entire 1998-99 schedule.
	   ``If we do not have a collective bargaining agreement by that
date, then David and I will have to recommend to the board that the
1998-99 season be canceled,'' NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik
said Wednesday.
	   It would be the first time a major professional sports league in
North America lost an entire season of competition.
	   No further talks are scheduled in the six-month-old dispute,
which centers on players and owners trying to decide how to divide
dlrs 2 billion in annual revenue.
	   There was no immediate reaction from the National Basketball
Players Association. Stern met with union leader Billy Hunter in
Los Angeles.
	   ``It's my view that if the owners are unwilling to move from
their current proposal, the season will then be canceled,'' agent
Arn Tellem said. ``I believe that ultimately when the players
analyze this, there is no way they will ever take the deal on the
table.''
	   ``I assume that some additional negotiations will take place in
advance of Jan. 7, but nothing has been scheduled at this time,''
Granik said.
	   Before this season, the NBA had never lost a single game because
of labor disputes. The lockout began July 1, and 358 games have
been canceled since the scheduled start of the season on Nov. 3.
	   The last round of bargaining took place Dec. 12, and players
continue to lose dlrs 50 million a week in salaries.
	   In Houston, Texas District Judge David Medina scheduled a
hearing for Wednesday on a lawsuit by Nick Van Exel of Denver,
Marcus Camby of New York and Reggie Slater of Toronto, who want to
be cleared to play basketball in Europe.
	   American players cannot play overseas without clearance from USA
Basketball. The lawsuit alleges that USA Basketball is conspiring
with the NBA to keep the players from going overseas, and asks for
an injunction against USA Basketball.

Balloonists halfway around the world elude Pacific weather

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three balloonists streaked across the Pacific
Ocean on a jetstream Thursday, hoping to elude a troublesome
weather pattern that could threaten their bid to achieve the first
non-stop trip around the world in a balloon.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were moving at 145 mph (233
kph), 1,500 miles (2,400 km) east of Japan, when they soared past
the halfway mark on an eastward circuit of the globe that began in
Marrakech, Morocco on Dec. 18.
	   ``They are pleased with their progress, but there is still a
worry about the weather in the Pacific,'' said ground crew
spokeswoman Jackie McQuillan in the afternoon.
	   ``We are watching it very carefully, but we are feeling slightly
more confident about things than we were this morning,'' she said.
	   Ground crew director Mike Kendrick had sounded ``a note of
concern'' in the morning about a high pressure trough developing
over the ocean. ``We're not panicking yet,'' he said, explaining
that if the balloon gets into the trough it could be dragged to a
lower altitude and have to ditch in the ocean.
	   ``If we fall out of the jetstream into this trough over the
Pacific then there is only one way, and that is back to Hawaii and
they are going to go for a swim,'' he told Sky TV.
	   The Pacific crossing is dangerous, he said, because the
frequency of shipping is not very high and rescue would be
difficult. The ground crew were tracking the position of all ships
that would be under the balloon in the Pacific.
	   The three-man crew, flying at 28,000 to 31,000 feet (8,500 to
9,500 meters) in a pressurized capsule, is aiming to reach North
America sometime Christmas Day, most likely in the evening over
southern Canada or Washington State.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, and cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   The 272-foot-high (83-meter-high) hot and helium balloon is
flying at about the same altitude as a jumbo jet and could be
visible from the ground if the weather is clear.
	   The trip is expected to last from eight days to nearly three
weeks and finish in Western Europe at the end of a 24,000-mile
(38,000 kms) flight.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   China had said the balloonists could cross their territory below
26 degrees north latitude. But the trio drifted further north
Monday after navigating around Mediterranean storms and closed
airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   The project ground crew said that the Chinese asked the
balloonists to land at the Lhasa airfield Tuesday morning, but the
balloon overshot the field and it was impossible to come down
anywhere else.
	   With the help of British diplomats, the balloonists won Chinese
permission to continue if they got out of the country as quickly as
possible.

Iranian court reduces sentence of former mayor

appeals court decision. Pick up 7th graf pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An appeals court has reduced the jail
sentence of a former Tehran mayor convicted of corruption from five
years to two years, a judiciary statement said Thursday.
	   The court also reduced to 10 years from 20 years the period
Gholamhossein Karbaschi was banned from assuming public office.
	   It replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of dlrs 3,000,
statement said. This would be in addition to the original fines he
was ordered to pay: dlrs 330,000 as punishment and dlrs 200,000
that he must pay back the city.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
had been a target of hard-line political rivals, and many Iranians
saw the trial as a political settling of scores. The judiciary in
Iran is controlled by hard-liners.
	   Karbaschi was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his
eight years as Tehran's mayor. He filed an appeal in August.
	   It was not immediately clear when Karbaschi, who has been out on
bail, will begin serving his sentence.
	   Karbaschi's lawyer Bahman Keshavarz later said his client will
protest the decision by the appeals court.
	   ``I do not accept the ruling issued by the appeals court,'' said
Kashavarz.
	   He said he will submit the protest to the prosecutor general on
Saturday.

Christmas in Iraq amid deprivation, sorrow

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A golden star of Bethlehem twinkles from
atop Yousif Habboush's Christmas tree and silver and blue streamers
hang from his dining room chandelier, but once again there will be
no turkey on the holiday table.
	   In a nearby poorer Baghdad neighborhood, Faris Boutros Mehdi
shops for presents to put beneath his small, bare, plastic
Christmas tree. A bottle of perfume for his girlfriend costs about
25,000 dinars (dlrs 14), about half of his monthly salary.
	   The rich and poor of Iraq's 500,000-member Christian community
are struggling to celebrate the season of peace on earth in a
society devastated by eight years of U.N. sanctions.
	   Recent airstrikes have only increased the misery.
	   ``People are celebrating Christmas Day, but inside they are not
joyful,'' said Matti Shaba Matoka, the Syrian Catholic archbishop
of Baghdad. ``We hope that this year we will have a Christmas of
peace.''
	   This year, Matoka will again urge his flock to stay in Iraq and
preserve a community that traces its roots to the first century,
when St. Thomas converted the initial Christians.
	   He is fighting an uphill battle.
	   About one-third of Iraq's Christians have left the country since
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Priests say there are some traditionally Christian villages in
mostly Kurdish areas of the north that are virtually abandoned.
	   Although Muslims have also fled, many Christians have relatives
in the West from earlier migrations and have found it easier to
leave.
	   ``If everybody leaves, who will remain?'' Matoka asked. On one
side of his office wall was a picture of Matoka greeting Pope John
Paul II. On the opposite wall was a picture of him meeting with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who wore an olive green military
uniform.
	   Iraq is officially a secular state, and most Christians say they
face little discrimination. Christians, however, make up only about
5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people and many feel alienated
within the overwhelmingly Muslim society.
	   ``There are some people who are narrow-minded but generally
no,'' Mehdi said when asked about discrimination.
	   In the streets of Baghdad there are Christmas decorations in
many stores and restaurants. In one neighborhood, a man in the
traditional Santa suit _ Baba Noel in Arabic _ danced in one of the
main streets.
	   Most Iraqi Christians are members of the Chaldean and Nestorian
sects, but there are also Syrian Catholics and Armenian Orthodox.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz _ a Chaldean _ is one of
several prominent Christians in the government, army and the
security forces.
	   For the Habboush family, which lives in a luxurious two-story
white villa, there is much to be thankful for this year.
	   Although the four children huddled in their parent's bedroom for
four nights as U.S. missiles slammed into the city, no one was
hurt.
	   And although sanctions have crippled the economy, Habboush owned
a construction company before the war and has been able to slowly
sell off his equipment to help make ends meet.
	   ``We are living at 25 percent of our earlier standard of
living,'' he said. ``I don't want it to fall much more.''
	   His traditional Christmas lunch _ the main holiday meal in Iraq
_ will consist of lamb soup, fish and chicken.
	   Missing will be the turkey, which can cost up to a month's
salary for an average family and that is only when it can be found.
	   Christmas will be far more austere for Mehdi, a 27-year-old lab
technician who helps support his mother, his sick father and his
three siblings.
	   His holiday meal will consist of pacha _ lamb stomach stuffed
with rice and meat topped with the lamb's head _ and date pastries.
	   ``We try our best to save money for the whole year for
Christmas,'' said Mehdi, who earns about 50,000 dinar (dlrs 28) a
month.
	   He said his salary is enough to help pay for the Christmas meal
``but I'm in really big trouble with my girlfriend.''
	   He said he doesn't have enough money for the bottle of perfume
he wants to buy for her and may have to settle for cheap imitation
perfume that sells on the streets of Baghdad for about 5,000 dinar
(about dlrs 3).
	   Above his black steel-framed bed with a sagging mattress is a
map of the United States with a picture of the Lebanese singer
Fairouz.
	   ``This is where I dream to go,'' he said smacking his hand
against the map.

Belarus' Lukashenko arrives for meeting with Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko vowed
Thursday to continue pressing for a closer union between his
country and Russia, beginning in a meeting Friday with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Lukashenko arrived in Moscow on Thursday evening. He said the
two countries were ready to sign two treaties and an agreement, and
that he was prepared to sign a political declaration setting out
the two partners' responsibilities in the proposed union.
	   The authoritarian Belarusian leader, openly nostalgic for the
Soviet Union, has urged closer political integration and dual
citizenship since Russia and Belarus signed a union treaty in 1996.
The move strengthened ties, but stopped well short of merging the
two nations.
	   Russia has been less enthusiastic. The nation of nearly 150
million people has a multitude of economic and social problems,
while Belarus, with about 10 million people, is even poorer.
	   Belarus has been suffering from food shortages, and has
introduced food rationing in some regions.
	   Still, Russia views Belarus as an important ally. Both countries
are adamantly opposed to NATO's expansion into East Europe.
	   Lukashenko promised Thursday that he would visit Moscow
frequently ``because the conversation taking place in the Kremlin
will define the future of two countries and fraternal peoples,''
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   During a trip to Moscow last week, Lukashenko pushed for
establishing a single currency _ a tacit way of asking for Russian
subsidies. The cash-strapped Russian government hasn't given an
immediate answer.

Grim Christmas for survivors of Hurricane Mitch

	   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ There are outward signs of Christmas
in Posoltega: A radio station has sent toys and the city says it
will swing donated pinatas loaded with candy from the poles of
refugee camps.
	   But there is little joy.
	   In the shadow of the Casitas volcano _ and in hundreds of other
towns across Central America _ Christmas comes too hard on the tail
of Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``What Christmas?'' asked Gregorio Sanchez, a 42-year-old farmer
and evangelical preacher who, along with his wife and five
children, lives among hundreds of other refugees in a black plastic
shelter with a dirt floor.
	   Two months ago Sanchez made a comparatively good living as a
farmer in this impoverished nation. On his 9 hectares (22 acres),
he grew crops and raised cows and pigs to sell in nearby towns.
	   Then Mitch came bringing furious rains.
	   On Oct. 30, mud thundered down the flanks of the volcano burying
the nearby villagers' land, their houses, their friends, their
relatives.
	   Many hundreds died at the volcano. Officials estimate the storm
killed about 3,000 people in Nicaragua and about 9,000 in the
region.
	   With many roads and bridges still cut, Honduran officials are
still reporting new deaths from starvation.
	   Sanchez's old village, called Rolando Rodriguez, is covered by a
gray expanse of dried mud, rocks and uprooted trees.
	   Wearing the stained shirt he wore when he fled, Sanchez gave an
eerie tour of the trampled world where he once lived.
	   ``Here was the school,'' he said, beside a rock twice his
height.
	   ``Here was the evangelical church. There was the house of Don
Felipe Diaz, who shut himself up in the house with his sons and
daughters, and they all died together when the mudslide destroyed
it.''
	   ``There was the bar of Adriana Munoz, who saved herself and her
daughters. Here was the children's dining hall. Last Christmas they
gave toys to the children. We don't know how many children died,''
he said.
	   From a hillside, Sanchez saw the avalanche, heard the deafening
roar. He raced to his house, rousted his family and ran back to the
hill, with other villagers running behind.
	   ``Like Lot's wife, I turned to look back and those who were
following me had disappeared. And to the east, where there had been
the fertile valley of Rolando Rodriguez, now there was nothing.''
	   The pall hanging over Christmas might have its deepest impact on
the children, who used to spend the holiday waiting for Santa to
deliver gifts.
	   Now many go to the highway, shoeless, dirty and semi-clothed to
beg coins from drivers.
	   ``This cannot be,'' Sanchez said. ``Our children are losing
their sense of shame.''

Iranian court reduces sentence of former mayor

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An appeals court has reduced the sentence of
a former Tehran mayor convicted of corruption from five years to
two years in jail, a judiciary statement said Thursday.
	   The court also reduced to 10 years from 20 years the period
Gholamhossein Karbaschi was banned from assuming public office.
	   It replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of 10 million
rials (dlrs 3,000), the statement said. This would be in addition
to the original fines he was ordered to pay: 1 billion rials (dlrs
330,000) as punishment and 600 million rials (dlrs 200,000) that he
must pay back the city.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
had been a target of hard-line political rivals, and many Iranians
saw the trial as a political settling of scores. The judiciary in
Iran is controlled by hard-liners.
	   Karbaschi's lawyer Bahman Keshavarz later said his client will
protest the decision by the appeals court.
	   ``I do not accept the ruling issued by the appeals court,'' said
Keshavarz.
	   He said he will submit the protest to the prosecutor general on
Saturday.
	   Karbaschi was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his
eight years as Tehran's mayor. He filed an appeal in August.
	   It was not immediately clear when Karbaschi, who has been out on
bail, will begin serving his sentence.
	   During his trial, which lasted more than a month, Karbaschi
admitted to making mistakes, but denied stealing public money.
	   Karbaschi won wide respect for his work as mayor. He built parks
and social centers and reduced pollution and traffic congestion.
But he also made enemies among the merchant class which resented
his taxes and his support for Khatami, a moderate cleric who
believes in relaxing the Islamic social code. His pro-Khatami
stance also incurred the enmity of hard-liners.
	   Riots erupted in Iran soon after Karbaschi's arrest in April.
	   For many Iranians, the televised trial gave the first insight
into Iran's judicial process and moderates saw it more as an
indictment of the judiciary than the mayor.

U.N. concerned at intensified rebel attacks in Sierra Leone

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council has expressed
concern at intensified rebel attacks in Sierra Leone and urged all
countries to abide by an arms embargo against rebel forces and
neighboring Liberia.
	   ``The members of the council expressed how imperative it is that
the rebels put an end to their atrocities,'' the council said
Wednesday in a press statement read by Bahrain's U.N. Ambassador
Jassim Mohammed Buallay, the current council president.
	   The rebels are believed to have killed, maimed and raped
thousands of rural villagers in a revenge campaign to widen their
influence through fear.
	   Council members condemned the participation of foreign forces on
the rebel side and expressed ``serious concern at the large number
of armaments flowing into the hands of the rebels in an organized
manner.''
	   The council reaffirmed its support for the government of
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah and for the Nigerian-led West African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
	   Kabbah's government has been waging war against members of
Sierra Leone's ousted military junta and its rebel allies since
March, when ECOMOG troops drove Sierra Leone's military junta from
power to clear the way for Kabbah's return to power.
	   Kabbah had been ousted from power in a May 1997 coup.
	   In Sierra Leone, ECOMOG troops pounded the outskirts of the
capital, Freetown, with heavy artillery and air attacks Wednesday
amid fears of a rebel advance on the city. But the force later said
reports of the rebel attack were false.
	   The bombardment followed several days of fighting between ECOMOG
and rebels in towns surrounding Freetown. The capital was quiet
today.

Ethnic Albanians claim Serb forces launch attack on Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb forces backed by tanks and
artillery attacked a Kosovo rebel stronghold Thursday, burning
houses and killing at least one person, ethnic Albanian sources
said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military targeted six
villages near Podujevo, 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital, Pristina, and had sealed off all roads to the
area.
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the
attack. Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   The violence threatens to revive the war between secessionist
ethnic Albanians and Serb security forces. From February to
October, 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 lost their homes.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed that shelling and machine-gun
fire in the area had killed one person.
	   Grunnet said a convoy of Yugoslav army vehicles, including
several Russian-built T-55 tanks, left bases in Pristina and
Podujevo early Thursday and swept through the area just west of
Podujevo.
	   He said Yugoslav authorities described the attack as a ``limited
search operation'' for suspects in Monday's killing of a Serb
policeman in the area.
	   The operation marks a significant setback to the already shaky
cease-fire agreement that ended the worst of the fighting. On
Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin warned of
the increasing violence.
	   ``A large-scale crackdown against the civilian population of
Kosovo would do nothing to improve the security situation and could
spark a cycle of violence that would seriously undermine the
cease-fire agreement,'' Rubin said in Washington.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called
the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold
challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to
halt the fighting.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian report, Serb tanks had entered
one of the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, which is fighting for independence from Serbia.
	   The report said at least one ethnic Albanian villager was killed
and several houses were set ablaze. A later report by the ethnic
Albanian center said Serb snipers had taken up positions at
``strategic points'' in the area and were firing at civilians, who
were fleeing deeper into rebel territory.
	   There was no comment from Serb sources.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   Mustafa urged foreign governments and international monitors of
Kosovo's two-month cease-fire to intervene with Yugoslav
authorities to halt the attacks.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides against
launching more attacks. The alliance's supreme commander for
Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly aggressive
Serb military and police activities.''
	   Clark said the stepped-up police activities did not conform to
Milosevic's pledges in the agreement. He reiterated that Milosevic
and top military commanders in Belgrade have been told they ``must
comply with their promises made to NATO.''

Russian parliament gives initial approval to 1999 budget

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament gave quick initial approval to the
draft 1999 budget Thursday, stoking hopes that the hardliners who
dominate the legislature would cooperate with the government to
pull Russia out of its economic crisis.
	   In contrast with the rancor and commotion that have surrounded
the passage of past years' budgets, the lower house of parliament,
known as the State Duma, refrained from lambasting the government
Thursday and voted 303-65 to approve the 1999 budget after its
first reading.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov rallied lawmakers' support in an
emotional speech before the vote, saying that Russia desperately
needs the budget to deal with the worst economic crisis since the
Soviet collapse.
	   ``The question is whether we're ready to undertake
responsibility for overcoming the crisis or will again sink into
debates, mutual recriminations and half-steps,'' Primakov said.
	   Last year, the Communists who dominate the Duma demanded more
spending on social programs and the dismissal of leading reformers
from the Cabinet as conditions for approving the budget.
	   Now, the severity of the economic crisis has made it clear to
all that the government doesn't have money for more social
spending. And Russia's new Cabinet, formed as a compromise with the
Communists, doesn't include radical reformers.
	   Primakov warned lawmakers before the vote that he would resign
along with his Cabinet if the budget were rejected.
	   A lean budget is essential for resolving the economic crisis. It
is also a key condition for getting new foreign loans, which Russia
desperately needs to help pay off its huge debts.
	   Many lawmakers said the budget was far from perfect, but argued
that the situation was too dire to put off approval.
	   ``The budget rejection or a significant delay in its passage
would bring our country to such a situation that the economic
crisis of August and September would seem like a time of economic
prosperity,'' Alexander Zhukov, the chairman of the Duma's budget
committee, told the session.
	   August and September were among the most painful months for many
Russians. Their wages and savings lost value by the day as the
ruble fell, banks froze individual accounts, and food all but
disappeared from some stores during a few days of panic-buying.
	   The draft budget is based on an average rate of 21.5 rubles to
the dollar and forecasts 30 percent inflation next year. But the
ruble has already fallen below 20 rubles to the dollar and
inflation this year is expected to top 70 percent.
	   ``Is there any single person who believes that forecast? No,
there is not,'' said prominent liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky,
an economist.
	   The budget also relies on dlrs 7.2 billion in foreign loans that
may not come, and counts on restructuring almost half of Russia's
dlrs 17.5 billion foreign debt _ something foreign lenders have yet
to agree to.
	   Russia's coffers are so bare that the entire 1999 budget calls
for government spending of just 575 billion rubles (dlrs 29
billion) and revenues of only 474 billion rubles (dlrs 24 billion).
	   By comparison, the United States government collects and spends
more than dlrs 30 billion in an average week.
	   The Duma must vote several more times on the budget in coming
weeks, and then send it to the upper house, the Federation Council.
The next Duma vote is unlikely to take place until next month at
the earliest.

OSCE reports violations in Kazak presidential race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Multiple violations have marred the preparations
for a January presidential election in the Central Asian nation of
Kazakstan, international observers said Thursday.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
criticized Kazakstan's government for barring two prominent
opposition leaders from the race, intimidating voters, and allowing
too little time for campaigning, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Kazakstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev is the overwhelming
favorite in the race in this former Soviet republic.
	   Nazarbayev's critics say he will not allow opposition candidates
to mount full-fledged campaigns against him.
	   Nazarbayev will face Communist Party leader Serkbolsyn Abdildin;
Engels Gabbasov, a teacher, writer and lawmaker; and Sany Kasymov,
head of Kazakstan's customs committee, in the Jan. 10 election.
	   Former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin was barred from
running after attending a meeting of an unregistered political
group, and Asylbek Amantai, leader of an opposition political
movement, was shut out of the campaign because he was jailed nine
months ago for organizing an illegal meeting.

Saddam says U.S. attack violated principles of Jesus

 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Saddam's Christmas message: U.S. strike
violated the teachings of Jesus
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a Christmas message to his people,
President Saddam Hussein said that U.S. and British airstrikes on
Iraq violated the teachings of Jesus and called on all believers to
``face up to these criminals.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam issues a Christmas address each year.
	   ``The rulers of America and Britain... are the enemies of God,''
Saddam said in his address, which was carried by the official Iraqi
News Agency.
	   ``Their criminal aggression was against not only Iraq but also
against humanity, mankind and the principles called for by Jesus,''
he said.
	   The United States and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq
in the early hours of Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its
weapons inspectors saying that Iraq was blocking their work.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the inspectors to return.
	   In his address, Saddam called on all believers to ``face up to
these criminals who respect no sanctity.''
	   Iraq's state-run newspapers said Thursday that Iraqis will not
be intimidated by U.S. threats of renewed strikes to force Baghdad
to allow the resumption of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   The arms inspection teams now exist only ``in the sick dreams
entertained by America,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said in a
front-page editorial.
	   The inspectors are working to dismantle Iraq's programs to build
weapons of mass destruction. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until the weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq says more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers were killed in
the strikes on some 100 targets.
	   The Babil newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son Odai, warned that the United States and Britain might strike
again.
	   ``The possibility of military action which they wave as a means
of psychological terror will not be more than what our people and
military units have already seen,'' the paper said.
	   The Iraqi military has remained on alert, despite the end of the
strikes.
	   Road junctions, strategic sites and main roundabouts in Baghdad
are still patrolled by militia of the ruling Baath Party, a move
taken just before the airstrikes began. Air defenses remain ready.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An appeals court has reduced the jail
sentence of a former Tehran mayor convicted of corruption from five
years to two years, a judiciary statement said Thursday.
	   The court also reduced to 10 years from 20 years the period
Gholamhossein Karbaschi was banned from assuming public office.
	   It replaced his sentence of 60 lashes with a fine of dlrs 3,000,
statement said. This would be in addition to the original fines he
was ordered to pay: dlrs 330,000 as punishment and dlrs 200,000
that he must pay back the city.
	   Karbaschi, a key ally of moderate President Mohammad Khatami,
had been a target of hard-line political rivals, and many Iranians
saw the trial as a political settling of scores. The judiciary in
Iran is controlled by hard-liners.
	   Karbaschi was found guilty in July of embezzlement during his
eight years as Tehran's mayor. He filed an appeal in August.
	   It was not immediately clear when Karbaschi, who has been out on
bail, will begin serving his sentence.
	   Karbaschi's lawyer Bahman Keshavarz later said his client will
protest the decision by the appeals court.
	   ``I do not accept the ruling issued by the appeals court,'' said
Keshavarz.

Poll shows Netanyahu would lose against all three likely

contenders &QL; 
 &UR; With Israel-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would
lose against each of the likely candidates to face him in early
elections, according to a poll published Thursday.
	   According to the poll taken by the Maariv daily and Gallup, the
leader of the opposition, a just-announced contender and another
who has yet to announce his candidacy would beat the hardline
premier who has led Israel for two and a half years.
	   No single candidate is expected to receive enough of the votes
in the first round, and elections will probably go to a run-off.
	   Labor Party Ehud Barak _ until recently the only other serious
contender _ would receive 45 percent as opposed to Netanyahu's 38
percent in a final run for the premiership. Those saying they would
vote for neither, or didn't know, amounted to 17 percent.
	   Support for Netanyahu and Barak had been almost even in polls
for months until recent weeks when the leader of the Labor Party
pulled ahead.
	   Dan Meridor, who left Netanyahu's Likud Party on Wednesday to
announce his candidacy at the head of a centrist party that has yet
to be formed, would receive 44 percent of the vote over 33 percent
for Netanyahu in a run-off. Twenty-three percent of respondents
said they would vote for neither or did not know for whom they
would vote.
	   The fourth candidate, former army chief of staff Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, would come out the winner with 48 percent of the
vote over Netanyahu's 33 percent. Eighteen percent said they did
not know for whom they would vote, or would not vote.
	   Shahak left the army only Thursday and has yet to officially
announce his candidacy. He has said he may join Meridor's party and
would serve under him if polls revealed Meridor had a greater
chance to beat Netanyahu.
	   Israel's parliament, the Knesset, gave initial approval to early
elections on Monday when nationalists and doves alike united in
opposition to Netanyahu's peace policies.
	   Nationalists were incensed at Netanyahu's agreement to further
territorial concessions to the Palestinians, made two months ago at
U.S.-brokered talks in Wye, Maryland. Doves _ among them, Barak _
say that Netanyahu's recent freeze on the concessions is
endangering the peace.
	   The election bill is slated to pass its second and third
readings next month. Israeli media reports say the elections may be
held on April 27.
	   The Maariv-Gallup poll was conducted Wednesday evening and
questioned 560 people. It had a margin of error of 4.5 percent.

Wild elephants kill five in India's remote northeast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ A herd of wild elephants went on a rampage
in India's remote northeast, trampling to death at least five
people and critically injuring two others, a wildlife warden said
Thursday.
	   The attack took place Wednesday when nearly 50 wild Asiatic
elephants entered the village of Tingri, near the Ikhipathar
reserve forest where many elephants live, the warden said on
condition of anonymity.
	   An infant was among the dead in the stampede, which also
destroyed 50 mud huts.
	   Tingri is in Assam state, which has a population of nearly 5,000
elephants.
	   Another five people were killed in a similar elephant rampage
last week in Sonitpur area, 150 miles (240 kilometers) north of the
Assam capital of Gauhati.
	   Anwaruddin Chaudhary, a wildlife expert, said a shrinking
habitat and a disproportionate rise in the number of elephants in
the past 15 years have led to change in the elephants' behavior.
	   Wild elephants have killed nearly 400 people in Assam in the
past 10 years, Chaudhary said.

 &UR; Defying NATO threats, Serb forces strike at Albanian stronghold
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with statements by KLA and Serbian spokesmen,
eyewitness reports. RECASTS and CHANGES byline
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO and U.S.
warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck against a Kosovo Albanian
rebel stronghold Thursday, dealing a blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the troubled Serb province.
	   Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several
others injured in what Serb officials reportedly called a
``limited'' operation in search of the killers of a Serb policeman
slain in the area Monday.
	   Ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said
``our police must continue to clamp down against the terrorists,''
referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. The
province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military raided six
villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital, Pristina.
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack
in a ``fierce battle.''
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. Ethnic Albanians
said three others were injured in the blast and that many more
injuries were reported in other villages that came under the
attack.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed shelling and machine-gun fire
in the area but had no details about the extent of the fighting.
	   Grunnet also confirmed one death and said the operation ended by
late afternoon. He said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles,
including several Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases
in Pristina and Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west
of Podujevo and launched the operation.
	   He said Yugoslav authorities told the OSCE the sweep was a
``limited search operation.'' But Grunnet told CNN-International
that the operation seemed more than ``a normal police operation
than you see in most countries of the world.''
	   The operation marks a new setback to the already shaky
U.S.-brokered cease-fire agreement that ended the worst of the
fighting on Oct. 12. About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000
fled their homes in fighting that began Feb. 28 when Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic launched a crackdown on ethnic
Albanian secessionists.
	   On Wednesday, State Department spokesman James Rubin warned of
the increasing violence.
	   ``A large-scale crackdown against the civilian population of
Kosovo would do nothing to improve the security situation and could
spark a cycle of violence that would seriously undermine the
cease-fire agreement,'' Rubin said.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called
the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold
challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to
halt the fighting.
	   Adem Demaci, a speaker for the KLA, said that people fled the
new Serb offensive and claimed that about 100 Serb tanks were
involved in the operation.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian report, Serb tanks had entered
one of the villages, Lapastica, a stronghold of the KLA. The APTN
crew saw one U.S. observer vehicle enter Lapastica moments before
heavy gunfire was heard in the village.
	   The ethnic Albanian report said several houses were set ablaze.
A later report by the ethnic Albanian center said Serb snipers had
taken up positions at ``strategic points'' in the area and were
firing at civilians, who were fleeing deeper into rebel territory.
	   Xemail Mustafa, a spokesman for for the province's ethnic
Albanian leaders, said ``This offensive confirms our worst fears
that the Serbian regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to
launch an action aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of
Kosovo.''
	   Mustafa urged foreign governments and the international monitors
sent to Kosovo to verify a two-month-old cease-fire to intervene
with Yugoslav authorities to halt the attacks.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides against
launching more attacks. The alliance's supreme commander for
Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly aggressive
Serb military and police activities.''
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana echoed those concerns,
saying in Brussels, Belgium, that the escalating violence and
killings ``pose a grave risk to the cease-fire.''
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' he said.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ An American tourist was stopped at Moscow's
international airport Thursday for allegedly trying to smuggle dlrs
125,000 in cash out of Russia, a news report said.
	   Russian customs officials said the money was hidden in the man's
luggage, the Interfax news agency reported. They said he was a
tourist returning from Moscow to New York. No other details were
immediately available.
	   Also on Thursday, customs officials confiscated dlrs 40,000 in
undeclared cash from the luggage of a Czech Republic national, who
was flying to Prague, Interfax reported.
	   Customs officials at Sheremetyevo airport also confiscated five
bars of gold, weighing about 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds), from a
Vietnamese citizen, the report said.
	   A criminal investigation has been launched in each case.
	   Russia's State Customs Committee said Thursday that in the first
six months of the year, officers confiscated around dlrs 5 million
and 430 kilograms (946 pounds) of gold from suspected smugglers,
Interfax reported.

<TEXT>
	   CAEN, France (AP) _ One of three men caught tunneling to a bank
vault managed to escape police by fleeing into crowds of Christmas
Eve shoppers in this Normandy town Thursday.
	   The trio in their mid-20s was digging a tunnel to the vault of a
Societe Generale in downtown Caen overnight Tuesday when police
caught them in the act, managing to arrest two of them. The other
fled into the night.
	   On Thursday morning, police had driven the two handcuffed
suspects from jail to the courthouse downtown when one of them
broke away from two escorting officers and ran, officials said on
customary anonymity.
	   With his hands cuffed behind his back, the suspect managed to
evade officers after a short pursuit, blending into crowds of
Christmas shoppers in the commercial district, authorities said.
	   Officials declined to identify the suspects but said the two
were locals with past police records.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II celebrated this Christmas
with his mind on the next one, looking ahead eagerly to the opening
of the jubilee year that will launch Christianity's third
millennium.
	   John Paul was delivering his Christmas Eve Mass homily from St.
Peter's Basilica. From there, on Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will open
2000 celebrations with the traditional jubilee-year opening of the
basilica's usually closed main doors.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, I shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the opening of
the holy door,'' John Paul said in an advance text of his Christmas
Eve homily.
	   ``It will be a truly great holy year. For in a completely unique
way, it will celebrate the 2000th anniversary of the event and
mystery of the incarnation in which humanity reached the apex of
its calling. God became man in order to give man a share in his own
divinity.''
	   ``This is the good news of salvation. This is the message of
Christmas! The church proclaims it tonight by means of my words,
too, for the peoples and nations of the whole Earth to hear.
	   ``Christ is born for us. Come, let us adore him!''
	   John Paul, increasingly frail at 78, has long looked forward to
the Jubilee Year as a culminating event of his papacy, now in its
21st year.
	   The Christmas Eve Mass opens a busy few days for the pope, who
has kept his schedule light to save his strength for the holiday
services. He fell sick with the flu last week, forcing him to
cancel some of his events on his calendar.
	   The pope no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning in St.
Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest up from the
midnight Mass Christmas Eve.
	   He is scheduled to keep up his tradition of appearing before
tourists and pilgrims in the square at noon on Christmas Day, when
he reads a Christmas message and gives holiday greetings in dozens
of languages.
	   After Christmas, the pope plans to have his usual few days of
rest at the papal residence in a town outside Rome.

Marines in the desert make the best of their sandy white Christmas

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ There was not a tree in sight, let alone one with
decorations, and instead of snow they had sand, plenty of it, but
some 1,000 U.S. Marines tried to make the best of Christmas Eve in
the Kuwaiti desert on Thursday.
	   The chaplain of the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit read from the
Bible. The cooks served a hot dinner of lasagna, baked beans and
rice. And the troops contributed their own sense of the occasion.
	   ``We will light a candle, sing Christmas carols, and exchange
rocks for presents,'' said Sgt. Tony Williams of Waco, Texas.
	   Lance Cpl. Michael Morris recommended the dinner's crumb cake.
It was extra crunchy, he said, with sand.
	   Morris said he found it hard to ``get in the mood of Christmas''
in a windswept camp 20 kilometers north of Kuwait City. Back home
in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the festive season is usually ``very
snowy.''
	   The marines arrived in Kuwait earlier this week. They were
deployed as part of the operation in which U.S. and British forces
carried out four days of airstrikes against Iraq to punish it for
its alleged obstruction of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The United States stationed some 5,000 troops in Kuwait to
protect the oil-rich state from an Iraqi counterattack. Baghdad's
troops invaded Kuwait in 1990 and occupied it for seven months
before being driven out by a U.S.-led coalition in the Gulf War.
	   Cpl. Robert Katz of New Rochelle, N.Y., said Christmas was about
being with the people dearest to your heart, and ``we're all
friends and family here.''
	   He said the men had held a competition in their trenches to see
who could etch the best Christmas tree or stocking on the sandy
walls.
	   ``Whatever we can do for morale,'' Katz explained.
	   As Sgt. Williams put it, ``we were not afforded the opportunity
to buy things, so we have to make do with our surroundings.''
	   However, the troops will have a real Christmas present on
Friday. They are being flown out of the sandy wastes to USS Belleau
Wood, their amphibious assault ship in the Gulf. On board they can
expect a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings that the U.S. Navy
can provide.

Olympic question: When is a gift a bribe?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY SIDDONS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Among Olympic perks, there are gifts, favors and
possibly bribes.
	   And then, there are bulldogs.
	   As the International Olympic Committee wrestles with its
greatest ethics scandal and three panels investigate alleged
bribery in Salt Lake City's bid for the Winter Games, IOC members
and potential host cities face the issue of where friendliness ends
and corruption begins.
	   Atlanta, like most bid cities, handed out gifts to visiting IOC
members, and at least one had four legs and a wet nose _ a bulldog
for a Cuban delegate.
	   ``You get caught up in the entertainment mode and you may do
things that stretch the rules,'' said Charlie Battle, who was in
charge of international relations in Atlanta's winning bid for the
1996 Olympics. ``You go over the top.''
	   In what may have been one of the most creative acts of
gift-giving, Atlanta boss Billy Payne gave a bulldog to IOC member
Manuel Gonzalez Guerra after he admired Uga, the mascot of Payne's
alma mater, the University of Georgia.
	   ``The biggest problem we had was getting Customs to let him take
the dog back,'' Battle said. ``They don't like people taking things
to Havana from the United States. Maybe they were afraid we were
hiding spy gear in his collar.''
	   There's no way of knowing if Guerra voted for Atlanta in the
secret balloting in Tokyo in 1990, and IOC rules now limit gifts to
a total of dlrs 150 a member - meaning any current canine giveaways
would probably involve a mutt.
	   In the two weeks since the Salt Lake Organizing Committee said
families of six IOC members received dlrs 400,000 in college
scholarships during its successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games,
Olympic organizers past, present and future have defended their
work amid allegations that the scandal extends far beyond Utah.
	   Marc Hodler, the IOC's senior member and one of its most
respected, said 5 to 7 percent of the committee's 115 members were
open to bribes and that vote buying occurred in the campaigns for
the 1996, 1998 and 2000 Olympics.
	   Olympic organizers and IOC members say they have done nothing
wrong and played by the rules, but they also acknowledged that
those rules are now being drastically tightened by the Salt Lake
case.
	   ``The USOC has made it clear to us what we can and cannot do,''
said Nick Vehr, the head of Cincinnati's bid. ``We have their
entire undertaking on limits of gifts and such.''
	   The USOC had no rules on bidding when Salt Lake City finally won
the Olympics on its fifth try in 1995, according to committee
president Bill Hybl.
	   The IOC imposed its first limits in 1986, after the volume of
gifts and favors in the campaigns for the 1992 Games became
embarrassing. Those ``tokens'' included fur coats, diamond jewelry
and unlimited first-class travel for members who wanted one more
peek at cities like Paris, Barcelona and Brisbane.

Defying NATO threats, Serb forces strike at Albanian stronghold
</HEADLINE>

fighting continuing late Thursday &QL;

	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO and U.S.
warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck against a Kosovo Albanian
rebel stronghold Thursday, dealing a blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the troubled Serb province.
	   Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several
others injured in what Serb officials reportedly called a
``limited'' operation in search of the killers of a Serb policeman
slain in the area Monday.
	   In a statement distributed Thursday night by the government's
Tanjug news agency, Serb police said they ``liquidated'' several
``terrorists'' in the rebel stronghold Lapastica after guerrillas
fired at the police with ``different arms.''
	   Ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said
``our police must continue to clamp down against the terrorists,''
referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. The
province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military raided six
villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital, Pristina.
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack
in a ``fierce battle.''
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. Ethnic Albanians
said three others were injured in the blast and that many more
injuries were reported in other villages that came under the
attack.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   ``I just had time to pick up my children and flee,'' said
Shukrije Bashota, 28, from the rebel-controlled village Lapastica.
``I have nothing else with me.''
	   An elderly woman from Glavnik, who identified herself only as
Cefzere, said Serb attackers ``opened grenade fire at us even
before our children were awake. We are in the mountains without
bread. I don't know what we are going to do.''
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed shelling and machine-gun fire
in the area. Grunnet also confirmed one death and said fighting was
continuing late Thursday.
	   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ethnic
Albanian snipers were firing in the area.
	   Grunnet said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including
several Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases in
Pristina and Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west of
Podujevo and launched the operation.
	   He said Yugoslav authorities told the OSCE the sweep was a
``limited search operation.'' But Grunnet told CNN-International
that the operation seemed more than ``a normal police operation
that you see in most countries of the world.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A golden star of Bethlehem twinkles atop
Yousif Habboush's Christmas tree and silver and blue streamers hang
from his dining room chandelier, but once again there will be no
turkey on the holiday table.
	   In a nearby poorer Baghdad neighborhood, Faris Boutros Mehdi
shops for presents to put beneath his bare, plastic Christmas tree.
He can't afford to buy his girlfriend a bottle of perfume for
25,000-dinars (dlrs-14), about half of his monthly salary.
	   The rich and poor of Iraq's 500,000-member Christian community
are struggling to celebrate the season of peace on earth in a
society devastated by eight years of U.N. sanctions.
	   Recent airstrikes have only increased the misery.
	   ``People are celebrating Christmas Day, but inside they are not
joyful,'' said Matti Shaba Matoka, the Syrian Catholic archbishop
of Baghdad. ``We hope that this year we will have a Christmas of
peace.''
	   This year, Matoka will again urge his flock to stay in Iraq and
preserve a community that traces its roots to the first century,
when St. Thomas converted the initial Christians.
	   He is fighting an uphill battle.
	   About one-third of Iraq's Christians have left the country since
sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Priests say there are some traditionally Christian villages in
mostly Kurdish areas of the north that are virtually abandoned.
	   Although Muslims have also fled, many Christians have relatives
in the West from earlier migrations and have found it easier to
leave.
	   Iraq is officially a secular state, and most Christians say they
face little discrimination. Christians, however, make up only about
5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people and many feel alienated in
the mainly Muslim society.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz _ a member of the Chaldean sect
_ is one of several prominent Christians in the government, army
and the security forces.
	   For the Habboush family, which lives in a luxurious white villa,
there is much to be thankful for this year: No one was hurt during
four nights of U.S. missile strikes.
	   Habboush owned a construction company before the war and has
been able to slowly sell off his equipment to help make ends meet
under punishing U.N. sanctions.
	   ``We are living at 25 percent of our earlier standard of
living,'' he said. ``I don't want it to fall much more.''
	   His traditional Christmas lunch _ the main holiday meal in Iraq
_ will consist of lamb soup, fish and chicken.
	   Missing will be the turkey, which can cost up to a month's
salary for an average family _ when it can be found.

Egyptian minister: Apology not enough for killing civilians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An apology is not enough for the death of a
Lebanese women and six of her children killed in an Israeli air
raid on eastern Lebanon, the Egyptian foreign minister said
Thursday.
	   Amr Moussa also called on Israel to respect international laws
that forbid attacking civilian targets.
	   A Lebanese woman and six of her seven children were killed
Tuesday during an Israeli bombing raid on the eastern Lebanese
village of Nabi Sheet. The woman's husband and an 11-year-old son
were wounded in the attack.
	   The Israeli army later expressed regret for the loss of civilian
lives, saying its jets struck a civilian target by mistake while
trying to hit a guerrilla training facility and broadcast station.
	   ``Egypt condemns the killing and attacks against civilians, and
an apology is not enough,'' Moussa told reporters Thursday.
	   Lebanese guerrillas retaliated Wednesday by showering northern
Israeli settlements with Katyusha rockets, injuring 16 Israelis _
15 suffered from shock, and one suffered moderate wounds.
	   ``Israel should respect international laws and charters that
prohibit attacks on civilians,'' Moussa said, adding that Lebanese
and Palestinian people were as human as Israelis.
	   The latest violence threatened to undermine a U.S.-brokered
ceasefire agreement reached in April 1996 to spare civilians.

Pakistan slams India's defense pact with Russia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan warned Thursday that a
military deal between neighboring India and Russia was the
precursor to a ``massive new weaponization'' drive in South Asia _
home to the world's two newest nuclear powers.
	   A foreign ministry statement condemned the new defense pact on
military and technical cooperation recently signed by its uneasy
neighbor India and Russia.
	   ``We are heavily concerned and dismayed that at the turn of the
millennium, when promotion of peace and economic development are
the focus of endeavors in other regions, South Asia must bear the
burden of massive new weaponization for the fulfillment of India's
hegemonistic goals,'' the statement said.
	   Pakistan and India have fought three wars since the South Asian
subcontinent gained its independence from Britain in 1947.
	   In May the two countries exploded underground nuclear devices
and declared themselves nuclear powers.
	   The international community moved quickly to slap on economic
sanctions, which have since been relaxed because of the danger,
particularly to Pakistan, of economic collapse.
	   However the United Nations, and the United States in particular,
has been pushing India and Pakistan to scale back their military
might to avoid a nuclear arms race on the volatile subcontinent,
home to more than one billion people.
	   Calling the agreement between India and Russia a ``dangerous
development,'' the Pakistani foreign ministry statement warned that
it will only hurt attempts at negotiations between the two
countries.
	   With more weapons in India's arsenal, Pakistan said New Delhi
will be less inclined to negotiate and more inclined to use
military force in regional disputes, most notably the 51-year-old
Kashmir dispute.
	   Pakistan and India have twice gone to war over the Himalayan
state, which both countries lay claim to. They fought a third war
in 1971 over Bangladesh or what was then East Pakistan.
	   Kashmir was split between the two countries by departing British
rulers. Since then both India and Pakistan claim a united Kashmir.

	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO and U.S.
warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck against a Kosovo Albanian
rebel stronghold Thursday, triggering what both sides called fierce
fighting and dealing a blow to U.S.-led peace efforts.
	   Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several
others injured in what they termed a major Serb offensive. Serb
officials said the ``limited'' operation was launched in search of
killers of a Serb policeman slain in the area Monday.
	   In a statement distributed Thursday night by the government's
Tanjug news agency, Serb police said they encountered ``fierce
fire'' but ``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel
stronghold Lapastica.
	   The statement said the operation was continuing Thursday night.
Ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said ``our
police must continue to clamp down against the terrorists,''
referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army.

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	   -0-
	   Tages Anzeiger, Zurich, Switzerland, on impeachment and Iraq:
	   In recent days America has waged war _ on Iraq and on its own
president. Never, since the end of the irreconcilable Vietnam
debate, have two political camps been so hostile towards each other
as in Congress at the weekend for the decision on the impeachment
of Bill Clinton.
	   It was the hard-liners who decided this confrontation. The small
number of moderate Republicans were rolled flat.
	   This does not show a shortcoming in the American constitution,
but primarily the weakness of the parliamentary system. As in the
Weimar Republic, the voice of the center was eliminated ... in
Washington, with the aim of preventing the moderating influence of
a middle way. ...
	   It is high time that the forces in the Senate put an end to the
scandal. The United States, a world power, must end its internal
war over the sex and lies of the president and return to political
concerns. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Berliner Morgenpost, Berlin, on Clinton impeachment:
	   For the second time in its history the American House of
Representatives have formally opened impeachment proceedings
against a U.S. president. An historic step? Maybe. But only when
man understands history. Because only historians knew just a few
months ago that the first president was not Nixon, but Andrew
Johnson _ Abraham Lincoln's vice president and successor. Johnson's
case, that was also primarily burdened with party political
interests and less from real political shortcomings, failed in the
Senate _ and Clinton's case also has hardly a chance to get the
needed two-thirds majority for an impeachment. Not the least
because the American people have said clearly what it thinks of it:
Nothing. With the last election in November the Republicans had to
take clear losses, and also with their vote on the weekend they
helped the image of Clinton in the public more that hurt it, as the
latest polls show. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Clinton impeachment:
	   ... President Nixon resigned from office in 1974 before the
House of Representatives took an impeachment vote against him in
the Watergate scandal because he thought he could not avoid
impeachment. ...
	   President Nixon said in a tearful voice that he had decided to
resign from his office to give priority to the national interest.
	   In contrast, President Clinton, during a visit to Palestinian
territory last week, said impeachment would not benefit the state
or the people.
	   Even after he was impeached, he declared that he was determined
to continue the work of his presidency until the last hour of the
last day of his term, emphasizing that remaining in office would
benefit the people.
	   We fear that the partisan confrontation will increase during the
impeachment trial in the Senate and the U.S. political situation
will go into further confusion. ...
	   We hope that the impeachment trial, which begins early next
year, will proceed smoothly and that U.S. politics will regain its
balance and stability as early as possible.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Figaro, Paris, on Israeli politics:
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has no choice: he is
no longer in a position to take even the least important political
stand.
	   For a few months, the West has expressed surprise at his
conduct. One day he shakes the hand of (Palestinian leader Yasser)
Arafat and concludes a peace agreement. Then, a week later, he
blocks the process.
	   In the United States and Europe, one thing is being said of
late: that (Netanyahu) either no longer knows what he wants, or
that he's lying to everybody.
	   The Israeli prime minister has his back to the wall. He has had
to accept the resignation of his foreign minister and finance
minister. Each departure reduced his majority.
	   He was elected by a coalition across the Israeli right after
saying he knew how to restore security to the streets of Israel.
For voters, he was the man to restore peace.
	   This policy was doomed from the start.
	   It deliberately ignored the tricky existence of Palestinian
authority. It neglected world opinion, and ignored the fact that
the United States was determined to help Arafat. This was triple
neglect.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Independent, London, on Israel:
	   Benjamin Netanyahu's fall from power in Israel is hardly a
surprise. For two-and-a-half years he has flirted with disaster,
turning this way and that, feinting toward peace when the eyes of
the world were on him, and then throwing scraps to his hard-line
supporters when he thought he could get away with it. ... At this
stage, no one knows who will take power. We shall have to hold our
breath while we wait to see what emerges, but as long as Mr.
Netanyahu and his allies do not survive, the wait will be well
worth it.
	   Netanyahu's premiership has served only to divide Israelis. Now
that nation needs a leader with a historic sense of mission, strong
and confident enough to compromise over the creation of a
Palestinian state. ... A prime minister who can live up to the best
in the Israeli tradition _ a Ben-Gurion, or even a Begin _ is
desperately needed. ... Only one thing is certain: the religious
zealotry and self-defeating folly of this government should not be
allowed to return through the division of its opponents.

	   La Vanguardia, Barcelona, Spain, on Mideast peace process:
	   The weaknesses of (Clinton, Netanyahu and Arafat) have condemned
the peace process. But not all three are equally to blame.
Netanyahu is a case on his own. He gained power after allying with
the Israeli sectors most opposed to withdrawal from the West Bank
although he maintained that the only thing he was concerned with
was Israel's security. But now, however, when his most extreme
allies have withdrawn their support, all has been laid bare: the
question was not one of security but rather opposition to any
substantial withdrawal from the West Bank. ... In the end,
Netanyahu has achieved part of his objective: early elections means
the peace process will be frozen for another four months. Then the
electorate will decide.
	    &UR; ___
	   Il Messaggero, Rome, on U.S. air strikes against Iraq:
	   The war stirred up by the United States and Britain against Iraq
did not produce winners.
	   The list of those defeated is very impressive: Bill Clinton and
Tony Blair, Russia and China, Arafat and the Palestinians, the
United Nations and Europe. Saddam Hussein should also appear on
this ``black list.''
	   Clinton was unable to explain the legitimacy of his decision,
arousing suspicion that the timing was in some way linked to the
impeachment process. Only Blair sided with him militarily: a
dishonorable sign of his historical, tactical and psychological
subjection.
	   Even Russia and China were not part of the American preventive
diplomacy dialogue, even if they are permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council.
	   The missiles on Baghdad annulled the success of Clinton's
historical visit to Palestinian territories, where, once again, the
``Stars and Stripes'' has been put to flames.
	   The United Nations' credibility has been destroyed by both
Clinton and Saddam, and Europe showed once again that it is unable
to find a common political voice. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Frankfurt, on Iraq:
	   Everything is fine, but Saddam stays. This is how the political
result of the latest Middle East war against Iraq could be
summarized. It is disastrous. ... The latest military strike has
hurt Saddam (the population even more so), but it has increased the
dictator's standing among the Arab masses.
	   Washington has served word that it now intends to oust Saddam
Hussein from his throne in the long term. That is not realistic.
Nobody knows what would be supposed to happen after a coup in Iraq.
It also seems that no one has given it any serious thought. ... The
Americans are now helpless with Iraq, they don't know what to do
next.
	    &UR; ___'
	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on Clinton impeachment:
	   The impeachment of President Bill Clinton by the U.S. House of
Representatives goes far beyond the fortunes of a flawed man or the
careers of his vindictive opponents. It bears on issues of
governance that make it more difficult for proponents of the
American Way to spread their message across the globe. What stands
revealed is the hand of bloody-minded adversarial politics, which
divides a nation within and paralyzes its workings abroad just when
its leadership of the world is most needed. There are no heroes in
this story, only an array of small men taking turns to hold hostage
institutions intended to deliver the state from harm.
	   ...in its self-righteous zeal to bring him down, no matter what
it takes or how long it takes or whom it hurts or how badly it
hurts, Congress has made a mockery of its responsibilities to the
people who have elected it. Very many members of that institution
seem consumed by vengeance...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Jordan Times, Amman, Jordan, on France-Iraq:
	   All eyes are now focused on the French initiative that President
Jacques Chirac on Sunday said France would launch to deal more
reasonably with the Iraqi situation following the U.S. and British
attack on that country. President Chirac is already on record as
being opposed to any military action against Iraq without the
consent of the U.N. security Council.
	   This places Paris in a unique position to take an initiative
that can be acceptable to all sides especially Iraq. Russian and
Chinese solidarity lend valuable support to it within the U.N.
Security Council. There is a basic agreement between the three
major capitals that the case of Iraq must be returned to the
council as sine qua non to any meaningful, just and permanent
settlement of the decade_long crisis.
	   The Arab capitals have been caught off guard by the events of
last week and saw their mild and ineffective reactions overshadowed
by Russian, Chinese, and Vatican pronouncements. The Arab World
needs to get its act together by adopting a clear and coherent
stance on the Iraq situation and on how to deal with it in the
aftermath of last week's bombardments of the country.
	    &UR; ___
	   Clarin, Buenos Aires, on the bombardment of Iraq:
	   The end of the U.S.-British attack on Iraq raises more questions
than it answers. The military campaign, it would seem, has caused
important damage to strategic installations of Saddam Hussein's
regime ...
	   Hussein has made clear that from now on he will not allow more
U.N. weapons inspectors, arguing that the attack has destroyed the
object of those inspections.
	   It is impossible to tell if the missiles have met with such
success and it is very possible that chemical weapons arsenals
still survive or can be replenished ... As such, the outcome
heralds the start of a new stage of hard negotiation, or future
conflicts. Neither of the two alternatives promises an improvement
for world security.

	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO and U.S.
warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck against a Kosovo Albanian
rebel stronghold Thursday, dealing a blow to U.S.-led efforts to
bring peace to the troubled Serb province.
	   Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several
others injured in what Serb officials reportedly called a
``limited'' search operation for the killers of a Serb policeman
slain Monday in the area.
	   In a statement distributed Thursday night by the government's
Tanjug news agency, Serb police said they ``liquidated'' several
``terrorists'' in the rebel stronghold Lapastica after guerrillas
fired at the police.
	   Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav Seselj said ``our police must
continue to clamp down against the terrorists,'' referring to the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. The
province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, said Serb police and military raided six
villages near Podujevo, 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the
provincial capital, Pristina.
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack
in a ``fierce battle.''
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. Ethnic Albanians
said three others were injured in the blast and that many more
injuries were reported in other villages that came under the
attack.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   ``I just had time to pick up my children and flee,'' said
Shukrije Bashota, 28, from the rebel-controlled village Lapastica.
``I have nothing else with me.''
	   An elderly woman from Glavnik, who identified herself only as
Cefzere, said Serb attackers ``opened grenade fire at us even
before our children were awake.''
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, confirmed shelling and machine-gun fire
in the area. Grunnet also confirmed one death and said fighting was
continuing late Thursday.
	   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said ethnic
Albanian snipers were firing in the area.
	   Grunnet said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including
several Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases in
Pristina and Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west of
Podujevo and launched the operation.
	   He said Yugoslav authorities told the OSCE the sweep was a
``limited search operation.'' But Grunnet told CNN-International
that the operation seemed like more than ``a normal police
operation.''
	   The operation marks a new setback to the U.S.-brokered
cease-fire agreement that ended the worst of the fighting on Oct.
12. About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic launched a crackdown on ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called
the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold
challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to
halt the fighting.
	   Adem Demaci, a speaker for the KLA, said that people fled the
new Serb offensive and claimed that about 100 Serb tanks were
involved in the operation.
	   Xemail Mustafa, a spokesman for for the province's ethnic
Albanian leaders, said ``This offensive confirms our worst fears
that the Serbian regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to
launch an action aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of
Kosovo.''
	   Mustafa urged foreign governments and the international monitors
sent to Kosovo to verify a two-month-old cease-fire to intervene
with Yugoslav authorities to halt the attacks.
	   On Wednesday, two top NATO officials warned both sides against
launching more attacks. The alliance's supreme commander for
Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, complained of ``increasingly aggressive
Serb military and police activities.''

commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter held a
secret meeting in Los Angeles Wednesday night, a few hours after
the league said a settlement must be reached by Jan. 7 to save the
season.
	   An NBA spokesman confirmed the meeting, which was the first
between the men since Dec. 11.
	   It took place at the office of agent Leonard Armato, who in the
past has tried to act as a peacemaker between Stern and Hunter.
	   There was no immediate word whether any progress was made.
	   Armato, who flew to New York earlier this month and brokered a
meeting between Stern and Hunter, did not return several phone
messages.

<TEXT>
	   The Evening Post, Wellington, New Zealand, on Clinton
impeachment:
	   The Clinton impeachment is the stuff of Shakespearean tragedy. A
talented and popular president, leader of the most powerful country
in the world, risks being brought down by his fondness for sexual
dalliance and his ill-judged attempts to cover his tracks by lying.
It is a tragedy of potentially epic scale: tragic not just for
Clinton personally, but for his country . . . and for the world
which desperately needs stability in the White House.
	   One thing must be said: President Clinton is a louse. He is a
sexual predator and prevaricator. But he has also been an effective
leader _ and since when were United States presidents required to
be as morally pure as the driven snow?
	   Yes, President Clinton behaved badly; but his misdemeanors
scarcely warrant impeachment. It is hard to escape the feeling that
the vote against him in the House of Representatives represents the
dark face of old-fashioned American Puritanism. It also represents
the dark face of American hypocrisy _ a fact dramatically
demonstrated by the shocking resignation of Bob Livingstone.
	   The question must be asked: how many politicians in Washington
can place their hands on their hearts and say they haven't cheated?
And where will the witch-hunt end?
	   At a time when the world desperately needs American leadership
on a range of pressing issues including world economic recovery,
peace in the Middle East and Saddam Hussein's Iraq, Washington is
preoccupied with its domestic imbroglio and Clinton is fighting for
his political survival.
	   It's a huge penalty to pay for a fleeting sexual encounter and
unfortunately it's not just President Clinton who will suffer.
	   Shakespeare would have loved it.
	    &UR; ___
	   The New York Times, on possible censure of President Clinton:
	   The Senate seems inclined to treat Bill Clinton's misconduct in
a fair and responsible way, provided the President will let it do
so. Though Senate sentiment has not yet coalesced around a specific
plan, both Republicans and Democrats are talking of censure as the
most appropriate punishment. For the last couple of days Mr.
Clinton and his aides have seemed in better touch with political
reality. They can help keep the Senate on a conciliatory course by
dispensing with the legal quibbling that has helped bring his
Presidency to the brink of destruction and by continuing to send
receptive signals about censure. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Washington Post, on freedom of speech in China:
	   So now we know the cost of speaking freely in China: 13 years
behind bars. That's the sentence handed down after a sham trial to
Xu Wenli, who tried to organize a Chinese Democratic Party. Fellow
democrats Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin were sentenced to 11 and 12
years, respectively. None was allowed to mount a defense.
	   In October China's Communist rulers signed, to great
self-congratulation and international acclaim, a treaty that
recognizes freedom of speech and freedom of association as
universal rights. Mr. Xu and his colleagues have now been sent back
to the Chinese gulag for seeking to exercise them. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Tidings, Ashland, Oregon, on Clinton impeachment:
	   President Clinton by now should realize that his chief legacy
will be impeachment.
	   The entire affair is a tragedy for America. Bill Clinton's
presidency is in tatters, and it's his own fault. He has shown
disrespect for the people of his country, his co-workers, his
family and others. He no longer deserves to be president.
	   No, the current scandal is not Watergate. That's a no-brainer.
But Bill Clinton apparently did lie under oath, intending to
mislead the prosecutor, the grand jury and the American people by
doing so.
	   Those abroad and at home who claim that this is still a sexual
inquisition do not get it: the President of the United States is
formally accused of lying under oath. If a police officer, a
teacher, a plumber, a nurse or a reporter did that _ and the
charges were proven _ he or she would go to prison. The president
must be held to the same standard we all are.
	   ... We do not know whether Bill Clinton will be convicted by the
Senate on these serious charges. But we are convinced that he
should face them, as the Constitution outlines. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Cincinnati Enquirer, on Clinton impeachment:
	   Historians may need to get professional help from psychologists
to analyze President Clinton's speech last Wednesday night,
justifying a surprise attack on Iraq. Words aimed like Tomahawk
missiles at Saddam Hussein boomeranged and blew up in the
president's face.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam disarmed
the inspectors,'' Mr. Clinton said _ unintentionally describing his
own strategy to block ``inspections'' of White House scandals.
	   He said Saddam was given ``one last chance,'' but ``failed to
seize it.'' How many chances at contrition and confession has Mr.
Clinton failed to seize with his insincere, carefully parsed
apologies?
	   His ``powerful message'' to Saddam was: ``If you act recklessly,
you will pay a heavy price'' _ exactly the powerful message to Mr.
Clinton of impeachment by the House yesterday.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Index-Journal, Greenwood, South Carolina, on Saddam Hussein:
	   Response from some nations critical of the American and British
action against Saddam Hussein is patently self-serving. That's
obvious, even as they so often pretend to be our friends.
	   Russia, China and France are among those who have disagreed with
steps taken to punish Saddam. Russia and China, in fact, have
``demanded'' that we stop.
	   That, of course, should surprise nobody. These three nations,
particularly, have been known to sell technology and military
equipment and jet fighters to Saddam. Even nuclear and germ warfare
materials have been shipped to him. ...
	   It's amazing how in times like these that some nations are quick
to lambaste the United States. Many of them are the same ones that
want _ expect _ us to provide them with security, food and all
kinds of aid.
	   It is one more indication why we should always keep our guard
up, and that means not letting our military and its equipment
decline. We've learned that lesson many times _ too many times.

Saddam says U.S. attack violated principles of Jesus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Saddam's Christmas message. No
Pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a Christmas message to his people,
President Saddam Hussein said that U.S. and British airstrikes on
Iraq violated the teachings of Jesus and called on all believers to
``face up to these criminals.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam issues a Christmas address each year.
	   ``The rulers of America and Britain... are the enemies of God,''
Saddam said in his address, which was carried by the official Iraqi
News Agency.
	   ``Their criminal aggression was against not only Iraq but also
against humanity, mankind and the principles called for by Jesus,''
he said.
	   The United States and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq
in the early hours of Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its
weapons inspectors saying that Iraq was blocking their work.
	   Iraq has said it will not let the inspectors return.
	   In his address, Saddam called on all believers to ``face up to
these criminals who respect no sanctity.''
	   Iraq's state-run newspapers said Thursday that Iraqis will not
be intimidated by U.S. threats of renewed strikes to force Baghdad
to allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume.
	   The arms inspection teams now exist only ``in the sick dreams
entertained by America,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said in a
front-page editorial.
	   The inspectors are working to dismantle Iraq's programs to build
weapons of mass destruction. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until the weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq says more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers were killed in
the strikes on some 100 targets.
	   The Babil newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son Odai, warned that the United States and Britain might strike
again.
	   ``The possibility of military action which they wave as a means
of psychological terror will not be more than what our people and
military units have already seen,'' the paper said.
	   The Iraqi military has remained on alert, despite the end of the
strikes.
	   Road junctions, strategic sites and main roundabouts in Baghdad
are still patrolled by militia of the ruling Baath Party, a move
taken just before the airstrikes began. Air defenses remain ready.

Albania calls for international pressure on Serbia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian government urged NATO on
Thursday to intervene to stop fighting in Kosovo in wake of a Serb
offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in the Podujevo area.
	   ``The Albanian government calls the international community to
use all measures to avoid a new wave of genocide in Kosovo after
the last Serbian offensive in Podujevo region,'' the Albanian
foreign ministry said in a statement.
	   It said that renewing the conflict in Kosovo would be
``extremely dangerous for the peace and the stability in all the
region. The political pressure on Belgrade should be continued with
all necessary measures.''
	   The Albanians said NATO intervention ``is necessary to end the
Kosovo drama and also to give to this question the desired solution
from all the parties.''
	   Speaking to parliament, Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko
accused the Yugoslav government of trying to provoke a renewal of
fighting.
	   ``The stand of the Albanian government is clear,'' he said. ``We
respect the will of the Albanians of Kosovo and also we respect the
international principals. We call the political forces of Kosovo to
unify their stands and also we call the political parties of
Albania to agree on one stand on Kosovo issue.''

France condemns Serb attacks in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France on Thursday condemned ``with the greatest
firmness'' the resumption of Serb attacks in the restive Yugoslav
province of Kosovo, calling them disproportionate to recent Kosovo
rebel activity.
	   At the same time, France criticized ``provocation by the UCK''
rebels as ``unjustifiable ... feeding the cycle of attacks and
repression,'' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
in a statement.
	   She referred to a recent attack in which six Serbs were killed
in the town of Pec.
	   Aware of ``the risks of a resumption of hostilities and the
escalation of violence,'' France called for ``a commitment toward a
political dialogue between the two parties,'' the spokeswoman said.

Chernomyrdin's party removes parliamentary leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Members of former Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin's political movement party followed his lead on
Thursday and voted to replace their parliamentary leader.
	   Thirty-six members of the Our Home is Russia parliamentary
grouping voted for removing Alexander Shokhin from the leadership
post, while four supported him, Russian media reported.
	   Shokhin said he would leave the parliamentary grouping.
	   ``I will build an independent political career,'' Shokhin was
quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Chernomyrdin accused Shokhin of weakening the parliamentary
grouping and not consulting enough with other leaders of the
movement.
	   For his part, Shokhin has departed from the party line on
several issues. He recently publicly supported forming an alliance
with Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, and two days ago he proposed
replacing the leadership of Our Home Is Russia, including
Chernomyrdin himself.
	   Shokhin served 10 days as deputy prime minister in charge of
financial policy under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov before
resigning and returning to his parliamentary post. At the time of
his resignation, he expressed frustration about the differences
among Cabinet members over Russia's economic strategy.
	   He had served as deputy premier and economics minister at the
start of Russia's free-market reforms in 1992-95.

Hunger-striking kidnappers stop drinking water
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Eight hunger-striking kidnappers on
Thursday stopped drinking water, underscoring their determination
to die if the Brazilian government doesn't release them.
	   The group is in prison for the 1989 kidnapping Abilio Diniz,
owner of Brazil's largest supermarket chain, demanding ransom in a
bid to fund Salvadoran rebels.
	   The five Chileans, two Argentines and one Brazilian stopped
eating on Nov. 16 to pressure the government to send the foreigners
home and pardon the Brazilian. Two Canadians also convicted in the
kidnapping, David Lamont and Christine Spencer, were transferred to
a Vancouver prison on Nov. 20.
	   Breno Altman, president of the Committee to Free Political
Prisoners, said the decision to stop drinking water was reached
``when it became clear that the government would not release the
prisoners after their sentences were reduced.''
	   Last week, a Sao Paulo court reduced the kidnappers' sentences
to between 15 and 18 years from 26 to 28 years, opening the way to
a possible paroled as early as February.
	   However, Sao Paulo Judge Otavio Augusto Machado do Barros said
that early release for those still in Brazil would depend on a
number of factors including their behavior while in prison.
	   ``They are not automatically entitled to anything,'' he said
last week. ``They have failed all their psychological evaluations
and have shown no remorse for their crime.''
	   The prisoners are hospitalized at Sao Paulo's Hospital das
Clinicas where doctors said that without water the prisoners could
die within five days.
	   Doctors said they would obey a court order to force-feed them
with a mixture of sodium, potassium and carbohydrates, once they
lose consciousness.
	   ``They (the prisoners) are fully aware of the consequences of
their decision,'' Altman said. ``Their fate is now in the hands of
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso who is the only one who can
authorize the expulsion and pardon.''
	   Cardoso on Thursday said Congress was expected to approve in
January prisoner transfer treaties with Chile and Argentina similar
to the one that befitted Spencer and Lamont.
	   ``This is the best solution to the impasse,'' Cardoso said,
urging the prisoners to stop their hunger strike.
	   The hunger strikers are: Ulisses Acevedo, Maria Marchi Badilla,
Pedro Lembach, Sergio Urtubia and Hector Ramon Tapia of Chile;
Humberto and Horacio Paz of Argentina; and Brazilian Raimundo
Freire.

	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO and U.S.
warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck against a Kosovo Albanian
rebel stronghold Thursday, triggering what both sides called fierce
fighting and dealing a blow to U.S.-led peace efforts.
	   In neighboring Albania, the Foreign Ministry called for NATO to
intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the overwhelming
majority.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC-Television that
the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments''
undertaken by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in October to
end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several
others injured in what they termed a major Serb offensive against
six villages near this town 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of
Pristina.
	   Serb officials said the ``limited'' operation was launched in
search of killers of a Serb policeman slain in the area Monday.
	   In a statement distributed Thursday night by the government's
Tanjug news agency, Serb police said they encountered ``fierce
fire'' but ``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel
stronghold Lapastica.
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice premier, Vojislav
Seselj, said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the
terrorists,'' referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. The
province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   In London, a KLA political representative, Pleurat Sejdru, told
BBC-TV that a unilateral cease-fire which the rebels declared more
than two months ago ``doesn't have any sense to be in place.''
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack
in a ``fierce battle.'' Both sides said fighting was continuing
late Thursday.
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. Ethnic Albanians
said three others were injured in the blast and that many more
injuries were reported in other villages that came under the
attack.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   ``I just had time to pick up my children and flee,'' said
Shukrije Bashota, 28, from the rebel-controlled village Lapastica.
``I have nothing else with me.''
	   An elderly woman from Glavnik, who identified herself only as
Cefzere, said Serb attackers ``opened grenade fire at us even
before our children were awake. We are in the mountains without
bread. I don't know what we are going to do.''
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles,
including several Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases
in Pristina and Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west
of Podujevo and launched the operation.
	   Although he said Yugoslav authorities called the attack a
``limited search operation,'' But Grunnet told CNN-International
that the sweep seemed more than ``a normal police operation that
you see in most countries of the world.''
	   The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called
the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold
challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to
halt the fighting.
	   Adem Demaci, a speaker for the KLA, said that people fled the
new Serb offensive and claimed that about 100 Serb tanks were
involved in the operation.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said several houses were set ablaze and
that Serb snipers had taken up positions at ``strategic points'' in
the area and were firing at civilians, who were fleeing deeper into
rebel territory.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for for the province's ethnic Albanian
leaders.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   Milosevic called off the crackdown Oct. 12 under an agreement
reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. But U.S. efforts to
begin talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians on the future of the
province have stalled.
	   The ethnic Albanians are demanding independence, which the
United States and the Europeans also reject. The Serbs insist on
nothing more than expanded self-rule for Kosovo within the Serbian
republic.
	   On Wednesday, State Department spokesman James Rubin warned of
the increasing violence which ``could spark a cycle of violence
that would seriously undermine the cease-fire agreement.''

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ A Greek diplomat was killed by automatic
weapons-fire Thursday in the Georgian capital Tbilisi, police said.
	   Anastasius Mizitrasos, 37, had been working as a security
attache at Greece's embassy in Tbilisi since March 1997. He was
shot and killed by unidentified gunmen just inside the house where
he lived with his wife and child, said Demuri Beradze, duty officer
of the district police in the prestigious Vake neighborhood of the
capital.
	   The gunmen escaped in a car, and burned it, Russian media
reported.
	   Russia's ORT public television station reported speculation in
Tbilisi that the killing was tied to disputes over the issuing of
Greek visas to Georgian workers who provide ``cheap labor.''
However, Georgian police would not discuss possible motives for the
killing.
	   An investigation into the killing has been launched, Beradze
said.

Christmas celebrations worldwide survive tensions

 &UR; Eds: Will be TOPPED with Mass, Pope message &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ He was delayed for a few hours by a
manhunt for a prison escapee suspected in the killings of two
Israelis, but Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in Bethlehem on
Christmas Eve in time to make it for celebrations.
	   The festive mood despite the dragnet in the town of Jesus' birth
was apposite: occasional intrusions of the profane did not keep
many Christians around the world from the sacred business of
celebration.
	   Boy Scout bagpipe bands marched through Bethlehem the day, and
crowds of wellwishers greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel Sabbah.
	   As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers
filled Manger Square _ despite published pleas by Mayor Hanna J.
Nasser, who told The Associated Press he considers such displays
inappropriate at Christmas.
	   Bethlehem was handed over from Israeli to Palestinian rule three
years ago just before Christmas, and the fireworks were a
celebration of independence.
	   It didn't bother Heather Taylor, 25, a teacher from Winnsboro,
Texas. ``This is where it all started,'' she said. ``I'm here to be
near to the place of the person I love, the Savior I love.''
	   Nasser would get his wish for decorum later in the evening, with
Midnight Mass in the Church of St. Katherine, next to the
fourth-century Church of the Nativity, built on the traditional
birthplace of Jesus.
	   For the overflow, a three-meter(-yard)-square television screen
was set up, tuned into Palestinian television, which will broadcast
the mass live.
	   The choir of the Salem Baptist Church of Chicago was rehearsing
for its pre-Mass performance.
	   Jamell Meeks said things had changed since 1992, the last time
the choir performed, during the ``intefadeh,'' the Palestinian
uprising.
	   ``All that scary stuff isn't going on,'' she said.
	   As Palestinians grow more confident in their sovereignty, the
nationalist tone of previous Christmases has been played down:
instead of the two-story high portrait Arafat of earlier years,
smaller depictions of the Palestinian leader hung from streamers
over Manger Square.
	   A manhunt for Jamil Jadala, a Bethlehem native accused of
involvement in the killings of two Israelis in October, was still
underway when Arafat arrived in Bethlehem early Thursday evening.
	   Arafat is under pressure from Israel to contain anti-Israel
violence. Jadala's escape from a Nablus jail earlier this week has
embarrassed him, and when Bethlehem police received a tip he had
returned to the area of his hometown, they went on immediate alert.
	   Tensions intruded into Christmas celebrations elsewhere in the
world.
	   In Jakarta, Indonesia's Christian leaders, shaken by recent
attacks by Muslim mobs on Christian churches, appealed for racial
and religious harmony.
	   The world's fourth most populous nation has endured sporadic
riots in recent months as social and religious tensions rise amid
the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   In the Kuwaiti desert, some 1,000 U.S. Marines in the region to
meet any Iraqi threat in the region tried to make the best of
Christmas Eve in the desert.
	   The United States and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq
in the early hours of Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its
weapons inspectors saying that Iraq was blocking their work.
	   Cpl. Robert Katz of New Rochelle, New York, said Christmas was
about being with the people dearest to your heart, and ``we're all
friends and family here.''
	   On the others side of the border, President Saddam Hussein said
that the recent U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq violated the
teachings of Jesus and called on all believers to ``face up to
these criminals.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam issues a Christmas address each year.
	   ``We hope that this year we will have a Christmas of peace,''
said Matti Shaba Matoka, the Syrian Catholic archbishop of Baghdad.
	   The bleak Christmas did not stop Faris Boutros Mehdi from
shopping for presents to put beneath his small, bare, plastic
Christmas tree. A bottle of perfume for his girlfriend costs about
25,000 dinars (dlrs 14), about half of his monthly salary.
	   The effects of eight years of U.N. sanctions have limited
celebrations in Iraq; in hundreds of towns across Central America,
natural disaster wiped out the holiday entirely.
	   ``What Christmas?'' asked Gregorio Sanchez, a 42-year-old farmer
and evangelical preacher who lives with a wife and five children in
a dirt-floor shelter of black plastic shelter in Posoltega,
Nicaragua, alongside hundreds of other refugees.
	   Two months ago, the rains of Hurricane Mitch were followed by
mud, burying their lands, their houses, their friends, and often
their families.
	   Elsewhere, others could celebrate a reemergence of Christmas.
	   In Havana, Cubans crowded markets to buy pork roasts and other
traditional foods for a Christmas made especially festive by the
recent reinstatement of Dec. 25 as a permanent holiday.
	   In Asmara, Eritrea, a Christmas tree decked with glowing lights
dominated a traffic island on Asmara's main thoroughfare. Another
adorned the central post office where electronic Christmas jingles
play throughout the day.
	   A western version of Christmas is making inroads in this
half-Muslim, half Orthodox Christian capital of 400,000 in the Horn
of Africa.
	   Those driving the observance of western-style Christmas on Dec.
25 are minority Roman Catholics and Protestants _ and the many
Eritreans who have returned from years of exile in western nations,
after Africa's newest nation became independent from Ethiopia in
1993.
	   ``I lived in Piscataway, New Jersey, for 11 years, so I'm used
to celebrating on the 25th,'' said Luz Yosief, an Eritrean who now
works for the U.N. Development Program.

EU helps Central Asia reopen old trade routes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ At a time when the European Union is
opening its arms to eastern Europe, the five Central Asian
economies _ once trading hubs for merchants traveling the Silk Road
_ lobby for their share of EU support.
	   Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan
_ former Soviet republics that broke with Moscow in 1991 _ are
counting on the EU to help them develop proper laws, managerial
know-how and reliable infrastructure.
	   ``They still have a long way to go,'' said Cees Wittebrood, an
official at the EU executive Commission who deals with relations
between the 15-nation bloc and Central Asia, the Caucasus and
Mongolia.
	   ``The way ahead of them is now getting bumpier, with the
economic impact of the Russian crisis and the political impact of
the civil war in Afghanistan.''
	   He said the EU's role is to ``give focus'' to the Central Asian
economies. ``They have a guiding light, which is integration into
European structures.''
	   The EU believes its political possibilities are limited in
Central Asia and that economic partnership is the best way to make
a difference and contribute to political stability in a volatile
region.
	   Central Asia lies at a strategic crossroads linking China,
Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran and Turkey. Countries there,
particularly Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, are wide open to
fundamentalist influences from Afghanistan.
	   The EU tries to counter these through economic aid. Over the
1991-1997 period, it committed some dlrs 280 million to the five
Central Asian countries, out of a total dlrs 2 billion dollars for
all 15 ex-Soviet republics and Mongolia.
	   In a way, the EU seeks to open up again the Old Silk Road. ``We
want to rebuild the roads that in the old days were used to link
East and West,'' says Wittebrood.
	   Caravans of silk, gold and incense once journeyed through the
rugged landscape of Central Asia, and some believe the former
Soviet states could revive their old, mercantile tradition.
	   ``Traditionally, trade between the Far East and China transited
through our countries,'' says Uzbekistan's Ambassador to the EU
Alisher Faizullaev.
	   EU economic aid aims to help restore old pipelines and bring
countries in the region together to discuss options for new
pipeline routes. Turkey, Iran and Romania want those new pipelines
to run through their territory.
	   ``We do not take a position. We do not express a preference. It
is up to the Central Asian countries to decide,'' said Wittebrood.
	   Bazaars still dot the road once traveled by Marco Polo.
	   But instead of silk and spices, the Central Asians hope oil and
gas will flow along the old routes once they successfully shed the
burdensome economic legacy of Soviet rule.
	   Central Asia has enormous potential in oil, gas, and minerals.
European investors are already involved in major projects, with
Germany by far the biggest investor.
	   Turkmenistan has lots of oil and gas. So does Kazakhstan but it
also has gold, uranium, copper and other minerals. Uzbekistan has
gold and is a big producer of cotton. Kyrgyzstan banks on
hydroelectricity. Tajikistan has gold deposits, but not much else.
	   Central Asians view EU expansion talks with 10 East European
neighbors and Cyprus, that began in November, as a positive
development that could in turn benefit them.
	   ``Via enlargement, we'll be closer to Europe. A lot of good
things will come with EU expansion,'' says Faizullaev.
	   Wittebrood agrees.
	   Knowing that the road ahead of them is long and difficult, the
governments of these territories, once arbitrarily divided into
states by Josef Stalin, seek to build up their strength through
greater regional cooperation.
	   ``These countries do not want to entirely cut their links with
Russia, but certainly they want to reduce their dependence on
Moscow,'' says Wittebrood.

	   ORTONA, Italy (AP) _ Fifty-five Christmases ago, they were
fighting each other house-to-house in the central Italian town of
Ortona, trying to kill rather than be killed themselves.
	   This Christmas Eve, the old German and Canadian soldiers who
managed to pull that off faced each other over tables in what had
then been Ortona's bombed-out church _ sharing a holiday meal
together; savoring their shared survival.
	   ``Fifty-five years ago I was burying our dead. Digging graves,''
said Bill Teleske, 79, of Edmonton, Canada, who was a 23-year-old
private during the 1943 battle for control of the Mediterranean.
	   ``Tonight, we had a good bowl of hot soup together, a good
supper, which is more than we had then,'' Teleske said.
	   ``There's no animosity,'' he said. ``The Germans say, `It was a
very good fight _ unfortunately, you won.'''
	   Donations from people at home helped pay for the trips for the
29 Canadian veterans here after Canada's Ministry of Veterans
Affairs turned down a request for funding.
	   The Canadians talked, ate and shared old photos with seven
German veterans _ like them, survivors of a Dec. 21-27 battle for
Ortona. The bloodiness, the tight quarters of the fight between
Canadian soldiers and German infantry and paratroopers earned it
the name of the ``Stalingrad of the West.''
	   German survivors of the battle returned home to ignominy.
Thursday night's dinner at Santa Maria di Costantiniopoli with
their old enemies at least gave the German veterans a chance to
talk with someone who understood and respected their ordeal, one
said.
	   ``Soldiers don't make war. Politicians make it. That is the
point,'' said Joseph Klein, 78, of Wolssburg, Germany.
	   ``It is very, very good,'' Klein said. ``We shook hands and we
had a really nice conciliation dinner.''
	   Italian hosts served the old soldiers vegetable soup, the town's
specialty; turkey; and strudel in a side room of the church after a
service led by an Italian priest. Then, they left them to talk.
	   ``There's lot of stories circulating. Where ever there's
soldiers, there's stories. Everyone has a story to tell,'' Teleske
said.
	   ``I can only put it this way: I wouldn't go through it again for
a million dollars _ but now I've gone through it and come out alive
I wouldn't miss this for a million dollars,'' he said. ``Tonight is
a wonderful night.''

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   The Evening Post, Wellington, New Zealand, on Clinton
impeachment:
	   The Clinton impeachment is the stuff of Shakespearean tragedy. A
talented and popular president, leader of the most powerful country
in the world, risks being brought down by his fondness for sexual
dalliance and his ill-judged attempts to cover his tracks by lying.
It is a tragedy of potentially epic scale: tragic not just for
Clinton personally, but for his country . . . and for the world
which desperately needs stability in the White House.
	   One thing must be said: President Clinton is a louse. He is a
sexual predator and prevaricator. But he has also been an effective
leader _ and since when were United States presidents required to
be as morally pure as the driven snow?
	   Yes, President Clinton behaved badly; but his misdemeanors
scarcely warrant impeachment. It is hard to escape the feeling that
the vote against him in the House of Representatives represents the
dark face of old-fashioned American Puritanism. It also represents
the dark face of American hypocrisy _ a fact dramatically
demonstrated by the shocking resignation of Bob Livingstone.
	   The question must be asked: how many politicians in Washington
can place their hands on their hearts and say they haven't cheated?
And where will the witch-hunt end?
	   At a time when the world desperately needs American leadership
on a range of pressing issues including world economic recovery,
peace in the Middle East and Saddam Hussein's Iraq, Washington is
preoccupied with its domestic imbroglio and Clinton is fighting for
his political survival.
	   It's a huge penalty to pay for a fleeting sexual encounter and
unfortunately it's not just President Clinton who will suffer.
	   Shakespeare would have loved it.
	    &UR; ___
	   The New York Times, on possible censure of President Clinton:
	   The Senate seems inclined to treat Bill Clinton's misconduct in
a fair and responsible way, provided the President will let it do
so. Though Senate sentiment has not yet coalesced around a specific
plan, both Republicans and Democrats are talking of censure as the
most appropriate punishment. For the last couple of days Mr.
Clinton and his aides have seemed in better touch with political
reality. They can help keep the Senate on a conciliatory course by
dispensing with the legal quibbling that has helped bring his
Presidency to the brink of destruction and by continuing to send
receptive signals about censure. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Washington Post, on freedom of speech in China:
	   So now we know the cost of speaking freely in China: 13 years
behind bars. That's the sentence handed down after a sham trial to
Xu Wenli, who tried to organize a Chinese Democratic Party. Fellow
democrats Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin were sentenced to 11 and 12
years, respectively. None was allowed to mount a defense.
	   In October China's Communist rulers signed, to great
self-congratulation and international acclaim, a treaty that
recognizes freedom of speech and freedom of association as
universal rights. Mr. Xu and his colleagues have now been sent back
to the Chinese gulag for seeking to exercise them. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Tidings, Ashland, Oregon, on Clinton impeachment:
	   President Clinton by now should realize that his chief legacy
will be impeachment.
	   The entire affair is a tragedy for America. Bill Clinton's
presidency is in tatters, and it's his own fault. He has shown
disrespect for the people of his country, his co-workers, his
family and others. He no longer deserves to be president.
	   No, the current scandal is not Watergate. That's a no-brainer.
But Bill Clinton apparently did lie under oath, intending to
mislead the prosecutor, the grand jury and the American people by
doing so.
	   Those abroad and at home who claim that this is still a sexual
inquisition do not get it: the President of the United States is
formally accused of lying under oath. If a police officer, a
teacher, a plumber, a nurse or a reporter did that _ and the
charges were proven _ he or she would go to prison. The president
must be held to the same standard we all are.
	   ... We do not know whether Bill Clinton will be convicted by the
Senate on these serious charges. But we are convinced that he
should face them, as the Constitution outlines. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Cincinnati Enquirer, on Clinton impeachment:
	   Historians may need to get professional help from psychologists
to analyze President Clinton's speech last Wednesday night,
justifying a surprise attack on Iraq. Words aimed like Tomahawk
missiles at Saddam Hussein boomeranged and blew up in the
president's face.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam disarmed
the inspectors,'' Mr. Clinton said _ unintentionally describing his
own strategy to block ``inspections'' of White House scandals.
	   He said Saddam was given ``one last chance,'' but ``failed to
seize it.'' How many chances at contrition and confession has Mr.
Clinton failed to seize with his insincere, carefully parsed
apologies?
	   His ``powerful message'' to Saddam was: ``If you act recklessly,
you will pay a heavy price'' _ exactly the powerful message to Mr.
Clinton of impeachment by the House yesterday.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Index-Journal, Greenwood, South Carolina, on Saddam Hussein:
	   Response from some nations critical of the American and British
action against Saddam Hussein is patently self-serving. That's
obvious, even as they so often pretend to be our friends.
	   Russia, China and France are among those who have disagreed with
steps taken to punish Saddam. Russia and China, in fact, have
``demanded'' that we stop.
	   That, of course, should surprise nobody. These three nations,
particularly, have been known to sell technology and military
equipment and jet fighters to Saddam. Even nuclear and germ warfare
materials have been shipped to him. ...
	   It's amazing how in times like these that some nations are quick
to lambaste the United States. Many of them are the same ones that
want _ expect _ us to provide them with security, food and all
kinds of aid.
	   It is one more indication why we should always keep our guard
up, and that means not letting our military and its equipment
decline. We've learned that lesson many times _ too many times.

Turkey extends mandate of U.S.-led force protecting Iraqi Kurds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's Parliament on Thursday extended
the mandate of a U.S.-led, Turkish-based allied force protecting
Iraqi Kurds from the forces of Saddam Hussein.
	   By a show of hands, lawmakers extended Operation Northern Watch
through June 30. The operation enforces a no-fly zone above the
36th parallel in Iraq, where Iraqi Kurds maintain a de facto
autonomous state.
	   The vote came a week after the United States and Britain bombed
Baghdad to punish Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons inspections.
	   The airstrikes led Turkey to close its border with Iraq for fear
of an influx of Iraqi refugees. State Minister Yucel Seckiner told
lawmakers Thursday that Turkey would be dealing with even more
would-be immigrants if Operation Northern Watch came to an end.
	   Northern Watch's mandate has been renewed every six months since
the end of the 1990-91 Gulf War.
	   More than 45 U.S. and British planes and 1,400 personnel are
part of the mission, based at the Incirlik air base near the
southern city of Adana.

Defying NATO threats, Serb forces strike at Albanian stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with KLA statement, comments by head of the
verification force &QL; 
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO and U.S.
warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck against a Kosovo Albanian
rebel stronghold Thursday, triggering what both sides called fierce
fighting and dealing a blow to U.S.-led peace efforts.
	   In neighboring Albania, the Foreign Ministry called for NATO to
intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the overwhelming
majority.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC-Television that
the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments''
undertaken in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in
October to end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several
others injured in what they termed a major Serb offensive against
six villages near this town 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of
Pristina.
	   International officials trying to verify compliance with the
October agreement estimated the Serbs employed more than 50
vehicles, including T-55 tanks and armored personnel carriers, in
the attack.
	   Serb officials said the ``limited'' operation was launched in
search of killers of a Serb policeman slain in the area Monday.
	   In a statement distributed Thursday night by the government's
Tanjug news agency, Serb police said they encountered ``fierce
fire'' but ``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel
stronghold Lapastica.
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice premier, Vojislav
Seselj, said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the
terrorists,'' referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. The
province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   In a statement issued in the provincial capital Pristina, the
KLA stopped short of the cease-fire in unilaterally proclaimed two
months ago at an end but said the rebels would ``not sit idly by''
and instead would `attack with all means available.
	   In London, a KLA political representative, Pleurat Sejdru, told
BBC-TV that the cease-fire ``doesn't have any sense to be in
place.''
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack
in a ``fierce battle.'' Both sides said fighting was continuing
late Thursday.
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. Ethnic Albanians
said three others were injured in the blast and that many more
injuries were reported in other villages that came under the
attack.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   ``I just had time to pick up my children and flee,'' said
Shukrije Bashota, 28, from the rebel-controlled village Lapastica.
``I have nothing else with me.''
	   An elderly woman from Glavnik, who identified herself only as
Cefzere, said Serb attackers ``opened grenade fire at us even
before our children were awake. We are in the mountains without
bread. I don't know what we are going to do.''
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles,
including several Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases
in Pristina and Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west
of Podujevo and launched the operation.
	   Although he said Yugoslav authorities called the attack a
``limited search operation,'' But Grunnet told CNN-International
that the sweep seemed more than ``a normal police operation that
you see in most countries of the world.''
	   The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called
the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold
challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to
halt the fighting.
	   Adem Demaci, a speaker for the KLA, said that people fled the
new Serb offensive and claimed that about 100 Serb tanks were
involved in the operation.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said several houses were set ablaze and
that Serb snipers had taken up positions at ``strategic points'' in
the area and were firing at civilians, who were fleeing deeper into
rebel territory.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for for the province's ethnic Albanian
leaders.
	   The American head of the OSCE verification force, William
Walker, expressed frustration at the apparent lack of will for a
peaceful settlement, saying ``both sides have been looking for
trouble and found it.''
	   Walker said the unarmed international verification force was
ready to help ``but we cannot go out there with arms to stop them
if they want to kill each other.''
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   Milosevic called off the crackdown Oct. 12 under an agreement
reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. But U.S. efforts to
begin talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians on the future of the
province have stalled.
	   The ethnic Albanians are demanding independence, which the
United States and the Europeans also reject. The Serbs insist on
nothing more than expanded self-rule for Kosovo within the Serbian
republic.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ All Israel's most recently-retired military
chief did Thursday was give back his uniform, declare an interest
in political life, and mouth a few pieties about hope and getting
along.
	   ``We need to make peace at home first, and then peace with our
neighbors,'' Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak said.
	   In the an elections year, peace with the Arabs may be easier.
	   ``Leftist'' bellowed hawks on the right, barely Shahak was out
the gate at military headquarters in Tel Aviv. ``Lawbreaker,'' they
threw in for good measure.
	   ``Lacks experience,'' countered the doves in opposition. And _
for the Israeli left, the equivalent of the atom bomb _ an
accusation Shahak was risking the legacy of his mentor, late
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
	   Like Colin Powell in the United States, Shahak is a successful
army man perceived by many as clean and remote enough from the
rough and tumble of politics to qualify for political leadership.
	   That has given him a lead in polls in the early elections for
prime minister.
	   A Maariv/Gallup poll published Thursday showed Shahak _ as head
of an as-yet unformed centrist party _ with the strongest chance to
beat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in elections likely to take
place by the end of April.
	   Shahak did not declare himself a candidate for prime minister,
and only vaguely committed himself to any political role.
	   But the denuding process left so many Israeli generals before
him in the cold is just beginning _ and his opponents wasted no
time in attempts at denting his armor.
	   A cartoon in the Haaretz newspaper on Thursday showed Shahak _
who started his military career as a paratrooper _ floating into a
sea of sharks.
	   Most threatened is Netanyahu, who agreed to early elections
earlier this week after he failed to get parliamentary backing for
his hard-line peace policies.
	   Netanyahu's Likud party immediately issued a statement
describing Shahak as a ``known leftist.''
	   In 1993 Rabin ordered Shahak, then deputy chief-of-staff, to
negotiate details of the then-fresh Oslo peace process with the
Palestinians. He became closely identified with the process, and
was blamed by Netanyahu for what the right perceives as policies
that left Israel vulnerable.
	   Likud figures also accused Shahak of breaking a law separating
the military from the political arena by meeting political leaders
in recent months, although he refrained from any political
pronouncements.
	   ``There's more than just a technical formality'' broken, said
Likud legislator Uzi Landau. ``An army chief-of-staff should set a
good example.'' Shahak held the meetings while he was on leave,
after he stepped down as chief-of-staff last August.
	   On the left, Labor Party legislators said Shahak was an unknown
quantity, and was not ready for the top job.
	   ``He was doing things that perhaps were more important,'' than
politics, Labor legislator Yossi Beilin said, but ``he lacks
political experience completely.''
	   ``I completed basic training 36 years ago,'' Shahak quipped.
	   Labor Party leaders bristled at a newspaper report that Shahak
would not join them because they were too closely associated with
the left.
	   In a reference to Shahak, Labor party leader Ehud Barak _
Shahak's predecessor as chief of staff _ excoriated him for the
alleged remark.
	   ``We are proud (of being on the left) and we will continue to
follow it until we win in the elections,'' he told a Labor party
meeting. ``Whoever doesn't understand this connection shouldn't use
the name of Yitzhak Rabin.''
	   It won't be the first time a golden boy of the army got
tarnished in the political arena. Most recently, Barak has
alienated many in his own party by not mounting a more credible
opposition against Netanyahu, despite a propensity for the
Netanyahu government to stumble from crisis to crisis.
	   There's a long list of decorated Israeli generals who finished
their careers in undistinguished political posts. Some 121 of
Israel's cabinet ministers since its inception have been
senior-ranking officers.
	   But Israelis remember the successes _ Moshe Dayan, who
negotiated peace with the Egyptians; Rabin, who anchored the
breakthrough with the Palestinians.
	   One former general on the other side of the political fence _
Uri Saguy _ expressed a rare note of sympathy for Shahak.
	   ``All of us, including those who are just released from the
army, are human beings and not gods, with weaknesses and faults and
with advantages of course,'' Saguy, a Likud legislator, tols Israel
army radio. ``We should relate to things in their proper
proportion.''

Ka-60 helicopter takes maiden flight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A new military transport helicopter that has been
in development since the 1980s took its maiden flight on Thursday,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The Ka-60, designed by the Kamov firm, is a twin-engined general
purpose military transport helicopter capable of carrying 14 troops
and more than 2 tons of cargo. Its development has been stalled by
the military's desperate cash shortage.
	   Gen. Vitaly Pavlov, the head of the Army Aviation Department of
the Defense Ministry, said that the army was interested in
receiving the new helicopters, Interfax reported. He said that up
to 330 Ka-60 helicopters would be used for training in military
academies.
	   The helicopter's chief designer, Vyacheslav Krygin, said serial
production would begin after flight tests are completed, in about 1
1/2 years, Interfax reported.

Forget Santa Claus. For Cubans, it's family dinner on Christmas

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Forget Santa Claus, Christmas trees and sleigh
bells in the snow. For Cubans, the family dinner on Christmas Eve
is the heart of the Christmas celebration.
	   Cubans crowded markets on Thursday to buy pork roasts and other
traditional foods for ``Noche Buena,'' which is especially festive
this year because of the declaration of Dec. 25 as a permanent
holiday.
	   ``I've never seen it this crowded this early,'' said Felicia
Margarita Baix, who arrived at the farmers' market in the Miramar
neighborhood to buy a pork leg at reduced government prices. ``This
is what it looks like for the New Year.''
	   The Dec. 24 tradition was lost or faded in importance for many
Cubans, especially after the Christmas holiday was abolished in
1969 by a government that was then officially atheist. The
government later declared itself a secular state and gradually
eased up on religious believers.
	   Interest in past Christmas traditions began to bloom last year
when the communist government granted a Christmas holiday as a
one-time favor to Pope John Paul II before his January 1998 visit
here. It was made permanent this year.
	   ``The Christmas feast is intimate, it is of the family, of the
heart,'' Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime Ortega said earlier this
week. ``It is the love of the family gathered together.''
	   The New Year's Eve dinner, coinciding with the anniversary of
the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power 40 years ago,
remains the most important holiday celebration in Cuba.
	   Both last and this year, there was a booming business in small
artificial Christmas trees selling for around dlrs 22 _ about twice
the average monthly government salary.
	   But the giving of gifts _ except for small children _ is not a
part of the celebration in a country that continues to suffer a
severe economic crisis. The figure of Santa Claus remains a mystery
to most Cubans, although he can be seen in the windows of a few
stores downtown.
	   Cubans prefer to spend their money on the family meal,
traditionally black beans and rice, a green salad with tomatoes,
perhaps yams, fried plantains or yucca, and the inevitable roast
pork.
	   On Thursday, there were long lines at the farmers market even
though some shoppers complained about the high prices. Dark rum and
beer _ the favorite Christmas drinks _ are available for pesos at
government stores.
	   But most other liquor, and imported candies like the ``turones''
from Spain that many Cubans like with their Christmas Eve meal, are
available only to about half the population who now have dollars to
purchase them in hard-currency stores.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more color; EXPANDS on manhunt; why Arafat
present; crowds down from last year; Christmas in Eritrea
celebrated on Jan. 7 &QL; 
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ He was delayed for a few hours by a
manhunt for a prison escapee suspected in the killings of two
Israelis, but Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in Bethlehem on
Christmas Eve in time to make it for celebrations.
	   The festive mood despite the dragnet in the town of Jesus' birth
was not out of place: occasional intrusions of the profane did not
keep many Christians around the world from the sacred business of
celebration.
	   Boy Scout bagpipe bands marched through Bethlehem throughout the
day, and crowds of wellwishers _ along with mounted Palestinian
police _ greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel Sabbah.
	   As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers
filled Manger Square _ despite published pleas by Mayor Hanna J.
Nasser, who told The Associated Press he considers such displays
inappropriate at Christmas.
	   Bethlehem was handed over from Israeli to Palestinian rule three
years ago just before Christmas, and the fireworks were a
celebration of independence.
	   Crowds were down this year because of security fears in the wake
of recent anti-Israel violence and protests against the U.S. and
British bombardment of Iraq.
	   It didn't bother Heather Taylor, 25, a teacher from Winnsboro,
Texas. ``This is where it all started,'' she said. ``I'm here to be
near to the place of the person I love, the Savior I love.''
	   Nasser would get his wish for decorum later in the evening, with
Midnight Mass in the Church of St. Katherine, next to the
fourth-century Church of the Nativity, built on the traditional
birthplace of Jesus.
	   For the overflow, a three-meter (yard) square television screen
was set up, tuned into Palestinian television, which will broadcast
the mass live.
	   The choir of the Salem Baptist Church of Chicago was slated for
for a pre-Mass performance.
	   Jamell Meeks said things had changed since 1992, the last time
the choir performed, during the ``intefadeh,'' the Palestinian
uprising.
	   ``All that scary stuff isn't going on,'' she said.
	   A fireworks display from the roof overlooking the square an hour
before the Midnight Mass brought cheers from the crowd below.
	   Singers in the Bethlehem Bible College choir raised their arms
to try to shield their eyes from the smoke, blowing off the roof
down into their faces.
	   As Palestinians grow more confident in their sovereignty, the
nationalist tone of previous Christmases has been played down:
instead of the two-story high portrait Arafat of earlier years,
smaller depictions of the Palestinian leader hung from streamers
over Manger Square.
	   Arafat is a Muslim, but his participation in Christmas events in
Bethlehem signals his support for the Christian Palestinian
minority.
	   A manhunt for Jamil Jadala, a Bethlehem native accused of
involvement in the killings of two Israelis in October, was still
underway when Arafat arrived in Bethlehem early Thursday evening.
	   Arafat is under pressure from Israel to contain anti-Israel
violence. Jadala's escape from a Nablus jail earlier this week has
embarrassed him, and when Bethlehem police received a tip he had
returned to the area of his hometown, they went on immediate alert
and surrounded his house.
	   Arafat was due at 4:30 p.m., but arrived 45 minutes late _ a
delay Israel army radio, citing Palestinian security sources,
attributed to security rearrangements because of the manhunt.
	   Tensions intruded into Christmas celebrations elsewhere in the
world.
	   In Jakarta, Indonesia's Christian leaders, shaken by recent
attacks by Muslim mobs on Christian churches, appealed for racial
and religious harmony.
	   The world's fourth most populous nation has endured sporadic
riots in recent months as social and religious tensions rise amid
the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   In the Kuwaiti desert, some 1,000 U.S. Marines in the region to
meet any Iraqi threat in the region tried to make the best of
Christmas Eve in the desert.
	   The United States and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq
in the early hours of Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its
weapons inspectors saying that Iraq was blocking their work.
	   Cpl. Robert Katz of New Rochelle, New York, said Christmas was
about being with the people dearest to your heart, and ``we're all
friends and family here.''
	   On the others side of the border, President Saddam Hussein said
that the recent U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq violated the
teachings of Jesus and called on all believers to ``face up to
these criminals.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam issues a Christmas address each year.
	   ``We hope that this year we will have a Christmas of peace,''
said Matti Shaba Matoka, the Syrian Catholic archbishop of Baghdad.
	   The bleak Christmas did not stop Faris Boutros Mehdi from
shopping for presents to put beneath his small, bare, plastic
Christmas tree. A bottle of perfume for his girlfriend costs about
25,000 dinars (dlrs 14), about half of his monthly salary.
	   The effects of eight years of U.N. sanctions have limited
celebrations in Iraq; in hundreds of towns across Central America,
natural disaster wiped out the holiday entirely.
	   ``What Christmas?'' asked Gregorio Sanchez, a 42-year-old farmer
and evangelical preacher who lives with a wife and five children in
a dirt-floor shelter of black plastic shelter in Posoltega,
Nicaragua, alongside hundreds of other refugees.
	   Two months ago, the rains of Hurricane Mitch were followed by
mud, burying their lands, their houses, their friends, and often
their families.
	   Elsewhere, others could celebrate a reemergence of Christmas.
	   In Havana, Cubans crowded markets to buy pork roasts and other
traditional foods for a Christmas made especially festive by the
recent reinstatement of Dec. 25 as a permanent holiday.
	   In Asmara, Eritrea, a Christmas tree decked with glowing lights
dominated a traffic island on Asmara's main thoroughfare. Another
adorned the central post office where electronic Christmas jingles
play throughout the day.
	   A western version of Christmas is making inroads in this
half-Muslim, half Orthodox Christian capital of 400,000 in the Horn
of Africa.
	   Those driving the observance of western-style Christmas on Dec.
25 are minority Roman Catholics and Protestants _ and the many
Eritreans who have returned from years of exile in western nations,
after Africa's newest nation became independent from Ethiopia in
1993. Most Eritrean Christians are Orthodox, and celebrate
Christmas on Jan. 7.
	   ``I lived in Piscataway, New Jersey, for 11 years, so I'm used
to celebrating on the 25th,'' said Luz Yosief, an Eritrean who now
works for the U.N. Development Program.

	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians, and
Saddam, who is Muslim, issues a Christmas address each year.
	   ``We hope that this year we will have a Christmas of peace,''
said Matti Shaba Matoka, the Syrian Catholic archbishop of Baghdad.
	   The bleak Christmas did not stop Faris Boutros Mehdi from
shopping for presents to put beneath his small, bare, plastic
Christmas tree. A bottle of perfume for his girlfriend costs about
25,000 dinars (dlrs 14), about half of his monthly salary.
	   The effects of eight years of U.N. sanctions have limited
celebrations in Iraq. For many in Central America, natural disaster
wiped out the holiday entirely.
	   ``What Christmas?'' asked Gregorio Sanchez, a 42-year-old farmer
and evangelical preacher. Sanchez lives with a wife and five
children in a black plastic dirt-floor shelter in Posoltega,
Nicaragua, alongside hundreds of other refugees.
	   Two months ago, the rains of Hurricane Mitch were followed by
mud, burying people's land, houses, friends, and often their
families.
	   Elsewhere, others celebrated a reemergence of Christmas.
	   In Havana, Cubans crowded markets to buy pork roasts and other
traditional foods for a Christmas made especially festive by the
recent reinstatement of Dec. 25 as a permanent holiday.
	   In Asmara, Eritrea, a Christmas tree decked with glowing lights
dominated a traffic island on the city's main thoroughfare. Another
adorned the central post office where electronic Christmas jingles
play throughout the day.
	   A western version of Christmas is making inroads in this
half-Muslim, half Orthodox Christian capital of 400,000 in the Horn
of Africa. The country's Orthodox Christians traditionally
celebrate the birth of Christ quietly at home on Jan. 7.
	   Minority Roman Catholics and Protestants have driven the
observance of western-style Christmas on Dec. 25, along with the
many Eritreans who have returned from exile in the West to live in
Africa's newest country, which gained independence from Ethiopia in
1993.
	   ``I lived in Piscataway, New Jersey, for 11 years, so I'm used
to celebrating on the 25th,'' said Luz Yosief, an Eritrean who now
works for the U.N. Development Program.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a Christmas message to his people,
President Saddam Hussein said that U.S. and British airstrikes on
Iraq violated the teachings of Jesus and called on all believers to
``face up to these criminals.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam issues a Christmas address each year.
	   ``The rulers of America and Britain... are the enemies of God,''
Saddam said in his address, which was carried by the official Iraqi
News Agency.
	   ``Their criminal aggression was against not only Iraq but also
against humanity, mankind and the principles called for by Jesus,''
he said.
	   The United States and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq
in the early hours of Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its
weapons inspectors saying that Iraq was blocking their work.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the inspectors to return.
	   In his address, Saddam called on all believers to ``face up to
these criminals who respect no sanctity.''
	   INA, quoting an army spokesman, said late Thursday that 14
formations of warplanes violated Iraqi airspace in the morning. It
did not identify the planes or say how many planes were involved,
but said they entered Iraq from Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti airspace.
	   It said the planes were out of the range of Iraqi air defenses.

Israel condemns comments of Russian Communist leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A Russian Communist Party boss who accused Jews
of causing ``mass impoverishment'' and ``extinction'' in the
country demonstrated how far his party was from the democratic
ideals it claimed to uphold, Israel said Thursday.
	   Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov, who finished second in
the 1996 presidential election, made the remarks Wednesday in
response to calls on him to denounce recent anti-Semitic comments
by others in the party.
	   ``The spread of Zionism in the state government in Russia is one
of the reasons for the current catastrophic condition of the
country, the mass impoverishment and the process of extinction of
its people,'' Zyuganov said in an open letter released.
	   The Israeli foreign ministry denounced Zyuganov's words in a
statement Thursday.
	   ``Israel severely condemns and expresses shock from these
anti-Semitic declarations that do not contribute to relations
between the Russian and Jewish peoples and the state of Israel,''
read the statement.
	   ``These statements are not consistent with (Zyuganov's) claims
that his party aims to build a democratic society in Russia,'' it
said.
	   It said it was clear that Zyuganov was drawing on an infamous
anti-Semitic forgery, ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.''
	   Under Zyuganov, the Communist party has taken on an increasingly
aggressive, nationalistic tone. Anti-Semitic rhetoric has grown
with the nation's economic troubles _ the traditional spark for
scapegoating.
	   ``Israel expresses hope that the Russian powers will find
appropriate ways to deal with this grave incident,'' read the
foreign ministry statement.

Defying NATO threats, Serb forces strike at Albanian stronghold

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO and U.S.
warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck against a Kosovo Albanian
rebel stronghold Thursday, triggering what both sides called fierce
fighting and dealing a blow to U.S.-led peace efforts.
	   In neighboring Albania, the Foreign Ministry called for NATO to
intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the overwhelming
majority.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC television that
the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments''
undertaken in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in
October to end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   Ethnic Albanians said at least one person was killed and several
others injured in what they termed a major Serb offensive against
six villages near this town 32 kilometers (20 miles) north of
Pristina.
	   International officials trying to verify compliance with the
October agreement estimated the Serbs employed more than 50
vehicles, including T-55 tanks and armored personnel carriers, in
the attack.
	   Serb officials said the ``limited'' operation was launched in
search of killers of a Serb policeman slain in the area Monday.
	   In a statement distributed Thursday night by the government's
Tanjug news agency, Serb police said they encountered ``fierce
fire'' but ``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel
stronghold Lapastica.
	   Both sides said fighting was continuing late Thursday.
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice premier, Vojislav
Seselj, said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the
terrorists,'' referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. The
province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   In a statement issued in the provincial capital Pristina, the
KLA stopped short of abrogating the cease-fire it unilaterally
proclaimed two months ago. It said, however, the rebels would ``not
sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means available.''
	   In London, a KLA political representative, Pleurat Sejdru, told
BBC-TV that the cease-fire ``doesn't have any sense to be in
place.''
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack
in a ``fierce battle.''
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of a man
killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. Ethnic Albanians
said three others were injured in the blast and that many more
injuries were reported in other villages that came under the
attack.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   ``I just had time to pick up my children and flee,'' said
Shukrije Bashota, 28, from the rebel-controlled village Lapastica.
``I have nothing else with me.''
	   An elderly woman from Glavnik, who identified herself only as
Cefzere, said Serb attackers ``opened grenade fire at us even
before our children were awake. We are in the mountains without
bread. I don't know what we are going to do.''
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles,
including several Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases
in Pristina and Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west
of Podujevo and launched the operation.
	   Yugoslav authorities called the attack a limited search
operation but Grunnet told CNN-International that the sweep seemed
more than ``a normal police operation that you see in most
countries of the world.''
	   The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called
the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold
challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to
halt the fighting.
	   Adem Demaci, a spokesman for the KLA, claimed that about 100
Serb tanks were involved in the operation.
	   Ethnic Albanian sources said several houses were set ablaze and
that Serb snipers had taken up positions at ``strategic points'' in
the area and were firing at civilians, who were fleeing deeper into
rebel territory.
	   ``This offensive confirms our worst fears that the Serbian
regime planned to use the Christmas holidays to launch an action
aimed at ethnically cleansing the north of Kosovo,'' said Xemail
Mustafa, a spokesman for the province's ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   The American head of the OSCE verification force, William
Walker, expressed frustration at the apparent lack of will for a
peaceful settlement, saying ``both sides have been looking for
trouble and found it.''
	   Walker said the unarmed international verification force was
ready to help ``but we cannot go out there with arms to stop them
if they want to kill each other.''
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   Milosevic called off the crackdown Oct. 12 under an agreement
reached with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke. But U.S. efforts to
begin talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians on the future of the
province have stalled.
	   The ethnic Albanians are demanding independence, which the
United States and the Europeans also reject. The Serbs insist on
nothing more than expanded self-rule for Kosovo within the Serbian
republic.

Only a toe into Israel's political waters, and Shahak sees sharks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with reaction to Shahak entering
politics. &QL; 
 &UR; By RON KAMPEAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The only thing Israel's former chief of staff
did on Thursday was give back his uniform, declare an interest in
political life, and mouth a few pieties about hope and getting
along.
	   In an election year, that's enough to spark a war.
	   ``We need to make peace at home first, and then peace with our
neighbors,'' said Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak as he formally ended
his military career. Shahak has been on leave since stepping down
as chief of staff in July.
	   ``Leftist,'' bellowed hawks on the right. ``Lawbreaker,'' they
threw in for good measure.
	   ``Lacks experience,'' countered the doves in opposition. Then
they dropped their version of the atom bomb: He's not worthy of the
legacy of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
	   Like Colin Powell in the United States, Shahak is a successful
army veteran perceived by many as clean and remote enough from the
rough and tumble of politics to qualify for political leadership.
	   His reputation has already given him a lead in polls in the
early elections for prime minister.
	   A Maariv/Gallup poll published Thursday showed Shahak with the
strongest chance to beat Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
elections likely to take place by the end of April.
	   That even though Shahak has not declared himself a candidate and
the centrist party everyone sees him leading doesn't even exist
yet.
	   By leaving the army, he not only became free for the first time
to talk politics _ and, many hope, run for prime minister _ he also
became free game for nervous rivals on all sides.
	   On Thursday Shahak only vaguely committed himself to any
political role, but his opponents wasted no time with a pre-emptive
strike.
	   A cartoon in the Haaretz newspaper showed Shahak _ who started
his military career as a paratrooper _ floating into a sea of
sharks.
	   Most threatened is Netanyahu, who agreed to early elections this
week after he failed to get parliamentary backing for his hard-line
peace policies.
	   Netanyahu's Likud party immediately issued a statement
describing Shahak as a ``known leftist.''
	   In 1993 Rabin ordered Shahak, then deputy chief of staff, to
negotiate details of the Oslo peace process with the Palestinians.
He became closely identified with the process, and was blamed by
the right for what it perceives as policies that left Israel
vulnerable.
	   Likud figures also accused Shahak on Thursday of breaking a law
separating the military from the political arena by meeting
political leaders in recent months, although he was on leave ahead
of his retirement and made no political statements.
	   Meanwhile, from the left, Labor party legislators said Shahak
was an unknown quantity, unready for the top job.
	   ``He was doing things that perhaps were more important,'' than
politics, Labor legislator Yossi Beilin said, but ``he lacks
political experience completely.''
	   ``I completed basic training 36 years ago,'' Shahak quipped in
response.
	   Labor leader Ehud Barak excoriated Shahak for a news report that
he was balking at joining Labor because it was too leftist.
	   ``We are proud (of being on the left) and we will continue to
follow it until we win in the elections,'' Barak told a Labor party
meeting. ``Whoever doesn't understand this connection shouldn't use
the name of Yitzhak Rabin.''
	   Barak _ Shahak's predecessor as chief of staff _ was also a
golden boy of the army who had troubles moving in to the political
arena. Many in his own party criticize him for not mounting a more
credible opposition against the crisis-ridden Netanyahu government.
	   Shahak is a long line of generals to move from the military to
politics _ some with more success than others.
	   One former general on the other side of the political fence _
Uri Saguy _ expressed a rare note of sympathy for Shahak.

army, are human beings and not gods, with weaknesses and faults and

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ He was delayed for a few hours by a
manhunt for a prison escapee suspected in the killings of two
Israelis, but Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in Bethlehem on
Christmas Eve in time to make it for celebrations.
	   The festive mood despite the dragnet in the town of Jesus' birth
was not out of place: occasional intrusions of the profane did not
keep many Christians around the world from the sacred business of
celebration.
	   Boy Scout bagpipe bands marched through Bethlehem throughout the
day, and crowds of wellwishers _ along with mounted Palestinian
police _ greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel Sabbah.
	   As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers
filled Manger Square _ despite published pleas by Mayor Hanna J.
Nasser, who told The Associated Press he considers such displays
inappropriate at Christmas.
	   Bethlehem was handed over from Israeli to Palestinian rule three
years ago just before Christmas, and the fireworks were a
celebration of independence.
	   Crowds were down this year because of security fears in the wake
of recent anti-Israel violence and protests against the U.S. and
British bombardment of Iraq.
	   It didn't bother Heather Taylor, 25, a teacher from Winnsboro,
Texas. ``This is where it all started,'' she said. ``I'm here to be
near to the place of the person I love, the Savior I love.''
	   Nasser got his wish for decorum later in the evening, with
Midnight Mass in the Church of St. Katherine, next to the
fourth-century Church of the Nativity, built on the traditional
birthplace of Jesus.
	   Sabbah fanned incense over the altar, and led a service that
included prayers in Arabic, English and Latin.
	   For the overflow, a three-meter (yard) square television screen
was set up, tuned into Palestinian television, which broadcast the
mass live.
	   The choir of the Salem Baptist Church of Chicago led a
foot-stomping pre-Mass performance.
	   Chorister Jamell Meeks said things had changed since 1992, the
last time the choir performed, during the ``intefadeh,'' the
Palestinian uprising.
	   ``All that scary stuff isn't going on,'' she said.

Friday but motorists seemed to ignore them and light traffic
continued to flow in the streets.
	   Journalists at the Al-Rasheed Hotel were blocked from leaving
the hotel and were asked by management to go to the bomb shelter.

Westerners evacuated from Sierra Leone, Foreign Office says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two British Royal Air Force Hercules military
transporter planes on Thursday evacuated 81 British and European
citizens - including nine Italian priests - from Sierra Leone, the
Foreign Office said, after an intensification of fighting between
government and rebel forces in the west African state.
	   The spokesman said that the evacuees, who were all uninjured,
were flown from Lungi airport near Sierra Leone's capital,
Freetown, to the capital of Senegal, Dakar.
	   ''A majority of them were British, some were from European
nations. There were also 9 Italian priests. That's all the people
that wanted to leave this evening,'' the spokesman, speaking on
terms of customary anonymity, said.
	   The spokesman said that the evacuation was a precautionary
measure, and that more flights may be arranged.
	   Refugees have poured into Sierra Leone's capital this week after
fighting intensified between rebel forces and Nigerian-led West
African intervention troops based in nearby towns.
	   Thousands of villagers have lost limbs and others have been
killed in attacks apparently carried out by the rebel troops,
seeking revenge for their ouster from Freetown by the West African
force in February.
	   That allowed elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah to return from
months in exile after Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma took power in a
bloody May 1997 coup.

Saddam says U.S. attack violated principles of Jesus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in grafs 11-13 with air raid sirens going off in
Baghdad, no anti-aircraft fire and Pentagon denial &QL; 
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a Christmas message to his people,
President Saddam Hussein said that U.S. and British airstrikes on
Iraq violated the teachings of Jesus and called on all believers to
``face up to these criminals.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam issues a Christmas address each year.
	   ``The rulers of America and Britain... are the enemies of God,''
Saddam said in his address, which was carried by the official Iraqi
News Agency.
	   ``Their criminal aggression was against not only Iraq but also
against humanity, mankind and the principles called for by Jesus,''
he said.
	   The United States and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq
in the early hours of Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its
weapons inspectors saying that Iraq was blocking their work.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the inspectors to return.
	   It says more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers were killed in
the strikes on some 100 targets.
	   In his address, Saddam called on all believers to ``face up to
these criminals who respect no sanctity.''
	   Since the four-day bombing campaign ended Sunday, Iraq has
accused the United States and Britain of violating Iraqi airspace
and firing two missiles near the southern city of Basra. Washington
and London denied the allegations.
	   INA, quoting an army spokesman, said late Thursday that 14
formations of warplanes violated Iraqi airspace in the morning. It
did not identify the planes or say how many were involved, but said
they entered Iraq from Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti airspace.
	   The news agency said the planes were out of the range of Iraqi
air defenses.
	   Air raid sirens sounded twice in Baghdad early Friday, the first
time since end of the bombing.
	   There was no immediate explanation. No anti-aircraft fire was
heard. Motorists seemed to ignore them, and light traffic continued
to flow in the streets.
	   Journalists at the Al-Rasheed Hotel were blocked from leaving
the hotel and were asked by management to go to the bomb shelter.
	   ``I have no knowledge why the sirens have gone off,'' Pentagon
spokesman Glenn Flood said in Washington. ``The U.S. Defense
Department is not responsible for it, and it's not doing
anything.''
	   Despite the end of the bombing, the Iraqi military remains on
alert. Road junctions, strategic sites and main roundabouts in
Baghdad are still patrolled by militia of the ruling Baath Party, a
move taken just before the airstrikes began.
	   Iraq's state-run newspapers said Thursday that Iraqis will not
be intimidated by U.S. threats of renewed strikes to force Baghdad
to allow U.N. weapons inspections to resume.
	   The arms inspection teams now exist only ``in the sick dreams
entertained by America,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said in a
front-page editorial.
	   The inspectors must verify the destruction of Iraq's nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons and long-range missiles before
tough economic sanctions imposed after Baghdad's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait can be lifted.
	   The Babil newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son Odai, warned that the United States and Britain might strike
again.
	   ``The possibility of military action which they wave as a means
of psychological terror will not be more than what our people and
military units have already seen,'' the paper said.

U.S. carrier drops anchor for Christmas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADNAN MALIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS CARL VINSON (AP) _ Some 72 planes, including 46
fighter jets, were chained down Thursday as this gigantic aircraft
carrier dropped anchor to prepare for Christmas celebrations.
	   But the partial stand-down did not alter the state of alertness
on the 97,000-ton carrier where most of its 5,000 crews worked the
normal 12 hours.
	   The USS Carl Vinson, which leads an eight-ship battle group,
took charge from the USS Enterprise, which sailed out of the Gulf
Wednesday. Several warplanes that took off from the Enterprise had
been engaged in four days of air strikes on Iraq.
	   ``We have a partial stand-down for Christmas, but at the same
time... we are having our main engines at the ready, aircraft are
on alert and ready to go to the countries' bidding whenever called
to do so,'' said Capt. David Crocker, the commanding officer of the
Carl Vinson.
	   The carrier arrived in the Gulf on Dec. 19.
	   Earlier Thursday, aircraft aboard the carrier flew some 60
sorties, including ``a couple no-fly zone missions and mainly
training missions related to proficiency flying,'' said Crocker.
	   He said the aircraft ``picked up some signals from the Iraqi air
defense encampments, but none of them were threatening.''
	   Meanwhile, about 200 men and women were busy servicing or
rearranging the fighter jets _ 46 of the 72 aircraft on the carrier
are warplanes, the rest are support planes.
	   Some sorted out thousands of kilograms (pounds) of mail as the
carrier swung into a festive Christmas mood.
	   Some 25,900 kilograms (57,000 pounds) of mail arrived Thursday,
adding to some 22,730 kilograms (50,000 pounds) that arrived a day
earlier from around the United States.
	   ``It's a crazy operation,'' said Senior Chief Manuel Mendonza,
who is in charge of handling the incoming mail on the carrier as
several sailors came to pick up their mail.
	   I'm glad I took mine out earlier,'' said Mendonza, 49, of El
Paso, Texas.
	   Entertainment on the carrier ranged from an appearance of Santa
Claus from an FA-18 Hornet fighter jet to Christmas carols and
Christmas dinner to cheer up homesick sailors.
	   Several movies, including the 1942 classic ``It's a Wonderful
Life,'' were shown Thursday.
	   Still, everyone wanted to be home.
	   ``Not one of these people would not like to be home with the
family, including me,'' said Crocker, of Fargo, North Dakota.
	   ``I miss my mom's clam chowder. I wish I could be home,'' said
Petty Officer Kristina Manicke, 20, of Raymond, Washington.
	   ``It's my first Christmas away from family,'' said a tearful
Manicke, an aviation electronics technician.
	   Petty Officer Shelby Cornelius who works on an explosive
ordinance disposal team, said he was spending his first Christmas
away from his family in 12 years.
	   ``It's very unfortunate, but we don't have a choice. We have a
job to do,'' said Cornelius as he read his letter from his wife,
Patricia.
	   ``I will open the presents on Christmas day,'' said Cornelius,
whose wife is expecting a baby.
	   Normal operations, including reconnaissance flights are to
resume Saturday.

 &UR; RETRANSMITS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   The Evening Post, Wellington, New Zealand, on Clinton
impeachment:
	   The Clinton impeachment is the stuff of Shakespearean tragedy. A
talented and popular president, leader of the most powerful country
in the world, risks being brought down by his fondness for sexual
dalliance and his ill-judged attempts to cover his tracks by lying.
It is a tragedy of potentially epic scale: tragic not just for
Clinton personally, but for his country . . . and for the world
which desperately needs stability in the White House.
	   One thing must be said: President Clinton is a louse. He is a
sexual predator and prevaricator. But he has also been an effective
leader _ and since when were United States presidents required to
be as morally pure as the driven snow?
	   Yes, President Clinton behaved badly; but his misdemeanors
scarcely warrant impeachment. It is hard to escape the feeling that
the vote against him in the House of Representatives represents the
dark face of old-fashioned American Puritanism. It also represents
the dark face of American hypocrisy _ a fact dramatically
demonstrated by the shocking resignation of Bob Livingstone.
	   The question must be asked: how many politicians in Washington
can place their hands on their hearts and say they haven't cheated?
And where will the witch-hunt end?
	   At a time when the world desperately needs American leadership
on a range of pressing issues including world economic recovery,
peace in the Middle East and Saddam Hussein's Iraq, Washington is
preoccupied with its domestic imbroglio and Clinton is fighting for
his political survival.
	   It's a huge penalty to pay for a fleeting sexual encounter and
unfortunately it's not just President Clinton who will suffer.
	   Shakespeare would have loved it.
	    &UR; ___
	   The New York Times, on possible censure of President Clinton:
	   The Senate seems inclined to treat Bill Clinton's misconduct in
a fair and responsible way, provided the President will let it do
so. Though Senate sentiment has not yet coalesced around a specific
plan, both Republicans and Democrats are talking of censure as the
most appropriate punishment. For the last couple of days Mr.
Clinton and his aides have seemed in better touch with political
reality. They can help keep the Senate on a conciliatory course by
dispensing with the legal quibbling that has helped bring his
Presidency to the brink of destruction and by continuing to send
receptive signals about censure. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Washington Post, on freedom of speech in China:
	   So now we know the cost of speaking freely in China: 13 years
behind bars. That's the sentence handed down after a sham trial to
Xu Wenli, who tried to organize a Chinese Democratic Party. Fellow
democrats Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin were sentenced to 11 and 12
years, respectively. None was allowed to mount a defense.
	   In October China's Communist rulers signed, to great
self-congratulation and international acclaim, a treaty that
recognizes freedom of speech and freedom of association as
universal rights. Mr. Xu and his colleagues have now been sent back
to the Chinese gulag for seeking to exercise them. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Daily Tidings, Ashland, Oregon, on Clinton impeachment:
	   President Clinton by now should realize that his chief legacy
will be impeachment.
	   The entire affair is a tragedy for America. Bill Clinton's
presidency is in tatters, and it's his own fault. He has shown
disrespect for the people of his country, his co-workers, his
family and others. He no longer deserves to be president.
	   No, the current scandal is not Watergate. That's a no-brainer.
But Bill Clinton apparently did lie under oath, intending to
mislead the prosecutor, the grand jury and the American people by
doing so.
	   Those abroad and at home who claim that this is still a sexual
inquisition do not get it: the President of the United States is
formally accused of lying under oath. If a police officer, a
teacher, a plumber, a nurse or a reporter did that _ and the
charges were proven _ he or she would go to prison. The president
must be held to the same standard we all are.
	   ... We do not know whether Bill Clinton will be convicted by the
Senate on these serious charges. But we are convinced that he
should face them, as the Constitution outlines. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Cincinnati Enquirer, on Clinton impeachment:
	   Historians may need to get professional help from psychologists
to analyze President Clinton's speech last Wednesday night,
justifying a surprise attack on Iraq. Words aimed like Tomahawk
missiles at Saddam Hussein boomeranged and blew up in the
president's face.
	   ``Instead of the inspectors disarming Saddam, Saddam disarmed
the inspectors,'' Mr. Clinton said _ unintentionally describing his
own strategy to block ``inspections'' of White House scandals.
	   He said Saddam was given ``one last chance,'' but ``failed to
seize it.'' How many chances at contrition and confession has Mr.
Clinton failed to seize with his insincere, carefully parsed
apologies?
	   His ``powerful message'' to Saddam was: ``If you act recklessly,
you will pay a heavy price'' _ exactly the powerful message to Mr.
Clinton of impeachment by the House yesterday.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Index-Journal, Greenwood, South Carolina, on Saddam Hussein:
	   Response from some nations critical of the American and British
action against Saddam Hussein is patently self-serving. That's
obvious, even as they so often pretend to be our friends.
	   Russia, China and France are among those who have disagreed with
steps taken to punish Saddam. Russia and China, in fact, have
``demanded'' that we stop.
	   That, of course, should surprise nobody. These three nations,
particularly, have been known to sell technology and military
equipment and jet fighters to Saddam. Even nuclear and germ warfare
materials have been shipped to him. ...
	   It's amazing how in times like these that some nations are quick
to lambaste the United States. Many of them are the same ones that
want _ expect _ us to provide them with security, food and all
kinds of aid.
	   It is one more indication why we should always keep our guard
up, and that means not letting our military and its equipment
decline. We've learned that lesson many times _ too many times.

Latin patriarch delivers political mass
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ In a sharply political Christmas
Mass, the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem recalled Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails and lashed out at the ``oppressor.''
	   Michel Sabbah, the top Roman Catholic official in the region,
also prayed for ``the suffering of the people of Iraq,'' days after
a U.S.-British bombardment of the country.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who attended the Mass, has
recently clashed with Israel over its refusal to release
Palestinians jailed for killing.
	   Sabbah said Palestinian-controlled Bethlehem was still unable to
enjoy peace _ an allusion to the stalled peace process.
	   Addressing Arafat as ``President'' _ a term rejected by Israel,
which considers intimations of Palestinian statehood a threat _
Sabbah said Arafat had as his motto, ``The message of the angels.''
	   ``May it bring forgiveness but also purification to those who
oppress ... when peace is in the heart, it will be possible to
establish it in the land.''
	   ``We pray for the people of Iraq in its continuous suffering,''
he said. Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions for eight years because
of President Saddam Hussein's refusal to cooperate with a program
to ensure the destruction of the country's weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``We pray for the prisoners in our lands still suffering and
deprived of freedom of peace,'' he said, an allusion to the recent
dispute with Israel.
	   Arafat says Israel agreed to release the killers at
U.S.-brokered peace talks at Wye River, Maryland. Israel insists
that was never on the agenda.
	   Israel Television's Arabic service and Palestinian television
simultaneously broadcast the mass.
	   Messages were read in a succession of languages by monks after
the service.
	   One monk, speaking Arabic-accented Hebrew, prayed for ``peace in
in the hearts of leaders of our region.''

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ He was delayed for a few hours by a
manhunt for a prison escapee suspected in the killings of two
Israelis, but Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in Bethlehem on
Christmas Eve in time to make it for celebrations.
	   The festive mood despite the dragnet in the town of Jesus' birth
was not out of place: occasional intrusions of the profane did not
keep many Christians around the world from the sacred business of
celebration.
	   Boy Scout bagpipe bands marched through Bethlehem throughout the
day, and crowds of wellwishers _ along with mounted Palestinian
police _ greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel Sabbah.
	   As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers
filled Manger Square _ despite published pleas by Mayor Hanna J.
Nasser, who told The Associated Press he considers such displays
inappropriate at Christmas.
	   Bethlehem was handed over from Israeli to Palestinian rule three
years ago just before Christmas, and the fireworks were a
celebration of independence.
	   Crowds were down this year because of security fears in the wake
of recent anti-Israel violence and protests against the U.S. and
British bombardment of Iraq.
	   It didn't bother Heather Taylor, 25, a teacher from Winnsboro,
Texas. ``This is where it all started,'' she said. ``I'm here to be
near to the place of the person I love, the Savior I love.''
	   Nasser got his wish for decorum later in the evening, with
Midnight Mass in the Church of St. Katherine, next to the
fourth-century Church of the Nativity, built on the traditional
birthplace of Jesus.
	   Sabbah fanned incense over the altar, and led a service that
included prayers in Arabic, English and Latin.
	   He delivered a sharply political mass, alluding to Israel as the
``oppressor'' and praying for the release of Palestinian prisoners
in Israeli jails. Sabbah also prayed for the ``people of Iraq,''
days after a U.S.-British bombardment of that country.

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Istanbul's largest Roman Catholic Church
called off Christmas Eve midnight Mass, citing security concerns
due to strong anti-Italian sentiment over Italy's harboring of a
Kurdish rebel.
	   ``There will be no midnight service this year,'' said a notice
at the entrance of St. Anthony's church.
	   Church officials told Turkey's Anatolia news agency a service
would be held Friday morning.
	   Italy's refusal to extradite Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan to Turkey for trial has angered many Turks, sparking violent
anti-Italian protests and boycotts on Italian goods.
	   Istanbul is an overwhelmingly Islamic country with only a tiny
Christian minority. In 1996, a concussion bomb placed in a
confessional in St. Anthony's went off during a service at the
church. No one was injured.
	   The war between Kurdish rebels and Turkey's military has killed
37,000 since 1984.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ U.S. National Basketball Association
commissioner David Stern and union director Billy Hunter held a
secret meeting in Los Angeles Wednesday night, a few hours after
the league said a settlement must be reached by Jan. 7 to save the
season.
	   An NBA spokesman confirmed the meeting, which was the first
between the men since Dec. 11.
	   It took place at the office of agent Leonard Armato, who in the
past has tried to act as a peacemaker between Stern and Hunter.
	   ``Absolutely no progress was made,'' NBA spokesman Brian
McIntyre said. ``There may or may not be another meeting over the
weekend.'' Yet sources on both sides of the talks told The
Associated Press that a deal could be done quickly if they could
agree to swap major concessions.

Israel condemns anti-Semitic comments of Russian Communist leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel denounced Russian Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov Thursday for making ``anti-Semitic declarations''
and expressed hope that Russian authorities would find appropriate
ways to deal with his slurs.
	   Zyuganov, who finished second in the 1996 presidential election,
blamed Jews in the Russian government for helping to cause ``the
current catastrophic condition of the country, the mass
impoverishment and the process of extinction of its people.''
	   Zyuganov's remarks Wednesday were in response to calls on him to
denounce recent anti-Semitic comments by others in the party.
	   Israel's Foreign Ministry said Zyuganov's statement were not
consistent with his claims that the Communist Party ``aims to build
a democratic society in Russia.''
	   ``Israel severely condemns and expresses shock from these
anti-Semitic declarations that do not contribute to relations
between the Russian and Jewish peoples and the state of Israel,''
the ministry said in a statement.
	   ``Israel expresses hope that the Russian powers will find
appropriate ways to deal with this grave incident,'' it said.
	   Under Zyuganov, the Communist party has taken on an increasingly
aggressive, nationalistic tone. Anti-Semitic rhetoric has grown in
Russia since its economic troubles have deepened over the last
several months.

<TEXT>
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ When 23-year-old Andonia Lynch
walked off the airplane in Barbados, customs officials were
impressed to see her managing a baby on one arm and an 81-pound
(36-kilogram) suitcase on the other.
	   They were even more impressed, however, by the luggage's
contents _ bags and bags of high-quality marijuana that had escaped
a recent police sweep of marijuana farms and processing huts on the
nearby island of St. Vincent.
	   Lynch, a St. Vincent native, was convicted Thursday of drug
trafficking and sentenced to three years in jail.
	   She was detained Monday night at the Bridgetown airport.
	   Magistrate Valton Bend ordered the 11-month-old baby into
government custody until family members in St. Vincent claim it.

Defying NATO threats, Serb forces strike at Albanian stronghold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with KLA statement saying won't
``stand idly by,'' comment from head of verification force. No
Pickup.
 &UR; By MISHA SAVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO warnings, Serb
tanks and troops struck an ethnic Albanian rebel stronghold
Thursday in Kosovo, dealing a blow to U.S.-led efforts to bring
peace to the troubled Serb province.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC-Television that
the Serb offensive was a ``clear violation'' of a cease-fire agreed
on by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in October to end eight
months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   At least one person was killed, and ethnic Albanians said
several others were injured in what they said was an assault by
Serb police and troops backed with tanks on six villages outside
the town of Podujevo.
	   Serb police, quoted by the government's Tanjug news agency, said
they encountered ``fierce fire'' but ``liquidated'' several
guerrillas in the rebel stronghold Lapastica. The operation was
continuing Thursday night, they said.
	   Serbian officials reportedly told international observers the
action was a ``limited operation'' to find the killers of a Serb
policeman slain on Monday.
	   ``Our police must continue to clamp down against the
terrorists,'' said ultra-nationalist Serbian Vice Premier Vojislav
Seselj, referring to the Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   The KLA is fighting for independence for Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians form 90 percent of the province's 2 million people. The
province is in southern Serbia, the main Yugoslav republic.
	   In a statement issued in the provincial capital Pristina, the
KLA stopped short of ending its unilaterally declared cease-fire,
but said the rebels would ``not sit idly by'' and instead would
``attack with all means available.''
	   In neighboring Albania, the foreign ministry called for NATO to
intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the
province.
	   In October it took the threat of NATO airstrikes to push
Milosevic to accept the cease-fire. The deal ended the worst of the
fighting after a seven-month crackdown by Serb troops on
separatists that left 1,000 dead and drove 300,000 from their
homes.
	   Thursday's action by Serb police and military struck six
villages near Podujevo, 32 kilometers north of Pristina, according
to the Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the ethnic
Albanian leadership.
	   An Associated Press Television News crew saw the body of one man
killed by a shell in one of the villages, Glavnik. Ethnic Albanians
said three others were injured in the blast and many more were
injured in other villages under attack.
	   Serb tanks entered Lapastica and several houses were set ablaze,
the Kosovo Information Center said. Serb snipers were also firing
at fleeing civilians, it said.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians fled the region on foot and in
vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills around Podujevo.
	   ``I just had time to pick up my children and flee,'' said
Shukrije Bashota, 28, from Lapastica. ``I have nothing else with
me.''
	   An elderly woman from Glavnik, who identified herself only as
Cefzere, said Serb attackers ``opened grenade fire at us even
before our children were awake. We are in the mountains without
bread. I don't know what we are going to do.''
	   Jorgen Grunnet, a spokesman for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, said Serb authorities had told the OSCE
that the sweep was a ``limited search operation.''
	   But Grunnet said the operation seemed more than ``a normal
police operation.''
	   He said convoys of Yugoslav army vehicles, including several
Russian-built T-55 tanks, were seen leaving bases in Pristina and
Podujevo early Thursday. They converged just west of Podujevo to
launch the attack.
	   The chief ethnic Albanian peace negotiator, Fehmi Agani, called
the Serb operation a ``very serious provocation'' and a ``a bold
challenge to NATO,'' which had threatened airstrikes in October to
halt the fighting.
	   On Wednesday, State Department spokesman James Rubin warned
against increasing violence, saying it could ``spark a cycle of
violence that would seriously undermine the cease-fire agreement.''
	   The American head of the OSCE verification force, William
Walker, expressed frustration at the apparent lack of will for a
peaceful settlement, saying ``both sides have been looking for
trouble and found it.''
	   Walker said the unarmed international verification force was
ready to help ``but we cannot go out there with arms to stop them
if they want to kill each other.''

Christmas celebrations worldwide survive tensions

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 25-27, tensions in Istanbul; celebrations aboard

 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ He was delayed for a few hours by a
manhunt for a prison escapee suspected in the killings of two
Israelis, but Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in Bethlehem on
Christmas Eve in time to make it for celebrations.
	   The festive mood despite the dragnet in the town of Jesus' birth
was not out of place: occasional intrusions of the profane did not
keep many Christians around the world from the sacred business of
celebration.
	   Boy Scout bagpipe bands marched through Bethlehem throughout the
day, and crowds of wellwishers _ along with mounted Palestinian
police _ greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel Sabbah.
	   As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers
filled Manger Square _ despite published pleas by Mayor Hanna J.
Nasser, who told The Associated Press he considers such displays
inappropriate at Christmas.
	   Bethlehem was handed over from Israeli to Palestinian rule three
years ago just before Christmas, and the fireworks were a
celebration of independence.
	   Crowds were down this year because of security fears in the wake
of recent anti-Israel violence and protests against the U.S. and
British bombardment of Iraq.
	   It didn't bother Heather Taylor, 25, a teacher from Winnsboro,
Texas. ``This is where it all started,'' she said. ``I'm here to be
near to the place of the person I love, the Savior I love.''
	   Nasser got his wish for decorum later in the evening, with
Midnight Mass in the Church of St. Katherine, next to the
fourth-century Church of the Nativity, built on the traditional
birthplace of Jesus.
	   Sabbah fanned incense over the altar, and led a service that
included prayers in Arabic, English and Latin.
	   He delivered a sharply political mass, alluding to Israel as the
``oppressor'' and praying for the release of Palestinian prisoners
in Israeli jails. Sabbah also prayed for the ``people of Iraq,''
days after a U.S.-British bombardment of that country.
	   For the overflow, a three-meter (yard) square television screen
was set up, tuned into Palestinian television, which broadcast the
mass live.
	   The choir of the Salem Baptist Church of Chicago led a
foot-stomping pre-Mass performance.
	   Chorister Jamell Meeks said things had changed since 1992, the
last time the choir performed, during the ``intefadeh,'' the
Palestinian uprising.
	   ``All that scary stuff isn't going on,'' she said.
	   A fireworks display from the roof overlooking the square an hour
before the Midnight Mass brought cheers from the crowd below.
	   Singers in the Bethlehem Bible College choir raised their arms
to try to shield their eyes from the smoke, blowing off the roof
down into their faces.
	   As Palestinians grow more confident in their sovereignty, the
nationalist tone of previous Christmases has been played down:
instead of the two-story high portrait Arafat of earlier years,
smaller depictions of the Palestinian leader hung from streamers
over Manger Square.
	   Arafat is a Muslim, but his participation in Christmas events in
Bethlehem signals his support for the Christian Palestinian
minority.
	   A manhunt for Jamil Jadala, a Bethlehem native accused of
involvement in the killings of two Israelis in October, was still
underway when Arafat arrived in Bethlehem early Thursday evening.
	   Arafat is under pressure from Israel to contain anti-Israel
violence. Jadala's escape from a Nablus jail earlier this week has
embarrassed him, and when Bethlehem police received a tip he had
returned to the area of his hometown, they went on immediate alert
and surrounded his house.
	   Arafat was due at 4:30 p.m., but arrived 45 minutes late _ a
delay Israel army radio, citing Palestinian security sources,
attributed to security rearrangements because of the manhunt.
	   Tensions intruded into Christmas celebrations elsewhere in the
world.
	   In Jakarta, Indonesia's Christian leaders, shaken by recent
attacks by Muslim mobs on Christian churches, appealed for racial
and religious harmony.
	   The world's fourth most populous nation has endured sporadic
riots in recent months as social and religious tensions rise amid
the worst economic crisis in three decades.
	   Istanbul's largest Roman Catholic Church called off Christmas
Eve midnight Mass, citing security concerns due to strong
anti-Italian sentiment over Italy's harboring of a Kurdish rebel.
	   In the Persian Gulf, some 72 planes, including 46 fighter jets,
were chained down Thursday as a giant U.S. aircraft carrier dropped
anchor to prepare for Christmas celebrations.
	   The USS Carl Vinson, which leads an eight-ship battle group,
took charge from the USS Enterprise, which sailed out of the Gulf
Wednesday. Several warplanes that took off from the Enterprise had
been engaged in four days of air strikes on Iraq.
	   But the partial stand-down did not alter the state of alertness
on the 97,000-ton carrier where most of its 5,000 crews worked the
normal 12 hours.
	   In the Kuwaiti desert, some 1,000 U.S. Marines in the region to
meet any Iraqi threat in the region tried to make the best of
Christmas Eve in the desert.
	   The United States and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq
in the early hours of Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its
weapons inspectors saying that Iraq was blocking their work.
	   Cpl. Robert Katz of New Rochelle, New York, said Christmas was
about being with the people dearest to your heart, and ``we're all
friends and family here.''
	   On the others side of the border, President Saddam Hussein said
that the recent U.S. and British airstrikes on Iraq violated the
teachings of Jesus and called on all believers to ``face up to
these criminals.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam issues a Christmas address each year.
	   ``We hope that this year we will have a Christmas of peace,''
said Matti Shaba Matoka, the Syrian Catholic archbishop of Baghdad.
	   The bleak Christmas did not stop Faris Boutros Mehdi from
shopping for presents to put beneath his small, bare, plastic
Christmas tree. A bottle of perfume for his girlfriend costs about
25,000 dinars (dlrs 14), about half of his monthly salary.
	   The effects of eight years of U.N. sanctions have limited
celebrations in Iraq; in hundreds of towns across Central America,
natural disaster wiped out the holiday entirely.
	   ``What Christmas?'' asked Gregorio Sanchez, a 42-year-old farmer
and evangelical preacher who lives with a wife and five children in
a dirt-floor shelter of black plastic shelter in Posoltega,
Nicaragua, alongside hundreds of other refugees.
	   Two months ago, the rains of Hurricane Mitch were followed by
mud, burying their lands, their houses, their friends, and often
their families.
	   Elsewhere, others could celebrate a reemergence of Christmas.
	   In Havana, Cubans crowded markets to buy pork roasts and other
traditional foods for a Christmas made especially festive by the
recent reinstatement of Dec. 25 as a permanent holiday.
	   In Asmara, Eritrea, a Christmas tree decked with glowing lights
dominated a traffic island on Asmara's main thoroughfare. Another
adorned the central post office where electronic Christmas jingles
play throughout the day.
	   A western version of Christmas is making inroads in this
half-Muslim, half Orthodox Christian capital of 400,000 in the Horn
of Africa.
	   Those driving the observance of western-style Christmas on Dec.
25 are minority Roman Catholics and Protestants _ and the many
Eritreans who have returned from years of exile in western nations,
after Africa's newest nation became independent from Ethiopia in
1993. Most Eritrean Christians are Orthodox, and celebrate
Christmas on Jan. 7.
	   ``I lived in Piscataway, New Jersey, for 11 years, so I'm used
to celebrating on the 25th,'' said Luz Yosief, an Eritrean who now
works for the U.N. Development Program.
	   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II celebrated this Christmas with
his mind on the next one, looking ahead eagerly to the opening of
the jubilee year that will launch Christianity's third millennium.
	   John Paul was delivering his Christmas Eve Mass homily from St.
Peter's Basilica. From there, on Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will open
2000 celebrations with the traditional jubilee-year opening of the
basilica's usually closed main doors.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, I shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the opening of
the holy door,'' John Paul said in an advance text of his Christmas
Eve homily.

Saddam says U.S. attack violated principles of Jesus

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In a Christmas message to his people,
President Saddam Hussein said that U.S. and British airstrikes on
Iraq violated the teachings of Jesus and called on all believers to
``face up to these criminals.''
	   Air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad early Friday, but motorists
seemed to ignore them and light traffic continued to flow in the
streets. The Pentagon denied carrying out any military action to
cause the warning.
	   ``I have no knowledge why the sirens have gone off. The U.S.
Defense Department is not responsible for it, and it's not doing
anything,'' Pentagon spokesman Glenn Flood said in Washington.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the air raid sirens which
sounded after midnight. A half-hour later an all-clear siren
sounded. No anti-aircraft fire was heard.
	   It was the first time that sirens were sounded since the end of
four-day U.S.-British bombings Sunday.
	   In his Christmas address, Saddam said the ``rulers of America
and Britain... are the enemies of God.'' His message was carried by
the official Iraqi News Agency.
	   ``Their criminal aggression was against not only Iraq but also
against humanity, mankind and the principles called for by Jesus,''
he said.
	   He called on all believers to ``face up to these criminals who
respect no sanctity.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam issues a Christmas address each year.
	   The United States and Britain launched air attacks against Iraq
in the early hours of Dec. 17 after the United Nations withdrew its
weapons inspectors saying that Iraq was blocking their work. Iraq
has said it will not allow the inspectors to return.
	   INA, quoting an army spokesman, said late Thursday that 14
formations of warplanes violated Iraqi airspace in the morning. It
did not identify the planes or say how many were involved, but said
they entered Iraq from Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti airspace.
	   It said the planes were out of the range of Iraqi air defenses.
	   Road junctions, strategic sites and main roundabouts in Baghdad
are still patrolled by militia of the ruling Baath Party, a move
taken just before the airstrikes began. Air defenses remain ready.
	   Iraq's state-run newspapers said Thursday that Iraqis will not
be intimidated by U.S. threats of renewed strikes to force Baghdad
to allow the resumption of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   The arms inspection teams now exist only ``in the sick dreams
entertained by America,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said in a
front-page editorial.
	   The inspectors are working to dismantle Iraq's programs to build
weapons of mass destruction. U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait cannot be lifted until the weapons
inspectors certify that Iraq is rid of chemical and biological
weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq says more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers were killed in
the strikes on some 100 targets.
	   The Babil newspaper, owned by President Saddam Hussein's eldest
son Odai, warned that the United States and Britain might strike
again.
	   ``The possibility of military action which they wave as a means
of psychological terror will not be more than what our people and
military units have already seen,'' the paper said.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in
Bethlehem on Christmas Eve _ delayed by a manhunt for a Palestinian
fugitive but still in time for celebrations in the town of Jesus'
birth.
	   Troubles intruded on holiday celebrations elsewhere in the
world, too, with refugees of Hurricane Mitch finding Christmas
spirit hard to come by and Christians in Indonesia shaken by
attacks on churches.
	   Still, the sacred business of celebration took precedence for
many Christians. Christmas was being reborn in Cuba, and Pope John
Paul II was to deliver his Christmas Eve Mass homily from St.
Peter's Basilica.
	   Even the dragnet in the town of Jesus' birth could not dampen
festivities. Boy Scout bagpipe bands marched throughout the day,
and crowds of well-wishers _ along with mounted Palestinian police
_ greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel Sabbah.
	   As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers
filled Manger Square _ despite pleas by Mayor Hanna J. Nasser, who
says such displays are inappropriate at Christmas.
	   Bethlehem was handed from Israeli to Palestinian rule just
before Christmas 1995, and the fireworks were a celebration of
independence.
	   Heather Taylor, a 25-year-old teacher from Winnsboro, Texas,
said she didn't mind the intrusion: ``I'm here to be near to the
place of the person I love, the Savior I love.''
	   Decorum was to come later in the evening with Midnight Mass in
the Church of St. Katherine, next to the fourth-century Church of
the Nativity that was built on the traditional birthplace of Jesus.
A 10-foot by 10-foot television screen was set up for the overflow.
	   The nationalist tone of previous Christmases in a Bethlehem
under Palestinian authority has been played down: Instead of the
2-story-high portrait Arafat of earlier years, smaller depictions
of the Palestinian leader were hanging from streamers over Manger
Square.
	   A manhunt for Jamil Jadala, a Bethlehem native accused of
involvement in the October killings of two Israelis, was still
under way when Arafat arrived in Bethlehem early Thursday evening.
Arafat is under pressure from Israel to contain political violence,
and Jadala's escape from a Nablus jail earlier this week has
embarrassed him.
	   Bethlehem police surrounded his house after receiving a tip he
had returned to his hometown. Arafat was 45 minutes late to the
Christmas festivities because the manhunt required security
rearrangements.
	   Tensions intruded into Christmas celebrations elsewhere in the
world, but festivities were not lost:
	   _In Jakarta, Indonesia's Christian leaders appealed for racial
and religious harmony following recent attacks by Muslim mobs on
Christian churches. Rising social and religious tension has rocked
a nation struggling through its worst economic crisis in three
decades.
	   _In the Kuwaiti desert, 1,000 U.S. Marines in the region to meet
any Iraqi threat, tried to make the best of Christmas Eve in the
desert. Cpl. Robert Katz of New Rochelle, N.Y., said Christmas was
about being with the people dearest to your heart, and ``we're all
friends and family here.''
	   _On the others side of the Kuwait-Iraq border, President Saddam
Hussein delivered a Christmas message, saying recent U.S. and
British airstrikes on Iraq violated the teachings of Jesus. He
called on all believers to ``face up to these criminals.''
	   Eight years of U.N. sanctions has limited celebrations among
Iraq's Christian minority. Still, Faris Boutros Mehdi shopped for
presents to put beneath his small, bare, plastic Christmas tree. A
bottle of perfume for his girlfriend cost him nearly $15, about
half his monthly salary.
	   _In some Central American towns, Hurricane Mitch wiped out the
holiday entirely. ``What Christmas?'' asked Gregorio Sanchez, who
lives with his wife and five children in a dirt-floor shelter of
plastic in Posoltega, Nicaragua, alongside hundreds of other
refugees.
	   _In Havana, however, Cubans crowded markets to buy pork roasts
and other traditional foods for a Christmas made especially festive
by the recent reinstatement of Dec. 25 as a permanent holiday.

Reports: Japan insurer, U.S. securities company to team up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yasuda Mutual Life Insurance Co., one of Japan's
top insurers, and PaineWebber Inc., a major U.S. securities
company, are forming a joint investment-trust business, newspapers
reported Friday.
	   The two companies will set up the venture by February and start
selling funds in Japan from April through Yasuda Mutual's
nationwide sales network, the Nihon Keizai business daily reported.
	   The joint venture will be the latest effort by Japanese and U.S.
financial institutions to work together here and will mark the
first such investment-trust joint venture company, the report said.
	   In October, Wall Street investment bank J.P. Morgan and Co. and
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., one of Japan's largest lenders, agreed
to set up an Tokyo-based mutual fund company.
	   Japan is currently implementing its ``Big Bang'' deregulation
aimed at creating a more liberalized financial market by the early
21st century.
	   The Yasuda-PaineWebber venture will be capitalized at 2 billion
yen (dlrs 17.24 million), the Nihon Keizai and the Yomiuri, Japan's
largest newspaper, said.
	   Yasuda's affiliate, Yasuda Capital Management Co., will hold 55
percent of the new firm's capital, with the remaining 45 percent to
be held by PaineWebber, the reports said.
	   The two companies were scheduled to announce the agreement later
Friday, the reports said.
	   Yasuda Mutual, which owns 8.1 percent of PaineWebber, has sent
more than 100 trainees in its asset-management and system divisions
for training at the New York-based company, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   The new joint venture will also handle investments in
defined-contribution pension programs, which are to be introduced
in fiscal 2000 in Japan, the reports said.

Balloonists halfway around the world elude Pacific weather
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: REMOVES grafs 5,6; UPDATES with balloon beginning to skirt
Pacific depression grafs 6, 7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Three balloonists streaked across the Pacific
Ocean on a jetstream Thursday, hoping to elude a troublesome
weather pattern that could threaten their bid to achieve the first
non-stop trip around the world in a balloon.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden were moving at 145 mph (233
kph), 1,500 miles (2,400 km) east of Japan, when they soared past
the halfway mark on an eastward circuit of the globe that began in
Marrakech, Morocco on Dec. 18.
	   ``They are pleased with their progress, but there is still a
worry about the weather in the Pacific,'' said ground crew
spokeswoman Jackie McQuillan.
	   ``We are watching it very carefully, but we are feeling slightly
more confident about things than we were this morning,'' she said.
	   The Pacific crossing is dangerous, ground crew director Mike
Kendrick said, because the frequency of shipping is not very high
and rescue would be difficult. The ground crew were tracking the
position of all ships that would be under the balloon in the
Pacific.
	   Later Thursday, spokesman David Partridge said that the balloon
was maintaining its height and speed and was moving northwards,
skirting the depression which meteorologists were warning could
suck the balloon down and even force it to reverse direction.
	   ''We are trying to position the balloon to go as quickly as
possible and outrun the developing weather system,'' Partridge
said.

	   A summary of news from The Associated Press. Some items have
moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f'' category
codes:
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in
Bethlehem on Christmas Eve _ delayed by a manhunt for a Palestinian
fugitive but still in time for celebrations in the town of Jesus'
birth. Troubles intruded on holiday celebrations elsewhere in the
world, too, with refugees of Hurricane Mitch finding Christmas
spirit hard to come by and Christians in Indonesia shaken by
attacks on churches. Still, the sacred business of celebration took
precedence for many Christians. Christmas was being reborn in Cuba,
and Pope John Paul II was to deliver his Christmas Eve Mass homily
from St. Peter's Basilica. (CHRISTMAS ROUNDUP)
	   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO and U.S.
warnings, Serb tanks and troops struck against a Kosovo Albanian
rebel stronghold Thursday, triggering what both sides called fierce
fighting and dealing a blow to U.S.-led peace efforts. NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC television that the Serb
offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments'' undertaken
in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in October to
end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes. Ethnic
Albanians said at least one person was killed and several others
injured in a Serb offensive near Podujevo, about 20 miles (30 kms)
north of Pristina. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad early
Friday, but motorists seemed to ignore them and light traffic
continued to flow in the streets. The Pentagon denied carrying out
any military action to cause the warning. There was no immediate
explanation for the air raid sirens which sounded after midnight
and again a half-hour later. No anti-aircraft fire was heard.
(IRAQ)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The only thing Israel's former chief of staff
did on Thursday was give back his uniform, declare an interest in
political life, and mouth a few pieties about hope and getting
along. In an election year, that's enough to spark a war. ``We need
to make peace at home first, and then peace with our neighbors,''
said Lt. Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak as he formally ended his military
career. Shahak has been on leave since stepping down as chief of
staff in July. Shahak, considered a frontrunner in the upcoming
election for prime minister, was denounced as a ``leftist'' by the
hawkish right and inexperienced by the dovish opposition. Shahak is
expected to run with a new centrist party. (ISRAEL-POLITICS)
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
accused of masterminding the U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa, says
he's innocent of the attacks but not sorry they occurred, a
Pakistani news agency reported Thursday. The comments were his
first public denial of involvement in the August bombings, which
killed a total of 224 people in Tanzania and Kenya. ``I was not
involved in the bomb blasts ... but I don't regret what happened
there,'' bin Laden was quoted as saying by Afghanistan's ruling
Taliban, the independent News Network International reported. The
Saudi billionaire has been living in exile in Afghanistan, and the
Taliban religious army, which rules most of the country, has until
now refused to let him make public statements. (AFGHANISTAN-BIN

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow edged closer to new highs, but many
stocks sagged Thursday as holiday-bound investors nibbled at their
big gains from Tuesday's record-setting rally. The Dow Jones
industrial average extended its winning streak to six sessions, but
rose just 15.96 points _ or by 0.2 percent _ at 9,217.99 by the
early 1 p.m. (1800 GMT) close for Christmas Eve. Still, including
Wednesday's 157-point romp, the Dow has tacked on 427 points during
that streak, closing in on the Nov. 23 record of 9,374.27.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Americans' personal income registered the
largest increase in nine months and unemployment applications hit a
17-month low, suggesting the U.S. economy will enter 1999 with
enough power to resist the drag from economic slumps abroad. Income
increased by a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent in November, the
most since February, the Commerce Department said Thursday. This
follows respectable gains in September and October. Separately, the
Labor Department said the number of Americans seeking unemployment
benefits fell by 13,000 to a seasonally adjusted 287,000 last week,
the lowest since July 1997. ``The economy is ending 1998 on a
bright note for the consumer, with incomes rising comfortably and
unemployment low,'' said economist Bob Dederick of Northern Trust
Co. (US-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Sales at the newly merged automobile
giant DaimlerChrysler AG were 260 billion marks (dlrs 158 billion)
in 1998, a company spokesman said Thursday. That is about 13
percent higher than combined 1997 of Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler
Corp., which were around 229.3 billion marks. On Sunday,
DaimlerChrysler will release sales figures that should reveal a
``qualitative trend'' for 1998, the spokesman said. Further
earnings details will be published at the Detroit Auto Show during
the first week of January. Analysts expect DaimlerChrysler to post
a net profit of between 10 billion and 11 billion marks (dlrs 6
billion to dlrs 6.7 billion) in 1998, after a combined 8.04 billion
by the two separate companies in 1997. (GERMANY-DAIMLERCHRYSLER)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Parliament gave quick initial approval to the
draft 1999 budget Thursday, stoking hopes that the hardliners who
dominate the legislature would cooperate with the government to
pull Russia out of its economic crisis. In contrast with the rancor
and commotion that have surrounded the passage of past years'
budgets, the lower house of parliament, known as the State Duma,
refrained from lambasting the government Thursday and voted 303-65
to approve the 1999 budget after its first reading. Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov rallied lawmakers' support in an emotional speech
before the vote, saying that Russia desperately needs the budget to
deal with the worst economic crisis since the Soviet collapse.
(RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   PARIS (AP) _ French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn
reiterated his government's skepticism Thursday about the merits of
Europe-wide tax harmonization. ``I don't know if it's impossible,
but I wonder above all if it's really desirable'' to achieve a
general harmonization of tax and social security charges in Europe
in the medium term, Strauss-Kahn said in an interview with daily
newspaper Les Echos. Strauss-Kahn said the principle of giving
European Union states freedom in setting their own fiscal policy
remained important, particularly given the different quality of
social services they provide. However, he said the EU should go
ahead with harmonization in the areas of corporate and capital
gains taxation and hoped it would happen by mid-1999. (FRANCE-EU
TAXES)
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The government and the Solidarity trade
union on Thursday signed an agreement promising to preserve early
retirement privileges for miners, who suspended an underground
protest a day earlier. ``We suspended our protest for humanitarian
reasons,'' said Solidarity mining leader Andrzej Kaczkowski in
reference to the observance of Christmas, one of the holiest
holidays in predominantly Catholic Poland. Under the agreement, the
government promised to keep the early retirement rule that allows
miners and others employed in dangerous conditions to retire, with
full pension, after 25 years of work, no matter their age.

 &UR; Eds: Includes items on Elton John, Monica Lewinsky, O.J. Simpson,
Prince Charles and Mike Tyson &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Singer Elton John stunned Britain's soccer
establishment by criticizing Premier League players as lazy and
overpaid.
	   ``The cost of players is spiraling out of control,'' said John,
the pop star who is chairman of the Watford team, which is not in
the Premier League this season. ``Then you see the players'
attitudes _ they are paid so much money and they are just strolling
around the pitch.''
	   British media reacted as expected.
	   ``Premiership prima donnas keep on breaking Elton John's
heart,'' the Daily Telegraph reported. The Daily Express described
John's comments as a ``Rocket from the rocket man.''
	   Premier League spokesman Mike Lee said Wednesday that John was
entitled to his opinion but was missing the true picture.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   KHMELNYTSKY, Ukraine (AP) _ A Ukrainian candy factory is fond of
President Bill Clinton and real sweet on Monica.
	   On Thursday, the Khmelnytsky factory in its namesake town named
its newest chocolate confection after Monica Lewinsky, the former
White House intern who ... well, you know the rest.
	   The rectangular chocolates bearing the name Monica are intended
to show support for Clinton, plant officials said.
	   Clinton visited this former Soviet republic several years ago
and tasted its candies. He later wrote a letter of congratulations
after the plant won an international prize.
	   ``We keep this letter as a precious relic,'' factory director
Vasyl Liubovetsky said.
	   The plant is hoping its Monica chocolates will find a huge
market. Its Israeli partner has already ordered a large batch.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ O.J. Simpson has made plans for ``a normal
Christmas'' with his children despite an appeals court ruling that
threatens custody of his young son and daughter.
	   ``We're not letting it affect our lives,'' Simpson said
Wednesday. ``We're going to have a normal Christmas, opening gifts,
having friends stop by.''
	   Sydney, 13, and Justin, 10, still spend time with grandparents
Lou and Juditha Brown, who were the children's guardians while
Simpson was jailed and his main opponents in the custody fight.
	   Simpson was acquitted in the 1994 stabbing deaths of ex-wife
Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman. A wrongful
death trial jury found Simpson liable and awarded the victims'
families dlrs 33.5 million in damages.
	   A judge returned custody to Simpson in 1996 but an appeals court
reversed that ruling Nov. 10, criticizing the judge for failing to
consider evidence that Simpson might have killed his ex-wife.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ A casual question at an informal meeting has drawn
Prince Charles into the debate on the medicinal properties of
cannabis.
	   During a private Christmas visit to a charity home in western
England, Charles told 36-year-old Karen Drake, who suffers from
multiple sclerosis, that he had heard the narcotic was good for
easing pain from the disease, according to British newspapers
Thursday.
	   ``He (the prince) asked me if I have tried taking cannabis,
saying that he understood that, under strict medial supervision, it
was one of the best things for it,'' The Guardian, a liberal
broadsheet, quoted Drake as saying.
	   The Sun, a conservative tabloid, quoted Drake as saying she was
``surprised'' by Charles' question, but wanted at least to try the
drug to discover if it could ease pain.
	   Campaigners supporting the use of cannabis for medical use
welcomed Charles' remarks.
	   A spokeswoman for Charles said it was a private visit and a
private conversation, but acknowledged it would be ``churlish'' to
deny cannabis was mentioned.
	   The spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said the prince was aware of the debate over the medical use of
marijuana.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ Former heavyweight boxing champ Mike Tyson was
doing the talking _ and some troubled youths were listening.
	   The former heavyweight champion drew on his own criminal past
Wednesday to tell teen-agers in a tent prison to get their lives
together.
	   ``You're not here because somebody framed you even though we all
say we are,'' Tyson told about 15 prisoners. ``Even though I didn't
take anything from that girl, I put myself in that position.''
	   Tyson served more than three years in an Indiana prison after
being convicted of rape in 1991. He is training in Phoenix for his
Jan. 16 fight against Francois Botha.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in
Bethlehem on Christmas Eve _ delayed by a manhunt for a Palestinian
fugitive but still in time for celebrations in the town of Jesus'
birth.
	   Troubles intruded on holiday celebrations elsewhere in the
world, too, with refugees of Hurricane Mitch finding Christmas
spirit hard to come by and Christians in Indonesia shaken by
attacks on churches.
	   Still, the sacred business of celebration took precedence for
many Christians.
	   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II celebrated this Christmas with
his mind on the next one, looking ahead eagerly to the opening of
the jubilee year that will launch Christianity's third millennium.
	   John Paul delivered his Christmas Eve Mass homily from St.
Peter's Basilica. From there, on Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will open
2000 celebrations with the traditional jubilee-year opening of the
basilica's usually closed main doors.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, I shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the opening of
the holy door,'' John Paul said in an advance text of his speech.
	   Even the dragnet in the town of Jesus' birth could not dampen
festivities. Boy Scout bagpipe bands marched throughout the day,
and crowds of well-wishers _ along with mounted Palestinian police
_ greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel Sabbah.
	   As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers
filled Manger Square _ despite pleas by Mayor Hanna J. Nasser, who
says such displays are inappropriate at Christmas.
	   Bethlehem was handed from Israeli to Palestinian rule just
before Christmas 1995, and the fireworks were a celebration of
independence.
	   Heather Taylor, a 25-year-old teacher from Winnsboro, Texas,
said she didn't mind the intrusion: ``I'm here to be near to the
place of the person I love, the Savior I love.''
	   Decorum came later in the evening with Midnight Mass in the
Church of St. Katherine, next to the fourth-century Church of the
Nativity that was built on the traditional birthplace of Jesus. A
10-foot by 10-foot (3 meter by 3 meter) television screen was set
up for the overflow.
	   Sabbah fanned incense over the altar, and led a service that
included prayers in Arabic, English and Latin.
	   He delivered a sharply political mass, alluding to Israel as the
``oppressor'' and praying for the release of Palestinian prisoners
in Israeli jails. Sabbah also prayed for the ``people of Iraq,''
days after a U.S.-British bombardment of that country.
	   The nationalist tone of previous Christmases in a Bethlehem
under Palestinian authority has been played down: Instead of the
2-story-high portrait Arafat of earlier years, smaller depictions
of the Palestinian leader were hanging from streamers over Manger
Square.
	   A manhunt for Jamil Jadala, a Bethlehem native accused of
involvement in the October killings of two Israelis, was still
under way when Arafat arrived in Bethlehem early Thursday evening.
Arafat is under pressure from Israel to contain political violence,
and Jadala's escape from a Nablus jail earlier this week has
embarrassed him.
	   Istanbul's largest Roman Catholic Church called off Christmas
Eve midnight Mass, citing security concerns due to strong
anti-Italian sentiment over Italy's harboring of a Kurdish rebel.
	   In the Gulf, some 72 planes, including 46 fighter jets, were
chained down Thursday as a giant U.S. aircraft carrier dropped
anchor to prepare for Christmas celebrations.
	   Tensions intruded into Christmas celebrations elsewhere in the
world, but festivities were not lost:
	   _In Jakarta, Indonesia's Christian leaders appealed for racial
and religious harmony following recent attacks by Muslim mobs on
Christian churches. Rising social and religious tension has rocked
a nation struggling through its worst economic crisis in three
decades.
	   _In the Kuwaiti desert, 1,000 U.S. Marines in the region to meet
any Iraqi threat, tried to make the best of Christmas Eve in the
desert. Cpl. Robert Katz of New Rochelle, New York, said Christmas
was about being with the people dearest to your heart, and ``we're
all friends and family here.''
	   _On the others side of the Kuwait-Iraq border, President Saddam
Hussein delivered a Christmas message, saying recent U.S. and
British airstrikes on Iraq violated the teachings of Jesus. He
called on all believers to ``face up to these criminals.''
	   _In some Central American towns, Hurricane Mitch wiped out the
holiday entirely. ``What Christmas?'' asked Gregorio Sanchez, who
lives with his wife and five children in a dirt-floor shelter of
plastic in Posoltega, Nicaragua, alongside hundreds of other
refugees.
	   _In Havana, however, Cubans crowded markets to buy pork roasts
and other traditional foods for a Christmas made especially festive
by the recent reinstatement of Dec. 25 as a permanent holiday.
	   _In Japan, it was business as usual for most people. Christmas
is a secular, largely commercial event and not a national holiday
in Japan, where about 1 percent of the country's 125 million people
are Christians.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 
 &UR; TRINIDAD: Minister angers Indo-Trinidadians, threatens to resign &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A cabinet member who called
Indo-Trinidadians ``some of the most ignorant people on the
planet'' is accusing Trinidad's prime minister of creating a
``Hindu theocracy.''
	   Dr. Morgan Job, the minister in charge of affairs for the island
of Tobago, threatened to resign Wednesday, saying Prime Minister
Basdeo Panday was stoking racial conflict with attacks on news
media owned by people of African descent.
	   Panday and most supporters of his United National Congress are
descendants of East Indian laborers brought to Trinidad as
indentured laborers, while Job and the majority of Tobago residents
are black descendants of African slaves.
	   Two weeks ago, Job himself called Indo-Trinidadians who support
offering Hindu courses in schools ``ignorant idiots.''
	   ``The Indians here are some of the most ignorant people on the
planet that I know,'' Job said to reporters. ``The people who call
themselves Hindus and Indians in Trinidad are so ignorant it's
embarrassing.''
	   Trinidad and Tobago, an oil-rich Caribbean country off the coast
of Venezuela, has been marked by racial tension. The two ethnic
groups about evenly divide the population of 1.3 million.
	   Panday's party took power in the 1995 elections. All previous
governments since the country gained independence from Britain in
1962 have been dominated by Afro-Trinidadians.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Task force urges steps to promote democracy in Cuba
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A draft report of an independent task force
wants the government to end limitations on cash transfers from the
United States to needy Cubans as part of a broader program to
promote ``rapid, peaceful democratic change on the island.''
	   At present, such transfers are restricted to dlrs 1,200 a year,
and the task force, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations,
says removing the limits would accelerate the process of creating
``a new group of Cubans'' independent of the state.
	   The co-authors of the report are Bernard W. Aronson and William
D. Rogers, both Democrats who made their marks in Republican
administrations. Aronson served as the top Latin America aide in
the State Department for President Bush, and Rogers held senior
State Department posts under President Ford.
	   A copy of the draft was obtained by The Associated Press. The
identities of other task force members were not available.
	   Beyond remittances, the report also advocates an increase in
family reunification efforts, scholarly and cultural exchanges,
direct mail service and allowing Cuban-Americans to claim relatives
on the island as dependents.
	   ``The success of the Cuban-American community is one of the most
powerful factors in promoting change in Cuba,'' the report says.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Aviation officials say Year 2000 problem to be fixed by
June
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's aviation computers, charged
with guiding thousands of flights from North to South America,
should be immunized against year 2000 problems by June, officials
said Thursday.
	   The Civil Aviation Authority is waiting for a final dlrs 59,000
(Jamaican dlrs 2 million) appropriation from the government to
finish reprogramming, said chairman Thorrance Lewis.
	   Other funds are coming from the Interamerican Development Bank,
he said.
	   Jamaica's controllers are charged with guiding jetliners over
the western Caribbean Sea. So far in 1998, they have handled 16,100
flights, Lewis said.
	   Air traffic control agencies worldwide are rushing to fix an
error in older computers that could cause breakdowns when 2000
arrives.
	   Because controllers ``hand off'' airplanes as they travel from
region to region, each country's computers depends on other to
supply them with information about the flight.
	   The biggest problem may be in ensuring that nearby countries are
all in compliance, Lewis said.
	   ``We will only be as compliant in so far as the other regions
are also compliant,'' Lewis said. ``That is the major problem we
will have _ in coordinating with other states around us.''
 &UR; BAHAMAS: Residents complain of chilly reception at Atlantis resort
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Feeling slighted, Bahamian residents and
their government are complaining about having to pay a fee to visit
attractions since the much-vaunted opening of Atlantis resort.
	   Islanders have sent letters of protest to Prime Minister Hubert
Ingraham, whose office in turn protested to Sun International Ltd.
on Tuesday, saying it was ``not acceptable, nor permissible, that
certain of the facilities at Altantis be closed to the general
public.''
	   The letter noted that the resort enjoys certain duty-free
privileges under the Hotels Encouragement Act, and that ``resorts
enjoying concessions under the act must make the facilities of the
hotel available to the general public.''
	   The resort's vice president J. Barrie Farrington said that
``obviously our desire is to accommodate the Bahamian community, it
is not to discourage or prevent access.''
	   But guests had complained of lack of privacy, he said, with
2,500 and more non-guests visiting on a busy day.
	   ``We created this very wonderful attraction at considerable
expense so we want to treat it more commercially ... and
justifiably so.''
	   The dlrs 450 million project, billed as the world's largest
island resort by creator Sol Kerzner, the South African
entrepreneur, opened two weeks ago.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Police to boost patrols after 22 killings in six days
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Reacting to 22 slayings in the past
six days, Puerto Rican police said Thursday they will increase
patrols in high-crime areas during the holidays.
	   Fifteen people were shot to death last weekend alone, officials
said. Investigators believe most were related to drug trafficking.
	   There were 50 men and 20 women killed in December, bringing the
total to 635 murders this year, down from 710 in 1997.
	   Police superintendent Pedro Toledo said Thursday he would also
send more police into public plazas, shopping centers and bar
districts to quell fights during holiday celebrations. He said
commanders had not yet decided how many extra agents they will
need.
	   The number of killings in Puerto Rico typically surges during
the holidays, when Christmas and year-end parties begin.
	   The cities with the most killings this year have been San Juan
with 195, Carolina with 114, Bayamon with 86 and Ponce with 85.
 &UR; ST. LUCIA: Leaders lament recent crimes
	   CASTRIES, St. Lucia (AP) _ In their Christmas addresses to
supporters, political leaders in St. Lucia lamented an outbreak of
crimes that have shaken this Caribbean island.
	   ``How sad that criminal elements will use this season of
celebration, this season of peace-making, to commit their acts of
terror,'' said Prime Minister Kenny Anthony. He said St. Lucians
``long for peace.''
	   Police have reported several armed robberies in recent weeks,
unusual for this country of 160,000 people. Last week, an assailant
broke into the home of 16-year-old Giselle Georges, then raped and
killed her.
	   Anthony pledged his government would ``work tirelessly for peace
and law and order, so that locals and visitors alike can be safe,
day or night, in their homes and on the streets.''
	   Former prime minister Sir John Compton, leader of the opposition
United Workers Party, urged St. Lucians to keep Christmas and
year-end celebrations peaceful.
 &UR; U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Police want men who abandoned victim
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands, (AP) _ U.S. Virgin Islands
police are searching for two men who abandoned a dying man at a St.
Croix hospital.
	   The victim, 36-year-old Carl Decicco of Estate St. John, died
Thursday from head injuries.
	   Witnesses saw two men leave Decicco outside the door of the Juan
F. Luis Hospital Wednesday night. Police say Decicco appeared to
have been beaten, and they are calling his death a murder.
	   It is the 27th killing this year in the U.S. Virgin Islands, a
territory of 100,000 people.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Woman hefts 81 pounds of marijuana in luggage
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ When 23-year-old Andonia Lynch
walked off the airplane in Barbados, customs officials were
impressed to see her managing a baby on one arm and an 81-pound
(36-kilogram) suitcase on the other.
	   They were even more impressed, however, by the luggage's
contents _ bags and bags of high-quality marijuana that had escaped
a recent police sweep of marijuana farms and processing huts on the
nearby island of St. Vincent.
	   Lynch, a St. Vincent native, was convicted Thursday of drug
trafficking and sentenced to three years in jail.
	   She was detained Monday night at the Bridgetown airport.
	   Magistrate Valton Bend ordered the 11-month-old baby into
government custody until family members in St. Vincent claim it.
 &UR; PUERTO RICO: Legal or not, relatives head to Cuba for Christmas
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Cuban exiles call it the
``Christmas disease'' _ a wave of ``serious'' illnesses that
relatives cite each year in requesting U.S. government permission
to visit loved ones in Cuba during the holidays.
	   Since Cuban President Fidel Castro decided to reinstate
Christmas, the epidemic has only become worse.
	   ``It's amazing how everyone gets sick around this time _ there
are more serious cases of sickness in Cuba than there are hospital
beds,'' said Raul Alzaga, one of three travel agents in Puerto Rico
licensed to arrange trips to Cuba.
	   The phenomenon seemed to intensify last year, after Castro
granted a one-time Christmas holiday as a favor to Pope John Paul
II and the United States moved to loosen travel restrictions,
Alzaga said.
	   This year, Castro decided to make the holiday permanent on the
communist island, and the number of Alzaga's customers traveling in
December to visit their supposedly sick relatives has risen by
about a third to 160, he said.
	   The U.S. Treasury Department, which regulates travel to Cuba,
does not track individual passengers visiting sick relatives unless
they make more than one trip per year. That makes it difficult to
estimate the number of travelers, an agency spokeswoman said.
	   However, Cuba claims about 70,000 emigrants in the United States
and elsewhere visited the island last year. It is unclear how many
entered to visit relatives.
 &UR; CUBA: Forget Santa Claus. For Cubans, it's family dinner on
Christmas eve
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Forget Santa Claus, Christmas trees and sleigh
bells in the snow. For Cubans, the family dinner on Christmas Eve
is the heart of the Christmas celebration.
	   Cubans crowded markets on Thursday to buy pork roasts and other
traditional foods for ``Noche Buena,'' which is especially festive
this year because of the declaration of Dec. 25 as a permanent
holiday.
	   ``I've never seen it this crowded this early,'' said Felicia
Margarita Baix, who arrived at the farmers' market in the Miramar
neighborhood to buy a pork leg at reduced government prices. ``This
is what it looks like for the New Year.''
	   The Dec. 24 tradition was lost or faded in importance for many
Cubans, especially after the Christmas holiday was abolished in
1969 by a government that was then officially atheist. The
government later declared itself a secular state and gradually
eased up on religious believers.
	   Interest in past Christmas traditions began to bloom last year
when the communist government granted a Christmas holiday as a
one-time favor to Pope John Paul II before his January 1998 visit
here. It was made permanent this year.
	   ``The Christmas feast is intimate, it is of the family, of the
heart,'' Roman Catholic Cardinal Jaime Ortega said earlier this
week. ``It is the love of the family gathered together.''
 &UR; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Hurricane victims brace for bleak Christmas
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Rosario Ramos never
bothered with Christmas trees before. But this year, living in
government housing after Hurricane Georges destroyed her home, she
figured some holiday cheer couldn't hurt.
	   So she and her son decorated a tree, then carried it outside her
shack for the neighbors to enjoy. The blinking lights did little to
lift her spirits.
	   ``I can't go on like this'' Ramos, 41, said, staring into the
shadows cluttered with other hastily built shelters. ``This coming
year I have to do something.''
	   For a month, Ramos lived in an elementary school-turned-shelter.
Then the government moved her to temporary housing built in the
Perla Antillana area of eastern Santo Domingo.
	   Here, nearly 1,600 families _ some of whom lost children,
fathers or mothers in the storm _ live in cramped buildings while
they try to rebuild their homes and lives. Some 100,000 people are
doing the same around the country.
	   The site is loud, dusty and depressing. ``We have one bathroom
for every six people, and not everybody knows how to live together
as a community,'' Ramos said.
	   Georges killed 283 people, caused dlrs 1.7 billion in damage and
left more than 300,000 homeless when it raked this Caribbean
country on Sept. 22.
 &UR; VENEZUELA: In Venezuela, it isn't Christmas without contagious
Gaita music
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ When a radio disk jockey urged the
public to stop listening to ``Gaita'' music last Christmas because
he thought it was too rowdy, residents of the oil-rich city of
Maracaibo boycotted the station and scrawled pro-Gaita slogans on
their car windows.
	   The deejay quickly became persona non grata in Maracaibo,
birthplace of the hip-swinging, foot-stomping music that is as
basic to Christmas in Venezuela as ``Silent Night'' is in the
United States.
	   ``Christmas without Gaita isn't Christmas,'' said Hereberto
Molina, one of the kings of Gaita (GUY-tah) with 500 songs to his
credit.
	   Long confined to steamy Zulia state, Gaita is spreading
throughout Venezuela and to Colombia, Miami, Aruba and Puerto Rico.
Songs have been published in English, Italian, Portuguese and the
local Indian language of Guajira.
	   With its thundering African drums and irreverent lyrics, Gaita
developed over the last two centuries partly as homage to the
supposed apparition of the Virgin Mary near Lake Maracaibo.
	   Today, it's a craze among young and old alike. Teen-agers attend
Gaita concerts until sunrise. Their parents and grandparents dance
to the music on tape or in clubs.
	   ``We've got Gaita in our blood,'' said clothes salesman Henrique
Serrano, 24.

Jadeja will open for India
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ India's cricket team received a
boost for Saturday's second test against New Zealand when opener
Ajay Jadeja was declared fit Friday.
	   The Indian vice-captain sprained his ankle before the washed out
first test and after days of hobbling was finally able to train
strongly.
	   ``Jadeja is fit and batted well at the nets. He came on the tour
as a first-choice opener and we have to respect that,'' coach
Aunshuman Gaekwad said Friday.
	   Gaekwad, emphasized on the importance of a good showing by his
team in the last two tests of the three-match series after the
first test in Dunedin was abandoned without a ball bowled.
	   India's last overseas series win was a 2-0 success over England
in 1986. Since beating Sri Lanka by 235 runs in Colombo in July
1993, India has failed to win a test abroad in 17 attempts.
	   ``We'll go in there tomorrow with a positive, aggressive
attitude because we have our pride to play for,'' Gaekwad vowed.
	   ``We've always been known as a team that wins tests at home. I
want to change that. In New Zealand we haven't won for a lone time,
and more the reason why we have to put a great deal into try and
win.''
	   India's 3-1 win here in 1967-68 remains its only series success
and it is yet to win a test since an eight-wicket victory in
Auckland in 1976.
	   A third seamer will be sacrificed to make room for controversial
off-spinner Harbhajan Singh after Trevor Jackson, the Basin Reserve
Turf manager said the wicket would take spin after the first couple
of days.
	   New Zealand too hasn't ruled out playing off spinner Paul
Wiseman alongside left-arm orthodox spinner Daniel Vettori,
although the first choice will be four seamers.
	   ``The pitch will have pace and carry. It might do something
during the first half hour, but my advice is to bat first. Come
third day, it will spin,'' Jackson said.
	   Singh's bowling action had come under close scrutiny since the
19-year old made his debut against Australia in March this year.
	   Although Singh has never been called for throwing, International
Cricket Council's match referees Ranjan Madugalle of Sri Lanka and
Peter van der Merwe of South Africa have questioned the legality of
his action.
	   New Zealand coach Steve Rixon said any irregularity in his
action was not blatant.
	   ``He isn't the sort of guy you would watch and say to yourself,
`He is a chucker' or `He has a dodgy' action','' Rixon said.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Air raid sirens sounded in Baghdad early
Friday, but motorists seemed to ignore them and light traffic
continued to flow in the streets. The United States denied carrying
out any military action to cause the warning.
	   ``I have no knowledge why the sirens have gone off. The U.S.
Defense Department is not responsible for it, and it's not doing
anything,'' U.S. Defense Department spokesman Glenn Flood said in
Washington.
	   There was no immediate explanation for the air raid siren, which
sounded after midnight. An all-clear signal was given a half-hour
later. No anti-aircraft fire was heard.
	   Journalists at the Al-Rasheed Hotel were briefly blocked from
leaving the hotel and were asked by management to go to the bomb
shelter.
	   On Tuesday, the Iraqi News Agency reported that U.S. and British
warplanes violated Iraq's airspace and fired two ``stray missiles''
in the direction of the southern city of Basra. The Pentagon and
the British Defense Ministry denied that report.
	   The United States and Britain enforce a no-fly zone with air
patrols above the 36th parallel in Iraq, as well as just south of
Baghdad.
	   The Iraqi News Agency, quoting an army spokesman, said late
Thursday that 14 formations of warplanes violated Iraqi airspace in
the morning. It did not identify the planes or say how many were
involved, but said they entered Iraq from Saudi Arabian and Kuwaiti
airspace. It said the planes were out of the range of Iraqi air
defenses.
	   Early Friday was the first time air raid sirens were sounded
since the United States and Britain ended a four-day military
strike Sunday.
	   In his Christmas address, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said
the ``rulers of America and Britain ... are the enemies of God.''
	   ``Their criminal aggression was against not only Iraq but also
against humanity, mankind and the principles called for by Jesus,''
he said in a message carried by the Iraqi News Agency.
	   He called on all believers to ``face up to these criminals who
respect no sanctity.''
	   Some 5 percent of Iraq's 22 million people are Christians and
Saddam, who is Muslim, issues a Christmas address each year.
	   Iraq has said the U.S.-British air and missile attacks killed
more than 40 civilians and 62 soldiers. The strikes, which began in
the early hours of Dec. 17, were launched after the United Nations
withdrew its weapons inspectors, saying that Iraq was blocking
their work.
	   Iraq has said it will not allow the inspectors to return.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A stooped, slowed Pope John Paul II
celebrated the 20th Christmas of his papacy with his mind on the
next one, looking forward to the jubilee year that will begin
Christianity's third millennium.
	   John Paul delivered his Christmas Eve homily in a floodlit St.
Peter's Basilica. From there, on Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will
launch celebrations for 2000 with the symbolic opening of a door
that is sealed during all but church anniversary years.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, the church shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the
opening of the holy door,'' John Paul said in a midnight Mass
televised in about 40 countries.
	   The phrase was a slight change in wording from his prepared text
_ in the original, the pope said he himself would inaugurate the
jubilee.
	   Increasingly frail at 78, the pope had kept his schedule light
for days to rest for the midnight Mass.
	   Flu and a fever had forced him to cancel some events last week.
	   John Paul walked slowly up the long aisle of the nearly 4-acre
basilica. At times when he had to stand in the more than 1 1/2-hour
service, he often clutched his silver staff with both hands, the
rod higher than his own bent figure.
	   But he smiled when children came forward to the altar to present
ceremonial gifts. Leaning forward, he patted their heads.
	   Walking back down the aisle after the Mass, John Paul crossed
slowly back and forth from one side to the other, shaking hands
with the faithful stretching their arms out to him.
	   John Paul has devoted much of his papacy toward preparing the
church for the third millennium. ``It will be a truly great holy
year,'' he said Thursday.
	   ``For in a completely unique way, it will celebrate the 2000th
anniversary of the event and mystery of the incarnation in which
humanity reached the apex of its calling. God became man in order
to give man a share in his own divinity.
	   ``This is the good news of salvation. This is the message of
Christmas! The church proclaims it tonight by means of my words,
too, for the peoples and nations of the whole Earth to hear. Christ
is born for us. Come, let us adore him!''
	   Thousands listened inside the basilica. Many more lingered
outside in St. Peter's Square, where lights on the season's
nativity scene and giant fir tree were lit for the first time
earlier in the night. John Paul introduced both customs to the
Vatican.
	   At midnight, church bells rang across Rome to mark the coming of
Christmas.
	   The pope no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning in St.
Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest up from the
midnight Mass.
	   He is scheduled to keep up his tradition of appearing before
tourists and pilgrims in the square at noon on Christmas Day, when
he reads a Christmas message and gives holiday greetings in dozens
of languages.
	   After Christmas, the pope plans to have his usual few days of
rest at the papal residence in a town outside Rome.

U.S. maxi Sayonara favored again
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ United States maxi Sayonara looks set
to continue the foreign domination of line honors in Australia's
famous Sydney to Hobart yacht race, which starts Saturday.
	   Sayonara, raced by American computer billionaire Larry Ellison,
has only been beaten once since it was launched in 1995 and is
aiming for its second win in the 630 nautical mile bluewater
classic.
	   If the 80-footer beats the local boats home into Hobart, it will
be third time in four years a foreign yacht has finished first.
	   New Zealand Endeavour trumped the locals in 1992, Sayonara won
in 1995 and German's Morning Glory set a race record of two days,
14 hours, seven minutes and 10 seconds the following year.
	   Sayonara's rivals are expected to be last year's line honors
winner Brindabella of Sydney and new Australian maxi Wild Thing.
	   The contest for handicap honors appears more open, but there are
many who believe Sayonara could become the sixth yacht to do the
line honors and handicap double.
	   Ellison believes unforeseen damage is the only major barrier to
victory.
	   ``She is a much more modern boat than Brindabella, if we don't
break, we should beat Brindabella, we should beat anybody,''
Ellison said.
	   ``If we hold together we should win the race, the question is if
this boat comes through and pays us a favor we would just love to
knock off the record.''
	   Ellison says Sayonara can knock half a day off Morning Glory's
record given the right conditions.
	   Brindabella's captain and owner George Snow believes a new
record is possible.
	   ``I think the front boats will be very close all the way down,
which will be a great challenge,'' said Snow. ``We are well set up,
we've got the best crew we've ever had and I think the boat is in
great shape,'' Snow added.
	   The race is tipped to start Saturday under freshening north
easters with the prospect of showers and a thunder storm before a
southerly change of around 25-30 knots later in the day.
	   The southerly is expected to ease to 15-20 knots over Sunday
before swinging back to the north on Monday with a west to south
westerly change expected to move through Tasmania and Bass Strait
on Tuesday when the first yacht is anticipated to finish.

Report: Deal would give Murdoch, French TV biggest stake in Italy's
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Telecom Italian has struck a deal to sell 80
percent of its pay TV unit to Rupert Murdoch's media empire and
France's TF1, Italy's ANSA news agency reported Thursday.
	   The accord has been long anticipated and much debated in Italy,
where some in government and media have argued against foreign
ownership of the pay TV industry. Murdoch is interested in the
lucrative soccer broadcast rights in Italy.
	   Italian investors have been scared off by the high investments
the operation would need in coming years.
	   Telecom owns 100 percent of the pay television unit, Stream. It
would retain an ``important role'' under the accord, including
technical distribution, ANSA said.
	   Lawyers still have to work out exact wording of the deal, ANSA
said.
	   The majority shareholder would be NewsEurope Corp., the Italian
branch of Murdoch's media holdings, ANSA said.
	   Murdoch's News Corp. owns the Twentieth Century Fox studio, Fox
network, the Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Post, the HarperCollins
book publisher and newspapers in Britain and Australia.

Disfigured by pollution and neglect, Paris bridges get a facelift
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Even by gargoyle standards, these were scary:
hollow eyes, crumbling foreheads, rotten noses.
	   But it wasn't only the gargoyles adorning Paris' famous Pont
Neuf bridge that were in trouble. The bridge itself, and many of
the others spanning the Seine, were falling apart.
	   Slabs of centuries-old stone had fallen from their arches. Their
facades were weather-beaten or blackened.
	   ``Something had to be done,'' said Pierre Bauda, in charge of a
15-year, multi-million dollar project to repair many of the Seine's
34 bridges. Work began in 1990 and is expected to be completed in
2005.
	   Walking under the Pont Neuf, which slices the tip of the Ile de
la Cite where Notre Dame stands, Bauda despairs: ``Look: it's
dirty, disgusting.''
	   Water had seeped through cracks in the stones, leaving festering
black stains. Under the moss-ridden arches, huge tourist boats,
which in the past have collided with bridges, plowed by. Heavy
traffic pounded overhead, taxing the bridge's foundations and
spewing exhaust.
	   ``The bridges of Paris face many threats. But air pollution is
especially hard to fight,'' said Christian Garoche, chief architect
at the Pont Neuf. ``If you cycle through Paris with a mask on, by
the end of the day it will be laced with dirt. So you can imagine
what it's like for the gargoyles and stone, sitting there for
centuries.''
	   Soot has penetrated the structures, making the stone porous and
vulnerable to erosion.
	   Much of the stone on the `petit bras' (small arm) of the Pont
Neuf, which links the Ile de la Cite to the Left Bank, has been
replaced. Each of the 12 arches could take up to a year to restore,
with stones cut to size and transported from quarries in northern
France.
	   The Pont Neuf, which means New Bridge, is actually the city's
oldest, dating to 1578. Its repairs will eat up at least a third of
the project's dlrs 114 million budget.
	   But there have been rewards already. After scraping away layers
of grime, workers discovered that one of the gargoyles was a female
face, alone among 383 males.
	   Two sculptors spent the summer swinging from supports on the
bridge to put the final touches on the gargoyles, half of which had
to be replaced entirely. The new ones were chiseled on the end of
slabs of stone weighing a ton and swung into their niches by a
crane.
	   ``When I'm concentrating, I feel transported out of time,'' said
37-year-old Witold Pyzik, one of the sculptors. ``But I'm brought
back to reality by the traffic, the police sirens and the tourists'
cameras.''
	   Other jobs have included improving the water-tightness of the
Pont de la Concorde. The bridge was built with stones retrieved
after the storming of the Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, setting
off the French Revolution that toppled King Louis XVI and put an
end to monarchy.
	   Every three years, divers plunge into the polluted Seine to
check on the foundations of the bridges.
	   In all, five of the bridges are listed monuments. Almost all
were built in the 1800s. Only three went up this century.
	   The newest addition, the pedestrian Passerelle Solferino, is
being built between the Musee d'Orsay and the Tuileries Gardens _ a
sleek, metallic structure between two classical bridges up to 300
years older.
	   ``The landscape of the river is constantly changing,'' said
Bauda. ``But the new must sit well with the old. These repairs will
guarantee that the old bridges last about another two centuries.''

In basketball and politics, Bradley passed before taking his shot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURENCE ARNOLD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ There weren't many flaws in Bill Bradley's
game as a star basketball player at Princeton University, but coach
Butch van Breda Kolff pounced on one of them.
	   ``Bill is not hungry. At least 90 percent of the time, when he
gets the ball, he is looking for a pass,'' the coach lamented about
his star back in 1965.
	   Bradley never shook that habit, even as he moved to the National
Basketball Association and then into the U.S. Senate. Just as he
passed to others on the court, Bradley passed again and again when
urged to test his ideas in a race for the White House.
	   In 1988, fresh off his signature accomplishment in Congress, the
1986 overhaul of the income tax code, the New Jersey senator
decided he wasn't ready to run for president. He sat out again in
1992. And he quit when his third term ended in 1996 to travel the
country teaching, writing, and advising.
	   Now Bradley, 55, is making his move. He has formed a
presidential exploratory committee and says he is preparing to run
in 2000.
	   But some say he weakened his chances by passing so long before
taking his shot.
	   There are many questions. Can his style succeed in a national
campaign environment of rapid response and sound bites? Have two
years out of politics improved his campaign skills or weakened his
ties to his party?
	   In a clumsy 1990 re-election campaign that he almost lost,
Bradley seemed out of touch with New Jersey voters, refusing to
comment on controversial tax increases imposed by Democratic Gov.
Jim Florio.
	   Bradley himself said he ``put the crowd to sleep'' in a speech
to the 1988 Democratic convention and that his keynote at the 1992
convention _ held at New York's Madison Square Garden, scene of his
pro basketball triumphs _ was ``wooden.''
	   He also irritated fellow Democrats when he left the Senate
complaining that ``neither political party speaks to people where
they live their lives.''
	   William Warren Bradley has always followed his own path.
	   ``He was particularly resentful of people always telling him
what he should do,'' said a friend of two decades, Tom Hartmann, a
retired journalism professor at Rutgers University.
	   Upon graduating from Princeton, billed as the ``great white
hope'' for professional basketball, Bradley instead spent two years
as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford. Explaining that decision in his 1976
book, ``Life on the Run,'' Bradley wrote: ``The greater the acclaim
became, the more certain it was that the public appetite could
never be satisfied.''
	   He returned to a successful 10-year career with the New York
Knicks. Then, ignoring those who thought he should pay his dues
first, he ran for the Senate and won.
	   There was always speculation on the sports pages that this
cerebral athlete might be president someday. And his Knick
teammates called him both ``Dollar Bill,'' a play on his
tightfisted ways, and ``Mr. President.''
	   Political supporters have long seen potential in Bradley.
	   ``He could be a real unifying source for the country,'' said
Peter Burke, treasurer for Bradley's first two Senate campaigns.
``He's so strong on race relations, moderate on financial matters,
and he's got such a good grasp of the world economy. He'll do well
among women, and moderate Republicans over the years have voted for
him in New Jersey and will be attracted to him now.''
	   Bradley was long wary of a national candidacy because of the
loss of privacy, which he worked hard to protect. In that first
Senate run in 1978, he kept his home address a secret even from
volunteer drivers, meeting them at a local gas station to start the
day.
	   ``The public has a right to know if you're a crook, but they do
not need to know if you're a sinner, since we all are,'' he wrote
in his 1996 memoirs.
	   Bradley says he is thankful he did not run in 1992 because his
wife Ernestine was diagnosed with breast cancer later that year.
Bradley was by her side as she recovered from surgery and
chemotherapy.
	   Their daughter, Theresa Anne, was then in high school; she is
now a junior at New York University.
	   A week after declaring himself a likely candidate, Bradley told
some New Jersey Democrats that running for president is ``a
decision I have circled for about 10 years.''
	   ``You don't know if it's the right thing until after you've made
up your mind,'' he said, adding: ``I have never felt more right
about a decision in my entire life.''

his star back in 1965.
	   Bradley never shook that habit, even as he moved to the National
Basketball Association and then into the U.S. Senate. Just as he
passed to others on the court, Bradley passed again and again when
urged to test his ideas in a race for the White House.
	   In 1988, fresh off his signature accomplishment in Congress, the
1986 overhaul of the income tax code, the New Jersey senator
decided he wasn't ready to run for president. He sat out again in
1992. And he quit when his third term ended in 1996 to travel the
country teaching, writing, and advising.
	   Now Bradley, 55, is making his move. He has formed a
presidential exploratory committee and says he is preparing to run
in 2000.
	   But some say he weakened his chances by passing so long before
taking his shot.
	   There are many questions. Can his style succeed in a national
campaign environment of rapid response and sound bites? Have two
years out of politics improved his campaign skills or weakened his
ties to his party?
	   In a clumsy 1990 re-election campaign that he almost lost,
Bradley seemed out of touch with New Jersey voters, refusing to
comment on controversial tax increases imposed by Democratic Gov.
Jim Florio.
	   Bradley himself said he ``put the crowd to sleep'' in a speech
to the 1988 Democratic convention and that his keynote at the 1992
convention _ held at New York's Madison Square Garden, scene of his
pro basketball triumphs _ was ``wooden.''
	   He also irritated fellow Democrats when he left the Senate
complaining that ``neither political party speaks to people where
they live their lives.''
	   William Warren Bradley has always followed his own path.
	   ``He was particularly resentful of people always telling him
what he should do,'' said a friend of two decades, Tom Hartmann, a
retired journalism professor at Rutgers University.
	   Upon graduating from Princeton, billed as the ``great white
hope'' for professional basketball, Bradley instead spent two years
as a Rhodes scholar at Oxford. Explaining that decision in his 1976
book, ``Life on the Run,'' Bradley wrote: ``The greater the acclaim
became, the more certain it was that the public appetite could
never be satisfied.''
	   He returned to a successful 10-year career with the New York
Knicks. Then, ignoring those who thought he should pay his dues
first, he ran for the Senate and won.
	   There was always speculation on the sports pages that this
cerebral athlete might be president someday. And his Knick
teammates called him both ``Dollar Bill,'' a play on his
tightfisted ways, and ``Mr. President.''
	   Political supporters have long seen potential in Bradley.
	   ``He could be a real unifying source for the country,'' said
Peter Burke, treasurer for Bradley's first two Senate campaigns.
``He's so strong on race relations, moderate on financial matters,
and he's got such a good grasp of the world economy. He'll do well
among women, and moderate Republicans over the years have voted for
him in New Jersey and will be attracted to him now.''
	   Bradley was long wary of a national candidacy because of the
loss of privacy, which he worked hard to protect. In that first
Senate run in 1978, he kept his home address a secret even from
volunteer drivers, meeting them at a local gas station to start the
day.
	   ``The public has a right to know if you're a crook, but they do
not need to know if you're a sinner, since we all are,'' he wrote
in his 1996 memoirs.
	   Bradley says he is thankful he did not run in 1992 because his
wife Ernestine was diagnosed with breast cancer later that year.
Bradley was by her side as she recovered from surgery and
chemotherapy.
	   Their daughter, Theresa Anne, was then in high school; she is
now a junior at New York University.
	   A week after declaring himself a likely candidate, Bradley told
some New Jersey Democrats that running for president is ``a
decision I have circled for about 10 years.''
	   ``You don't know if it's the right thing until after you've made
up your mind,'' he said, adding: ``I have never felt more right
about a decision in my entire life.''

Dollar lower against yen, Tokyo stocks up in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar fell against the yen early Friday
amid light, holiday-thinned trading. Japanese share prices moved
higher after a loss the previous day.
	   The dollar bought 116.00 yen in early trading, down 0.12 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level
of 116.29 yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 139.22 points, or 1.01
percent, to 13,845.95 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Thursday, the average closed down 72.72 points, or 0.53 percent.
	   In currency dealings, trades remained in a narrow range with
many players taking off for Christmas.
	   Traders reacted little to a slew of negative economic data
released earlier in the day, as the poor state of Japan's economy
had already been factored in.
	   The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said Japan's
industrial output fell 2.0 percent in November from October, while
large store retail sales for the same month fell 1.5 percent from a
year ago.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened higher in thin trading
as an early rise in bond prices eased investor concerns over the
recent weakness in the credit market.
	   ``There is some buying from pension funds because many stocks
are now very cheap with the Nikkei average below 14,000 points,''
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities.
	   But trading was conducted mostly by dealers closing out
positions as Friday is the last day to trade stocks for delivery
during 1998. Activity also remains sparse because of the Christmas
holiday in many countries overseas.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 7.51 points, or 0.70 percent, to 1,081.69. The
TOPIX closed down 8.28 points, or 0.76 percent, the day before.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.830 percent from Thursday's finish of
1.885 percent, driving its price up to 99.75 yen from 99.31 yen.

<TEXT>
	   SOLONCI, Ukraine (AP) _ The brother and sister live in the same
village and on the same street. Yet they are a world apart.
	   Maria and Arpad Ivan have been able to hug each other only twice
the past 53 years _ their fractured relationship a victim of
decades of East-West mistrust that lingers starkly at the
Slovakia-Ukraine border.
	   Even though their nations were Soviet bloc allies, nearly a
decade after the Iron Curtain was lifted and the Berlin Wall fell
the Ivans and their neighbors are still divided by barbed wire and
red tape.
	   A post-World War II treaty drew the border down the middle of
the village, cruelly separating families and friends. For those
still alive from that chilling time, the hope of undoing it in
their lifetimes is fast dying.
	   ``If only I could see my brother once again,'' 85-year-old Maria
Ivan Jevcsak says, looking westward from her dilapidated home on
the Ukrainian side toward her brother's home, where he is confined
by ill health.
	   ``We're both old and frail _ who knows how long we'll live? _
and the barbed wire that separates us seems eternal,'' she adds,
sobbing.
	   Crossing the border elsewhere is possible. But the costly,
arduous overnight journey _ which involves buying passports and
waiting all day at a border crossing more than 30 miles (50
kilometers) away just to cross the street _ is out of the question
for the poor, aging Ivans and others.
	   The village is 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of where the
borders of Ukraine, Slovakia and Hungary meet, and its long list of
nationality switches reflects the region's turbulent history.
	   About half the 1,100 villagers live on the Ukrainian side, which
is called Solonci, and half are in the Slovak part, known as Velke
Slemence. Almost all of them are ethnic Hungarians, but their
village has been passed around among six countries this century.
	   When Maria was born in 1913, the village was named Szelmenc and
was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was given to
Czechoslovakia after World War I, then reverted to Hungary in 1938.
Her half was put in the Soviet Union following World War II and has
been part of Ukraine since the Soviet breakup in 1991.
	   The other half of the village reverted to Czechoslovakia after
the war, then became Slovak when that nation split five years ago.
	   When the control-obsessed Soviets erected the barbed-wire fence
in 1945, residents at first were allowed to pass freely between the
two sides to see relatives, harvest crops, go to church.
	   Then one chilling day, the border was sealed, even though both
sides were in allied communist states.
	   Whoever got stuck on the wrong side was stuck for a lifetime.
One little girl who had the flu was staying with her grandmother on
the Slovak side while her mother and father were working in the
fields in Ukraine. Her parents never saw her again.
	   When Maria's mother died on the Slovak side, she and her husband
were denied a permit to attend the funeral. They stood at the
barbed wire with their flowers, listening to the priest's prayers
and family members' sobs from the cemetery just 200 yards (meters)
away.
	   A crossing was opened on two occasions during Mikhail
Gorbachev's time as Soviet leader. But authorities of the
independent Ukraine are tougher than ever, maintaining border
patrols and even forbidding conversations across the border fence.
	   The guards keep a high vigilance ``to implement earlier
agreements by politicians,'' said Serhiy Astakhov, a border guard
spokesman in Kiev, Ukraine's capital.
	   Divided for decades, the two sides of the village have grown
into different worlds.
	   On the Slovak side, store shelves are full of goods. On the
Ukrainian side, even staple items like bread and milk are in short
supply.
	   Family ties have loosened. The old generation is almost all
gone, and the young have grown up not knowing anything different.
	   But the heartache continues for the Ivans and a few others.
	   Since her brother is too frail to come outside, Maria used a
visit by foreigners to arrange a rare border meeting recently with
her sister-in-law, Terezia, 60, from the Slovak side.
	   The two women stood 25 feet (8 meters) apart and shouted across
the tall barbed-wire barrier.
	   ``How are you?'' Maria asked, looking around warily.
	   In the past, she says, when people were caught chatting, ``they
took them away, and some have never returned.''
	   Sending letters is unreliable. The village seems officially
forgotten on both sides _ neither Solonci nor Velke Slemence appear
on maps.
	   Most of the time those on the Slovak side have their letters to
the other part of the village returned, stamped ``Address
unknown.''

<TEXT>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) _ Want to buy the fastest ocean liner in the
world?
	   The SS United States, once the only cross-Atlantic transport for
the likes of Princess Grace, Elizabeth Taylor and President John F.
Kennedy, is for sale.
	   For about dlrs 30 million _ plus several times that amount in
repairs _ the retired steamship could become a first-class
2,000-passenger cruise ship, a national monument and museum, or a
military transport ship for up to 14,000 troops.
	   Commissioned as a joint venture between the Navy and ship
designer Gibbs and Cox, the dlrs 73 million SS United States set to
sea in 1952 embodying America's postwar confidence. Built to
rigorous military specifications _ and 110 feet (33.5 meters)
longer than the Titanic _ it broke the speed record for crossing
the Atlantic Ocean on its maiden voyage: 3 days, 10 hours, 40
minutes.
	   ``It's truly a national treasure, and should be returned to
that,'' said Mike Alexander of Boulder, Colorado, a former
passenger who has become an ardent supporter. ``A mobile national
monument is the best outlet for that.''
	   Today, however, that goal seems remote for the stagnant ship.
Gutted in 1995 to remove asbestos, it needs dlrs 200 million to
dlrs 500 million in renovations _ or about the cost of building a
new ship.
	   ``If someone doesn't come forward to buy and preserve her, the
next owner will be a scrapper,'' said Bill DiBenedetto of Raleigh,
North Carolina, president of the SS United States Preservation
Society.
	   The SS United States was in service for 17 years, crossing the
North Atlantic more than 800 times and ferrying nearly every
celebrity of the 1950s and '60s. Regulars included Grace Kelly, who
honeymooned on the ship, and England's King Edward VIII, who
snubbed British cruise lines after abdicating the throne to marry
an American divorcee.
	   Even then-Rhodes scholar Bill Clinton joined the ship's tourist
class _ one step above the crew _ on his way to Oxford University
in 1968. The SS United States Foundation plans to present Clinton
with a plaque commemorating that voyage.
	   The ship's austere luxury disguised its military prowess. It had
a torpedo-resistant hull and double steam-powered engines that were
considered classified military information until 1978. Its official
top speed was about 38 knots, or 44 mph (71 kph); present-day
cruise ships average about 18 to 20 knots.
	   Though never called to battle, the ship could have been
converted to transport up to 14,000 troops within 24 hours,
Alexander said.
	   ``She's really a wolf in sheep's clothing,'' Alexander said.
	   The SS United States was decommissioned in 1969 _ the year the
first 747 airplane crossed the Atlantic _ and shuffled between
ports in Virginia, Turkey and Ukraine before coming to rest two
years ago at Philadelphia's Pier 82. It is not open to the public,
but a private tour for journalists recently revealed a shell of a
ship left only with load-bearing walls and steel floors.
	   DiBenedetto wants to create a stationary museum designated as a
national monument. He imagines hundreds of maritime exhibits housed
among the ship's 13 decks.
	   Alexander hopes the ship will become a mobile museum, protected
as a historic site but also carrying passengers. It also could be
made into a docked convention center and hotel, like the RMS Queen
Mary in Long Beach, California.
	   ``This is something that I think should be shared by generations
to come. It should be the possession of the American people,'' said
Robert Westover, president of the SS United States Foundation, a
sister organization of DiBenedetto's group.
	   Current owner Edward Cantor of Linden, New Jersey, supports
restoration efforts but is not concerned about getting a historical
designation right away, said his personal assistant Charlene
Jacobs, adding that his first priority is to sell the ship. She
said Cantor was too busy to be interviewed.
	   For now, supporters are hoping for a miracle. Neither of the
ship's fan clubs could afford even the dlrs 18,000-per-month pier
bills and no other potential buyer has come forward.
	   ``The worst thing that could happen would be for a nonprofit to
get a hold of it, and not be able to pay the bills,'' DiBenedetto
said. ``At this point, it's going to take a national movement.''

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A stooped, slowed Pope John Paul II
celebrated the 21st Christmas of his papacy with his mind on the
next one, looking forward to the jubilee year that will begin
Christianity's third millennium.
	   John Paul delivered his Christmas Eve homily in a floodlit St.
Peter's Basilica. From there, on Dec. 24, 1999, the pope will
launch celebrations for 2000 with the symbolic opening of a door
that is sealed during all but church anniversary years.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, the church shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the
opening of the holy door,'' John Paul said in a midnight Mass
televised in about 40 countries.
	   The phrase was a slight change in wording from his prepared text
_ in the original, the pope said he himself would inaugurate the
jubilee.
	   Increasingly frail at 78, the pope had kept his schedule light
for days to rest for the midnight Mass.
	   Flu and a fever had forced him to cancel some events last week.
	   John Paul walked slowly up the long aisle of the nearly 4-acre
basilica. At times when he had to stand in the more than 1 1/2-hour
service, he often clutched his silver staff with both hands, the
rod higher than his own bent figure.
	   But he smiled when children came forward to the altar to present
ceremonial gifts. Leaning forward, he patted their heads.
	   Walking back down the aisle after the Mass, John Paul crossed
slowly back and forth from one side to the other, shaking hands
with the faithful stretching their arms out to him.
	   John Paul has devoted much of his papacy toward preparing the
church for the third millennium. ``It will be a truly great holy
year,'' he said Thursday.
	   ``For in a completely unique way, it will celebrate the 2000th
anniversary of the event and mystery of the incarnation in which
humanity reached the apex of its calling. God became man in order
to give man a share in his own divinity.
	   ``This is the good news of salvation. This is the message of
Christmas! The church proclaims it tonight by means of my words,
too, for the peoples and nations of the whole Earth to hear. Christ
is born for us. Come, let us adore him!''
	   Thousands listened inside the basilica. Many more lingered
outside in St. Peter's Square, where lights on the season's
nativity scene and giant fir tree were lit for the first time
earlier in the night. John Paul introduced both customs to the
Vatican after becoming pontiff in October 1978.
	   At midnight, church bells rang across Rome to mark the coming of
Christmas.
	   The pope no longer celebrates Mass on Christmas morning in St.
Peter's Basilica to allow himself more time to rest up from the
midnight Mass.
	   He is scheduled to keep up his tradition of appearing before
tourists and pilgrims in the square at noon on Christmas Day, when
he reads a Christmas message and gives holiday greetings in dozens
of languages.
	   After Christmas, the pope plans to have his usual few days of
rest at the papal residence in a town outside Rome.

Bin Laden renews call for attacks on United States and Israel
</HEADLINE>

interview. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, accused of
masterminding the bombings of two U.S. embassies, renewed his call
for attacks on the United States and Israel, a U.S. television
network reported.
	   ``We are confident that the Muslim nation would rid Islamic
countries of the Americans and the Jews,'' bin Laden told ABC News
on Thursday night, speaking through an interpreter.
	   ABC broadcast brief excerpts from an interview with the Saudi
millionaire, which it said was conducted Wednesday night in a tent
in the wilderness of Afghanistan under heavy security. Bin Laden,
bearded and wearing a loose robe, appeared healthy and alert.
	   He stopped short of denying that he tried to develop chemical
and nuclear weapons, according to ABC.
	   ``If I seek to acquire such weapons, this is a religious duty.
How we use them is up to us,'' he said.
	   Bin Laden, who has been living in exile in Afghanistan, denied
he was involved in the August bombings of the embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania but supported the attacks and said he knew some of the
suspects who have been charged, according to ABC.
	   ``These are true men whom we respect and hold in the highest
esteem,'' he said.
	   A U.S. court has indicted bin Laden for the two bombings, which
killed 224 people and injured hundreds of others, and Washington
has demanded he be extradited.
	   Bin Laden said he was not in his camps when U.S. missiles struck
on Aug. 21, in retaliation for the bombings. The United States said
the camps were used for training terrorists, but the Taliban
religious army, which controls most of Afghanistan, said the 26
people killed were merely religious students.
	   Bin Laden said he survived an assassination plot ordered and
financed by a Saudi prince, ABC reported, without giving the date
of the plot or identifying the prince.
	   ``They were offered large sums of money in return for
assassinating me. But I was not hurt,'' bin Laden said.
	   The Taliban has refused to hand over bin Laden, saying he is an
honored guest and will be protected in keeping with Afghan
tradition.
	   The Taliban's Supreme Court held an inquiry last month into U.S.
charges that bin Laden led an international terrorist organization
targeting American interests worldwide and exonerated him. The
court berated the United States for failing to provide evidence of
his guilt.
	   But the Taliban promised that no one, including bin Laden, would
use Afghan territory as a terrorist base.
	   They also said that bin Laden gave a written guarantee to the
Taliban's supreme leader Mullah Mohammed Omar that he would not
participate in any terrorist activity while in Afghanistan.
	   ``I am leading my life under the rules and regulations of Mullah
Omar,'' bin Laden said in a separate interview earlier Thursday
with the independent Pakistani news agency, News Network
International.
	   The Taliban said that means that bin Laden is not training,
financing or encouraging terrorist activity from his base in
southern Afghanistan.
	   ABC said its producer in Pakistan was hastily summoned to the
tent in the wilderness on Wednesday.
	   Bin Laden's campaign against the United States is aimed at
forcing Washington to withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia, home to
Islam's two holiest sites, Medina and Mecca. Bin Laden also has
criticized Saudi Arabia for allowing U.S. troops to remain there
and has vowed to overthrow the monarchy.
	   The United States also suspects bin Laden of financing the June
1996 bombing of a U.S. military apartment complex in the Saudi
Arabian city of Dhahran. Nineteen U.S. servicemen were killed and
about 500 people were injured.
	   The Saudi government expelled bin Laden nearly a decade ago. He
sought asylum in Sudan before relocating to Afghanistan along with
an estimated 300 followers.

Japanese jobless rate hits record high of 4.4 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate hit a record high of 4.4
percent in November as companies struggling in the country's worst
recession in decades trimmed their work forces and suffered from a
wave of bankruptcies, the government said Friday.
	   The total number of workers shrank by 480,000 from a year ago to
64.81 million, marking the 10th straight month of on-year declines,
said the statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination
Agency. The total number of jobless stood at 2.91 million.
	   The November rate tops the previous record of 4.3 percent, set
in recent months. Worst hit were workers at medium-sized companies,
where employment fell by 1.4 percent from levels a year earlier.
	   The jobless rate _ the highest since the government started
measuring it in the 1950s _ also set another record: it was the
first time Japan's unemployment rate equaled that of the United
States, where the jobless rate also stood at 4.4 percent in
November, an agency official said.
	   The new unemployment figure comes as Japan is grappling with its
deepest recession since the end of World War II. Bankruptcy debts
have hit record highs, domestic consumption is stagnant and the
financial system is weighed down by massive bad debts.
	   The Labor Ministry said Friday that the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, fell to a new record
low of 0.47 in November, indicating that there were 47 jobs being
offered for every 100 workers seeking employment.
	   The new job offers ratio showed there were only 85 new jobs for
every 100 people newly seeking work. A year ago, the ratio stood at
1.16.
	   New job offers in the manufacturing sector plunged by nearly 29
percent from a year earlier. New job offers in the construction
industry shrank by 6.3 percent from last year despite an increase
in public works spending resulting from a 16.65 trillion yen (dlrs
143.5 billion) fiscal stimulus package currently working its way
through the economy.
	   The number of workers who left their jobs unwillingly surged
360,000 in November from a year ago to 920,000, reflecting an
increase in the number of bankruptcies and the accelerating pace of
corporate downsizing.
	   Isuzu Motors Ltd., for example, announced Thursday a
restructuring plan that includes plans to reduce group-wide
payrolls by 4,000 employees by March 2000 through attrition.
	   A rise in the number of people looking for work was another
factor boosting the unemployment rate in November, the official
said.
	   Normally, the number of people looking for work declines around
the end of the year. But this year, due to the severity of the
economy, more people either continued to look for work or began
looking, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   As has been the case in recent months, the manufacturing and
construction sectors continued to be hard hit by flagging labor
demand.
	   Friday's data also highlighted another feature of Japan's
economy: the number of full-time employees continues to shrink as a
percentage of the total work force, while the number of part-time
and temporary workers continues to climb.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ Ecuador's Supreme Court has rejected
former President Abdala Bucaram's appeal of a two-year prison
sentence for slander and ordered his arrest if he returns to the
country, the court's president said Thursday.
	   Bucaram, who was known as ``El Loco'' or ``The Crazy One'' for
his eccentric behavior, was removed from power in February 1997 by
Congress for ``mental incapacity'' amid massive street protests and
corruption charges.
	   He fled to Panama, where he still lives, and in June an Ecuador
court sentenced him to two years in prison for slandering
opposition legislators Jaime Nebot and Alexandra Vela during his
six-month rule.
	   Bucaram also faces three charges of corruption and misuse of
state funds in Ecuador. He has denied the charges, saying he is the
victim of ``political persecution.''
	   The populist Bucaram was known for his scathing attacks on his
political opponents and wild campaign rallies in which he sometimes
sang rock songs accompanied by scantily clad dancers. He has vowed
to return to Ecuadorean politics.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Reacting to 22 slayings in the past
six days, Puerto Rican police said Thursday they will increase
patrols in high-crime areas during the holidays.
	   Fifteen people were shot to death last weekend alone, officials
said. Investigators believe most of the killings were related to
drug trafficking.
	   Seventy people were killed in December, bringing the total to
635 this year. There were 710 murders in 1997.
	   Police superintendent Pedro Toledo said Thursday he would also
send more police into public plazas, shopping centers and bar
districts to quell fights during holiday celebrations.

Ice trekkers spend Christmas at place humans have never been
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAY LILLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) _ Three adventurers on an ice trek
across Antarctica to the South Pole and back could claim the most
isolated Christmas on Earth _ in a blizzard-blasted tent pitched
where no human has gone before.
	   Their only contact with the outside world Friday from their icy
campsite 306 miles (490 kms) from the South Pole will be by Iridium
satellite phone, so long as the Antarctic blizzard allows the
connection.
	   New Zealander Peter Hillary and his team, Australians Jon Muir
and Eric Philips, are trying to recreate English explorer Robert
Falcon Scott's ill-fated 1911 expedition.
	   They are attempting to ski nearly 1,875 miles (3,000 kms) from
New Zealand's Antarctic Scott Base to the South Pole and back with
no outside assistance.
	   If successful, the trip will be the longest unsupported ice trek
this century.
	   Since departing Scott base Nov. 4 the three have covered 555
miles (889 kms), but failed to reach their hoped-for Christmas
destination _ the South Pole _ because bad weather this week has
again slowed progress.
	   In a Christmas message on Dec. 23, Hillary said the team was
excited about crossing the previously untraversed Shackleton
Glacier.
	   ``I guess we just about had our Christmas today, we got the top
of the Shackleton Glacier, and its certainly the best present any
of us could get,'' Hillary said.
	   ``But we've got the Titan Dome and the polar plateau still
ahead, so we'll be out there over Christmas.
	   ``While we're out there may all of you have a wonderful
Christmas Day with your family, and we'll be thinking of you.''
	   A blizzard began to blow soon after the message was sent. The
trio's families were hopeful of receiving a further transmission on
Friday.
	   Before the blizzard, the adventurers were making steady but slow
progress of 12 to 15 miles (20 to 25 kms) a day, hauling sleds
laden with supplies across the frozen landscape.
	   With no room for luxury supplies, the three will have a strictly
nontraditional Christmas dinner, sticking to their usual 6,000-plus
calories a day diet of high-energy muesli floating in a mixture of
cooking oil and butter.
	   They did have one yuletide surprise _ a handful of lollipops
stashed in one of their three sleds by Hillary's wife Yvonne.
	   A small Camembert cheese and miniature bottle of Scotch whisky
will be shared on Dec. 26 to celebrate Hillary's birthday.
	   Yvonne and Hillary's son Alexander will share Christmas dinner
with Hillary's father, Mount Everest conqueror and Antarctic
explorer Sir Edmund Hillary.
	   Having completed the ascent of Shackleton Glacier, the team will
now trek across the colder polar plateau where temperatures can
drop as low as -50 Celsius (-58 Fahrenheit).
	   The team aims to complete Scott's failed mission to manhaul to
the South Pole and back.
	   Scott and his team of four men, who set out with ponies and
sled-dogs, died of starvation and weakness only a few miles from a
supply dump, and just days from journey's end.

Horse lovers thrive in `Arabian paradise': Arizona
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY371-NY376 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SCOTTSDALE, Arizona (AP) _ For decades, this city and the nearby
valley have welcomed Arabian horses, not just as visitors but as
big business.
	   Surrounded by ranches and breeding areas, Scottsdale has become
the Southwest's hub for breeding and raising, training and riding,
buying and selling the majestic creatures _ and has become known
internationally as ``an Arabian paradise.''
	   Along the way, Arabians have become to Arizona what
thoroughbreds are to Kentucky. The Fall and Futurity show,
sponsored by the Arabian Horse Association of Arizona last month,
warms up winter's traditional hoopla.
	   Eight-year-old Elena Ugliepta showed her love for her horse at
the show. A competitor in the 13-and-under showmanship class, she
doted on Adijahn, bestowing very public kisses.
	   Dedication to the animals was clear even with less demonstrative
trainers, such as Rod Owens of Chandler, Arizona, who exercised
H.R. Freedom at dawn during the show.
	   Horse groom Nolene Lowrey was not shy either. ``Horses have
always been a part of my life,'' she said, displaying a horse-head
tattoo on her shoulder. ``They will always be with me.''
	   The November show is just one showcase for the horses. The All
Arabian Horse Show, planned for early 1999 in Scottsdale, often
draws more than 300,000 visitors. Entering its 44th year, the show
remains one of the world's largest Arabian horse events.
	   Locals have shown their appreciation of the shows and the horses
they celebrate. City planners protect horse-riding trails.
Developers build luxury ``equestrian residences'' with barns,
training and exercise areas _ plus a condo, of course.
	   Excellent endurance racers, Arabians are considered the
``brains'' among horse breeds. Bedouin riders in the Middle East
considered their horses gifts from God, fashioned from a desert
breeze. The line originated 20 centuries ago, traceable to just
three racehorses: the Byerly Turk, the Darley Arabian, the
Godolphin.
	   Two purebred stallions _ gifts from the Turkish sultan to Gen.
Ulysses S. Grant _ arrived in the United States in 1873. Twenty
years later, the Turkish exhibit at the Chicago World's Fair had 45
Arabians and was a hit. One of the largest shipments followed,
arranged by Teddy Roosevelt in 1906. To keep track, the Arabian
Horse Registry of America began in 1908.
	   Arabian horses began arriving in Arizona in the 1930s, as such
prominent families as the Wrigleys and McCormicks bought horse
ranches. The arid desert climate proved irresistible then, and
still does. The area has bred champions for decades, with sales
records following racetrack records.

Reports: Bad loans at Japan banks exceed previous estimates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's 19 largest banks have problem loans 15
percent larger than the banks themselves had reported, inspections
by the Financial Supervisory Agency show, newspapers said Friday.
	   At the end of March, the banks held 57 trillion yen (dlrs 491.38
billion) in bad loans, the Nihon Keizai newspaper, Japan's top
business daily, quoted the agency survey as showing.
	   An agency spokeswoman refused to comment on the media reports,
saying that a senior agency official was to hold a briefing on the
inspections later Friday.
	   Based on their own assessments, the banks had reported a total
of 50.2 trillion yen (dlrs 432.76 billion) in bad debts.
	   The agency's survey, however, classified about 7 trillion yen
(dlrs 60.34 billion) in loans to the banks' related firms as
unrecoverable or high-risk, the Nihon Keizai said. The agency
conducted inspections of the 19 banks from July through November.
	   A mountain of problem loans left from the collapse of real
estate prices early this decade has threatened the health of
Japan's financial system.
	   Earlier this year Japan's Parliament approved laws aimed at
revitalizing the financial system and lifting the country out of
its worst recession in half a century.
	   The legislation, which went into effect in October, opened a
line of 60 trillion yen (dlrs 515 billion) in public money to the
banking industry.
	   The government can use the money to bail out weak banks or help
healthy ones rid themselves of a crushing burden of bad loans.
	   Under the new restructuring measures, the government has already
nationalized two major lenders _ the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan
and Nippon Credit Bank Ltd.
	   The two banks were found to have liabilities exceeding assets,
with combined bad debts running more than 1.6 trillion yen (dlrs
13.79 billion) higher than they had previously disclosed, the Nihon
Keizai said.

	   It will be a 365-day march to a December midnight and the next
millennium. But along the way, the world in 1999 will try to tie up
some loose ends.
	   Israelis and Palestinians face a May deadline for finding a way
to live together permanently in peace. Northern Ireland is to
convene its ``unity'' assembly after decades of strife. And the
Panama Canal, a wonder of the early 20th century, will be handed
over to Panama in time for the 21st.
	   In Europe, a new continental currency and an expanded NATO will
debut. On a calendar full of election days, two stand out:
Indonesia and Nigeria, giants struggling to shake off long spells
of authoritarianism.
	   And 250 miles (400 kilometers) above it all, astronauts will be
piecing together the International Space Station, readying it for
its first live-in crew in January 2000.
	   The Associated Press asked correspondents around the world to
assess the prospects for 1999. Here are their reports:
	   ___
 &UR; Mideast
 &UR; By NICOLAS B. TATRO &QC; 
	   JERUSALEM _ A crisis is looming between Israel and the
Palestinians over Yasser Arafat's plans to declare an independent
state in May with or without Israel's approval.
	   The issue is likely to set the agenda for Middle East politics,
at least in the early part of the year. Israel has warned that a
unilateral declaration of statehood would invite a tough response.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said he would annex Jewish
settlements and West Bank land needed to maintain Israel's security
if Arafat chose to sidestep the negotiating process.
	   The crisis will come to a head on May 4, when Arafat contends
the Israel-Palestinian peace accords expire, and he has the right
to act.
	   It will take an all-out mediation effort by the United States to
prevent a showdown and get the two sides to negotiate the most
sensitive issues: the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements,
borders and the disposition of Palestinian refugees.
	   After the round of airstrikes on Iraq, U.S. diplomacy will be
tested in trying to maintain a united front in the long-running
faceoff with Saddam Hussein over U.N. inspections of military
facilities and economic sanctions.
	   Support within the Middle East for Washington's hard line on
Iraq was already weakening even before the latest attacks, in large
measure because of the erosion of faith in the Israel-Palestinian
peace process.
	   In Iran, the attempts at social and political reforms by
President Mohammad Khatami remain under attack from hard-liners
supported by the judiciary and clergy aligned with Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. At year's end, a mysterious string
of slayings was aimed at Iranian dissidents and intellectuals.
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's government appears to have
contained Islamic militants after a six-year campaign, but the gap
between rich and poor still holds the seeds of danger for his
country.
	   ___
 &UR; Europe
 &UR; By JEFFREY ULBRICH &QC; 
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Eleven of the 15 European Union countries
leap into the new year with a new single currency, trading in their
marks, francs and lire for the euro.
	   Euro currency won't start circulating until 2002, so the
currency at first will be an accounting factor in financial market,
banking and business transactions.
	   Despite some initial uncertainty, some people see the new
monetary system as the biggest step toward European unity since the
creation of the Common Market.
	   A decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, East is slowly
joining West. NATO will accept Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic into the fold and the EU continues negotiations to bring
in up to a dozen new members.
	   On the dark side of the ledger, the Balkans worry both East and
West.
	   An upsure in violence is threatening the cease-fire in Kosovo.
On one side are the Serbs, who see Kosovo as an integral part of
their republic, and on the other the province's majority Albanians
who lost their autonomy 10 years ago and now are demanding
independence.
	   The West is sending in 2,000 civilian observers in an effort to
preserve the truce. NATO missiles and bombers remain poised,
keeping pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
behave.
	   Bosnia, another Balkan tinderbox, is making slow progress, but
there is no indication the 32,000 NATO-led peacekeepers there will
be leaving anytime soon.
	   Many nations, now considered ``outs,'' will spend 1999 trying to
show the world why they should be counted among the ``ins.''
	   Countries like Slovenia, Romania, Macedonia, Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania ache to join the European mainstream. Already members of
organizations like the Council of Europe and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the countries are eager for the
big time _ NATO and the EU.

 &UR; Latin America &QC; 
 &UR; By MICHELLE RAY ORTIZ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY _ Weak oil prices and natural disasters put many
Latin American nations in a tough position heading into 1999.
	   Honduras and Nicaragua both must rebuild from the devastation of
Hurricane Mitch, and are seeking forgiveness of their total of dlrs
11 billion in foreign debts. Mitch killed more than 9,000 people
across Central America, destroyed roads and bridges and left
thousands homeless.
	   Peru, meanwhile, intends to spend 1.86 billion soles (dlrs 600
million) on reconstruction from storms caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenom earlier in 1998.
	   With oil prices at a 25-year-low, leaders in Mexico, Venezuela
and Ecuador are preaching austerity and bracing for recessions in
the face of plummeting export revenues.
	   Brazil, struggling with a huge public deficit, will try to
restore investor confidence by slashing dlrs 23 billion from its
government budget.
	   Panama, meanwhile, looks forward to taking possession of the
Panama Canal from the United States on Dec. 31, 1999. But not
before presidential elections in May; Martin Torrijos, the son of
former Panamanian strongman Omar Torrijos, leads in early opinion
polls.
	   El Salvador, Argentina and Chile also will elect new presidents.
	   The future of Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, which
has ruled since 1929, will be reshaped as presidential aspirants
jostle in the party's first open primary.
	   The atmosphere will be friendlier when Mexico welcomes Pope John
Paul II for a 3 1-2 -day visit in January.
	   A judge will determine whether two members of Argentina's former
military junta will face trial on charges of adopting children
taken from dissidents during its 1976-83 ``dirty war,'' and Chile
awaits the outcome of Spain's extradition request for former
dictator Augusto Pinochet.
	   Colombia's new president, Andres Pastrana, is trying to engage
leftist guerrillas in peace talks to end a 34-year conflict _ and
to attract foreign aid for programs to give farmers alternatives to
growing drugs.

 &UR; Asia
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
	   TOKYO _ Asian nations are struggling to turn around their
crippled economies with hopes of curtailing the growing
unemployment, poverty and, in Indonesia, stirring social unrest.
	   But many hope to turn the corner toward recovery. Key to that
would be fixing the financial systems throughout Asia that are
still in shambles.
	   The Japanese economy, which could potentially serve as an engine
for regional growth, is likely to continue to shrink, wallowing in
its worst recession in a half century.
	   Voter impatience with Japan's governing party is likely to come
to the fore if parliamentary elections are held during 1999, as
some expect.
	   More serious is the turmoil in Indonesia that threatens to
explode ahead of general elections in June and the choosing of a
new president that follows. Instability is sure to keep foreign
investors away from the once booming nation and keep its economy
spiraling downward.
	   Unemployment will likely persist in many spots, including
Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea and mainland China.
	   In Taiwan, which has escaped the worst of the economic crisis,
parties will choose candidates for the presidential election in
March 2000. Rhetoric in recent campaigns questioning whether the
island should reunite with China at some point has kept Taiwan's
relations with Beijing tense.
	   Next December, Macau will revert to Chinese rule after nearly
450 years under Portuguese administration. Although Macau will
retain its political and economic system, tackling the Chinese
gangs entrenched in the enclave is a sensitive issue.
	   The major challenge in South Korea is to clean up, under a new
president, the bloated, debt-ridden business conglomerates that
thrived on cozy relations with past military governments.
	   ___
 &UR; Africa
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Primal issues _ securing life and
liberty _ will dominate affairs in Africa, with efforts to forge an
``African renaissance'' undermined by dictatorships, wars and
corruption.
	   Two elections hold promise for building and consolidating
democracy in two of Africa's giants: Nigeria and South Africa.
	   Nigeria, ruled by military dictatorships during 20 of its 38
years of independence, holds presidential elections in February.
Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, who took power in June following the
death of Gen. Sani Abacha, has vowed to step down and hand power to
a civilian government in May.
	   South Africa will hold its second-ever all-race election around
mid-year. Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, leader of the ruling
African National Congress, is expected to succeed President Nelson
Mandela. He will have the challenge of dismantling economic
apartheid, a legacy of white rule that left most of the nation's
wealth in the hands of whites.
	   Wars continue to fester and sap the continent's resources.
	   Efforts will continue to end fighting in Congo that has
destabilized central Africa and involves troops from at least seven
countries. Uganda and Rwanda back rebels seeking President Laurent
Kabila's overthrow. Troops from Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad
are helping Kabila.
	   Patching up Angola's peace process will be even more difficult
after government and rebel forces resumed fighting in December,
using artillery and warplanes. The renwed fighting ended a
four-year peace pact.
	   In northern Africa, Ethiopia and Eritrea are poised to resume
clashes that killed hundreds in 1998.
	   And no end is in sight to the civil war in Sudan, which enters
its 16th year and is Africa's longest. An estimated 1.5 million
people have died in the war between the government in the Arab and
Islamic north and rebels of the Christian and animist south.

 &UR; Russia and CIS
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
	   MOSCOW _ Just as it started to look like things were getting
better after years of decline, Russia is gripped by its worst
economic crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
	   Hopes of an economic turnaround have evaporated since the
country was hit by the global crisis in developing markets. With
much of the nation already resembling a disaster zone after decades
of stagnation, the government has no real strategy for dealing with
the country's problems.
	   Millions of people will continue to go without pay or pensions;
those who do get paid will be able to buy less and less as the
ruble plummets and inflation soars. While fears of famine appear
unjustified, life is likely to get even grimmer in a country where
many now live in poverty.
	   Among the few bits of good news, a majority of Russians continue
to back democracy. And after decades of decline and disaster, many
Russians are hardy survivalists who greeted the latest crisis by
resolving to get through it.
	   One of the few certainties will be the failing health of
President Boris Yeltsin, who is likely to spend more and more time
out of sight. But Yeltsin has been largely written off in Russia,
and if he steps down early or dies he almost certainly will be
replaced by an elected successor.
	   There is no clear successor to Yeltsin. The Communists should do
well in parliamentary voting next December, but are not likely to
win the presidency, which will be up for grabs in 2000 if Yeltsin
serves out his full term.
	   Things look bleak across the rest of the former Soviet Union as
economies buckle. Autocratic leaders are entrenching their rule in
Belarus and Central Asia. Ukraine will hold a presidential election
in 1999 that is expected to be a bitter contest.

 &UR; Australia and Pacific
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
	   SYDNEY, Australia _ Australians face two momentous changes in
1999 _ one affecting their national psyche, the other their
pocketbooks.
	   Late in the year, they are holding a referendum on whether to
cut their last colonial link by dumping Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II as head of state, making the nation _ founded in 1901 _ a
republic.
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister John Howard, who was re-elected in
October by promising to cut income taxes by imposing a 10 percent
goods-and-services tax, will battle to get that plan through the
Senate, where his party is not in the majority.
	   New Zealand heads to a national election of its own some time
before November, with conservative Prime Minister Jenny Shipley of
the National Party trailing in opinion polls behind the Labor
Party's Helen Clark.
	   The smaller South Pacific nations, represented by the Pacific
Forum, will step up their lobbying to urge major coal-burning
nations like India and China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
before some island states are lost under rising sea levels.
	   The Federated States of Micronesia are worried about
renegotiating their semi-independent status with the United States
under a compact that expires in 2001. They fear Washington will be
less generous with aid than during the Cold War, when the islands
were considered strategic assets.
	   All the smaller Pacific island nations will be preoccupied in
1999 with the need to reform, restructure and reduce their
governments and civil service as well as privatize state
enterprises. After years of giving lip service to the idea, they
now see it as the only way to salvage their economies, and also
realize foreign donors are making reform a condition for further
aid.
	   Countries close to the International Date Line will spend the
year squabbling over which island is the best vantage point for
watching the first sunrise of the new millennium. Most hotel rooms
on Fiji, Tonga, Kirabati and Samoa are already booked.
	   ___
 &UR; Caribbean
 &UR; By MICHELLE FAUL &QC; 
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Decolonization, drug-related crime and a
trade dispute with Washington are preoccupying the Caribbean
nations.
	   Puerto Rico's Gov. Pedro Rossello also vows to pursue his
crusade to make the U.S. colony the 51st state, despite losing a
December referendum. Rossello has friends in Washington who say
Congress is weary of supporting the Spanish-speaking island at a
cost of dlrs 10 billion a year for which Puerto Ricans pay no
federal taxes.
	   Former British colonies led by Trinidad and Jamaica plan to
scrap London's Privy Council as their highest court of appeal and
set up a Caribbean supreme court in 1999 _ part of moves to
overcome international opposition to the death sentence that
leaders want to use to fight increasing drug-related crimes.
	   Barbados wants a referendum to end the British monarch being the
ceremonial head of state, a move that could encourage similar
actions by other former British colonies.
	   Grenada and Trinidad plan elections a year early amid
allegations of government corruption and, in Trinidad, growing
racial tension between those of East Indian descent and blacks who
had dominated politics until the 1995 election of the first
Indo-Trinidadian leader. Similar black-Indo rivalries could explode
into renewed violence in Guyana, on the shoulder of South America.
	   Haiti enters 1999 mired in a power struggle that has left the
hemisphere's poorest country without a functioning government since
June 1997.
	   Several islands will lobby to retain their protected and vital
banana trade with Europe, in a row that could take over trade talks
between the European Union and the United States in March.
Washington is threatening sanctions unless Europe imports more
bananas from U.S.-owned producers in Central America.

 &UR; United Nations
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
	   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations enters the new year facing a
double challenge _ the global financial crisis and conflicts and
crises from Africa to Afghanistan, with Iraq again at the top of
the list.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan paints a grim picture of the
world at the start of 1999: More wars in Africa, neighboring
nations embroiled in conflicts in Congo and Afghanistan, failed
peace efforts in Angola, political chaos in Haiti and famine and
civil war in Sudan.
	   The U.N. chief warns that unless efforts to find peaceful
solutions are redoubled in hotspots, ``we have every reason to fear
the worst in 1999.''
	   And unless the underlying distortions and imbalances in the
global economy are tackled, ``we must expect more conflicts and
even more intractable ones,'' he adds.
	   As Annan knows well, every global problem ends up at the United
Nations and he laments that crises are all-consuming and leave
little time for the organization's critical work in trying to
alleviate poverty.
	   But the results of U.N. peacemaking efforts are often
disappointing, partly because the world body is perennially short
of resources, and must serve the interests of its members who are
often at odds.

`Destroying a book so it will live forever'

 &UR; By TRUDY TYNAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMHERST, Massachusetts (AP) _ Armed with little more than a
carton of discarded books and a dream, Aaron Lansky was a
23-year-old graduate student when he set about saving the remnants
of Yiddish literature.
	   Nearly 20 years and 35,000 titles later, he is about to give it
a permanent home in cyberspace.
	   Starting in January, the National Yiddish Book Center that
Lansky created will begin a two-year project to digitize its
contents.
	   Once the books are scanned into computers, people will be able
to order copies from an Internet web site. New books then will be
printed electronically on acid-free paper with a soft-cover
binding.
	   The cost of production, excluding the scanning, is about dlrs 6
per book, Lansky said. The printing time: 30 seconds per book.
	   ``That means we can sell them at a price that anyone, not just
scholars, can afford,'' Lansky said. ``It is the fulfillment of a
dream.''
	   Less than a year after he began checking out scanning processes,
Lansky has raised half of the dlrs 2.2 million needed to complete
the project. A dlrs 500,000 gift arrived recently from filmmaker
Steven Spielberg, after whom the digital library will be named.
	   ``Yiddish will be the first literature to be 100 percent
digitized,'' Lansky said. ``It will pave the way.''
	   It is, he observes, another strange twist in the history of a
modern literature, itself rich in ironies.
	   Yiddish literature dates to the mid-1800s when, during a secular
revival, Jewish writers published the first books in the Germanic
language that had been spoken for centuries by the Jewish
communities of Europe.
	   It was crippled by the Nazi Holocaust. Now, says Lansky,
technological advances have come just in time to rescue it from
decomposing on the acid paper on which it was printed.
	   ``This is all crumbling around us. In 50 years all these books
will be gone,'' said the curly-haired dynamo, waving his hands at
the dlrs 8 million library and cultural center he has built on the
rural, western Massachusetts campus of Hampshire College.
	   It was as a student at the young, nontraditional liberal arts
school far from the traditional centers of Jewry that Lansky first
learned to read Yiddish and conceived his dream.
	   He started his quest out of frustration at not finding a book he
needed for a graduate class at McGill University. At that time
barely a half-dozen libraries in North America had Yiddish books,
and scholars estimated that no more than 70,000 books survived.
	   Once he began amassing books that had escaped the ravages of
Hitler and Stalin, and the disdain of a younger generation that did
not read Yiddish, Lansky began distributing extra copies to
libraries around the world.
	   Even though books still come to his center at a rate of 1,000 a
week, only a few copies _ sometimes just one copy _ of some rarer
volumes survive.
	   ``You would think with 1.5 million books it would be enough
already,'' Lansky said. ``But just think of the cultural crisis if
only three copies of Dickens existed in the whole world.''
	   Now, the center has established collections at more than 400
libraries in 20 countries from Japan to Israel. And as interest
rises in the literature, more and more libraries are clamoring for
books, he said.
	   ``Every time we send out a book, we make hundreds of librarians
mad at us, because they want it,'' he said.
	   The scanning process developed by the Danka Inc., a Kodak
spin-off, requires the spines to be cut off the books, so initially
only those volumes with multiple copies will be scanned.
	   ``In two years we may have a better way,'' he said. ``Still, we
are destroying a book so it will live forever.''
	   It is, Lansky says, something of a vindication to be able to
hold a newly printed book in the 1,000-year-old language that gave
rise to the works of humorist Sholem Aleichem and Nobel Prize
winner Isaac Bashevis Singer.
	   ``When I was 23 years old everyone told me I was too late,''
Lansky recalled. Today, fewer than 1 percent of Jews read Yiddish.
	   Still, he said, it may have been just the right time as a new
generation became interested in Yiddish culture and literature
through college and other classes.
	   Lansky is one of them.
	   A native of the northeastern state of Massachusetts, he had
little connection with his Jewish heritage as a child. Growing up
in New Bedford, he considered Yiddish a ``secret language'' spoken
by his mother and grandmother when they wanted to keep something
from the children.
	   It wasn't until he took one of the first courses ever to be
offered on the Holocaust as a student at Hampshire College that he
became interested in Yiddish culture.
	   When he learned to read Yiddish, at 21, ``it was like a whole,
wonderful new universe opened up,'' he said.
	   He began scrounging Yiddish books in the old Jewish
neighborhoods of Montreal and Toronto for his graduate classes.
Before long he had abandoned graduate school in a single-minded
scramble to save the books.

<TEXT>
	   Every major Jewish organization told him it couldn't be done and
refused funding.
	   But, against all odds, more books turned out to exist in print
than anyone had imagined.
	   Some private libraries were lovingly presented, one book at a
time, over a glass of tea. Others, discarded by children and
grandchildren who did not read Yiddish, were literally snatched
from the trash as garbage trucks approached.
	   After one midnight phone call from New York City, Lansky and his
cohort of long-haired young ``zamlers,'' or gleaners, pulled 8,000
books from a trash container on 16th Street.
	   Books weren't all they saved.
	   A warehouse beneath the Brooklyn Bridge yielded 75,000 folios of
Yiddish sheet music in mint condition.
	   And suddenly the dream didn't seem so impossible.
	   A decade after he began collecting in 1980, Lansky not only had
the books, but had raised dlrs 8 million to build the center to
house them.
	   Under his leadership, the center has assembled an international
contributing membership of about 30,000 and has snared grants from
a variety of foundations. In 1989, Lansky received a dlrs 250,000
``genius grant'' from the MacArthur Foundation.
	   The center now has a paid staff of 20 people and an annual
operating budget of about dlrs 2 million.
	   Still, as he makes his way through the offices and the
computers, he will sometimes pause to pull open one of the boxes of
books spilling in unruly waves from the loading dock.
	   ``Each box is a treasure,'' he said. ``You never know what you
will find when you open them.''

U.S. carrier drops anchor for Christmas

<TEXT>
	   ABOARD THE USS CARL VINSON (AP) _ Some 72 planes, including 46
fighter jets, were chained down Thursday as this gigantic aircraft
carrier dropped anchor to prepare for Christmas celebrations.
	   But the partial stand-down did not alter the state of alertness
on the 97,000-ton carrier where most of its 5,000 crews worked the
normal 12 hours.
	   The USS Carl Vinson, which leads an eight-ship battle group,
took charge from the USS Enterprise, which sailed out of the Gulf
Wednesday. Several warplanes that took off from the Enterprise had
been engaged in four days of air strikes on Iraq.
	   ``We have a partial stand-down for Christmas, but at the same
time... we are having our main engines at the ready, aircraft are
on alert and ready to go to the countries' bidding whenever called
to do so,'' said Capt. David Crocker, the commanding officer of the
Carl Vinson.
	   The carrier arrived in the Gulf on Dec. 19.
	   Earlier Thursday, aircraft aboard the carrier flew some 60
sorties, including ``a couple no-fly zone missions and mainly
training missions related to proficiency flying,'' said Crocker.
	   He said the aircraft ``picked up some signals from the Iraqi air
defense encampments, but none of them were threatening.''
	   Meanwhile, about 200 men and women were busy servicing or
rearranging the fighter jets _ 46 of the 72 aircraft on the carrier
are warplanes, the rest are support planes.
	   Some sorted out thousands of kilograms (pounds) of mail as the
carrier swung into a festive Christmas mood.
	   Some 25,900 kilograms (57,000 pounds) of mail arrived Thursday,
adding to some 22,730 kilograms (50,000 pounds) that arrived a day
earlier from around the United States.
	   ``It's a crazy operation,'' said Senior Chief Manuel Mendonza,
who is in charge of handling the incoming mail on the carrier as
several sailors came to pick up their mail.
	   I'm glad I took mine out earlier,'' said Mendonza, 49, of El
Paso, Texas.
	   Entertainment on the carrier ranged from an appearance of Santa
Claus from an FA-18 Hornet fighter jet to Christmas carols and
Christmas dinner to cheer up homesick sailors.
	   Several movies, including the 1946 classic ``It's a Wonderful
Life,'' were shown Thursday.
	   Still, everyone wanted to be home.
	   ``Not one of these people would not like to be home with the
family, including me,'' said Crocker, of Fargo, North Dakota.
	   ``I miss my mom's clam chowder. I wish I could be home,'' said
Petty Officer Kristina Manicke, 20, of Raymond, Washington.
	   ``It's my first Christmas away from family,'' said a tearful
Manicke, an aviation electronics technician.
	   Petty Officer Shelby Cornelius who works on an explosive
ordinance disposal team, said he was spending his first Christmas
away from his family in 12 years.
	   ``It's very unfortunate, but we don't have a choice. We have a
job to do,'' said Cornelius as he read his letter from his wife,
Patricia.
	   ``I will open the presents on Christmas day,'' said Cornelius,
whose wife is expecting a baby.
	   Normal operations, including reconnaissance flights are to
resume Saturday.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in
Bethlehem on Christmas Eve _ delayed by a manhunt for a Palestinian
fugitive but still in time for celebrations in the town of Jesus'
birth.
	   Troubles intruded on holiday celebrations elsewhere in the
world, too, with refugees of Hurricane Mitch finding Christmas
spirit hard to come by and Christians in Indonesia shaken by
attacks on churches.
	   Still, the sacred business of celebration took precedence for
many Christians.
	   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II celebrated this Christmas with
his mind on the next one, looking ahead eagerly to the opening of
the jubilee year that will launch Christianity's third millennium.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, the church shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the
opening of the holy door,'' John Paul said in a midnight Mass at
St. Peter's Basilica televised in about 40 countries.
	   The phrase was a slight change in wording from his prepared
text. In the original, the pope said he himself would inaugurate
the jubilee.

Taylor indicates desire to play on
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Australian cricket captain Mark
Taylor has given the clearest signal yet that he wants to remain in
charge beyond the current Ashes series against England.
	   There was speculation before this series that Taylor was
preparing to retire following the Ashes contest, although he never
suggested it was correct.
	   As Taylor prepared for Saturday's fourth test in the five-match
series, he indicated he wants to keep playing.
	   Australia tours the West Indies for a four-test series starting
in March and Taylor said he would like to play there again.
	   ``I'm fairly sure I'll go to the West Indies if the selectors
pick me,'' Taylor said Friday. ``I'm still enjoying playing and the
side is playing well with me as captain so provided those two
things are maintained I will keep playing.''
	   Taylor led Australia to a series victory on his previous tour of
the West Indies, but was unhappy with his batting form.
	   ``The one side I haven't played well against is the West Indies,
they have been the one bogey side,'' Taylor said.
	   ``I'll be going over there if selected, just trying to relax and
play the way I would play against any other side.''
	   Taylor, 34, has led Australia to 25 victories from 48 tests
since taking over from Allan Border in 1994, a winning rate among
the best in the sport's history.
	   During his aggressive and insightful reign, Australia has
stamped itself as the best test playing team in the world.
	   He made it clear his career was not set for a finish in the
fifth test at the SCG starting Jan. 2.
	   ``Whether it's my last Boxing Day test match I don't know, a
year is too long,'' Taylor said of the traditional Dec. 26 match in
Melbourne.
	   ``There's too many games between now and then, I'll just see
what happens in the next six months. I'll stop playing when I'm out
in the middle and things aren't happening for me with the bat, as a
captain or in the field or I'm standing out there one day thinking
'what the hell am I doing out here.' That will be the reason I stop
playing.''

Central Singapore snarled in huge traffic jam on Christmas Eve
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Christmas comes once a year, and that's how
about how rare huge traffic jams are in Singapore.
	   The city-state's main shopping district, Orchard Road, was
jammed with hundreds of thousands of people and bumper-to-bumper
cars from late Christmas Eve until until the wee hours of Christmas
morning.
	   It took about two hours for a bus to travel the road's length of
3 kilometers (1.86 miles). The street is lined with stalls
decorated with Warner Bros. cartoon characters and glittering
garlands in the trees.
	   Many shops stayed open late. But even when they closed, crowds _
from families to groups of teen-agers _ sat on stone planters and
benches enjoying temperatures of 30 degrees Centigrade (86 degrees
Fahrenheit).
	   The weather was relatively cool for tropical Singapore, located
just north of the equator. Hundreds of kids and adults wore red
Santa hats with blinking pompoms.
	   Less than 13 percent of Singapore's 3.1 million people are
Christian. But the multi-racial country emphasizes tolerance.
	   Christmas Day is a holiday, with the focus on shopping and
gift-giving. People of all faiths called out Merry Christmas to
each other under the palm trees.

Japanese jobless rate hits record high of 4.4 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sakaiya comment in grafs 5-6 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's unemployment rate hit a record high of 4.4
percent in November as companies struggling in the country's worst
recession in decades trimmed their work forces and suffered from a
wave of bankruptcies, the government said Friday.
	   The total number of workers shrank by 480,000 from a year ago to
64.81 million, marking the 10th straight month of on-year declines,
said the statistics bureau of the Management and Coordination
Agency. The total number of jobless stood at 2.91 million.
	   The November rate tops the previous record of 4.3 percent, set
in recent months. Worst hit were workers at medium-sized companies,
where employment fell by 1.4 percent from levels a year earlier.
	   The jobless rate _ the highest since the government started
measuring it in the 1950s _ also set another record: it was the
first time Japan's unemployment rate equaled that of the United
States, where the jobless rate also stood at 4.4 percent in
November, an agency official said.
	   The new unemployment figure comes as Japan is grappling with its
deepest recession since the end of World War II. Bankruptcy debts
have hit record highs, domestic consumption is stagnant and the
financial system is weighed down by massive bad debts.
	   The government does not expect a quick recovery. Taichi Sakaiya,
the head of the Economic Planning Agency, said Friday that the
employment situation would probably worsen before it gets better.
	   ``There's strong pressure for the jobless rate to rise,'' he
said.
	   The Labor Ministry said Friday that the ratio of job offers to
job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, fell to a new record
low of 0.47 in November, indicating that there were only 47 jobs
being offered for every 100 workers seeking employment.
	   The new job offers ratio showed there were 85 new jobs for every
100 people newly seeking work. A year ago, the ratio stood at 1.16.
	   New job offers in the manufacturing sector plunged by nearly 29
percent from a year earlier. New job offers in the construction
industry shrank by 6.3 percent from last year despite an increase
in public works spending resulting from a 16.65 trillion yen (dlrs
143.5 billion) fiscal stimulus package currently working its way
through the economy.
	   The number of workers who left their jobs unwillingly surged
360,000 in November from a year ago to 920,000, reflecting an
increase in the number of bankruptcies and the accelerating pace of
corporate downsizing.
	   Isuzu Motors Ltd., for example, announced Thursday a
restructuring plan that includes plans to reduce group-wide
payrolls by 4,000 employees by March 2000 through attrition.
	   A rise in the number of people looking for work was another
factor boosting the unemployment rate in November, the official
said.
	   Normally, the number of people looking for work declines around
the end of the year. But this year, due to the severity of the
economy, more people either continued to look for work or began
looking, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Serb attack deals new setback to shaky Kosovo peace accord

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a Serb offensive against a
Kosovo rebel stronghold, both sides are vowing to keep fighting,
dealing a new setback to an already shaky U.S.-brokered cease-fire
agreement.
	   The attack by Serb troops and tanks against six villages north
of Pristina was continuing late Thursday, sending hundreds fleeing
into snow-covered hills. An Associated Press Television News crew
saw the body of one man killed by an artillery shell in the village
of Glavnik and ethnic Albanians say several others were injured.
	   The attack began after U.S. and NATO officials warned both sides
against violence, which could threaten the fragile Oct. 12
agreement. The deal ended most of the fighting between government
forces and ethnic Albanian rebels seeking independence from
Yugoslavia's main republic, Serbia.
	   Yugoslav army soldiers backed by tanks and artillery struck at
rebel-infested villages near Podujevo, 30 kilometers (20 miles)
north of the provincial capital Pristina, purportedly searching for
gunmen who killed a Serb policeman three days before.
	   Hysni Fazliu, a spokesman for the party of leading ethnic
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, said rebels resisted the attack
in a ``fierce battle.''
	   ``Both sides have been looking for trouble and found it,'' said
William Walker, the American head of the Organization of Security
and Cooperation in Europe's verification force monitoring the
October accord. He expressed frustration at the apparent lack of
will for a peaceful settlement.
	   The OSCE reported heavy gunfire in the Podujevo area.
	   NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told BBC television that
the Serb offensive was in ``clear violation of the commitments''
undertaken in October by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
end eight months of fighting and avoid NATO airstrikes.
	   ``We remain fully vigilant and ready to act,'' Solana said.
	   In neighboring Albania, the Foreign Ministry called for NATO to
intervene to ``end the Kosovo drama'' and bring peace to the
Serbian province, where ethnic Albanians form the overwhelming
majority.
	   In a statement distributed Thursday night by the government's
Tanjug news agency, Serb police said they encountered ``fierce
fire'' but ``liquidated'' several ``terrorists'' in the rebel
stronghold Lapastica.
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's ultra-nationalist vice premier, Vojislav
Seselj, said ``our police must continue to clamp down against the
terrorists.''
	   The KLA, which is fighting for independence for Kosovo, stopped
short of abrogating a separate cease-fire it unilaterally
proclaimed just before the October deal was reached.
	   In a statement issued in Pristina, however, the rebels said they
would ``not sit idly by'' and would ``attack with all means
available.''
	   In London, a KLA political representative, Pleurat Sejdru, told
BBC-TV that the cease-fire ``doesn't have any sense to be in
place.''
	   The U.S. and French governments condemned the Serb attack. The
State Department also condemned all breaches of the ceasefire,
including provocative attacks committed by elements of the KLA.
	   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians, including women and children, fled
the region on foot and by vehicles on snow-covered roads and hills
around Podujevo.
	   About 1,000 people were killed and 300,000 fled their homes in
fighting that began Feb. 28 when Milosevic launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian secessionists.
	   That phase ended with an agreement between Milosevic and U.S.
envoy Richard Holbrooke, which averted threatened NATO airstrikes.
But diplomatic efforts to forge a longterm formula for Kosovo's
future have stalled, with both sides rejecting American proposals.

Bahamas residents complain of chilly reception at Atlantis resort
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DEBY NASH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) _ Feeling slighted, Bahamian residents and
their government are complaining about having to pay a fee to visit
attractions since the much-vaunted opening of the Atlantis resort
built by South African entrepreneur Sol Kerzner.
	   Islanders have sent letters of protest to Prime Minister Hubert
Ingraham. His office in turn protested to Sun International Ltd. on
Tuesday, saying it was ``not acceptable, nor permissible, that
certain of the facilities at Altantis be closed to the general
public.''
	   The dlrs 450 million project, billed as the world's largest
island resort, opened two weeks ago.
	   This week, it started charging visitors dlrs 25 and Bahamian
residents dlrs 12 to visit attractions such as a marine exhibit
with 30,000 to 40,000 species, and a see-through tunnel that
propels riders through lagoon filled with sharks and barracudas.
	   The letter from the prime minister's office noted that the
resort enjoys certain duty-free privileges under the Hotels
Encouragement Act, and that ``resorts enjoying concessions under
the act must make the facilities of the hotel available to the
general public.''
	   The resort's vice president J. Barrie Farrington said that
``obviously our desire is to accommodate the Bahamian community, it
is not to discourage or prevent access.''
	   But guests had complained of lack of privacy, he said, with
2,500 and more non-guests visiting on a busy day.
	   ``We created this very wonderful attraction at considerable
expense so we want to treat it more commercially ... and
justifiably so,'' he said.
	   On Thursday, the resort promised that ``in an effort to continue
our positive relationship with the Bahamian community, the company
will provide the Bahamian public with even greater access to the
features of Atlantis.''
	   Farrington said that meant Bahamians could tour the gardens and
refurbished facilities of the resort's original two hotels for
free, as well as the lobby of the new 23-story Royal Towers, the
highest buildings in the Bahamas. But he said they would have to
pay the dlrs 12 to visit the other new attractions.
	   That is unlikely to appease Bahamians, as indicated by an
editorial Thursday in The Nassau Guardian, which said: ``When
compared to similar attractions elsewhere, and recognizing the
amount of money that went into its creation, dlrs 12 is not an
unreasonable sum to pay ... But that is the deal.''

Dollar down slightly against yen, Tokyo stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The dollar was marginally lower against the yen
Friday morning as holiday-thinned trading ground to a near halt.
Japanese share prices moved higher after a loss the previous day.
	   The dollar bought 116.05 yen at midday, down 0.07 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 116.29
yen overnight.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 160.71 points, or 1.17
percent, to close the morning session at 13,867.44. On Thursday,
the average finished down 72.72 points, or 0.53 percent.
	   In currency dealings, trades remained in a narrow range with
many players taking off for Christmas.
	   Traders reacted little to a slew of negative economic data
released earlier in the day, including the announcement of a
record-high jobless rate, as the poor state of the economy had
already been factored in.
	   Japan's unemployment rate hit 4.4 percent in November, the
highest level since the current system of calculation was
introduced in the 1950s, the Management and Coordination Agency
announced
	   Separately, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
said Japan's industrial output fell 2.0 percent in November from
October, while large store retail sales for the same month fell 1.5
percent from a year ago.
	   On the stock market, share prices were higher in thin trading as
an early rise in bond prices eased investor concerns over the
recent weakness in the credit market.
	   ``There is some buying from pension funds because many stocks
are now very cheap with the Nikkei average below 14,000 points,''
said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock division at Tokyo
Securities.
	   But trading was conducted mostly by dealers closing out
positions was Friday is the last day to trade stocks for delivery
during 1998. Activity also remained sparse because of the Christmas
holiday in many countries.
	   ``There is no reason to trade shares,'' said Masaaki Higashida,
a deputy general manager at Nomura Securities.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 10.03 points, or 0.93 percent, to 1,084.21.
The TOPIX closed down 8.28 points, or 0.76 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 1.800 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.885 percent,
driving its price up to 100.00 yen from 99.31 yen.

Minister angers Indo-Trinidadians, threatens to resign
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A cabinet member who called
Indo-Trinidadians ``some of the most ignorant people on the
planet'' is accusing Trinidad's prime minister of creating a
``Hindu theocracy.''
	   Dr. Morgan Job, the minister in charge of affairs for the island
of Tobago, threatened to resign Wednesday, saying Prime Minister
Basdeo Panday was stoking racial conflict with attacks on news
media owned by people of African descent.
	   Panday and most supporters of his United National Congress are
descendants of East Indians brought to Trinidad as indentured
laborers, while Job and the majority of Tobago residents are black
descendants of African slaves.
	   Two weeks ago, Job himself called Indo-Trinidadians who support
offering Hindu courses in schools ``ignorant idiots.''
	   ``The Indians here are some of the most ignorant people on the
planet that I know,'' Job said. ``The people who call themselves
Hindus and Indians in Trinidad are so ignorant it's embarrassing.''
	   Trinidad and Tobago, an oil-rich Caribbean country off the coast
of Venezuela, has been marked by racial tension. The two ethnic
groups about evenly divide the population of 1.3 million.
	   Panday's party took power in the 1995 elections. All previous
governments since the country gained independence from Britain in
1962 have been dominated by Afro-Trinidadians.
	   The prime minister has had a running battle with the primarily
black-owned media, and his supporters physically assaulted
journalists during a party rally in November.
	   Panday did not react to Job's comments Wednesday, but Satnarayan
Maharaj, general secretary of the Hindu association Sanatan Dharma
Maha Sabha, called the Job ``mentally unstable'' and ``sub-human.''

Japan's industrial output drops further than expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Industrial output at Japan's factories and mines in
November fell a larger-than-expected 2 percent compared to the
previous month, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry
said Friday.
	   With production down for the second month in a row, MITI
characterized the situation as remaining ``stagnant.''
	   ``Despite progress in inventory adjustment, the inventory to
shipments ratio is still at a high level, mainly due to weakness in
shipments,'' a ministry official told reporters.
	   The fall was considerably larger than the average forecast in a
survey of economists, who projected a 1.1 percent decline in
seasonally-adjusted production. The survey was conducted by Dow
Jones Newswires.
	   The government had predicted a 1.5 percent drop.
	   In October, the fall in output had been less than expected,
coming in at 1.2 percent.
	   Dragging down production in November was a plunge in the
manufacture of transportation equipment and general machinery, MITI
said.
	   Despite the drop, the ministry said output would rebound in
coming months, predicting a rise of 0.3 percent in December from
November, followed by a 1.3 percent rise in January.
	   ``Production will pick up on the back of higher output in
certain industries,'' the official said. ``But there still isn't
enough data to indicate that the economy has hit bottom.''
	   The ministry also announced Friday that retail sales fell for
the seventh month in a row.
	   Sales at Japan's major department stores and supermarkets in
November dropped 1.5 percent to 1.960 trillion yen (dlrs 16.9
billion) on the year, MITI announced, predicting another decline
next month.

Not even 5, boy calls on Annan to work for world peace
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Lucas Olson Duffy hasn't even reached his
fifth birthday yet, but he already has the makings of a diplomat
and some definite ideas about world peace.
	   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, he said:
``Please talk to the president of Iraq. Please make up. Work it
out.''
	   The letter, hand printed with slightly crooked letters, is
signed ``Lucas,'' who is ``age 4 11/12.''
	   The secretary-general sent a thank you letter to Lucas, a
student at the U.N. International School.
	   ``I am glad to see that one is never too young to speak out for
peace,'' he said. ``I promise you I will work very hard for peace,
in Iraq and everywhere else in the world.''

Balloonists face most difficult obstacle in round-the-world trip

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with crew saying they are entering a
critical time for the mission; latest position. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ With more than half the adventure completed, three
men attempting to become the first to circumnavigate the globe by
balloon faced a critical point in their journey Friday as they
crossed the Pacific Ocean.
	   British tycoon Richard Branson, American millionaire Steve
Fossett and Per Lindstrand of Sweden entered a weather depression
over the ocean that project manager David Partridge said threatened
to pull their balloon out of the jet stream, and reverse its
direction.
	   ``They are right now in the low pressure trough. If they track
north, they go towards the jetstream. If they go south they head
towards Hawaii,'' said Partridge.
	   Comparing the jet stream to ``a river of fast moving air in the
sky,'' Partridge said the balloon needed to stay in the jet stream
to have any hope of completing its mission.
	   ``The jetstream gives us the best possible speed. If we fly low
it would take too long to get around. We would run out of fuel,''
he said.
	   The crew, planning to fly at 28,000 to 31,000 feet (8,500 to
9,500 meters) in a pressurized capsule, was expected to reach North
America sometime Christmas Day, most likely in the evening over
southern Canada or Washington state.
	   The balloon passed the halfway mark Thursday on an eastward
circuit of the globe about 1,500 miles (2,400 km) east of Japan.
The journey began in Marrakech, Morocco, on Dec. 18.
	   At 0200 GMT Friday, Partidge said that the 272-foot-high
(83-meter-high) ICO Global hot and helium balloon was about 700
miles (1,100 kms) northwest of Hawaii and was flying at about the
same altitude as a jumbo jet.
	   Provided all went well, Partridge said that the crew would
celebrate Christmas with boil-in-the-bag turkey meals, and would
make decorations out of paper printouts of messages sent from
London.
	   ``The suggestion has been to cut those to make party hats,''
said Partridge.
	   The trip was expected to last an additional eight days to three
weeks and finish in Western Europe at the end of the 24,000-mile
(38,000 kms) flight.
	   The London-based support team said it was concerned by the low
frequency of shipping in the Pacific, which would make a rescue
difficult. On Friday, they were tracking the position of all ships
that would be under the balloon in the Pacific.
	   Balloon pilots navigate by changing the lift of the balloon to
ascend or descend into different wind systems, and cannot plan
their courses and speeds precisely.
	   Long-distance balloon attempts are often attempted in winter,
Partridge said, because the jet streams, which run from west to
east, tend to be more stable and strong than at other times of the
year.
	   The team secured permission from 97 countries for overflights
and initially had only four refusals _ Iran, Iraq, Russia and North
Korea.
	   China had said the balloonists could cross their territory below
26 degrees north latitude. But the trio drifted further north
Monday after navigating around Mediterranean storms and closed
airspace over Iraq, Iran and Russia.
	   With the help of British diplomats, the balloonists won Chinese
permission to continue if they got out of the country as quickly as
possible.

Official says PAL still in talks with Cathay Pacific, Northwest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Debt-strapped Philippine Airlines is
still holding talks to revive the national carrier with foreign
investors, including Cathay Pacific Airlines and Northwest
Airlines, a senior official said Friday.
	   ``In order not to disturb the talks, they are not disclosing
this to the public,'' presidential Executive Secretary Ronaldo
Zamora in a radio interview. ``They are talking in private.''
	   Zamora also said that the government is prepared to help the
airline ``under commercial terms'' but it will not to take over
PAL.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks in September following labor
disputes and mounting losses worsened by Asia's financial crisis.
Its problems worsened with a pilots' strike last June.
	   It then opened negotiations with Cathay Pacific, but the Hong
Kong carrier announced early December it was pulling out of the
talks.
	   Zamora did not say how Cathay Pacific officials agreed to resume
talks, although President Joseph Estrada has pledged to bring the
two sides back to the negotiating table.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu has said the airlines
disagreed over management control of PAL and the timing of Cathay
Pacific's capital infusion into the Philippine carrier.
	   Cathay Pacific also refused to put its money into PAL until
after a PAL rehabilitation plan has been approved by creditors and
Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission, Espiritu said.
	   PAL submitted the plan to the Securities and Exchange Commission
on Monday. The plan must be approved by the SEC and the airline's
local and foreign creditors, to whom it owes dlrs 2.1 billion.
	   PAL's European creditors, however, rejected the rehabilitation
plan because it did not ensure the participation of a ``strategic
partner'' and the infusion of dlrs 200 million in fresh capital.
	   The creditors control the leases on 12 of the 22 Airbus jets PAL
would operate under the proposed rehabilitation plan.

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ Yasser Arafat's helicopter landed in
Bethlehem on Christmas Eve _ delayed by a manhunt for a Palestinian
fugitive but still in time for celebrations in the town of Jesus'
birth.
	   Troubles intruded on holiday celebrations elsewhere in the
world, too, with refugees of Hurricane Mitch finding Christmas
spirit hard to come by and Christians in Indonesia shaken by
attacks on churches.
	   Still, the sacred business of celebration took precedence for
many Christians.
	   At the Vatican, Pope John Paul II celebrated this Christmas with
his mind on the next one, looking ahead eagerly to the opening of
the jubilee year that will launch Christianity's third millennium.
	   ``My thoughts already turn to Christmas next year, when, God
willing, the church shall inaugurate the great jubilee with the
opening of the holy door,'' John Paul said in a midnight Mass at
St. Peter's Basilica televised in about 40 countries.
	   The phrase was a slight change in wording from his prepared
text. In the original, the pope said he himself would inaugurate
the jubilee.
	   Even the dragnet in the town of Jesus' birth could not dampen
festivities. Boy Scout bagpipe bands marched throughout the day,
and crowds of well-wishers _ along with mounted Palestinian police
_ greeted the Latin patriarch, Michel Sabbah.
	   As soon as darkness fell, the snap and sparkle of firecrackers
filled Manger Square _ despite pleas by Mayor Hanna J. Nasser, who
says such displays are inappropriate at Christmas.
	   Bethlehem was handed from Israeli to Palestinian rule just
before Christmas 1995, and the fireworks were a celebration of
independence.
	   Heather Taylor, a 25-year-old teacher from Winnsboro, Texas,
said she didn't mind the intrusion: ``I'm here to be near to the
place of the person I love, the Savior I love.''
	   Decorum came later in the evening with Midnight Mass in the
Church of St. Katherine, next to the fourth-century Church of the
Nativity that was built on the traditional birthplace of Jesus. A
10-foot by 10-foot television screen was set up for the overflow.
	   Sabbah fanned incense over the altar, and led a service that
included prayers in Arabic, English and Latin.
	   He delivered a sharply political sermon, alluding to Israel as
the ``oppressor'' and praying for the release of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails. Sabbah also prayed for the ``people of
Iraq,'' days after a U.S.-British bombardment of that country.
	   The nationalist tone of previous Christmases in a Bethlehem
under Palestinian authority has been played down: Instead of the
2-story-high portrait Arafat of earlier years, smaller depictions
of the Palestinian leader were hanging from streamers over Manger
Square.
	   A manhunt for Jamil Jadala, a Bethlehem native accused of
involvement in the October killings of two Israelis, was still
under way when Arafat arrived in Bethlehem early Thursday evening.
Arafat is under pressure from Israel to contain political violence,
and Jadala's escape from a Nablus jail earlier this week has
embarrassed him.
	   Istanbul's largest Roman Catholic Church called off Christmas
Eve midnight Mass, citing security concerns due to strong
anti-Italian sentiment over Italy's harboring of a Kurdish rebel.
	   In the Persian Gulf, some 72 planes, including 46 fighter jets,
were chained down Thursday as a giant U.S. aircraft carrier dropped
anchor to prepare for Christmas celebrations.
	   It was business as usual for most Japanese on Christmas, which
is a secular, largely commercial event and not a national holiday.
About 1 percent of Japan's 125 million people are Christians.
	   In Singapore, the main shopping district, Orchard Road, was
jammed with hundreds of thousands of people and bumper-to-bumper
cars late Christmas Eve. Less than 13 percent of Singapore's 3.1
million people are Christian. But the city-state emphasizes
tolerance. Christmas Day is a holiday and people call out Merry
Christmas to each other under the palm trees.

Communist rebels declare Christmas holiday cease-fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Communist rebels have declared a
Christmas holiday ceasefire, the leftwing umbrella National
Democratic Front said in a statement Friday.
	   The ceasefire took effect at midnight Dec. 23 and will end at
midnight Jan. 3.
	   The rebel New People's Army, however, will remain ready ``to
defend itself, its guerrilla areas and the people'' against
government assaults, the front said.
	   The government earlier declared a Dec. 15-Jan. 20 cease-fire
against the communist rebels.
	   The government said the cease-fire will not cover law
enforcement and security functions and defense of government
installations against rebel attacks.
	   In a separate statement to mark the 30th anniversary Saturday of
the founding of the Communist Party of the Philippines, party
chairman Armando Liwanag said ``the objective conditions are
growing ever more favorable for people's war.''
	   Liwanag said the party now has ``tens of thousands'' of members
from a few score when it was established in 1968. Its guerrilla
army has thousands of fighters ``equivalent to several regiments''
operating on 60 guerrilla fronts in ``substantial portions'' of the
country, he added.
	   The military, however, estimates that the rebels, which had a
peak strength of about 27,000 in the late 1980s, now number only
about 8,000.
	   Liwanag accused the government of President Joseph Estrada of
trying to terminate the peace talks to escape its obligations to
implement an agreement on human rights, including compensating
victims of abuse under late dictator Ferdinand Marcos and the
release of political prisoners.
	   The talks began in 1992 under then President Fidel Ramos.
	   Liwanag also said the communist rebels' ``informal, friendly and
cooperative'' ties are now developing into a formal alliance with
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front rebel group in the southern
Philippines.
	   The MILF is the largest of two Muslim rebel groups fighting for
a separate Islamic state in the southern Philippines.
	   The government has a cease-fire agreement with the MILF, which
began peace negotiations in 1997.
	   A larger Muslim rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front,
signed a peace accord in 1996. Some of its guerrillas have been
recruited into the regular armed forces.
