Jarrett not to be denied in Brickyard
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By TERRY BLOUNT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INDIANAPOLIS _ One year after blowing a chance to win, Dale Jarrett
won the Brickyard 400 by blowing away the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett suffered through the most frustrating moment of his
career last year at Indianapolis when his team miscalculated its
fuel consumption and ran dry midway through the race, causing
Jarrett to go four laps down en route to finishing 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The Quality Care Ford team returned to Indy with something to
prove and dominated Saturday's race, finishing more than three
seconds ahead of second-place Bobby Labonte. Defending champion
Jeff Gordon was third, Mark Martin finished fourth and Jeff Burton
took fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes the sting away from last year, that's for sure''
said Jarrett, who earned $712,240 for his victory. ``To come here
and win this year after having the best car last year is
phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second Brickyard 400 victory for Jarrett, who won the
event in 1996. But his team's main thought this time was making up
for last year's mistake in the No. 88 Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody knows we gave the race away last year,''
said Todd Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief. ``This is the same car we
had here then.''
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of more than 350,000 watched Jarrett lead 117 of
the 160 laps at the historic 2.5-mile oval, including the last 42
laps of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 88 car just got up on everybody and drove away,'' Jeff
Burton said. ``We made some changes (Saturday) morning and had a
really awesome racecar, but no one had anything for Jarrett
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett clearly had the best car, but the 42-year-old Hickory,
N.C., resident might have suffered the same fate as last year if
not for a yellow flag late in the race when Dave Marcis blew an
engine with 17 laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's final pit stop came on lap 116, meaning he would have
needed to go 44 laps on his last tank of fuel. Anything more than
40 green-flag laps at Indy is pushing your luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year, you wonder what may happen,'' Jarrett said.
``I got on the radio and asked Todd if we would be OK on fuel. He
said we would if I took care of the car and was easy on the gas
pedal. But we got some good racing luck with the caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took on only two tires on that last stop and we weren't
sure what it would do, but we had some of our best laps of the day
at the end. The car was easy to drive and handled perfectly. And
the engine was something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of last year's fuel miscalculation, Jarrett and Parrott
spent a lot of time on fuel calculations during a test session at
Indy two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year my fuel light came on when I ran out of gas, so it
didn't do me a hell of a lot of good,'' Jarrett said. ``This time
we set the fuel light to be sure I would have two laps left if the
light came on.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said a light came on in his head when he scraped the
wall in turn 1 on lap 19 while running second behind Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't paying good enough attention,'' Jarrett said.
``The car was a little tight, so I looked in my mirror to see what
was behind me and I brushed the wall. I think I've banged the wall
once every year we've been here, so I got this one out of the way
early.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett said the driver he feared the most all day was Bobby
Labonte, who passed Jarrett for the lead on lap 78 before Jarrett
regained the lead one lap later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That guy in 18 car (Labonte), you never know what he's got,''
Jarrett said. ``He passed me once and showed me he could do it. But
I had such a strong engine that when I really needed to go I could
get right down in the corners and stretch it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte now has two second-place finishes and one third at
Indianapolis in the Interstate Batteries Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would gladly trade one of my wins elsewhere for one of
Dale's here,'' Labonte said. ``My car probably was better than I
was today, but it didn't matter because Dale was dialed in all
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon started on the pole and led 24 laps early in the race,
but said he knew it was going to take a mistake by Jarrett's team
for anyone else to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``DJ had us covered,'' Gordon said. ``Even in practice (Friday)
I knew he would be the guy to beat. But I'm happy with what we did.
We had a lot of trouble getting the car hooked up, so I'm really
proud of coming back to finish third.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and all of the other contenders know it will take a minor
miracle for anyone to catch Jarrett now in the chase for the
Winston Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett increased his lead to 274 points, but he knows the
feeling of being one of the guys trying to catch up. He finished
third, second and third to the champion the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more fun being where we are,'' Jarrett said. ``When
you're second or third, you have to rely on the guy leading the
points having a bad day. Sometimes we would finish second, but he
would finish first. It's a lot more fun to be in control of your
destiny. It's fun to be on top.''

Four Cowboys have made case for Hall
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JODY GOLDSTEIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WICHITA FALLS _ Never have three players been together so long, had
so much success together and made such an impact on the game.
</P>
<P>
   It is the reason the Cowboys eventually could see Troy Aikman,
Emmitt Smith and Michael Irvin in the Pro Football Hall of Fame
some day. Aikman and Smith are virtual locks to make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's something that we're very proud of,'' Aikman
said. ``I think it's something that we're thankful of to (Cowboys
owner) Jerry (Jones). He's the one who's really been able to keep
us here. I do believe there's a special bond between us and the
fact that Michael came in and I followed him, and Emmitt came in
right after me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all went through the growing years together and the growing
things and we've enjoyed our success together. I can't imagine it
being any different. More than likely, we'll all be together when
we go out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Hall, that is. Aikman is one of only three quarterbacks
in NFL history to lead his team to three Super Bowl victories. He
enters his 11th season either owning or sharing 43 team passing
records. He has a completion percentage of .618 over his career, a
mark that is third-best in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when he visits the Hall of Fame this weekend in Canton,
Ohio, a tour the Cowboys have scheduled in conjunction with their
Monday night exhibition game against the Cleveland Browns, he won't
be picturing himself there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never really counted myself as being in the Hall of
Fame,'' Aikman said. ``If it were to happen, then it would be a
tremendous honor because of the players that were in it. Coming
into the game in '89, I didn't have any thoughts of being in the
Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career at this time has surpassed any of my wildest
expectations. And yet, it's still not enough. If I wound up being
in the Hall of Fame, then I would be as honored as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt Smith will be honored alongside him one
day. Now that Detroit Lions great Barry Sanders has announced his
retirement, Smith is the active NFL career rushing leader, coming
into his 10th season with 12,566 yards. That total puts him fifth
on the list and only 4,160 yards behind all-time leader Walter
Payton. With no plans of retirement any time soon and, barring
injuries, Payton's record is within Smith's grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the first player in NFL history to have five
consecutive seasons (1991-95) with 1,400 or more rushing yards.
With his NFL-record 25 touchdowns in 1995, he scored 100 touchdowns
in only six seasons, the fastest anyone in league history reached
that mark. He has been to seven Pro Bowls and was the 1993 NFL
Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a question mark among the Cowboys' big three, it is
Irvin, who has the stat sheet to get in but a rap sheet that could
cause problems. In 11 years, he has set team records for career
receptions (740) and yardage (11,737). He either owns or shares 20
Cowboys receiving records, including nearly every major career or
single-season standard.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks 10th on both the NFL career receiving list and career
receiving yard list. If he puts up the kind of numbers this year
that he has averaged over his 111-game career, he could rise as
high as fifth place on both lists by the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the off-the-field issues that could hinder Irvin's
chances. He missed the first five games of the 1996 season because
of an NFL suspension after a lengthy court battle resulted in a
plea of no contest to drug possession charges.
</P>
<P>
   One of this year's inductees into the Hall _ troubled linebacker
Lawrence Taylor _ sets a precedent for the voters to focus solely
on the on-the-field accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   One player who hasn't been wearing a star on his helmet as long,
but is a shoo-in for future induction, is cornerback/returner Deion
Sanders. The former two-sport athlete is the only person in
professional sports history to play in both a World Series (with
Atlanta in '92) and a Super Bowl (with San Francisco and Dallas).
</P>
<P>
   Known as the most dominant cover cornerback in the game, Sanders
has seven Pro Bowl appearances, 41 career interceptions and 20
regular-season touchdowns to his credit. He is second in NFL
history with eight interception returns for touchdowns and needs
only one to tie Ken Houston's all-time record of nine. He holds the
NFL record of return touchdowns of all types, with 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than Michael Jordan, there's been no one like him,''
Irvin said. ``Jordan did that in his sport, and I don't know if he
impacted a game quite like Deion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders has unmatched speed. In 10 seasons as a runner,
receiver, defender, punt returner and kickoff returner, he has
averaged 16.9 yards every time he has touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hesitate when I say someone is the best because
there's been so many great players in the history of the NFL,''
Cowboys special teams coach Joe Avezzano said. ``But I comfortably
say he's the best punt returner who has ever played. I still
stutter a little when I say that because that's such a startling
statement, but I have to with him.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other Cowboys players who haven't yet solidified their
spots in the Hall of Fame but could before their careers are over _
most notably offensive linemen Larry Allen and Mark Stepnoski.
Allen, a guard/tackle second-round pick out of Sonoma State in
1994, already has earned four All-Pro selections in only five NFL
seasons. Stepnoski, an 11-year veteran at center, made five
consecutive trips to Hawaii for the Pro Bowl from 1993-97.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas hasn't played in the Hall of Fame Game since 1979, so
this will be the first trip to Canton for most of the Cowboys.
Sightseeing and soaking up nostalgia are on the itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a real appreciation for the game and the players that
played it before me and their accomplishments,'' Aikman said.
``I've wanted to go. I think more than likely once I get there, it
will become more meaningful. It will probably affect me more.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time he makes the trip likely will be as an inductee.

DAVENPORT ON SOLID FOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 NO LONGER NO. 1-LBPT (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to say whom Lindsay Davenport stymies more frequently,
her tennis opponents or journalists. She has what the lay person
calls a ``nice personality.''
</P>
<P>
   She's punctual, cordial and good-natured. So in these days of
flashy women's tennis in which tantrums, teenagers and bravado are
daily occurrences, Davenport is comparatively _ gasp _ boring. She
knows her personality and accentuates it to hungry journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be the player who on the Monday after the
tournament is getting all the press for winning the tournament,''
Davenport said. ``I just really let the tennis do the talking. I
don't worry about too many other things. I don't like to create a
lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport and her pleasant personality will command attention
this week as she tries to defend her Acura Classic title at
Manhattan Country Club. The 23 year old, who grew up in Southern
California and lives in Newport Beach, is making a homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davenport came to Los Angeles ranked second in the
world without a grand-slam title. This year, she was ranked first
until Saturday when Martina Hingis reclaimed the ranking. She will
return to L.A. with two Grand Slam titles, having won the U.S. Open
last year and Wimbledon this year.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Davenport is hot with the exception of losing, 6-4,
7-5, to Venus Williams Saturday in the semifinals of the TIG
Classic at Carlsbad. After winning last week in Stanford, she is
18-2 in her past 20 matches (she also lost to Serena Williams at
Indian Wells), 35-6 this year and 20-4 on hard courts.
</P>
<P>
   Until she lost Saturday, Davenport was going for a Californian
sweep. She completed the sweep last year, winning in Stanford,
Carlsbad and Manhattan Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of knew I'd lose it this summer because I have so many
points to defend,'' Davenport said, after losing to Williams.
``I'll just try to get it back during the (U.S.) Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Davenport lost Saturday, she said a sweep in
California was a tall order.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my best traits is that I'm pretty realistic,'' she said
before the Californian tournaments. ``I love this surface, and I
love California, but two win all three last year was pretty special
and pretty magical.''
</P>
<P>
   There's that humble personality, again. She perhaps did pick an
appropriate word to describe her tennis because it's no stretch to
call her Wimbledon title magical. For several reasons, Davenport
wasn't ``supposed to'' win the prestigious grass tournament. Many
factors were working against her, so bookies made the odds of a
Davenport Wimbledon victory at 15-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Grass is not her surface. Almost everyone who follows tennis
knows that, and Davenport accepts that power is her strong point,
which usually isn't the key on grass. She doesn't have the quickest
feet in tennis, but makes up for it with a balance of strength and
consistency. Overall, however, she didn't appear to have the style
of play for a Wimbledon champ.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Chris Evert was the last American to win Wimbledon.
And that was in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport silenced critics and made one of the biggest steps of
her six-year professional tennis career by winning where she wasn't
``supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two Grand Slam titles instead of one puts me in a more elite
category,'' Davenport said. ``With just one, you may think it was
just lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's tennis keeps developing. She is lean, 6-foot-2{ and
175 pounds. But it wasn't always the case. Earlier in her career,
her weight most likely kept her from becoming an elite player. On
the tennis tour, which can be harsh and immature, a faction of
players nicknamed her Dump Truck.
</P>
<P>
   Although she had the cruel nickname and several players talked
behind her back, Davenport's attitude and tennis weren't affected
significantly. Even when she was new on the tennis tour, she
carried herself with maturity that she learned before she turned
pro.
</P>
<P>
   Her body type can make Davenport stick out in a crowd. This
could be disconcerting for a young woman, but early on, she learned
it wasn't necessarily negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty much 6-2 and almost 15 years old,'' Davenport
said. ``There are traits in kids that you just have to get used to.
Now I couldn't be happier.''
</P>
<P>
   She also couldn't be happier to be returning to L.A. She had one
of her first tennis experiences at the tournament, when it was
called the Virginia Slims, and someone in that position, a
Davenport in making, could be in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the most special tournament to me,''
Davenport said. ``My mom took me there when I was a girl, and
that's where I was first introduced to pro tennis. It's an
atmosphere that I love with my friends and family there.''

SANCHEZ VICARIO CAN'T BE TYPECAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the WTA Tour didn't exist, the WB network would
create it.
</P>
<P>
   Women's professional tennis, after all, is equal parts sport and
soap opera. It has more pretty, preening teens than ``Dawson's
Creek.'' It is more illusory than ``Charmed,'' darker than ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' as angst-filled as ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   However unintentionally, the WTA Tour reflects Moronic Youth,
the preoccupation with pubescence that has spawned a spate of
television shows (and films) featuring physically and financially
fit under-twentysomething characters.
</P>
<P>
   With a cast starring the likes of Venus and Serena Williams and
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the WTA Tour is more diverse than your
run-of-the-mill prime-time teen drama. But it is sadly the same in
other ways, mirroring television's obsession with youth (Martina
Hingis, the Williams sisters) and beauty (Anna Kournikova, Mary
Pierce).
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario, who has spent half her life on the professional
circuit, is a minority, all right. She is the Tour's token
do-gooder.
</P>
<P>
   Few players are more attractive on the inside. Fewer still have
been as outwardly successful.
</P>
<P>
   But because she doesn't have a supermodel's legs or a prize
fighter's mouth, the spotlight has largely skipped right over the
27-year-old Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   Renown has eluded her even though it's hard to ignore her
results. Consider: Sanchez Vicario has been No.1 in the world for
more weeks than the Williams sisters, Kournikova and Mary Pierce
combined. For 12 weeks in 1995, no other player on the planet was
above her.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the No.8 ranking that Sanchez Vicario brings to this
week's Acura Classic in Manhattan Beach are some very deep roots.
She planted herself in the top 10 in 1989, the year she won her
first Grand Slam title at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   She has been as unyielding as an oak ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 11 years, Sanchez Vicario's lowest year-end
ranking was ninth. That was in 1997, when she battled injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 she rebounded to win her fourth Grand Slam title. She
has 13 if you lump in doubles and mixed doubles with her singles
success. And why shouldn't they count toward her legacy? No one
denigrates Jenny Thompson's place in Olympic record books just
because her five swimming gold medals _ which tie her with
speedskater Bonnie Blair for the most gold medals won by a U.S.
woman _ all were earned in relays.
</P>
<P>
   If expanding one's game to include the alleys was so easy, more
players would excel at it. In fact, Sanchez Vicario is one of only
three female players to be ranked No.1 simultaneously in singles
and doubles. Martina Navratilova preceded her and Hingis followed.
</P>
<P>
   That places Sanchez Vicario in esteemed company. So does this:
At the beginning of 1998 she became the third female tennis player
in history _ behind Navratilova and Steffi Graf _ to surpass the
$12million mark in on-court earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball player Tony Gwynn won our attention and admiration last
week when he became the 22nd player to collect his 3,000th hit.
Sanchez Vicario drew considerably less notice in the first round of
the 1998 French Open when she became only the ninth woman to win
600 singles matches.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth round of the same tournament Sanchez Vicario would
skirt a shot to her temple in a fit of frustration by Serena
Williams. She would then survive a three-set final against Monica
Seles to win her third singles title at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sanchez Vicario's sixth three-set marathon in 12 Grand
Slam singles finals. Her sheer doggedness should have been enough
to impress us.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, what we remember is Seles, playing three weeks after
her father's death, being denied a storybook ending to a sad
chapter in her fractured fairytale life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite how it looked, Sanchez Vicario hadn't quite played her
heart out. She had saved a piece of it for her vanquished foe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry I beat you,'' Sanchez Vicario began, and her
grace in that moment made the rest of her words run together.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an isolated act of class. You have tennis stars who
behave like children and then you have Sanchez Vicario, who spends
her own money and time on projects that make life better for
underprivileged children and terminally ill kids.
</P>
<P>
   As 1998 came to a close, Sanchez Vicario's distinguished service
(and we're not talking about the act that begins with the ball
toss) earned her Spain's coveted Principe De Asturiaso award. Think
Nobel Prize and you've got the general idea.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be nice if Sanchez Vicario won this week in Hollywood's
backyard, but it's hardly necessary. She doesn't need her Hollywood
close-up to be a star. &QL;

SPOUSAL RAPE CARRIES LIGHTER PENALTIES IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSIE STECKNER  
 and JODIE SNYDER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leo Thomas got five years for raping his girlfriend, but he's
appealing the sentence on the grounds that the two were living like
husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Thomas claims, it was really like raping his
wife, which under Arizona law is a minor offense.
</P>
<P>
   And at least one judge agrees with him.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' defense, which has angered victims advocates, is based
on the fact that rape suspects in Arizona and most other states can
receive dramatically lighter penalties if they and their victims
share a marriage license.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we mention this, people just have disbelief,'' said
Christina Wildlake, head of the newly formed Arizona Sexual Assault
Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to relook at the law.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago in Arizona, it wasn't a crime to rape your spouse.
Today, a first-time spousal rape is a minor felony, considered as
serious as spitting on someone or slashing car tires.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, people convicted of non-spousal rape must go to
prison, sometimes for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' victim, whom ``The Republic'' is not identifying, said
she was stunned to learn of the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't believe that you can enter a relationship with
somebody and the crime is OK,'' the 38-year-old Phoenix area woman
said. ``It's like, whatever happens in your house is nobody's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But some family rights activists express concern about
stiffening spousal rape laws. They say spouses too often claim
abuse to gain leverage in divorce or child-custody proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just treacherous water,'' said Lesley Wimberly, a
Tucson legal consultant who specializes in cases of false abuse
allegations. ``We need to be very careful where we walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to protect the victim. But at the same time, you
don't want to create a new set of victims.'' &QL; 
OUTRAGED BY INEQUITY &QL; 
Maureen Jones-Ryan, who fought to get Arizona's current law on the
books, is outraged by the Thomas case and by the inequity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rape is a rape is a rape,'' said Jones-Ryan, director of the
Sexual Assault Recovery Institute in Phoenix. ``There should be no
discrimination because of the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who declined requests for an interview through his
attorney, denies in court documents that he committed rape.
However, he also claims that he and his girlfriend were all but
married at the time of the incident and, thus, his sentence should
be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Barbara Jarrett, who was
unavailable for comment, called his punishment ``clearly
excessive'' in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   She granted Thomas' request to petition the state Board of
Executive Clemency to commute his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates seeking to change the law say it may be an uphill
battle because it also means changing public perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time that women were considered chattel, they were
property,'' said Ernie Garfield, a businessman who serves on Gov.
Jane Hull's Commission on Violence Against Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, we haven't come that far.'' &QL; 
MARRIED MEN WERE EXEMPT &QL; 
Until 1976, no state considered it a crime for a husband to rape
his wife because married men were once exempted.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's a crime to some degree in every state. Eighteen
states and the District of Columbia have abolished the exemption,
according to the National Clearinghouse on Marital and Date Rape in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, it became a crime to rape or sexually assault your
spouse in 1988, primarily at the urging of Jones-Ryan. The bill was
sponsored by former Sen. Carolyn Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the only one of the many people I approached over
three or four years who was willing to stick her neck out and take
it on,'' Jones-Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is a popular misconception that the most
common type of rape is an attack by a stranger. In fact, they say,
the perpetrator is more likely to be someone known to the victim.
</P>
<P>
   The prevalence of spousal rape is difficult to track, experts
say. Domestic violence in general is among the most underreported
crimes, and spouses may not understand that non-consensual sex is a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   One 1992 study, by the National Victim Center in Virginia, found
that 10 percent of all sexual assault cases reported by women
involved a husband or ex-husband.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police report in the Thomas case, the victim
was awakened by Thomas on April 27 of last year and confronted
about an ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   After threatening her, then apologizing, Thomas asked to have
sex. But the victim refused. Then, according to the report, Thomas
said, ``If you're already going to report it (to police), you might
as well report it for rape, also.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas strongly disputed the allegations, saying that his
girlfriend attacked him and that they later had consensual sex. In
February, however, a jury convicted him of sexual assault, which
carries mandatory prison time ranging from 5.25 to 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' attorney at the time, Thomas Klobas, argued that the
Legislature didn't intend for offenders like Thomas to receive such
harsh punishment. Rather, lawmakers envisioned the ``classic
situation of a violent and unexpected confrontation between
strangers in which the victim was surprised, overpowered,
physically injured and abandoned.'' &QL; 
RULING NOTES RECORD &QL; 
Thomas was sentenced to 5.25 years. A month later, Jarrett's ruling
paved the way for him to appeal that sentence to the Board of
Executive Clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In her order, Jarrett said the offense involved non-consensual
sex, but noted that Thomas didn't physically harm his girlfriend,
has no prior felony convictions, is a father who once had sole
custody of four children, and was a longtime employee of a Phoenix
area company.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the court recognizes that the intent of the Legislature
is to treat sexual offenders harshly,'' Jarrett wrote, ``the
mandatory sentencing provisions seem unduly harsh in situations
involving domestic partners such as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Gonzalez, Thomas' current attorney, said that marital rape
law fits this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't it apply?'' he asked. ``These people were living
together as husband and wife, had been for several years, had
purchased a house together . . . had engaged in sexual relations
several times prior to this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   When Arizona's marital rape law was passed, some lawmakers
expressed concern that it could lead to abuses. One wondered
whether it would allow someone to gain leverage in divorce
proceedings. &QL; 
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY &QL; 
Garfield, a staunch supporter of sexual assault victims,
understands such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the uncertainty of whether it is rape or not rape,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like abuse. Is it being used by a spouse as a way of
winning over child custody? Is it something that is done out of
rage or hostility in a divorce?''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Tong, a nationally known family rights activist and author,
calls that the ``abuse excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She can use the abuse excuse as a weapon, as a means to get
the upper hand, if you will,'' he said. ``That ingredient should be
a major red flag for the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Maricopa County prosecutor Cindi Nannetti, chief of
the sex crimes unit, said cases of spousal rape are difficult to
prove, in part, because there are typically no witnesses and the
couple are living together. What's more, she said, it's hard for
jurors to understand that a spouse can be raped.
</P>
<P>
   Even victims themselves don't always understand it, Nannetti
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're surprised it's a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Spouses who rape can get six months to 1{ years in prison. A
judge also can reduce the charge to a misdemeanor, with probation
and counseling. The spouse must also register as a sex offender.
</P>
<P>
   If the spouse rapes a second time, the penalties include
mandatory prison time.
</P>
<P>
   The spousal rape law applies only if the couple are married and
living under the same roof. If they are in separate households, the
rape is considered more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a first offense for non-spousal rape carries
mandatory prison time ranging from 5.25 to 14 years. Offenders also
must register as sex offenders. &QL; 
OTHER ABUSE LIKELY &QL; 
Dr. Mary Koss, a public-health professor at the University of
Arizona and a nationally known expert on rape, said it's dangerous
to portray a rape such as Thomas' as a one-time aberration in a
basically stable relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Marital rape most likely occurs with other mistreatments such as
verbal abuse, psychological abuse and physical abuse, Koss said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' victim alleges that the rape capped several years of
physical and verbal abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Koss described spousal rapes as ``power crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to get the rights they (men) feel they
deserve but are not getting,'' she said. ``They never see what they
are doing as rape. It is within their legitimate rights.'' &QL;

DESERT CONTROL ISSUES ABOUND AT GOLDWATER RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BARRETT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pointing out the window of an Army helicopter, Terry Hansen
turns and shouts, ``See how pretty everything is?''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2.7 million acres of desert stretch below him. Under
cloudless skies, stiff-armed saguaros stand guard over clusters of
creosote bushes and cactus blooms. There are no cars, roads or
houses in sight, not even a fence.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter has just crossed into the Barry M. Goldwater Air
Force Range, the world's busiest military training range.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even tell where it begins!'' Hansen, assistant
airspace manager for the training range, shouts over the whir of
the Blackhawk's swirling blades.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of management responsibilities for the
range.
</P>
<P>
   A 1941 presidential decree set aside the 2.7 million acres of
Sonoran Desert in southern Arizona for military training. Since
then, it has been used to train thousands of pilots for war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of groups who will never be happy until we are
out of there,'' said Gary Blake, airspace manager for Luke Air
Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, government officials and Native Americans are
arguing over who should control what may be the largest undeveloped
area in Arizona. The training range stretches from Ajo to Yuma,
from Gila Bend to the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are issues as far flung as Tohono O'odham spirituality,
antelope habitat, the survival of the state's military bases and
billions of dollars in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a congressional committee cast a vote that could
shape the range's future. It voted to extend the military's lease
on the range for 25 more years. Without the extension, which still
must be approved by the full Congress, the property would revert to
public use in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen was among those who praised the vote Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy,'' he said. ``We're looking forward to
maintaining (the range) and being stewards of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, the Bureau of Land Management has managed the
range's cultural and natural resources, but it allows the military
to train over 6 percent of the land.
</P>
<P>
   The BLM shares overall management duties with various agencies,
including the Air Force, Marine Corps and National Guard,
Department of Fish and Wildlife and the U.S. Border Patrol. Critics
say the mix of managers has added layers of bureaucracy and taken
attention away from preserving the land and its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Department of Interior has acknowledged that a different
management structure would be more efficient. It supports the
proposal approved Thursday that would transfer primary control for
the range from the Interior Department to the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   That means, as early as next year, the Defense Department could
take over primary management for about 1.6 million acres,
everything but the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and an
additional 110,000 acres along the range border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to me; it's a sneak attack on public
lands,'' said Dean Bibles, Arizona BLM director from 1982 to 1989,
adding that the proposal was never publicly debated.
</P>
<P>
   Bibles prefers a proposal to turn management of the range over
to the National Park Service. It would designate those areas not
used by the military as the Sonoran Desert National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're realistic. The military has been there 60 years,'' said
Tucson teacher Bill Broyles, who is leading the national park
effort. ``What we're trying to do is figure out a better way to
manage the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen John McCain, R-Ariz., also had hoped to turn the range into
a park or refuge. He said Friday that he was disappointed that the
budget agreement did not include a study of alternative management
plans, which he intends to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is comfortable with the proposal because ``the
provisions in the bill appropriately balance the need for continued
military training with adequate protection of the natural and
cultural resources on the range.''
</P>
<P>
   Broyles said it doesn't make sense for the Defense Department to
manage the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land management is not the DOD's area of expertise. This is
like asking the Department of the Interior to fight a war,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bibles and Broyles also propose the merger of Organ Pipe Cactus
National Monument and the Cabreza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge
into a new Sonoran Desert National Park, with the Goldwater range
being incorporated into a national preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most pristine block of Sonoran Desert left. It is
absolutely beautiful. By taking care of it now, we can have one of
the premier parks in the world,'' Broyles said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tohono O'odham Nation, which borders the eastern portion of
the range, wants to control the range. It has historical, spiritual
and cultural importance to the tribe's 23,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Tribal Council passed a resolution asking
that the range be ``returned'' to the tribe when the military's
renewal of the land came up before Congress. Until then, leaders
said they would settle for the four border areas the military has
agreed to release, and an additional parcel that touches their
reservation, roughly 125,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said it's not up to them to decide what to do
with land that no longer serves a military purpose, Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force is not in the land business,'' he said, adding
that that responsibility falls to Interior Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's extension calls for study on whether to relinquish
land to the tribe. It also makes formal a range oversight committee
and requires that the committee include state, local and tribal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the O'odham's request for the land is granted, it could
take two years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders say, after so many years, that they are willing
to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, they (the government) will run out of reasons not
to give the land back to us,'' Chairman Edward Manual said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, tribal leaders have asked that the military
cease its training.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials argue that they cannot adequately protect the
country if they don't have a place to train their pilots, some of
whom were sent to combat in the Persian Gulf and Kosovo within a
few months of completing their training.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force, Marine Corps and National Guard units use the range
to teach pilots how to dogfight, shoot targets and drop bombs. It
is the second-largest military training ground in the country
behind Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada. But Goldwater gets the most
use. About 70,000 sorties are flown over the range each year from
bases throughout the Southwest, including five in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists want Congress to assess the damage to the
environment and the wildlife caused by a half-century of military
training.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater, environmentalists say, is the most biologically
diverse range in the world, with more than 525 kinds of plants and
animal species, 20 of them proposed or listed as threatened or
endangered.
</P>
<P>
   The extension included a requirement for an environmental review
of the range every five years.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Wildlife filed a lawsuit in June charging that the
agencies now managing the range have failed to protect the
endangered Sonoran pronghorn antelope. The 330,000-member,
non-profit group recommends Congress study the effects of low-level
Border Patrol planes and military training on the antelope before
renewing the lease.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent study says the military training has helped the
pronghorn antelope population by unintentionally stimulating growth
of a certain weed that antelope eat.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials say they know of no pronghorns killed by
artillery. As part of a settlement in a 1996 Defenders of Wildlife
lawsuit, they agreed to divert or cancel training if antelope were
spotted below.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. John Barry, Luke commander, said at least 125 sorties
were redirected or canceled last year because of antelope
sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Without the range, Barry and commanders of Davis-Monthan Air
Force Base in Tucson and the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma fear
their bases likely would close.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to find an identical training range would be
impossible,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent estimates, the bases pump $3.5 billion into
the state's economy. An Arizona State University West study found
that Luke's economic impact accounts for more than half the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Shipp, a member of the Yuma County Board of Supervisors and
a Yuma resident for more than 30 years, said Yuma's Marine Station
provides roughly a quarter of the city's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than just dollars,'' she added. ``They are a part of
us. It'd be like cutting off an arm or a leg to lose them.'' &QL;

NURSE PAIR PORN EXCUSE FOR PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because the subject matter is of a mature nature, we've tried to
approach it as adults, which is the opposite of what we should be
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, married nurses George and Tracy Miller were fired
from their jobs at Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn because they
operate an X-rated Web site proclaiming Tracy as `Dakota Rae . . .
a housewife . . . a nurse . . . a Web Goddess that enjoys sex live
on the Internet!''
</P>
<P>
   The couple say their dismissal was a violation of their First
Amendment right to free speech. They say their firing was
retaliatory and not related to their work.
</P>
<P>
   They say _ and newspapers, TV and radio seem to agree _ that we
should discuss the ``porno nurses'' controversy in a manner
befitting reasoned, intelligent men and women. And we have.
</P>
<P>
   And we're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Now is not the time to start acting like grown-ups. Now is the
time to be kids. ``Their'' kids. The Millers have two children, a
boy, 11, and a girl, 5.
</P>
<P>
   Quit being an adult for a minute. Think of yourself in the fifth
grade.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, there was only one thing worse than imagining
your parents having sex, and that was actually SEEING them have
sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's never seen it,'' George Miller told me Friday. ``Our
parental controls on our computer are as tight as they can be.'' &QL; 
WHAT ABOUT OTHER KIDS? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's not true at every household. With a few simple clicks, a
savvy kid can find, for free, images of ``Dakota Rae,'' known to
her children as ``Mom,'' doing things no kid should see. Copies can
be made. And shared.
</P>
<P>
   Could you have handled that as a kid? George was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``My parents were very conservative.
I have never seen my mom naked in my whole life.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that a bad thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' he answered. ``It's just how my parents
are.''
</P>
<P>
   How are you and Tracy as parents?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't drink. We don't smoke. We don't abuse. We've always
been there for our kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his son knows his mother poses nude, but doesn't
know about the sex acts shown on the site.
</P>
<P>
   As for that, he said, ``Anything that's been done (for the
camera) is strictly between me and her, or by herself. It could
always be worse than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe that, but since when is ``could be worse'' acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   The Millers say they're using the money they earn from cyberporn
to create a college fund for the children. &QL; 
IMAGINE THIS
</P>
<P>
   Again, imagine yourself as a youngster. If your parents had
presented you with two options:
</P>
<P>
   (1.) Having to take out a loan for college. Or
</P>
<P>
   (2.) Having thousands of people see Mom and Dad's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Which would you have picked?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're pretty liberal,'' George said. ``My son's grown
up with liberal views. He's mentioned to us that this is how a lot
of these starlets got their start. Posing for ``Playboy'' or
whatnot.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just posing, however. And this isn't some starlet.
</P>
<P>
   It's Mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few weeks, we've gotten about 60 letters from
people in the Valley who've wanted to do an adult Web site but
didn't know how to get started,'' George said. ``So, we're in the
process of sponsoring these people, helping them out and adding
content to our site.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millers believe some of their critics are hypocrites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of hypocrisy in people's lives,'' he said. ``I'm
sure there are plenty of people who are members of our site or have
viewed our site who would never admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   I've viewed their site.
</P>
<P>
   I admit it.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, having deliberated in a mature, reasoned way the
entire ``porno nurses'' controversy, I can tell you I don't believe
the Millers should have their First Amendment rights infringed
upon.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't believe they should lose their jobs as nurses.
</P>
<P>
   I just wish we could fire them as parents. &QL;

ARNOLD DROPS APPEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dodgers got 52/3 innings from Jamie Arnold in
their 7-6 win over the Mets on Saturday night, and then the
National League got its wish when the team announced Arnold would
drop his appeal of a five-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold will begin serving it today and be eligible again when
the Dodgers return home Friday to face Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to get it over with and just move past it,'' said
Arnold, who was suspended for his role in the July 11 fight with
Seattle. ``I can't pitch for another couple of days, so I guess it
makes sense. That's what they want to do, and that's fine with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it leaves the Dodgers in the market for a starter for
Thursday's game in Montreal, and they might summon Triple-A
Albuquerque's Mike Judd. He's 8-7 with a 6.67 ERA in 21 starts at
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some discussion of Mike Judd possibly joining us,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Park's performance: With the Dodgers offense scoring about as
much as it's rained in the drought-stricken Northeast, finding
silver linings on clouds has been trying. But pitching coach Claude
Osteen said righty Chan Ho Park's performance in Friday's 2-1 loss
is a tremendous sign.
</P>
<P>
   Park allowed two runs, both on sacrifice flies, in seven innings
and has allowed 12 runs in his past five starts. He's 1-2 in that
span.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was probably as good as he's been since I've been here, as
far as sticking to the game plan and making pitches when he had
to,'' Osteen said. ``I liked the way he pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Young starts rehab: Injured second baseman Eric Young begins a
rehab assignment today with Single-A San Bernardino and is expected
to rejoin the club when it returns from Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Young would return to the starting lineup. That
will give the Dodgers the opportunity to showcase Young, set to
make $9 million over the next two seasons, for an offseason trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems before was he never healed,'' Johnson
said. ``He'll help offensively. If his wheels are back, that's part
of his game. He felt a part of (his problem) was his wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is batting .263 with a .350 on-base percentage and was
benched before eventually landing on the disabled list. Since his
benching, Dodgers leadoff hitters are hitting .224 (13 for 58) with
three walks, four runs scored and a .262 on-base percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek is 12 for 41 (.293) in 10 games from the
leadoff spot, Craig Counsell is 1 for 8, Raul Mondesi 0 for 4 and
Trenidad Hubbard 0 for 1.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Dodgers' leadoff spot has been a sore point all
season. Their .335 on-base percentage is tied for 11th-worst in the
NL
</P>
<P>
   F.Y.I.: Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca said he'll probably undergo
surgery this offseason to have a cyst removed from his right
(throwing) hand. LoDuca has a hazelnut-sized lump on his hand. He
was going to have surgery during the season but decided to wait
until after because he didn't want to miss any more time. He
already missed six weeks when he broke his hand at Triple-A
Albuquerque.... Kevin Brown had his left, non-pitching wrist
wrapped in an ace bandage after the game. He's been bothered by
soreness for the past week, but it isn't expected to affect his
pitching.... Grudzielanek was a late scratch from the lineup with a
bruised right forearm, the result of being hit with a pitch by
Octavio Dotel in the series opener. X-rays were negative and his
status is day-to-day.... Carlos Perez is scheduled to pitch today
for Albuquerque against Edmonton.

BOBBY LABONTE NOT FRUSTRATED WITH SECOND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By John Sturbin 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Brickyard 400 runner-up Bobby Labonte conceded
that race winner Dale Jarrett had the field covered at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett joined Jeff Gordon as the only two-time winners of the
event. But Labonte continued to add to his resume at the famed
2.5-mile Speedway. Labonte has top-five finishes in three of the
six races at IMS, including two second-place results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not frustrated,'' said Labonte, who registered his 14th
top-five finish of the season in the No. 18 Interstate Batteries
Pontiac Grand Prix. ``We'll get one \Rat IMS\S. We came up a little
short to Dale Jarrett and beat the guys behind us. I can't complain
about that, but I'd have traded Pocono with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte has won three races this year, including both at Pocono
Raceway. He is third in Cup points, 293 behind Jarrett, but just 19
behind second-place Mark Martin. Dad helps Jarrett Two-time NASCAR
champion Ned Jarrett spent the afternoon working as a spotter for
his son, newly crowned two-time Brickyard 400 winner Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate when my dad can help,'' Dale Jarrett said.
``Because he's been a racer and that's an advantage to have someone
up there who's been in that position. He's awful good for the
majority of the time. As long as we can keep him from trying to
commentate, I'm in good shape. But when he starts trying to call
the race, we've got to turn him off for a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Ned Jarrett, a popular NASCAR commentator on ESPN and CBS
telecasts, had the day off because the race was televised by ABC.
Little rips Bodine A second Bodine brother became the object of a
heated cheap shot yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Little called Geoffrey Bodine ``a bald-headed cue ball''
after their cars made contact in Turn 2 on Lap 43. It was the day's
first caution, and Little charged Bodine with two counts of
unnecessary roughness and a ``brain-dead'' move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught it the first time and then lost it the second,'' said
Little, driver of the No. 97 John Deere Ford Taurus. Little
collected his thoughts, and added, ``I'm not saying anything
because I'm counting to 10. It was really stupid. I got bumped out
of \RTurn\S 1 and again into \RTurn\S 2. I thought I gave him
enough room, but I guess I didn't. There's got to be give-and-take.
In the end, I just got taken out by Bodine.''
</P>
<P>
   Little finished 43rd and last. Bodine, driver of the No. 60
Power Team Chevrolet Monte Carlo, continued and finished 25th.
</P>
<P>
   Little's comments echoed those uttered by Dale Earnhardt Jr.
after he was spun out by Todd Bodine during a NASCAR Busch Grand
National Series race at Pikes Peak International Raceway last
month. Stewart worn out Runaway Winston Cup rookie points-leader
Tony Stewart finished seventh, recording his 10th top-10 finish in
his past 10 starts. Stewart is fifth in the overall points chase,
but the native of Indiana couldn't wait to exit the Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to go home,'' said Stewart, the object of media
attention and sponsor activity this week. ``I'm tired of the hype
and bull and ready to go home and relax.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Stewart competed in both the Indy Racing League's Indy
500 and NASCAR's Coca-Cola 600 at Concord, N.C., on the same day.
He posted top-10 finishes in both events and completed a combined
single-day race record of 1,090 miles. But that experience almost
paled in comparison to the past three days here.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Columbus, Ind., Stewart maneuvered around Gasoline
Alley yesterday morning with an escort of five Indiana State
Policemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was neat to see the atmosphere,'' said Stewart, driver of
the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac. ``Everybody was so hyped and pumped
up about the event, it makes you proud to be a driver again.'' Last
laps Owner/driver Ricky Rudd's ninth-place finish was his first
top-10 of the season. Rudd won the Brickyard 400 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett earned $712,240 to climb over $2 million for the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's 117 laps-led set a race record. The previous mark was
97 by Jeff Gordon in 1998. Jarrett also led the last 43 laps, the
most consecutive laps-led in a Brickyard 400. The previous record
was 41 by Johnny Benson in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine cars running at the finish, an event record. The
previous record was 37 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's six leaders were the fewest in event history. The
previous low was seven in 1998.

SELE'S SHUTOUT GIVES STAFF A SHOT IN THE ARM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander Aaron Sele unveiled a
performance equivalent to Charlton Heston as Moses and delivered
the Rangers' pitching staff into The Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   The 123-day journey required the patience of another Old
Testament figure, but the Rangers' earned-run average emerged out
of the pitching wasteland with last night's 6-0 victory against the
Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' ERA slipped below the great barrier known as 5.00 _
well, if rounded five places to 4.99551 _ for the first time since
April 6 after Sele's complete-game shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it a job _ not a Job _ well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to remember a better-pitched game,'' Oates
said. ``He changed speeds. His location was good, and he kept the
curveball down. He really pitched well tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Sele (12-6) dispensed the Rangers' first complete-game shutout
since right-hander Rick Helling defeated the Minnesota Twins, 5-0,
on Sept. 7, 1998, and recorded a season-best 10 strikeouts without
issuing a walk during the 124-pitch appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a zone,'' said catcher Ivan Rodriguez, whose
three-run, sixth-inning homer off right-hander Roy Halladay gave
Sele a six-run advantage to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also worked well with his pitcher by demanding that
the Blue Jays receive a steady diet of fastballs in and curveballs
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to tip your hat to Pudge,'' Sele said. ``He was
mixing up pitches and moving around back there. I didn't have to
come over the plate too often. We didn't give in to anyone. He did
an outstanding job. Plus, he had that big home run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who managed only six hits, threatened only twice.
First baseman Willie Otanez led off the second inning with a
double, but Sele stranded the runner 90 feet from the plate by
inducing an inning-ending ground ball from catcher Darrin Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays loaded the bases with two outs during the seventh
inning, but their bid for a run ended when right fielder Juan
Gonzalez tracked down a fly ball off the bat of Shannon Stewart on
the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   That preserved the Rangers' first complete-game shutout in 128
games and the 18th this season in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielder Roberto Kelly _ who replaced injured left
fielder Rusty Greer in the lineup _ third baseman Todd Zeile and
center fielder Tom Goodwin contributed to Sele's masterpiece with
their defensive work.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez decided the outcome with his home run on a 2-0
fastball from Halladay, but right-hander Pat Hentgen (8-7) took the
loss after surrendering three runs on eight hits and two walks
during his 2 2/3-inning appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got behind in the count and threw a fastball over the
plate, but I don't want to talk about home runs,'' said Rodriguez,
who established a single-season best with his 22nd home run. ``I
want to talk about wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, start with the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   The once-beleaguered collection improved to 23-8 with a 4.23 ERA
during the past 45 games. That explains the Rangers' 30-15 record
since June 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we pitch decently, we have a chance to win a lot of
ballgames,'' Oates said. ``I think every manager in the American
League would say that, but I think it's especially true for us
because of our offense from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know offense can win you a few ballgames, but good pitching
and defense give you a chance to win every night. It sets the
tone.''

CHURCH WANTS TO BRING LIGHT TO AREA WITH DARK LEGACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TONY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Standing by his church's wooden cross, the Rev.
David Miller pointed to nearby Spahn Ranch where Charlie Manson
ordered his ``family'' to commit the infamous murders that occurred
on Aug. 9, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   When Church of Rocky Peak was built in 1988, Miller and his
congregation tried not to think about the dark legacy of Spahn
Ranch in the Chatsworth area, northwest of downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But they soon felt its spell.
</P>
<P>
   They learned the chaparral-covered hills in the Santa Susana
Mountain Pass were used by devil worshipers and often littered with
sacrificed animals and pentagrams.
</P>
<P>
   They learned the ranch is in an area known locally as Devil's
Canyon and was once a home to a suicidal cult and bandits.
</P>
<P>
   But now, thirty years since Manson and his cult left their
bloody mark in history, The Church of Rocky Peak is negotiating to
buy Spahn Ranch, to bring light to a place with a dark past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to obtain this piece of property _ Lord willing _
for a Christian day-care center and a small elementary school,'' he
said. ``Our desire is to put a light where there was a lot of
darkness and death _ a place many would say was even Satanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The family of Manson's victims was pleased by the church's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds good to me,'' said Cory LaBianca, the 51-year-old
daughter of Leno LaBianca and stepdaughter of Rosemary LaBianca.
``I'm glad the property is going to be used in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson case prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi said the church's plans
perpetuate the battle between good and evil that Manson foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly a tremendous irony with respect to the
religious aspects,'' said Bugliosi, author of ``Helter Skelter,''
the book that maintains Manson masterminded the seven murders to
ignite a race war in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Manson family thought Manson was the Second Coming of
Christ and the devil all wrapped into one. There was a connection
between the Beatle's `Helter Skelter' song and the Bible's
Revelations, Chapter 9. It's about the final destruction of men on
earth _ Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   The portion of Spahn Ranch the church is interested in is a
10-acre site owned by Bettina Thompson, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Manson Family moved to the San Fernando Valley in the late
1960s, living in a house in suburban Canoga Park and then moving to
Spahn Ranch, where Manson's girls used their wiles to charm the
nearly blind ranch owner, 80-year-old George Spahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a raggle-taggle bunch of kids,'' said Chatsworth
Historical Society historian Virginia Watson. ``I went up there to
rent a horse and buggy for the Chatsworth Parade. I was appalled.
They dressed funny. The girls used to flatter Mr. Spahn.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Aug. 9, 1969, Manson's followers crept into a
Benedict Canyon home in Beverly Hills and butchered beautiful,
pregnant actress Sharon Tate, the 26-year-old wife of movie
director Roman Polanski, director of ``Rosemary's Baby,'' a film in
which a young woman gives birth to the devil's child.
</P>
<P>
   The other victims included Hollywood's premier hair stylist, Jay
Sebring; coffee fortune heiress Abigail Folger; jet-setting Polish
film director Voytek Frykowski; and Steven Parent, shot leaving the
caretaker's home.
</P>
<P>
   The murder scene was one of ghoulish horror, with Tate's blood
used to smear the word ``Pig'' on the front door.
</P>
<P>
   The next night, Manson's followers killed Leno and Rosemary
LaBianca at their Los Feliz home, smearing in blood the words
``Death to Pigs'' and the misspelled ``Healter Skelter'' on the
walls and doors.
</P>
<P>
   The savage slayings terrorized Los Angeles for months as
investigators fumbled evidence and missed important clues. People
locked their doors, bolted windows and bought guns until the
suspects were caught three months later.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since the murders, the number of tourists looking
for directions to Spahn Ranch has not abated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still get people who come in and ask about Manson and Spahn
Ranch,'' said historian Watson.
</P>
<P>
   After Spahn's home burned in a 1970 ``Dante's Inferno''-type
wildfire, it was never rebuilt. The German company that bought the
land from Spahn never developed it into the dude ranch for German
tourists they had planned, Bugliosi said. A portion of the property
was sold to the state, and the remainder was bought by a private
family who operate a dog kennel, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Susana Mountain Pass is known for its colorful
history.
</P>
<P>
   Archeological discoveries have revealed ancient Indian burial
grounds, and infamous bandit Tiburcio Vasquez used it as a hide-out
in the 1870s. Other bandits used the rocky crevices to rob passing
stagecoaches.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of movies and television shows were filmed around the
Spahn Ranch, Stony Point and Iverson Ranch areas, including ``Ben
Hur,'' ``The Lone Ranger,'' ``Stagecoach,'' Roy Rogers' shows and
numerous Westerns.
</P>
<P>
   The area was also the home to another cult _ the Fountain of the
World. In 1958, two members of the cult used dynamite to blow
themselves and their fellow cultists to kingdom come, Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   A little further up the mountain sits Rocketdyne's Santa Susana
Field Laboratory, a place where nuclear reactors and rocket fuel
were tested for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since Manson and his followers left Spahn Ranch, a
dark cloud has seemed to hover over the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, Frank Letz, who lived nearby, died when he was
crossing a bridge to his home and it collapsed in a flash flood.
</P>
<P>
   But the dark myths don't bother Miller, who says the church
wants to purchase both the Letz and former Spahn Ranch properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Voltaire who made the statement that within 100 years,
no one would take the Bible seriously,'' Miller said. ``A hundred
years later, the Bible Society purchased his home, and it became a
Bible publishing center.''
</P>
<P>
   After a 10{-month trial that held the world spellbound, Manson,
Patricia Krenwinkel, Susan ``Sexy Sadie'' Atkins and homecoming
princess Leslie Van Houten were convicted and sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   High school football star Charles ``Tex'' Watson, who was tried
separately, also received a death sentence. But a U.S. Supreme
Court ruling that found California's death penalty statute
unconstutional in 1972 led to commuting their sentences to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Since the imprisonment, Watson and Atkins have become born-again
Christians. All of them have renounced Manson.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Fitzgerald, who represents Krenwinkle at her parole
hearings and was the Manson case's chief defense attorney, said the
``girls were soldiers in his infantry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the remarkable thing about it is, 30 years later, how did
he get young, white middle-class girls who had good educations and
came from decent homes to kill?
</P>
<P>
   ``They were lovely, bright, sensitive and thoughtful people. You
can see that today. When I saw the girls recently, they looked like
55-year-old nuns. They don't dye their hair or wear make-up. It's
hard to believe these are the same 18- and 19-year-old girls I sat
next to for a year-and-a-half.''

MURDERER IS HERO TO SATANISTS, OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TONY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three decades after Charles Manson ordered a
string of savage murders, the ghosts will not rest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the cult of Manson haunts the Internet and a new generation
is strangely mesmerized by the most bizarre slayings in the annals
of American crime.
</P>
<P>
   Manson, who gets four fan letters a day at California's Corcoran
State Prison, has become an ``icon of evil'' and a ``revolutionary
hero'' to hate groups, neo-Nazis and Satanists, Manson prosecutors
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manson has become the world's most famous criminal,'' said Los
Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Stephen Kay, who has
attended 53 parole hearings in the case. ``All we have to do is
look at what happened in Germany in World War II to see that Manson
is one of the worst extremists. The fact that he's been adopted by
a lot of these extremists on the World Wide Web is sad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a connection between these groups and Manson,'' said
Manson prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, author of the book ``Helter
Skelter.'' ``Manson has more followers now than he ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manson has become a metaphor for evil,'' Bugliosi said.
``Manson has become iconic to these hate groups. These Satanists
and neo-Nazis on the jagged edge of society look up to Manson. They
view him as a revolutionary hero.''
</P>
<P>
   About 40 rock bands in Europe and the United States play
Manson's music, including Guns n' Roses and The Beach Boys, who
recorded one of his songs in the late 1960s, Bugliosi said.
</P>
<P>
   The industrial hard rock group Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn
Manson recorded Manson songs at the former Tate residence, which
was located in the 10000 block of Cielo Drive in 1969, Bugliosi
wrote in his book.
</P>
<P>
   The residence was leveled several years ago, and a new home was
constructed. But the owners changed the address.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nelson, a Manson Family historian who lives in Costa Mesa,
said there is a cottage industry that sells Manson music, books and
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   White supremacist groups now live at Barker Ranch in Death
Valley, the location where Manson and his followers planned to wait
out the race war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a Nazi flag placed upon the sofa,'' Nelson said about
his recent visit to the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is also looking into a fire in July that burned the
nearby Meyer's Ranch, another of Manson's former hide-outs.
</P>
<P>
   If another charismatic guru came along with the desire to kill
and the ability to control others, Bugliosi said the horror could
be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids are still out there,'' he said.

CANDIDATES CRUISE ARIZONA'S ELITE ZIP CODES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the posh Paradise Valley habitats of Valley sports
celebrities to opulent digs near the Arizona Biltmore, presidential
candidates hunting for contributions are finding their quarry in a
few elite neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $1.7 million raised by Republican and Democratic
candidates in Arizona so far this year, 37 percent came from donors
living in only 10 ZIP codes, many of them in Scottsdale, Paradise
Valley and north Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   These figures emerged from a computer-based survey of campaign
contributions from Jan. 1 through June 30. &UR; Among other highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Many campaign donors appear to be hedging their bets, spreading
money around to two or more candidates. The ultimate switch-hitters
turned out to be Arizona Diamondbacks and Phoenix Suns owner Jerry
Colangelo, his wife, Joan, and their son Bryan. The family members
pumped $2,000 into the campaign of Republican George W. Bush,
shuttled $3,000 to Democrat Bill Bradley and $1,000 to Arizona Sen.
John McCain, a Republican. Colangelo also hosted a fund-raiser for
Bradley that netted close to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Despite badly lagging behind his competitors in the race for the
White House, McCain leads them in campaign fund raising in his home
state, having scooped up $832,332 in the first six months of the
year. Bush, the GOP front-runner, pulled in less than half that in
Arizona: $357,750. The state's other resident presidential
candidate, former Vice President Dan Quayle, raised $135,357.
Former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole brought in $110,150,
followed by anti-abortion activist Gary Bauer, who netted $33,199.
</P>
<P>
   The money sweepstakes yielded topsy-turvy results for Democrats,
too. The Democrats' dark-horse candidate, former New Jersey Sen.
Bradley, outdid the front-runner, Vice President Al Gore, by roping
in $125,850 to Gore's $73,705.
</P>
<P>
   The most generous cities overall for fund raising were Phoenix
with $425,933; Scottsdale with $234,255; and Paradise Valley with
$212,470. Tucson was next with $193,374. Glendale gave $34,962.
Each of the 185 ZIP codes statewide yielded at least one
contribution of $200 or more.
</P>
<P>
   The survey did not cover Republican presidential candidates Alan
Keyes, Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes because they did not file
their contributions electronically with the Federal Election
Commission. However, the Forbes campaign reported to ``The
Republic'' having raised $62,111, and Keyes reported raising $7,486
in Arizona in contributions of $200 and above.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign-finance experts said the numbers show how frenzied fund
raising has become, as candidates extend their money-gathering
operations to once-overlooked states such as Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like this is a heck of a lot of money this early, any
way you cut it,'' said Rob Melnick, director of the Morrison
Institute for Public Policy at Arizona State University. ``It just
blows my mind, and I think it's very worrisome when you start
raising this much money this early.''
</P>
<P>
   Fat wallets are carrying the most weight in the Arizona money
push. The average contributions for Bush, Dole and Bradley were all
over $800, according to the computer-based survey of campaign
donations of $200 and above in Arizona. Campaign contributions to
those three candidates far exceeded their average contributions
nationwide, suggesting the candidates are doing more high-dollar
events here and less grass-roots fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   And most of the wallets are opening up in the wealthiest suburbs
of Phoenix and Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   The ZIP code most likely to give to a presidential candidate,
85253, is in Paradise Valley and Scottsdale, which takes in the
homes of multimillionaire sports stars and and business moguls such
as hotelier Leona Helmsley. It coughed up $228,370.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line was a Phoenix ZIP, 85016, that takes in the Arizona
Biltmore and the ritzy Esplanade development built by former Gov.
Fife Symington, which shelled out $82,343.
</P>
<P>
   A northeast Phoenix area, 85018, gave $64,115; a north Tucson
ZIP, 85718, which takes in high-dollar homes in the Santa Catalina
foothills, contributed $57,025; and one in north Scottsdale, 85255,
delivered $47,250.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raisers and party officials said the results reflect the
tendency of candidates to go where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is tried and true, said Stacey Pawlowski, a
fund-raiser for presidential hopeful Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Most candidates approach someone who lives in a ritzy area and
get him or her to sponsor a fund-raiser. The host invites his or
her friends; and soon, the till is filled with checks from Paradise
Valley or the foothills of Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come in and you go into the Biltmore, and you have an
event at the Biltmore so the Biltmore guys involve all of their
neighbors and the Phoenix business community,'' Pawlowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution totals indicate that candidates are reaping the
benefits of huge fund-raisers and high-dollar donations, according
to campaign-finance experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the average contribution is what it is and the maximum is
$1,000, you must be getting an awful lot of $1,000 contributions,''
said Ruth Jones, an Arizona State University political science
professor. ``An awful lot of your candidates are going to pretty
monied people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Texas Gov. Bush benefited from a $1,000-a-plate
fund-raiser last spring hosted by his father, former President
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush also raked in funds from a fund-raiser hosted
by Tucson car dealer Jim Click. Both Click and former Valley
National Bank President Jim Simmons have pledged to raise $100,000
for Bush in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The survey shows that many donors are spreading their money
around, contributing to more than one candidate. More than 50
donors, many of whom gave the maximum $1,000 contribution to
Republican candidates Bush or McCain, also ``hedged their bets'' by
contributing to another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 20 donors gave to both Bush and McCain, 14 donated to
both McCain and Quayle and three donors each gave to Bradley and
McCain, Bush and Dole, Dole and McCain, and Quayle and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix resident Joyce Haver was one Valley resident who pumped
donations into the campaigns of more than one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Loyal to McCain but attracted also to the policies and history
of the Bush family, she gave $1,000 to Bush and $250 to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Haver said she would be pleased to see McCain included in the
Bush administration should Bush win, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave to both because I have a great deal of respect for both
those candidates,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the contributions yielded a total for both parties of
more than $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the candidates show no sign of slowing up their fund-raising
activity. In September, McCain, Forbes and Bush all have events
planned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pawlowski said Forbes and a few other candidates are
beginning to stray from a rich ZIP-code strategy, preferring to
raise donations from across the state through direct-mail
solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   Such ``grass-roots'' contacts help to build up a wide, loyal
base of followers who will later vote in the primary. When he
visits the state in September, Forbes will host a large
fund-raising event in Phoenix, but is also prospecting by mail in
far-flung locations such as Kingman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates are trying to get out there because they understand
that grass-roots support is necessary to win Arizona now,''
Pawlowski said. ``You can't just come in here and raise $200,000
and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials said the concentration of donors in
rich suburbs does not signal a party that is out of touch with the
average voter.
</P>
<P>
   Although it appears that only a few Republicans are taking part
in fund raising, thousands of others connect with candidates
through letters and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reach out to all people,'' Arizona Republican Party
Chairman Mike Minnaugh said. ``You don't have to have money to be
active in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Some contributors said they directed their dollars to candidates
who best fit their political ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Richard LaManna, a Phoenix-based business consultant, said he
shelled out $1,000 to Dole because she defies the stereotype of a
career politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think politicians are liars,'' LaManna said. ``They all have
a motive, and the motive is they want to be popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole represents a departure from the business-as-usual
candidate, according to LaManna. &QL;

DODGERS WAKE UP IN NINTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all the bashing and beating the Dodgers have
taken, they will be involved in the playoff race after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers did a huge favor to Atlanta and Cincinnati by
staging an improbable three-run rally to defeat the first-place
Mets 7-6 before a sellout crowd Saturday night at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they score three times in the ninth, they turned a
double play against former Dodger Mike Piazza to escape a
first-and-third, none-out situation to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   It will take more efforts like these to keep the Dodgers from
losing 100 games for the first time in 91 years, and just the third
overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad we're playing tough teams that are in it, so you
have to push yourself,'' said Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield,
whose leadoff homer tied the score at 5-5 in the ninth. ``When you
can keep playing teams that are in the race, you can play with the
intensity of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Dodgers losses reached triple digits was 1908,
when they were 53-101. That's also the last time the Chicago Cubs
won the World Series. The Dodgers lost a franchise-worst 104 games
in 1905.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (48-62) would have to go 14-38 to reach an even 100
losses. It seems unlikely the club couldn't post a .269 winning
percent in their remaining 52 games, but these are, after all, the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same club that, even with Saturday's win, is
involved in a streak in which it has won 5 of its last 18, a .278
winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't as though the Dodgers haven't gone through extended
lapses. From May 31 through July 7, the Dodgers went 9-24 (.273).
</P>
<P>
   ``We came up big in the end, and that's something we're going to
have to do the last couple of months,'' said Dodgers catcher Paul
LoDuca, who hit his first major-league homer in the eighth to pull
the Dodgers to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff race might be just enough to jumpstart the Dodgers.
They have six more games left with the Mets, three more with
Atlanta, seven with San Francisco and three with Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Without question those games will create more excitement and be
played with more intensity than games against Milwaukee, Montreal,
Florida and other slackers in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And if there's any question what kind of atmosphere a playoff
race can create, just think back a few years to when the Dodgers
were respectable. Or look at how it impacted the game with the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield homered off Billy Taylor to tie the score, and his
former Florida Marlins teammate Craig Counsell eventually drove in
two with a double off the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a while since we came back and won one, but that was
fun,'' Counsell said. ``We showed some fight. That's what you want
to do. We need to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also showed moxie in the bottom of the inning when
John Olerud singled in Roger Cedeno to make it 7-6 and put runners
on with none out. But with the infield playing in, Piazza, who has
come under criticism in New York for not producing in the clutch,
hit a weak grounder to Jose Vizcaino at short. Vizcaino looked
Edgardo Alfonso back to third and then flipped to Counsell to begin
the double play.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Benny Agbayani grounded to Counsell at second to
end the game and give reliever Jeff Shaw his 23rd save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was jacked,'' Shaw said. ``I felt like we were in the
playoffs. The place was going crazy.''

BOGGS HITS THE NUMBER: 3,000 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Wade Boggs took his place alongside the
gods of baseball Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, doing something no one thought
possible, something that had never been done before.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs, who played his first 11 seasons and got his first 2,098
hits for the Red Sox, became the 23d player in major league history
to crack the 3,000-hit barrier and the first to do it with a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   That's right _ a home run. Boggs hitting a homer for No. 3,000
is a little like Larry Bird winning the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, but
we can always leave it to Wade to put an unthinkable wrinkle on any
major achievement. Say what you want; the man is never boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I waited 18 years for,'' said a teary-eyed Boggs
after the game. ``I finally put my flag in that mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Boggs's sixth-inning blast off Cleveland lefty Chris Haney was
his third hit of the night and served as the crowning blow in a
long weekend of major league history.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis's Herculean Mark McGwire moved into the pantheon of
sluggers when he became the 16th member of the 500 Home Run Club
Thursday night. Friday it was Padre Tony Gwynn going 4 for 5 in
Montreal to become the 21st big leaguer with 3,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   It was left to Boggs to write the weekend's final chapter and he
did it with the flair we remember so well in his Red Sox days. Wade
grounded to second in the first inning and it appeared he might be
stuck on 2,997 well into next week, but before you could say ``Wee
Willie Keeler'', he cranked a couple of prototype Boggs singles and
came to the plate in the sixth with a chance to join Gwynn, Pete
Rose, Ty Cobb, and the rest of the 3,000 Hit Club.
</P>
<P>
   Wade's wife, Debbie, and dad, Win, sat calmly in section 106
(row AA, on the aisle) when he dug into the batter's box for the
fourth time of the night. His son, Brett, wearing Dad's No. 12 and
serving as the Devil Rays' batboy, sat on a stool next to the
on-deck circle.
</P>
<P>
   With one on and one out, Boggs worked the count to 2 and 2, then
smacked Haney's curveball 372 feet to right, far over the Tropicana
Field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Pandemonium. Boggs embraced first coach Billy Hatcher. Fireworks
exploded over his head as he trotted to second. Boggs blew a kiss
toward the Dome ceiling, a heavenly gesture to his mother who was
killed in a car crash in 1986. As he rounded third, a fan burst on
the field and attempted to intercept Boggs at home. Heads-up
security men blasted the nitwit fan out of his shoes in front of
the plate, and Wade hesitated while the tackle was made, then went
to his knees and kissed the dish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ball left the bat, I thought `My God, it's a home
run. I'll never get that ball back,' '' recounted Boggs. ``When I
got to the plate something went through my mind and I thought,
`I'll kiss home plate.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wade first embraced his son, then was engulfed by teammates.
Meanwhile, Debbie and Win were led onto the field and waited until
Boggs turned and saw them. He hugged his dad first, then his wife,
then his dad again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my dad, `We did it.' And it was `we.' My dad made me
the hitter I am. He was always there for me. He yelled at me when I
didn't do good. Thanks, dad. I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Specially marked baseballs were used for all of Boggs's at-bats
this weekend and 32-year-old Mike Hogan caught Boggs's homer. Hogan
is an assistant Sports Information Director at the University of
South Florida where Boggs's daughter, Meagan, is a student. Hogan
graciously exchanged the baseball for a Wade Boggs jersey and Boggs
tossed the ball to his dad during the postgame press conference.
</P>
<P>
   There was another sweet moment after the game, champagne
celebration. Meagan Boggs missed Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's event to be in a
friend's wedding, but made a frantic ride back to St. Pete in time
to hug her dad after the game. In a beautiful floor-length gown,
she ran to her dad and kissed him in the middle of the press
conference, then took a seat with her proud mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best part of this,'' said a beaming Boggs. ``Having
my family here to share it with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the evening, there was creeping doubt that the Boggs
Watch might grow old and tired before the end of the weekend. He
grounded to second his first time up which made him 0 for 5 since
hit No. 2,997 in Seattle Wednesday night. Cynics started worrying
about Boggs's bid turning into something like the Yaz Watch of
1979. Captain Carl, you might remember, locked in at 2,999 and then
went 0 for 10 against the Orioles and Yankees before Willie
Randolph waved at a grounder in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   The Boggs Watch did not remain stalled for long. Facing Charles
Nagy with the bases loaded in the third, Boggs turned on a 1-0
pitch and cracked a clean single to right for No. 2,998. Two
innings later he faced Nagy again with a runner aboard, and again
hit a single to right (this grounder looked remarkably similar to
the ball Yaz hit for 3,000). That put him at the magical 2,999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the longest mile to walk to home plate with 2,999
hits,'' said Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs was 4 for 11 lifetime against Haney. The homer was his
second of the season, the 118th of his career. It marked the 221st
three-hit game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can eat steak,'' he said, smiling. ``The poultry
industry just went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Forever Wade. Never boring. He goes into Sunday's game with
3,000 hits, tied with Roberto Clemente for 22d on the all-time hit
parade.

ANGELS CAN'T LAY A GLOVE ON RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANGELS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mo Vaughn's staph infection kept him home
again against his former team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   His Angels teammates, however, were forced to show up for work,
despite another onset of the affliction that has plagued them for
much of this misbegotten summer: dreadful baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, capitalizing on two errors in the first three
innings by Billerica's Gary DiSarcina, the shortstop who has
suffered as much as any Angel this season, scored seven runs in the
first three innings and cruised to a 14-3 win before a crowd of
36,577 at Edison International Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had 19 hits, including the day's longest ball, a
430-foot home run onto the putting green beyond the center-field
fence in the ninth inning by rookie Brian Daubach, his 15th home
run of the season and second in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach, who also singled, doubled, and scored three times, was
one of three Sox players to have three hits as they beat the Angels
for the second straight time after being shut out 8-0 in the opener
Thursday. Jose Offerman and Nomar Garciaparra were the others, as
every starter had at least one hit. Butch Huskey came off the bench
with the bases loaded in the Sox four-run eighth and delivered a
bases-clearing double.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored early and stayed on top of them,'' said Daubach,
whose broken-bat single on an 0-and-2 pitch began the Sox four-run
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp, who has had just one bad inning in his last three
starts, allowed one run on six hits in seven innings against the
demoralized Angels, whose halos never looked more askew than in the
third inning, when the final two Sox runs scored on what should
have been an inning-ending ground ball to short.
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded and the Sox already were ahead, 5-0, when
Offerman hit a chopper to DiSarcina, who already had booted ground
balls in each of the first two innings for his first two-error game
in more than two years. DiSarcina fielded this one cleanly, but his
throw was low and to the right of the first-base bag and Offerman
beat the throw.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jefferson, who was on third, scored on the play, as did
Jason Varitek, who appeared to be an easy out when first baseman
Darin Erstad fired a strike to the plate. But as Varitek slowed in
apparent concession, rookie catcher Ben Molina didn't notice him,
even though Varitek was so close he could have kicked the Angels'
catcher in the shinguards.
</P>
<P>
   Molina started to throw toward second when he spied Varitek,
held up his throw, but dropped the ball as Varitek jogged across
the plate. Offerman, meanwhile, was credited with an infield hit
and two RBIs on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson reached safely to open the second when DiSarcina, who
had botched Garciaparra's two-out grounder in the first, muffed his
grounder, then fell down before he could make a throw. Donnie
Sadler, making his first big-league start in center field, followed
with a broken-bat single one out later, and Trot Nixon hit a
ground-rule double into the left-field corner to make it 2-0.
Offerman's infield out brought home Sadler to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's broken-bat single opened the third. Garciaparra, who
had gone 0 for 7 in the first two games here, doubled and Daubach
scored on Troy O'Leary's sacrifice fly. Jefferson then singled
through a drawn-in infield for another run, and when Varitek
followed with another base hit, Angels manager Terry Collins went
to his bullpen, bringing in Mike Fyhrie.
</P>
<P>
   Fyhrie retired Sadler on a fly ball, but walked Nixon before
Offerman's ground ball to DiSarcina set in motion the kind of play
that has made the Angels an object of pity this season, not to
mention the last-place team in the AL West. The Angels are 4-17 in
their last 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pitched good again, hit the ball hard, got a couple of
head-knockers and took advantage of them, moved the runners over
and had some productive outs,'' said Jimy Williams, whose team
pulled even with Toronto in the wild-card race after the Rangers
shut out the Blue Jays, 6-0, Saturday &UR;  &LR; night at Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   John Wasdin, in his first appearance off the disabled list, gave
up a two-run home run to Tim Salmon in the eighth, but the Sox
ended the game in spectacular fashion. Varitek snatched a foul
popup near the screen while practically lying on his back, and
Garciaparra barehanded a ball that had caromed off Wasdin and threw
out Molina.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, meanwhile, were left to wonder what it will take to
end their misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting some of our personnel back,'' losing pitcher Tim
Belcher said, ``but you wonder if you brought in Henry Aaron and
Lefty Grove if it would make a difference.''

IT'S SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR CARTER, WHIGHAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ It was 48 hours before training camp was set
to open last month when Larry Whigham's phone rang. On the other
end was his boss, Patriots coach Pete Carroll. Whigham was not
exactly thrilled to hear his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew somebody had to leave,'' the veteran safety recalled
with a smile. ``I knew we had to make a salary cap adjustment.
Being a veteran of the game, you understand that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm packing my bags to get ready to go to camp and Coach
calls and says, `Hey, what's going on?' and I'm, like, `What is
going on?' ''
</P>
<P>
   What was going on was that seven-year veteran Willie Clay was
moving on, a victim of New England's cap problems and an ongoing
battle of wills and personalities with Carroll. But as with every
such action in life, opportunity was knocking for someone else at
the same time the door was closing on Clay's time in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that opportunity will come to Whigham or third-year
player Chris Carter has yet to be determined, but one way or
another somebody will play in Clay's place in September and Whigham
understands what the pecking order is when the competition begins
in earnest during Friday's first exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's Chris's job to lose, but you come into this league
as a defensive back and that's where you want to play,'' Whigham
said. ``I became a special teams player because I wanted to find a
way to keep a job. I found it and became a Pro Bowl player, but we
all want to start the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real shock to me to hear Willie was gone. He was a
very big part of this team on and off the field. He passed a lot of
things on to me and the other players and now it's time for us to
use that knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris and I have been side-by-side as backups for a couple of
years now and become good friends but Carroll asked me to move from
strong safety to free safety to challenge Chris for the job. It's
no problem. We hang out a lot. We work out together. But I know
what my opportunity is. It comes if Chris can't play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Carter can or can't remains a mystery at this stage
because the former third-round draft pick out of Texas has started
exactly zero games in his two seasons in New England, while Whigham
has started one in his five years. Clay, by comparison, started his
last 88 NFL games (including playoffs), having not missed a start
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Clay is coming off a season in which some would have you believe
he had begun to show signs of slippage, but the fact is he made a
career-high 103 tackles and three times had 10 tackles in a game.
To put that into perspective, Clay made more tackles in 1998 than
Whigham and Carter have combined for in their NFL careers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his limited chances, however, Carter appears confident
that he can handle both the workload and the mental requirements of
the safety man's position. The latter will be critical because Clay
was considered New England's most knowledgeable defensive player on
the field as far as understanding how offenses were trying to
attack and what coordinator Steve Sidwell was trying to do to
counter them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when talk springs up about the difficulty of replacing the
mental side of Clay's game, you have to pardon Carter if he laughs
just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   A kinesiology major who graduated from the University of Texas
during the 1998 offseason, Carter is considering attending medical
school after football, a fact that puts understanding defensive
schemes and offensive scheming into some sort of perspective for
him if not for his critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can handle the mental side of the job, but medical
school and football are two different things,'' Carter conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of professional athletes may not have been good in the
classroom but they're geniuses on the field. What I do on the field
is different from what I do in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from playing more I can see I'm thinking less and reacting
more. All players do a lot better when they see things and just
react to the play rather than thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting a lot more reps now, my reaction time has been cut
down.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The real question, however, is how Carter will react to the
likes of the Jets' Keyshawn Johnson running a seam route on him
with the game on the line. Will he be smart enough then to be where
he must be or will his inexperience cause hesitancy and the kind of
disaster that can lead to second guessing about the decision to
fire Clay two days before training camp?
</P>
<P>
   Like all the questions about him, that will remain an open one
for a while, but Carter remains self-contained and self-confident
about the job he has inherited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely confident in myself,'' Carter said. ``You have
to be. Every time you come to training camp, each and every player
has to feel they have a chance to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go into camp thinking you'll be on the bench, you don't
need to even be here. If you don't strive to be No. 1 in life, you
won't do anything. I always felt I could push Willie for the
starting job because this is about competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox manager Jimy Williams would be the first to tell you
that. Nobody in New England sports likes to talk as much about his
players ``competin' '' as Williams, so he'd love Carter's attitude.
</P>
<P>
   And Carter's confidence is not without history to support it.
When he arrived at Texas in 1993, he became an immediate starter at
free safety, and he ended up starting 43 of Texas's 47 games from
1993-96. During that stretch he broke the school record for
interception-return yardage by bringing back 14 picks for 348
yards, a 24.9-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Many a college star has been unable to duplicate his numbers in
the NFL, of course, but if Carter can even come close, he will have
put up the kind of numbers that, frankly, Clay put up before him.
</P>
<P>
   Clay averaged 95 tackles and four interceptions during his three
years as a Patriot starter, and in seven years in the NFL, he
recorded 24 interceptions (13 with New England), made 472 tackles,
and led the NFL in interception-return yardage in 1995 when he made
eight picks and brought them back for 173 yards (21.6 yards per
return).
</P>
<P>
   But most important when it comes to the matter of replacing Clay
is a statistic that cannot be ignored. Clay's teams won games with
him in the lineup, reaching the playoffs each of the last six
seasons when he was directing traffic in their secondaries.
</P>
<P>
   That simple fact is a point not lost on Sidwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Willie made a lot of contributions to the team,'' Sidwell
said. ``He's a smart player with great instincts and the kind of
hands you need to be an interceptor. There's always a
comfortability factor when you play with a guy like that, who is
smart and becomes your friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no question about it. We have to play with Larry
and Chris Carter now. They're both smart guys and they've had
enough exposure to football now that they should be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Whigham, the opportunity is a double-edged sword. As he
strives to replace Clay and beat out Carter, will he sacrifice his
edge on special teams, where several years ago he was considered
the best cover man in the AFC?
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said last week that regardless of whether Whigham beats
out Carter, he will retain his role on coverage and return teams,
and Whigham went to new special teams coach Brad Seely and said he
would do anything he is asked to do, including returning kicks if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet having said that, even Whigham seemed unsure of what the
future holds for him at the position where he once was a Pro Bowl
player if his status in New England's secondary changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a big role here on special teams but there's no
way I could do both,'' Whigham said of being a starting safety and
special teams captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The free safety is like the quarterback on defense. I don't
think they'd ask me to be the quarterback of the defense and go out
busting 300-pound guys in the head, too. I'm capable of it but I
don't think they'd ask that of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be so sure of that. Although the assumption is that Carter
will open the season next to Lawyer Milloy, if he doesn't and it is
Whigham, it won't be the only place on the field where he'll be
standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry plays a very unique role on our team but everyone wants
to play all the time,'' Carroll said. ``We tell our players to find
a role for themselves and excel at it, but it's important not to
shortchange guys either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's their job to expand on what they do. Larry found a role
and excelled at it but never accepted that role. But what (else)
you do depends on how unique that role is.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Whigham is hoping to spend the summer fighting Carter
over Clay's job, he also understands that the inside track belongs
to his teammate and friend for a lot of reasons, not the least of
which is his own excellence at football's blue-collar jobs like
destroying the wedge on kick coverage and pressuring kickers and
punters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the end, the competition will not be decided by how
valuable Whigham might be on special teams or how well either
reminds people of the cerebral play of Clay.
</P>
<P>
   The competition will be decided the way it usually is in the
NFL: by who makes plays. And who does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is the best-prepared for this,'' Carroll said. ``He's
had the most time (on the field) in our system and he's fit right
in and been steady in practice. I've liked the way it looks right
now, but we'll see who makes the plays in the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in camp has looked OK, but the games are what's
really important. Who makes the tackles and the plays on the ball
in games will decide who plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing for certain, then, is that there is one player
who won't make those plays in the games anymore. A guy called ``Big
Play'' Clay. Until further notice, his will remain a hole that
needs fixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come up and ask me if I can fill Willie's shoes,
it's not an insult to me at all,'' Carter said. ``Willie was a
father figure we all looked up to but now he's not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got his name off of making big plays. Sooner or later we
all get older and have to move on, but we'll all remember Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   How long they remember him in New England will go a long way in
deciding how well they remember Chris Carter and Larry Whigham.

STEINHAUER HAS TWO-SHOT CUSHION OVER KANE 
</HEADLINE>
 TOURNAMENT-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ Lorie Kane said Saturday that LPGA players don't
concern themselves with the names on a leaderboard, but rather the
numbers beside those names. Surely fans watching Sunday's final
round of the areaWEB.com Challenge won't follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   After all, how can you ignore the monikers gracing this
leaderboard, promising to make Sunday's final round compelling?
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the final threesome. Kane, who hasn't missed a
cut all year, has 10 top-10 finishes this season but has yet to win
since turning professional in 1996. She fired a 1-under-par 71
Saturday and is two shots off the pace at 9-under 207.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Steinhauer, at 11-under 205 after a 69, leads entering a
final round for the seventh time this season. The previous six
times she held her ground for three wins with a stroke average of
72.66. Tied with Kane entering Saturday's third round, Steinhauer
battled back from a subpar front nine for her 69.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Hall of Famer Beth Daniel (69_208), who continues
a comeback from left shoulder surgery in 1997, when she played just
seven events. Her round included an eagle on the par-5 11th hole
and a birdie on 18.
</P>
<P>
   Others to watch include Mardi Lunn (71_208), who birdied the
second hole, then parred the last 16. Jan Stephenson (71_209), who
said earlier this week she will retire after her next victory, also
made a charge.
</P>
<P>
   And though Kane initially said players don't watch names, she
did backtrack somewhat, adding that you always have to know where
players like Rachel Hetherington (73_210) and Dottie Pepper
(71_209) are. Kane also said no one ever forgets the competitive
Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the field and you see the Dottie Peppers and
Sherri Steinhauers and the Rachel Hetheringtons, you pay attention
to those girls,'' she said. ``And Mardi Lunn has been playing
awesome as well. We've got a good crop of girls here playing. If
Karrie Webb were here, you never want her to get too far in front
of you.''
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's weather forecast uncertain, tournament officials
have rescheduled tee times to allow for an early finish. Players
will tee off in threesomes off the front and back this morning from
8-10. Kane, Steinhauer, and Daniel go off at 9:50.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauer and Kane appear headed for a repeat of last month's
Japan Airlines Big Apple Classic, where the former won with a
35-foot putt on the fifth hole of a playoff. ``At the end of
(Saturday's) round, (Kane) said, `I guess I'll see you again
tomorrow,' '' said Steinhauer. ``I like playing with her. We feed
off each other.''
</P>
<P>
   After both parred the first two holes, Kane birdied the third
with a 5-foot putt and Steinhauer fell behind with a par. After
both hit into the sand on the par-5 fourth hole, Steinhauer got up
and down for birdie, while Kane three-putted for bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Kane fell two behind after two-putting No. 8 for bogey. After
both players birdied 11, Steinhauer birdied 15 for a three-shot
lead. She bogeyed 16, however, and Kane made birdie to close to a
stroke. After both players birdied 17, arguably the most difficult
hole on the course, Steinhauer sank a 10-foot birdie putt on 18,
while Kane finished with a par.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great position to be in,'' said Steinhauer of her
two-shot lead. ``You always wish it was more but two shots going
into tomorrow is a great place to be. I definitely need to play at
a higher level. There are a lot of great players beind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Daniel, who said the eagle on 11 was the turning
point in her round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from even to 2 under (on the round) and that was a
boost,'' she said. ``I had a really good attitude out there today.
I was patient and relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Though she is no longer tied for the lead, Kane said her goal
while playing the back nine was to be among the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always easier to be the chaser, I think,'' she said.
``Sherri has to be thinking _ I mean, she certainly has the mental
toughness to focus on her own game _ but when you have a two-shot
lead, you wish it were four. When it's four, you wish it were
six.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunn said the top two players have left little room for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the winning total is going to be around 14 under,''
she said. ``I think I'm going to have to shoot 66 to have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherri is such a great player. She is shooting it so straight
and is putting well I can't see her having any worse than 2 or 3
under.''

DONATO THINKS LATEST MOVE PUTS HIM GOOD SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At the end of this month, Ted Donato and his wife
Jeannine will pack up their three little boys and the family dog
and head off to Disneyland.
</P>
<P>
   Not for vacation, mind you, but for opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The last year has been a roller-coaster ride for Donato, and it
has had nothing to do with Magic Mountain or any of the other
dazzling spectacles Disney has to offer. The forward started the
year off with the Bruins, the team that had drafted him and
employed him for parts of eight seasons, but by the time the
whirlwind had ended, he had been traded to the New York Islanders,
the Ottawa Senators, and, after the season, the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Donato, 30, is very eager for this fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really excited about it, really excited,'' said Donato,
who maintains a residence south of Boston. ``I think it's going to
be a great situation for me. Obviously they have their superstar
players, but I think basically what they're looking for is more
depth in scoring. With (Tomas) Sandstrom not coming back and their
trading Travis Green, I know there should be ample opportunity I
should be able to take advantage of. I think it will be a good
situation. I know Ted Drury and Marty McInnis, so I should feel
somewhat comfortable quicker than if I didn't know those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato is confident that he will receive a legitimate shot at
securing a place on the roster, one that might not have been
available had he remained in Ottawa. As much as he enjoyed his time
with the Senators, the uncertainty of a team having so many
unsigned players and fighting for tax relief from the government
would likely have worked against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew that Ottawa had a lot of decisions to make,'' he
said. ``I think they had five out of eight defensemen whose
contracts were up and they have like six or seven forwards (who are
free agents), never mind that Alexei Yashin wants a new deal. They
still haven't figured out that tax thing as far as if the
government is going to give them any help, so I just thought I
wouldn't be back. If they were going to gamble and pay somebody, it
was going to be one of the young kids.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all that long ago that Donato was one of the young
kids on the Bruins. Now, he is signed through this season with the
Ducks and next July 1 will become an unrestricted free agent. His
hope is to stay put in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a little bit of regret because I liked Ottawa and I
think I could've had a good year there, too,'' he said. ``They have
a lot of good players, but to be honest, it seemed Ottawa this year
is going to be a little like Boston was last year where they'll
have a hard time getting everybody into camp and it made for kind
of a crazy start. I have a feeling they're going to start camp
minus four, five, or even six guys; at least two or three. I don't
think that's a great situation for me if I'm going to try to prove
myself and get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't want to be worrying about when this guy or that guy
gets back.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the moving around, the experience of changing teams
last season had a lot of positives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why but I have a feeling that what happened last
year will help me a lot this year,'' said Donato. ``I think Anaheim
is going to be a much better spot than the other two places were
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, there was the drama about the arena, the tumult
concerning ownership, and the revolving door of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a crazy situation,'' said Donato. ``I thought it
was going to be a lot better than it was. I liked living there but
there was just so much turmoil from top to bottom. I think some of
the guys who were there had been mentally beat up over the last few
years. I had always been in situations where you only worried about
playing and winning games. All the other stuff seemed to be so much
more of a factor, which is never good as far as winning hockey
games but I think, in general, it was a good learning experience
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the problem with the Islanders was the fact that
he hadn't gone through training camp with the team, so he found it
difficult to figure out his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never got the sense of what they wanted from me when I was
there, so that was kind of a problem,'' he said. ``In Ottawa, I
knew I'd be there for the playoffs and in case someone got hurt. I
would've liked to have played more down the stretch and been given
more of a chance in the playoffs but when (his role was limited),
it kind of spelled out that I wouldn't be back.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Kings, who head into the new Staples Center this
fall, are crossing their fingers that the improved digs and
acquisition of Zigmund Palffy will help turn around their fortunes.
The Kings have missed the playoffs five of the last six years.
General manager Dave Taylor said one area in which the club has
improved is at the minor league level. ``We've signed a new
American League affiliation agreement with Lowell,'' said Taylor.
``The past couple of years, we loaned players into Fredericton and
we loaned players into Springfield and we haven't had control of
the hockey operations. We have that now in Lowell and we look
forward to a good relationship with them.'' . . . Speaking of the
Kings, they are building a state-of-the-art practice facility in
suburban Los Angeles. The El Segundo rink will be their home much
more than the Staples Center, which is expected to be crammed full
of events the way the FleetCenter and other new arenas are. Taylor
said it's things like that that make a city attractive to potential
free agents. ``The game has changed so much now, there's so much
money involved, that if you can attract players to a city they want
to live in, they're going to play in a beautiful arena, they can
live in a great community, the practice facilities are
first-class,'' said Taylor. ``I think that means as much to the
players and the quality of life as what the dollars do. The game
has changed, no question. It's a challenge financially. Even in LA,
moving into a brand-new building, we're projecting a loss for this
year. That is a pretty sobering thought when you consider where the
salaries are going. They seem to be continuing to increase. I guess
we only have ourselves to blame, we're the ones signing the players
to the contracts. So when we have an opportunity to use the
collective bargaining agreement, we have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unless the sides come together, defenseman Darren Van Impe will
have his arbitration hearing Tuesday and Dmitri Khristich will have
his Thursday. Sources say Khristich is telling those close to him
he doesn't expect to be in Boston this season. Then again, he
probably thought that at arbitration time last year, too . . .
Blues goaltender Grant Fuhr, who once had ambitions to play on the
PGA Tour, had a sponsor's exemption to play in the Eagle Creek
Classic on the Canadian PGA Tour, but things didn't go very well.
He finished 11 over par, 147th out of 154 golfers. ``The good news
is (golf) doesn't pay the bills,'' quipped Fuhr. ``I hit more
hazards than greens in regulation. I drove all right and I putted
all right but everything in between was not very good.'' . . .
Sharks coach Darryl Sutter, not one to exaggerate, is expecting his
team to finish with 90 points this season. That's as a result of
the deal that netted the Sharks forward Niklas Sundstrom and a
third-round draft pick from the Lightning for defensemen Andrei
Zyuzin and Bill Houlder and forwards Shawn Burr and Steve Guolla.
``Ninety points gives you a shot at being in the top four in your
conference,'' said Sutter. ``That means you play close to .500 on
the road and .600 at home.'' The risk was giving up Zyuzin, who
some had predicted would become another Sandis Ozolinsh. ``Zooz is
never going to be Sandis because he's 20 pounds smaller,'' said
Sutter. ``You hammer on Sandis and he laughs at you. You hammer on
Zooz, and he's gotta rest for five minutes.'' . . . The
much-delayed sale of the Pittsburgh Penguins to a group headed by
Mario Lemieux has been delayed again. The new target date for the
closing is Friday. US Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz thinks the
parties should find a way to wrap it up. ``Let's get this deal
done,'' said Markovitz to Lemieux's attorney, David Salzman. ``It's
time to get it together.'' . . . Former Bruins goalie Bill Ranford
wound up signing with the Edmonton Oilers, with whom he won a
Stanley Cup in 1990. ``Once you're an unrestricted free agent,
you've got a lot of leeway in where you want to go, but there
wasn't a lot of job opportunities out there,'' said Ranford, who
will back up Tommy Salo. ``I wanted to be out West; I'd been out
East too long. So I called Edmonton and they were interested.'' . .
. The Carolina Hurricanes are stymied so far in their attempts to
sign restricted free agent Keith Primeau. It's believed that
Primeau rejected the club's offer of a five-year deal at $4 million
a season. Word out of that city is that Primeau wants $5 million a
year. Primeau decided not to file for arbitration and will use the
holdout option as leverage . . . 27 days to training camp. Where
has the summer gone?

RACE ESTABLISHES MAINE BEACHHEAD

 10K-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE ELIZABETH, Maine _ Watch out, Falmouth, the Peoples Beach
to Beacon 10K Road Race is gaining ground. In only its second year,
the brainchild of Joan Benoit-Samuelson has emerged not only as a
prelude to the Falmouth Road Race, but has become the premier road
race in Maine. Saturday morning, it drew a field of some 4,000
runners for a jaunt from Crescent Beach along the craggy coastline
to Portland Head Light at Fort Williams State Park.
</P>
<P>
   All the elements _ a strong field, a scenic course, and
favorable weather _ came together in a sort of harmonic convergence
that enabled Khalid Khannouchi, the men's winner, and Catherine
Ndereba, repeat champion in the women's field, to better last
year's winning times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a win-win situation for everybody,'' gushed
Benoit-Samuelson after arriving at the press tent with grand
marshal Johnny Kelley in tow. ``It was a shared experience for
everybody. But with what Khalid Khannouchi did here today and the
way Catherine Ndereba ran . . . it was just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, a 27-year-old Moroccan who resides and trains in
Ossining, N.Y., and is seeking to gain US citizenship, came within
one second of matching his 10K personal best, surging past
runner-up Joseph Kimani of Kenya at the 4-mile mark to win going
away in 27:48.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went over the course yesterday,'' Khannouchi said, ``and I
knew that if I wanted to win then I was going to have to make my
move at 5 miles, because that's where the hill started, and I am
good on the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi sensed that Kimani had slowed when the two reached
the 4-mile mark at a 4:31 pace. That's when Khannouchi put away
Kimani (28:19) with a strong finishing kick.
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba, a 27-year-old Kenyan who trains and resides in
Philadelphia, teamed with her training partner, runner-up Teresa
Wanjiku of Kenya, to run down early leader and third-place finisher
Jane Ngotho. Ndereba bettered her time of a year ago by 10 seconds
when she finished first in 32:05, beating Wanjiku by one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teresa and I have trained a lot together, so I knew she was
running very, very good,'' said Ndereba, who will arrive in
Falmouth as the defending women's champion.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Stephens, a 15-year-old sophomore at Hamilton-Wenham
Regional High, utilized a similar strategy by teaming with Jessica
Galli of Belle Mead, N.J., in the wheelchair division. Stephens was
first across the finish line in 28:01 with Galli second at 28:12.
Jason Fowler of Kingston, Mass., finished third overall and was the
first male wheelchair finisher, in 29:10.
</P>
<P>
   John Tuttle, 40, of Douglasville, Ga., won the men's masters
division in 30:08, while Marina Belyaeva of St. Petersburg, Russia,
won the women's masters division in 33:37.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: Falmouth. Khannouchi and Ndereba will both be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great race,'' Khannouchi said. ``But I'll go to
Falmouth and expect to win there, too.''

US WINS NO FRIENDS 
</HEADLINE>
 AM GAMES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ Uncle Sam didn't send his best runners,
swimmers, boxers, rowers, or basketball and soccer players to the
Pan American Games. And yet, the Americans are miles ahead of their
hemispheric cousins in the medal chase, as they always are. When
this quadrennial muscle fiesta ends here Sunday night, the United
States will have topped the table for the 12th straight time since
1955, provoking both yawns and resentment from the Yukon to Tierra
del Fuego.
</P>
<P>
   So why bother? Why spend nearly $4 million to keep sending more
than 700 athletes to run roughshod over the Canadians, Cubans, and
39 other overmatched neighbors? Because the Pan Ams are still the
biggest international competition next to the Olympics. Because
it's a chance to strengthen political ties with the rest of the
Americas and counterbalance the European bloc on the global
sporting stage. And because Congress says the US Olympic Committee
has to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says in our charter that we will send a team to the Pan
American Games,'' says USOC president Bill Hybl. ``That is our
charge and that is our mandate and we will fulfill it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that it isn't a delicate balancing act. If the Americans
send their A team in every sport, they blow everybody away. If they
send their B team, they're seen as patronizing. If they didn't come
at all, they would be viewed as arrogant and rude.
</P>
<P>
   Since they first turned up in Buenos Aires four dozen years ago,
the Yanks have been viewed as the heavies, the team everybody loves
to hate. When the US baseball team played Mexico in the semifinals
here, the overwhelmingly Canadian crowd rooted for the Mexicans.
When the US played Cuba for the gold medal, the crowd pulled for
the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans can't win for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come in here and we dominate the medal count even if we
don't bring our best team,'' shrugs USOC executive director Dick
Schultz. ``And if we talk too much about that, it ends up being an
embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominance _ and the regional touchiness that comes with it _
are inevitable. The US is the biggest, richest, most powerful
country in the hemisphere. If the yanquis swing their elbows in the
pool, they create a tidal wave. Even if they don't, the perception
is that they do.
</P>
<P>
   When the sports program was downsized from 435 medal events to
330, the Cubans claimed that the US and Canada were in cahoots,
trying to whittle down Cuba's count. Everything from defections to
the agents sniffing around their baseball team to high jumper
Javier Sotomayor's positive drug test was attributed to ``foreign
interests set to harm us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the hairy, ugly, powerful hand behind this?'' Jose
Ramon Fernandez, head of Cuba's national Olympic committee, mused
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fernandez didn't single out the Americans, they're
clearly at the top of the ``enemies of Cuba'' list. But even some
of Uncle Sam's lifelong friends are sensitive to the big splash he
makes, whether or not he means to. The neighborly fascination with
America is countered by fear of being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   So because the US carries a big stick, it's obliged to speak
softly, especially when the size and shape of the Games is being
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 41 other nations here deserve to be treated on an equal
basis,'' says Hybl, who spends much of his time in Pan American
Sports Organization meetings trying not to step on toes. ``We can't
afford to be seen as trying to dictate terms and have everything
our way.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the Juegos Panamericanos continue primarily because of
the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be supportive of the Games,'' says Schultz.
``Because they would fall apart if we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ecuador decided it couldn't handle the 1987 event,
Indianapolis stepped in and staged it on short notice. And three US
sites (San Antonio, Miami, and Raleigh-Durham) are bidding for
2007. But the main reason the Pan Ams endure is that the Americans
still show up on a grand scale _ too grand, if anything.
</P>
<P>
   When they brought 800 athletes to Mar del Plata four years ago,
Mario Vazquez Rana, the PASO president from Mexico, called it
``craziness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rana was upset about the size of the team,'' Schultz says.
``But I said, `Look, you can't have it both ways. You either want
us in or you want us out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There are 41 sports on the Pan Am program, from archery to
yachting, and the US is committed to bring a full team in every
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sports that aren't on the Olympic program (such as
bowling and water skiing), this is their Olympics,'' says Hybl.
</P>
<P>
   Though the USOC occasionally encourages a national federation to
bring its best team (as it did baseball this time), it usually
leaves the decision up to each sports governing body. If that means
the US sends the JV in half a dozen key sports, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened this summer, since several sports _ notably
track and field, boxing, and rowing _ have world championships this
month. Since the men's and women's basketball squads and women's
soccer team have already qualified for Sydney, they sent their
understudies. The swimmers, given a choice of racing the
Australians and Chinese in Sydney or the Canadians and Cubans here,
opted to go Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the federations that did bring their top teams here
(like baseball, softball, field hockey, team handball, water polo)
needed to for Olympic qualification. The rest (like archery,
fencing, judo) did it because major international competitions in
their sports are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Though the USOC estimates that only 60 percent of its team here
is A level, the Yanks have still been cleaning up with
second-stringers. They won 44 medals in track and field, more than
Cuba and Brazil combined. They topped the table in rowing with a
dozen. And the swimmers, the weakest group the US has ever sent to
the Pan Ams, still were neck-and-neck with the Canadian varsity
going into Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, deep down, PASO is happy it's not our full A team,''
says Schultz.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, even the US second-stringers are aces by
hemispheric standards. In sports such as track and field and
swimming, they missed making the top team by fractions of a second.
So they were a bit sensitive about being labeled B-squadders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that wasn't what we were,'' said swimmer Ed Moses,
who came out of nowhere to set a meet record in the 100
breaststroke. ``We are the team America sent here.''
</P>
<P>
   If it could, the USOC would bring the varsity in every sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of our job, to send a very competitive group of
athletes who'll do their best to win gold medals,'' says Hybl.
``People in the press will ask us why we compete in the Pan
American Games. We'll say the international competition, the spirit
of sportsmanship, the brotherhood. Then they'll say, what's the
medal count? So we have to weigh that. In the end, the USOC is held
accountable for doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans weren't atop the standings, most folks would be
surprised _ and suspicious. The only time they weren't was at the
inaugural Games at Buenos Aires in 1951, which were held in late
February. The US competed in only 15 of the 21 sports and ended up
second behind host Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the Yanks have mined a motherlode, with their medal
haul passing 200, then 300, then 400 as the event program gradually
doubled. How well is too well? How big is too big?
</P>
<P>
   Even though the medal events were chopped by a quarter this
time, the Americans still brought 703 athletes here (more than
they'll send to the Olympics) and the coterie of coaches, trainers,
staffers, and officials swelled the total to nearly 1,200. The
Americans have their own administrative house, their own transport
vans, their own polyclinic in the athletes' village.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam is either in or he is out, and when he's in, he brings
the whole family. Last time, this time, and next time, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our intention to have a full team in Santo Domingo in
2003,'' says Hybl. It may be `craziness,' but it's the American
way. And besides, it would take (literally) an act of Congress to
change it.

CUBANS RULE IN BOXING 
</HEADLINE>
 AMERICAN GAMES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNIPEG, Manitoba _ The symbol for the whole tournament was
massive super heavyweight Alexis Rubalcaba, shadow boxing in his
corner Saturday &UR;  &LR; night with nobody to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans didn't just dominate boxing at the Pan American
Games, they virtually won it by walkover. Twelve weight classes,
nine gold medals, plus a pair of bronzes for bookends. And the
final gold literally was a walkover, since US entrant Davin King
split his lip in his semifinal and couldn't fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't plan it this way,'' said the 19-year-old King after
collecting his silver medal. ``But my intention was at least to
bring something home for the USA and I did that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks, who left their best at home to prepare for the world
championships in Houston later this month, had modest expectations
here. But they still ended up with eight medals _ a gold from
bantamweight Gerald Tucker, silvers from King, flyweight Jose
Navarro, and middleweight Arthur Palac, and bronzes from
featherweight Aaron Torres, light welterweight Corey Bernard,
welterweight LeChaunce Shepherd, and light middleweight Darnell
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   That was one more than the US managed with its varsity in Mar
del Plata four years ago and it was an encouraging sign of depth
entering the Olympic year. ``The US performed very well here, but
we still have room for improvement,'' said coach Pete Balcunas.
``We were so close in some of the ones we lost. But that's
workable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans always shoot for perfection _ 12 classes, 12 golds _
at the Pan Ams. And once they knew the archrival yanquis were
bringing the second string, they thought they might finally get the
sweep. Tucker blew it apart by beating Waldemar Font, the world
silver medalist, by a point in the semifinals, but the Cubans still
figured to get nine golds if they won all four of Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's
finals.
</P>
<P>
   No challenge, no problem. Flyweight Yudel Jhonson outpointed
Canada's Zaya Younan, 11-2. Light middleweight Jorge Gutierrez
battered Canada's Scott Macintosh bloody and won by stoppage in the
fourth round. Light heavyweight Humberto Savigne TKO'd Brazil's
Laudelino Barros in the first. Then out came Rubalcaba, the
6-foot-8-inch, 250-pound giant who may be the most frightening
boxer the Cubans have ever put in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   He had won all three of his bouts here by knockout and broke the
nose of Canada's Patrice L'Heureux in the bargain. His bout with
King, the No. 3 US super heavyweight who'd never had an
international bout before he came here, figured to be a major
mismatch, since Rubalcaba had 8 inches and 42 pounds on him.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans knew Saturday morning the fight would never
happen after their doctor examined the stitches in King's lip.
``The wound is not just a little scratch. It's deep,'' said
Balcunas. ``Given who he was fighting, any punch that landed there
would have opened it up seriously. We're not here for that.''

HBO DELIVERS TWO-FISTED DOCUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
 OLYMPICS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It remains one of the most enduring images of the 20th
century: two fists, covered by black gloves, raised toward the
Mexico City sky.
</P>
<P>
   It said as much about the '60s as it did about the two men,
Tommy Smith and John Carlos. They were simply two guys, blessed
with world-class speed and an obligation, a sense of duty, to use
their stage as Olympic athletes to connect with the civil rights
movement.
</P>
<P>
   How they chose to wear the gloves and the political
circumstances surrounding the 1968 Summer Olympics are the subjects
of a brilliant HBO special, ``Fists of Freedom,'' airing Thursday
at 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Time and time again, HBO makes extraordinary documentaries, and
this one is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   It's not preachy or bombastic. Producers George Roy and Steve
Stern simply lay out the story from beginning to end, and uncover
the significant nuances in between. The detailed reporting includes
an interview with Australian Peter Norman, who won the silver medal
in the 200 meters, just beating out Carlos, and was the lone white
man on the medal podium.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers come away with a sense of the '60s and the plight of
young men struggling to navigate the tricky waters of race
relations.
</P>
<P>
   The special is about more than just sports. It illustrates the
conflict among black athletes in associating with black power
movements. It also shows the consequences of speaking out against
racial discrimination and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Beamon, the long jumper who set a world record in Mexico
that stood for two decades, simply wanted to focus on winning a
gold medal. He wore black socks to symbolize his protest. Boxer
George Foreman, on the other hand, waved the American flag after he
won the gold and was roundly criticized as an ``Uncle Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after Carlos and Smith raised their fists, Jesse Owens
tried to talk with the black athletes about future demonstrations.
Owens told them that politics had no part in Olympic competition.
Owens, too, was considered an Uncle Tom; he had been reduced to
racing against horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not anti-Christs,'' Smith told HBO. ``We were just
human beings who saw a need to be recognized. I don't like the idea
of people looking at it as negative. There was nothing but a raised
fist in the air and a bowed head acknowledging the American flag _
not symbolizing a hatred for it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not how mainstream America interpreted their actions.
Avery Brundage, the International Olympic Committee president,
threatened the American delegation, warning that if no action were
taken against the two, the entire team would be disqualified. Smith
and Carlos were sent home the next day and banned from Olympic
competition for life.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the media during the Games also was troublesome.
Brent Musburger, for example, went on to become a leading network
sports broadcaster. But at the time, he was a columnist for the
Chicago American and called Smith and Carlos ``black-skinned storm
troopers'' and labeled their behavior ``juvenile gestures.''
</P>
<P>
   Musburger was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports was a legitimate lever to bring about changes relative
to race _ a battle for dignity and respect,'' Harry Edwards, a
civil rights activist and San Jose State professor, told HBO.
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong show gets it right from the very beginning,
detailing the meager beginnings of Smith, Carlos, and another
Olympic gold medalist, Lee Evans. Carlos came from Harlem, with the
style and strut to match. Smith and Evans were country boys. They
came from poor, hard-working families that labored in cotton fields
or grape orchards, from sunup to sundown.
</P>
<P>
   Smith told HBO that his father was reluctant to permit him to
run in high school track meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would tell me that I could run in a meet, but if I came in
second, I would be back in the fields with my sisters and
brothers,'' Smith said. ``I got a lot of burn marks across my chest
from crossing the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that struggle, the notion of upward mobility, that caused
the most anguish. Some of the athletes had families and worried
about losing money and jobs. Others were simply afraid of speaking
out against racial oppression. After being sent home, the only job
Smith could find was washing cars.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Scott, the first black to play basketball at the
University of North Carolina, was a member of the gold medal 1968
Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that everyone (at North Carolina) did not welcome me
with open arms,'' Scott told HBO. ``But I had a responsibility when
I went there not to lose sight of. I could not be altogether
revolutionary because that would close the door for other guys
behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was always the threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Evans was criticized for ``watering down'' his protest after he
won the gold in the 400 meters. He went to San Jose State with
Smith and Carlos, and when those two were kicked out of the Games,
he initially wanted to go home with them. But he stayed and ran the
race of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Cosell asked him what he was going to do during the
victory ceremony; Evans didn't answer, but it soon became clear. He
wore a black beret, the hat popular among Black Panthers, and
laughed and smiled as he received the medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People asked me, `Why were you guys smiling so much on the
victory stand?' '' Evans told HBO. ``And I said, `Man, some guy was
threatening to shoot me. I smiled because I thought maybe they
wouldn't be able to shoot a guy who is smiling.' That's the only
thing that was on my mind on the victory stand: being shot dead.''

WRIGHT HEADED TO ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Lorenzen Wright path, where bread crumbs might
qualify as road repair, has led its namesake to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   According to an NBA source, the Clippers and Hawks have agreed
to a sign-and-trade deal that will send the free-agent
center/forward to Atlanta for two selections in the 2000 NBA Draft.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers are expected to announce the trade this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not official, but this thing's done,'' the source said of
a deal that will pay Wright $42 million over seven seasons and
provide the Clippers with the Hawks' first-round pick and a
lottery-protected, first-round pick Atlanta had acquired from
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The only threat to the deal, the source indicated, was the
unpredictable nature of Wright's tour guide, agent Robert Fayne.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago, Fayne attempted to expedite the trip by
threatening to sell his client to the Lakers for their $2 million,
middle-class exception. This move seemed to inspire Wright's
suitors who had failed to wow the Clippers with previous
sign-and-trade offers into greater fits of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   By putting two draft choices in the bank, the Clippers were able
to satisfy Wright's agenda without accepting players they didn't
want. The Clippers would have preferred keeping Wright, who
averaged 6.6 points and 7.5 rebounds as a reserve in his third NBA
season. They had offered to pay Wright $5 million per season for
six seasons, although owner Donald T. Sterling has never paid a
Clipper that much for one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Clippers are bargaining with us in good faith,''
said Fayne, who wouldn't confirm that a deal had been reached. ``At
this point, no deal has been consummated. It's possible we'll have
a deal fairly soon.''
</P>
<P>
   This deal also contradicts last week's reported notion that
Wright was headed to the capped-out Lakers because winning a
championship was more important than money.
</P>
<P>
   The virus seems to be airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Clippers worked a sign-and-trade deal for free agent
Lamond Murray and the Cleveland Cavaliers, Murray was eyeballing a
$2 million exception in San Antonio because his priority was
winning a championship. Murray also said returning to the Clippers
never was an option, although a Clippers source said his new agent,
Arn Tellem, solicited a Clips offer that would eclipse what the
Spurs could pay.
</P>
<P>
   Clip and save
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson and Johnny Newman, who were acquired from
Cleveland in the Murray deal, will be given physicals Tuesday in
L.A. ... Lamar Odom is scheduled to be in town today and will sign
his rookie contract early this week. ... Aside from free-agent,
point-guard target Haywoode Workman, the Clips will be touring the
market for a backup center.

MCNAIR BUILDING STRONG CASE FOR HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If good things come to those who wait, Bob McNair
should be handed two NFL franchises for his patience.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston businessman who has been trying to convince NFL
owners to accept what may be the best expansion-team financial
package in league history finally got some good news Thursday, but
it was hardly a bulletin. The news was simply this: People who pay
taxes in California don't want to pay them to bring pro football to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, that is a pretty reasonable position for a taxpayer to
take, although few seem to do so whenever the NFL comes around
wearing a ski mask while trying to bring its game to a tax coffer
near you.
</P>
<P>
   An owners meeting in Chicago July 27 led to new problems with
Los Angeles's efforts to land the league's 32d team when Bill
Chadwick, a representative of California Gov. Gray Davis, angered
some owners with a proposal that the state be paid $2.5 million-$5
million a year in rent for the use of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Chadwick recently resigned, only six weeks before an NFL-imposed
Sept. 15 deadline for a deal to be done at the Coliseum, telling
Davis he could not in good conscience recommend that taxpayer money
be expended on the effort to refurbish the Coliseum and bring an
NFL team back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Davis and NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue exchanged
faxes, with Davis telling Tagliabue there would be no new public
money available to aid a stadium deal at the Coliseum site.
Tagliabue replied by telling Davis the process would be reopened
for other bidders with stadium plans at Hollywood Park or in
Carson, an LA suburb, which was seen by league insiders as not only
creating chaos but all but assuring the LA deal had collapsed and
McNair would finally end up getting the expansion team for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, that is as it should be.
</P>
<P>
   McNair has not only met every criteria set up by the NFL _ short
of moving Houston to Los Angeles _ he also has continued to sweeten
the pot even after the league voted to give LA's effort six more
months to try to do what it hadn't been able to do in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Harris County agreed to put up $193 million in public
money to build a 1.3 million-square-foot exhibition hall adjacent
to the new stadium that would allow the league to put the NFL
Experience amusement park on the grounds if the Super Bowl ever
came to Houston, as it surely would. It also added another 3,000
parking spaces to its stadium plan, bringing total parking to
29,000, one of the highest numbers in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Parking has been a huge problem in Los Angeles, where a $225
million garage was proposed as part of the Coliseum deal. To put
that in perspective: If built, it would mean it costs more to build
a garage in LA than it will to build a stadium in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   McNair also convinced city politicians in Houston to fund half
the cost of a light rail system from downtown to the door of the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those efforts and his own disappointment at not getting
the franchise in March at the winter owners meetings, McNair has
said repeatedly that he understands why the NFL believes Los
Angeles is so important to its future.
</P>
<P>
   Although Houston is the nation's fourth-largest city, LA is the
second-largest, as well as being the television and entertainment
capital of the world. Owners like Bob Kraft fear the long-term
effects of a generation of children growing up without a rooting
interest in a local NFL team, while short term it has made it
difficult to continue negotiating increasing television fees.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, McNair chose not to attend the July 27 meeting, telling
friends he did not feel an appearance would be productive since the
league had given Los Angeles exclusive rights to the 32d team in
March for a six-month period. Instead, he flew around the country,
meeting with several influential members of the expansion
committee, including Pat Bowlen in Denver, Wayne Weaver in
Jacksonville, Jerry Richardson in Carolina, new Cleveland owner Al
Lerner, and Dan Rooney in Pittsburgh. He also had a lengthy
telephone conversation with Kraft, who along with Richardson
co-chairs the committee.
</P>
<P>
   While California's efforts continue to be bogged down, McNair
has been ready to start building for months. He has financing for a
$310 million stadium with a retractable roof that includes $195
million from taxpayers, has his money lined up to cover an expected
franchise fee of more than $500 million, and has guaranteed five
years of sellouts despite the fact that when the Oilers left after
the 1996 season, attendance had shrunk to 15,131 for the final game
at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of the matter is, Los Angeles will never come close to
matching McNair's financing plan nor will it be ready anywhere near
as quickly as he. Just as importantly, any effort in LA that lacks
massive public financial backing is doomed to mediocrity. When that
happens, the financially strapped new owners would not be able to
compete for free agents, the team would suffer on the field,
attendance would drop, games would be blacked out locally, and TV
ratings would slide.
</P>
<P>
   That is the same pattern that existed with the Raiders and Rams
in LA, a situation that led both to flee _ to Oakland and St. Louis
_ for fat stadium deals nowhere near as good as the one McNair has
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   What needs to happen now _ and seems likely to _ is that at a
special owners meeting called for Sept. 22 to address the issue,
they'll vote to give the team to the guy with the deepest pockets.
</P>
<P>
   That's Bob McNair, and he also has staying power and a pleasing
way about him. Contrast that with the pomposity of LA billionaire
Eli Broad, who last Thursday ``offered'' to send the league a $2
million nonrefundable fee for a 60-day option to acquire the
franchise and negotiate a new deal with a state that hasn't been
willing to negotiate for 60 months.
</P>
<P>
   Then he proposed financing the estimated $550 million franchise
fee by paying half now and the other half from projected future
revenues. That's as likely to happen as Hillary and Bill Clinton
renewing their wedding vows in the Oval Office pantry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, pulling people out of the stands is a 49er thing,
too. Patriots coach Pete Carroll has said he models his approach on
what he learned in San Francisco, but when he took a fan out of the
stands and had him address the team one day last week, he didn't
know that 3,000 miles away, on the campus where he once played
college football, 49ers coach Steve Mariucci was pulling a soft
drink vendor known as ``The Coke Stud,'' onto his practice field to
cool his team off. After quarterback Steve Young ran over to Sean
Reilly in the middle of a steamy practice with a dollar and bought
a drink and a minute later Jerry Rice followed suit, Mariucci
brought Reilly onto the field and bought drinks for several other
players . . . When Mariucci learned that fourth-round pick Anthony
Parker had suffered a torn ACL that will require surgery, it left
him with only one cornerback in camp who stands 6 feet or taller:
free agent Harold Piersey . . . Sometimes it might be wise for NFL
gurus to keep their ideas to themselves. Bill Walsh, the man who
created the 49ers' dynasty and now is trying to resurrect it as
general manager, wrote in a book he published last year, ``It is
foolish for a team to acquire a free agent whose circumstances are
contemptible _ regardless of how well he performs on the field.''
This offseason, he re-signed troubled defensive end Charles Haley
and brought in very troubled running back Lawrence Phillips. Maybe
he should read his book . . . The Cleveland Browns, of the San
Francisco Browns family, are likely to open the season with seven
ex-49ers starting for head coach Chris Palmer. Five started for the
49ers last season but only one of them will come off the expansion
list the Browns used to help stock their team . . . Palmer is
shedding his good-guy image in a hurry in training camp, ranting
and raving on the field in the best tradition of his mentor, Bill
Parcells. ``Coach Parcells once told me that half the games on
Sunday are decided by 7 points or less and half those games are by
3 points or less,'' Palmer said. ``The team that doesn't crack wins
games. We're trying to put them in the most difficult situations we
can. What I say to them is a lot less than what players on the
other team will be saying to them.'' . . . Browns' top draft choice
Tim Couch, the first player taken in the draft in April, may not be
ready to start in the NFL quite yet, but last week he completed a
15-yard pass from flat on his back after tripping over an offensive
lineman's foot while backpedaling during a scrimmage. What is he
capable of if he can stay upright? . . . Now here's a guy who can
stand some pressure. Miami wide receiver Tony Martin spent most of
last week in a federal courthouse facing prosecutors who accused
him of being involved in a money laundering scheme to protect a
local drug trafficker. When he was excused from court on Friday to
participate in a scrimmage against the Buccaneers, he responded by
catching a bomb for a touchdown over Sam Madison that led Tampa
head coach Tony Dungy to remark, ``He looked in midseason form.''
The only question Jimmy Johnson has is, will he have Martin's
services in midseason?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Tremain Mack apparently going to open the season under an
NFL suspension, the Bengals have asked oft-injured running back
Ki-Jana Carter to try returning kicks. This is two years after
Carter was booed off the field the first time he did it, when he
caught a kick and slid to the ground as he'd been instructed to do
to protect a Bengal lead. Carter told special teams coach Al
Roberts he would gladly do it . . . A year ago the Packers lost
four starters to free agency, and general manager Ron Wolf had had
enough of seeing his team slowly eroded by the competition's
dollars. So he hired a Boston boy, former Bob Woolf Associates
agent Andrew Brandt, in February to solve the problem. Brandt now
works solely on contract negotiations and the result of his
attention has left the Packers with only 11 players eligible to
become unrestricted free agents next February, down from 23 a year
ago. More importantly, a year ago four of their top 10 players were
set to walk. This year only one of their top 10 has less than four
years remaining on his contract, linebacker Brian Williams. To
accomplish this, the Packers have spent $18.65 million in signing
bonuses to re-sign seven starters this year and avoided the
position the Patriots were in two days before training camp when
they claim they had no choice but to cut veteran safety Willie Clay
to make salary cap room for their rookies. Remember that the next
time you hear someone say, ``Every team goes through it.'' . . .
After leading the league in penalties and penalty yardage _ and
committing five personal fouls on one embarrassing drive during a
Monday night game last year _ the Chiefs promised things would be
different under new coach Gunther Cunningham. Cunningham even
promised, ``I'm going to kill somebody if we get too many
penalties.'' Well, he'd better start shooting. The Chiefs had to
cancel a Friday afternoon practice and a Saturday scrimmage with
the New Orleans Saints after tackle Marcus Spears took off his
helmet and clubbed Brady Smith over the head in the morning and
safety Jerome Woods decked wide receiver Keith Poole late after a
play in the afternoon. The latter turned into a free-for-all. Poole
jumped up and was pulled from a pile of players by Chiefs
cornerback Cris Dishman and held while cornerback Carlton Gray
pummeled him, leaving him with a cut eye that required stitches.
There was also a mini-riot after the Spears incident, with several
fights going on around the field, including one involving Chiefs
defensive tackle Chester McGlockton and Saints offensive line coach
Bill Meyers. ``I didn't expect to solve the world's problems in six
months in the offseason or solve the world's problems after 14
practices,'' Cunningham said. ``I don't know if it was out of
control. It was something that needed to be stopped. We're taking
care of it.'' Certainly are. No gunplay was reported.

   First-round pick Edgerrin James has not yet signed with
Indianapolis, but he returned to his home there over the weekend
and the belief is he'll be in the fold next week around the same
time agent Leigh Steinberg works out a deal for Akili Smith, the
Bengals' top choice. James, who is trying to replace the 43 percent
of the Colts' offense that went to St. Louis with the trade of
Marshall Faulk, has already missed 16 days, 21 practices, and
Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's first exhibition game as of this morning . . .
The Lions have yet to ask AWOL running back Barry Sanders to fork
over the $7.2 million remaining on his signing bonus and he has yet
to file papers with the NFL office making his retirement official.
The Lions have put him on the ``did not report'' list and tolled
his contract, meaning whenever he does come back _ if ever _ he
would still owe them the four years remaining on the deal. In
addition, $3.5 million of his $11 million bonus on a deal that was
renegotiated two years ago had been deferred to 1998 and 1999 and
may not yet have even been paid to him, reducing by half what he
would ``owe'' the Lions if he never plays again . . . It was not a
good few weeks for the Lions. First they lose Sanders in shocking
fashion then Friday top draft pick Aaron Gibson appeared to have
been lost for the season with a shoulder injury and backup
quarterback Donald Hollis quit after one workout. Embattled head
coach Bobby Ross had to call ex-Notre Dame quarterback Ron Powlus,
who had been cut a day earlier, and ask him back. Like Sanders,
Hollis quit without saying a word to Ross . . . Ex-Boston College
linebacker Stephen Boyd has been included in a Lions marketing
effort that took an odd twist last week. Boyd's face and the Lions'
logo towered over Interstate 94 in a suburb outside Detroit on a
billboard that read, ``I stayed here to win.'' The team's marketing
department said the campaign had nothing to do with Sanders's
departure. Boyd was one of several free agents who re-signed with
Detroit, so he was included in a marketing scheme to rekindle
interest in the team. Herman Moore and Charlie Batch appear on
similar billboards. Sanders was never going to be included. Good
thing . . . Speaking of Sanders, did you know that the two greatest
running backs in NFL history both announced their retirements in
London? That's where Jim Brown was filming a movie in 1966 when he
said he wasn't coming back, and it's where Sanders first spoke
publicly about his decision after issuing a statement on the
Internet . . . Doug Flutie may have a new $5 million-a-year
contract and job insurance in Buffalo, but backup Rob Johnson still
insists the starting job should be his. ``It's pretty much his town
and his team right now and he deserves it,'' Johnson said last
week. ``You know who's going to be in there. You don't have to be a
brain surgeon. But I'm not a backup and I've proven that.'' Sounds
like a guy just happy to have a job, doesn't it?

MERCER DEAL MORE THAN DOLLARS AND SENSE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ First, there is their dispute about the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to tell you how much the Celtics offered Ron?''
Tevester Scott said. ``Six years, $25 million. As I've said before,
there are guys on the bench making more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino heard about the contract quoted by Scott _ Mercer's
agent _ and said, ``That's a blatant lie. We never talked to Ron
Mercer about a six-year deal. We talked to him about a four-year
deal.'' Pitino said the proposed contract was for four years and
$28 million with incentives. There were separate $1 million bonuses
for making the conference and NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a pretty good contract for a player who has
played two years in the league,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is their negotiating distrust of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the season,'' Scott said, ``Rick pulled Ron
aside and told him, `Come on, sign this contract for me. I'm your
college coach.' Ron told him, `No, you have to talk to my agent.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino: ``I didn't even talk contract with Ron at the end of the
year. I knew it was going to be tough to get him signed. I talked
to him about things like conditioning and improving his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the Celtics traded Mercer, Popeye Jones and Dwayne
Schintzius to the Nuggets for cash, a first-round pick, Danny
Fortson, Eric Williams and Eric Washington. The move showed that
Pitino was more devastated by losing the 1997 lottery than he ever
let on. If he weren't, one of his first draft picks, either Mercer
or Chauncey Billups, would still be here. It also showed how tense
the Mercer-Pitino relationship had become.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were never close. They were simply what they needed
to be. But things changed once Mercer fired David Falk and chose
Scott to represent him. Pitino has a good relationship with Falk;
you can guess what kind of relationship he has with Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick did some things behind our backs that we didn't
appreciate,'' Scott said. ``There were some teams interested in Ron
and he told us he would talk to them. The next thing you know, Rick
calls up and says, `I think I'm going to do a deal with Denver.'
That was something we hadn't even talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino: ``No one is going to tell the Boston Celtics how to make
a trade. We aren't here to satisfy an agent; we are here to make
the Boston Celtics better. They wanted us to call Toronto, we did,
and Toronto offered Doug Christie for Mercer, straight up. We
didn't think that was a fair trade, so we didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, that led to some harsh feelings. Pitino describes
his relationship with Mercer as ``professional.'' For now, Scott
still simmers over what he sees as double-dealing by the coach.
Pitino hears that and says, ``What's he talking about? I've only
talked to him once. Chris Wallace did most of the negotiating with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now that the NBA has lifted its curtain and allowed us to see
its productions of trades and free agent signings, this much is
clear: Some teams really know how to help themselves; other teams
need to hang out in the self-help section more often.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST CLASS ELITE &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   As if the rest of the Western Conference forgot about the Suns'
fortunes, Danny Ainge reminded everyone Thursday night. Ainge said
he was shocked in 1997 when the Suns were able to acquire Jason
Kidd. ``It's the same feeling now,'' he said after the team
essentially picked up Penny Hardaway for free (Pat Garrity, Danny
Manning, two first-rounders). Hardaway-Kidd easily becomes the best
backcourt in the West, especially since Hardaway doesn't have to
handle the ball. He now teams with Kidd, the Oscar Robertson of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing guards have no advantage against this duo. Hardaway is
6 feet 7 inches and Kidd is 6-4, so teams will not be able to post
them up.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns will most likely battle the Spurs and Trail Blazers for
the top spot in the West. You know how you joke with some people to
``Go to the store and buy a new personality''? The Blazers did
that. They dumped Isaiah Rider and Jim Jackson and picked up Steve
Smith and Detlef Schrempf. The latter two are known as pure
professionals; the former two are not. There should be no questions
about the makeup of the Blazers, on or off the court. Their only
weakness is that they have two fragile players in Smith and Arvydas
Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS CLASS (with a potential upgrade) &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been assumed that Keith Van Horn would re-up with
the Nets, but it still had to happen. The team got that last week
along with a more subtle signing: Jamie Feick. The forward/center
played well for New Jersey last year after Jayson Williams was
injured. Watch the Jersey Yanks closely. With George Steinbrenner
on their side, money is no longer an issue. Just as instability is
no longer an issue for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento got Nick Anderson from the Magic, re-signed its bench
players and got a backup point guard (Darrick Martin) when Jason
Williams needs a rest. There were rumblings last week that Mitch
Richmond would return, but that seems unlikely because the Kings
don't have much cap room and they still want to re-sign Corliss
Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   STANDBY PASSENGERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't treated as headline material around the league, but
Bucks coach George Karl knows how devastating it is to lose top
reserves. The Bucks lost Michael Curry, who went to Detroit, and
Dell Curry backed out of an oral agreement and signed with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics slammed the Nuggets by taking a first-rounder from
them, giving them a player they didn't want (Schintzius), giving
them a player they shouldn't have signed (Jones) and giving them a
player they could not _ or would not _ sign (Mercer). But there are
still more questions than answers. Was Calbert Cheaney's poor '99
season a fluke or a sign of something serious? If Fortson has a
great season, how do you sign him and Tony Battie? Whom do you
start at power forward, Battie or Fortson? (Fortson is a warrior,
but he doesn't like sitting on the bench. Plus, since Battie and
Fortson are in the last season of their deals, stats and playing
time become factors when it is time to negotiate. The Celtics are
playing dangerously by allowing both to begin this season in their
``contract'' years. If both play poorly, they could easily keep
them. If both play well, they could run the risk of not being able
to afford both of them.)
</P>
<P>
   HITCHIKERS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, Washington, Los Angeles Clippers and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies get the James Brown ``Talkin' Loud, Sayin'
Nothing'' award. First they said they wanted to trade the No. 2
pick in the draft for a veteran. Instead they drafted Steve
Francis. Still in search of quality veterans, they have done . . .
nothing. ``Coach Brian Hill'' will soon be a synonym for
``Jobless.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Wizards coach Gar Heard said it would be fun to win
in Washington because ``we have great fans who want to support this
team.'' Hey, Gar. What do you mean by ``team''? The Wizards lost
Otis Thorpe and Cheaney. They may lose Richmond. So that leaves Rod
Strickland, Juwan Howard and rookie Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers? Not such a bad week. They simply lost Rodney
Rogers, Lorenzen Wright, Martin and Lamond Murray.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't trade Eric Williams (in 1997),'' Pitino acknowledged
earlier this week. ``We gave him away.'' The Celtics got him back
in a giveaway, too. People in Denver were ecstatic to rid
themselves of the 6-8 forward and his $30 million contract. But one
unmistakable skill Williams has is an ability to get to the free
throw line. Pitino, a Bernard King fan, will be pleased to know
that Williams mimics the former Knick when he is on the court.
``It's all angles,'' said Williams, who spent most of his childhood
a 15-minute car ride from Madison Square Garden . . . One of the
futuristic tidbits going around the league is that Chicago is
saving all its pennies so it can go after Tim Duncan and Grant Hill
for the 2000-2001 season. If the Bulls were to pull that off,
executive Jerry Krause could proudly say that he built a
championship team without the presence of Michael Jordan. But as
good as that plan sounds, reality is that Chicago would not be
Duncan's first choice when he becomes a free agent after the '99-00
season. The 7-footer is close to Orlando coach Doc Rivers. And if
San Antonio doesn't get a new arena, Duncan would most likely wind
up in central Florida . . . Pitino was asked if he thought Antoine
Walker would be a Celtic on Opening Night. ``I'm 98 percent sure he
will,'' the coach said . . . Isiah Thomas made one of the smartest
purchases of the summer when he bought the nine-team Continental
Basketball Association for $10 million. Thomas has radical plans
for the league, which has been an unofficial farm system for the
NBA since the late '70s.

WALTRIP HAS TO SHIFT GEARS 
</HEADLINE>
 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For once in his storied career, the words were hard to
come by for Darrell Waltrip. A talkative member of the NASCAR
Winston Cup circuit, whose gift of gab won him many admirers among
the motorsports media and often got him sideways with more than a
few of his competitors, Waltrip spoke haltingly, choked with
emotion, when he stood before a microphone Thursday at Indianapolis
Motor Speedway and announced that he was retiring after next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done this for 40 years,'' said Waltrip, a 52-year-old
native of Owensboro, Ky., who next year will launch a Victory Tour
2000 in the No. 66 Kmart-sponsored Ford Taurus co-owned by Travis
Carter and Carl Hass before permanently parking it after the series
finale in Atlanta. ``We've gotten up every morning, put on our
racing gear, and gone to the track. When I tell you next year is my
last one, it's not easy. I always thought, `You've got next week,'
but I'm running out of next weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sports, your legs and arms give out. One thing that never
gives out is my heart. It's the things that carry it around that
have given out.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the clock is ticking on Waltrip's career, one that has
spanned nearly three decades and included 771 starts, 84 victories,
$17.8 million in earnings, and three Winston Cup championships
(1981, '82, and '85).
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip, however, has reached the twilight of his career,
evidenced by the fact that he has finished among the top 10 in
points only three times this decade. He currently stands 38th with
1,465 points and $665,718 in earnings after 18 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Travis, Carl Haas, and Kmart are going to provide me
with some victories,'' said Waltrip, who unveiled his Victory Tour
2000 mount before Saturday's Brickyard 400. ``It would be kind of a
fake tour if I don't get a victory. That's my goal.''
</P>
<P>
   After recording three victories in 1992, winning has been an
unattainable goal for Waltrip in the seven years since. Waltrip
would like nothing more than to capture career victory No. 85, if
for no other reason than to break the tie with longtime rival Bobby
Allison for third place on NASCAR's all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning a race now would be almost as good as winning my first
one in 1975,'' Waltrip said. ``I'm going to drive for 18 more
months and have a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   For one last time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett went into Saturday's Brickyard 400 with a healthy
254-point lead over Mark Martin in the Winston Cup standings and
then padded that lead by winning the race. It was a vast
improvement on last year's effort when, in his bid to become the
event's first two-time winner, he fell out of the lead midway
through the race when he ran out of fuel. ``So far we've been able
to do our job,'' said Jarrett. ``And as long as we can do that,
everything will be fine. But if you're the guy chasing the guy up
front, you've got to count on them having some trouble or making a
mistake. It doesn't matter how good you do your job, because
sometimes it's not enough. It's much more fun being out front and
letting those guys go home and say, `Man, those guys finished in
the top 5 again,' which we've done the last few years.'' . . .
Perhaps he is following the lead of former NFL coach Joe Gibbs, who
owns a successful Winston Cup stable that includes Bobby Labonte
and Tony Stewart, but Minnesota Vikings head coach Dennis Green has
entered into a partnership with Doc Watson, an ARCA driver, in the
formation of an ARCA team with an eye on expanding into the Busch
Series or, eventually, the Winston Cup circuit. Watson Green
Motorsports would become the latest in a number of minority-owned
teams that have sprouted in the last few years, beginning with that
of Cuban-born Felix Sabates, who fields cars for Winston Cup
drivers Sterling Marlin and Joe Nemechek. In addition, there is the
Washington-Erving race team headed by former NFL running back Joe
Washington and former NBA great Julius Erving; and Joyner-Kersee
Racing, a joint Winston Cup venture set to be launched next season
by Olympic track and field gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee, her
husband, Bob, and Kurt Roehring of Roehring Motorsports . . . As
expected, Formula One driver Michael Schumacher, who suffered a
pair of fractures in his right leg at the British Grand Prix July
11, will have to undergo surgery that will likely keep him out of
his Ferrari for the remainder of the season. In a TV interview
before the German Grand Prix last Sunday, Shumacher held out some
hope that he might be able to return, saying, ``Every week we have
a meeting with the doctors and we (review) everything. I have a cut
on my heel, and that is basically more of a factor, because of the
flexibility of my foot. That is more of a problem than the healing
(of the leg) itself. I'm not able to predict when things will be
well.'' Doctors could make no such determinations either when they
decided it was time to operate on Schumacher's leg, all but dashing
any hopes for his return to Ferrari . . . Eddie Irvine,
Schumacher's teammate, took over the points lead from Mika Hakkinen
with his victory last week in the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim.
Irvine now has 52 points, to 44 for Hakkinen. Irvine, though,
credited the teamwork of Mika Salo, Schumacher's substitute, when
he was given team orders to allow Irvine to pass him for the lead.
``Mika was the star today, and he won the race,'' lauded Irvine.
``He is `Boy Wonder,' and I'm going to give him my trophy. '' . . .
Indy Racing League driver Greg Ray tamed the ``Monster Mile'' at
Dover Downs International Speedway last Sunday with his second IRL
victory of the season. ``My team has been doing a great job,'' said
Ray, who closed within 2 points of IRL points leader Scott
Goodyear, 193-191 . . . The man without a mustache you saw behind
the wheel of the No. 3 Goodwrench Chevrolet in the Brickyard 400
was no impostor. It was none other than Dale Earnhardt. How many
times do you suppose the Intimidator was stopped by Indy's
overzealous, yellow-shirted security force and asked to produce
identification?

TCU HAS `A POINT TO PROVE' IN SECOND SEASON UNDER FRANCHIONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A year ago, TCU wasn't expected to win many
football games. This year, the Horned Frogs are expected to win the
Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say 1998 was one wild and wacky season.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Frogs won five more regular-season games than they
did in 1997. Next, they upset Southern Cal in the Sun Bowl. A
seven-year, $900,000 contract for first-year coach Dennis
Franchione followed arguably the Horned Frogs' best recruiting
class in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed around TCU, and Franchione predicts more
surprises in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen reported yesterday for TCU, and Franchione welcomes his
veterans on Tuesday with full-squad two-a-days beginning on Friday.
Franchione talked recently about the difference a year has made for
the Horned Frogs' hopes in 1999:
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you say to people who say last season's turnaround
was a fluke?
</P>
<P>
   A: I guess I could see how you could form an opinion like that.
Everybody's entitled. I've been doing this too many years to
believe in flukes, but it just makes me want to prove a point a
little more this year. That's our motto for this season: A point to
prove. People don't stop me and say that to me, but I've heard
that. You hear it recruiting. There is no doubt. Obviously, we were
fortunate, but I don't think we were a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think the Frogs can repeat last year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, No. 1, it's year two instead of year one. It's somewhat
easier than year one. I don't mean to sound like anything is easy.
But players know the system, coaches know the players and the
players know the coaches. I think that puts us a little ahead right
there. We have a good nucleus of people returning who have played
and we have some people who have a chance to step into some of the
positions who were vacated to make up for what we lost. We are a
stronger, more physical team. I know we are going to have 10
400-pound benchers on the offensive line. I think we had three last
year. I know we are going to be more physically prepared to handle
the season than we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you envision this program being at the end of this
season?
</P>
<P>
   A: My goal is that if we don't win the conference we go right
down to the end in the conference race. Did we put together another
winning season? I feel like we need to do that to reinforce to our
fans that it is OK to make an emotional commitment to TCU, that we
are for real.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your plan to return TCU to national prominence?
</P>
<P>
   A: I hope that we are going to be a team that is consistently
competitive at the top level of our conference and puts together a
string of winning seasons and continues to play the USCs and the
Arizonas of the world which are teams that have national
prominence. Beating USC, people can call that a fluke or whatever
but if we continue to do that then we are going to have to be
recognized. I think building facilities and doing the things we are
with television is going to put our program out there for people to
see, and when we bring recruits on campus they are going to see a
bigger commitment than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   They are going to see first-class facilities. They are going to
see a program with a vision and direction all the way from the top
and it takes all of those kinds of things to be able to take TCU
back to that level. And we had years and years and years where we
didn't maybe have that the way we have it now. I'd like to think
that now that we have it, it will all fall in place really quickly.
But I also know that we're one year removed from being 1-10 so
there are going to be some peaks and valleys along this course.
It's not going to be all climbing up the mountain. I hope it is,
but I know it may not be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you feel fortunate about your Sun Bowl berth because
politics played such a big role?
</P>
<P>
   A: You bet. First off, there is no way you can go into the first
year with a 1-10 football team and think, ``Gosh, we're going to a
bowl.'' We just wanted to win some games and get the ship turned in
the right direction. And then to be 6-5 and for the Big Ten to come
up short on bowl teams and the WAC breakup to become a blessing to
us. There had to be a lot of things fall the right way. We were
fortunate, but we were prepared. But when the opportunity to get
into a bowl came about we aggressively pursued that opportunity,
sold ourselves to the right people and were fortunate that things
fell the right way and then we made the best of that game.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who do you think is going to be the biggest surprise on the
team this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jason Goss because I think he's a real good player and not a
lot of people know how good he is. Another guy that I think could
fit into that would be Lavar Veale. Both of those kids had great
summers, worked hard. LaVar did play last year, but I think LaVar
and Jason who people will be a little bit surprised about where
they came from.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see yourself in five years? Do you see yourself
at TCU, and if so, for how long?
</P>
<P>
   A: I see myself at TCU, right here in Fort Worth. If things
continue to go the way they have been, and I know they can't always
be up years and great years, but yeah I can stay here a long time.
I like the city. The commitment of the university is strong. The
facilities we are building are exciting to me. I have to have those
kinds of things going on. I can't just be status quo. I've got to
see that the university and the athletic department and the
football program is always trying to improve itself, trying to
always be better, trying to be the best. As long as we're doing
that, I'm going to be excited about being here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you got your raise in the offseason what was the first
thing you went out and bought?
</P>
<P>
   A: I didn't really buy anything. We did decide to go to Hawaii
for spring break, but we were going to something like that. ... I
mean I was appreciative of the raise, but I only need certain
things in my life. It probably made it better for Kim and the girls
than for me. I don't think we made a lot of changes afterwards. I
grew up poor, and I don't really need a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is your relationship with Horned Frogs basketball coach
Billy Tubbs?
</P>
<P>
   A: Billy and I played golf together. We both vacationed in
Shangri-La, a golf resort in Oklahoma, for about four or five days.
We played golf together every day. Billy and I are about even. I
don't think either one of us got much (money) from the other one.
As I'm sure you can imagine, it was a highly competitive match, but
it was very enjoyable. I think he might have put a couple of
comments on me about my contract. He had me buy lunch one time. I
think he said something about I could afford it or something. But
we have a good relationship. We have a lot of fun, a lot of laughs.
Billy's fun to be around. I mean in some ways we don't see each
other a whole lot. Our seasons are so different, our recruiting
times are so different.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would be the ideal golf foursome?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'd probably like to play with Bill Parcells, Lou Holtz and
Gary Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why Barnett? Is it because you see similarities between
Northwestern's turnaround and TCU's turnaround?
</P>
<P>
   A: We're both purple and black. Sure there are similarities. I'd
like to think that maybe I can get this on a little bit more of an
even keel than Gary was able to. He had the two great years and
then dropped back down. But yeah, there are similarities and the
fact that it seems like every time a job comes open it seems like
Gary Barnett and me whether I want it to or not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where do you see college football headed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I like the aspect that parity has become much better in
college football. Obviously, there are some schools that are
tradition rich and always will be up there. But it's become more
and more reliable on good coaching, good planning, good vision and
good recruiting. So I like that. We're closer to TCU beating USC or
whatever it may be than I think we were in a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   The thing I don't like is the way that certain people seem to
have control over the entire sport as far as the universities are
concerned and that there is a definite greed factor. You take all
the money from the NCAA Tournament in basketball and disperse it
among all the Division I playing teams but yet in college football
we don't do that. So we've kind of drawn a line where the rich are
trying to get richer instead of trying to bring parity further into
college football.

TYSON BETTER OFF GOING AFTER BUTTERBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ They're both circus acts now, so why shouldn't somebody
just match Butterbean with Not-Quite-Iron Mike Tyson and get it
over with?
</P>
<P>
   If promoters are truly going to go through with putting the
former heavyweight champion in with diabetic coma victim Buster
Douglas Oct. 2, why not skip that sporting misdemeanor and go right
to a felony? At least that is the way cult hero and four-round box
office sensation Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch sees things, and he's
probably onto something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike can only fight four rounds anyway,'' Butterbean bellowed
recently. ``He can't fight after that, so we definitely should
fight. I've gotten better and he's gotten worse. My last fight,
George Foreman even said, `Butterbean better be careful because
he's sneaking up on some talent.'
</P>
<P>
   ``People would love to see me and Mike fight. I think I'd knock
him out. I know I can handle him. It would be a short fight one way
or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   That in itself would be merciful and it would likely rid boxing
of at least one of its growing number of sideshows, which is reason
enough to call for the making of the match over something like a
ritual execution of one of Tyson's former slayers.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Tyson was considered as legitimate a
heavyweight as there was. He was spoken of with awe and respect and
it was theorized that once he retired he'd take the express train
to the International Boxing Hall of Fame. But life has always been
more difficult for Tyson to manage than a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hopping that express train to the Hall, he ended up
in a green van to hell. Twice he got off in a prison cell, and
those experiences have left him overweight, overwrought,
overextended, and overly concerned about his next opponent. If the
stories in circulation are to be believed, Tyson still carries too
much weight, too many doubts, and too little cash, a condition that
has reduced him to worrying about facing the likes of German Axel
Shulz, Croatian Zeljko Mavrovic, or mini-heavyweight Orlin Norris
in his latest comeback.
</P>
<P>
   That comeback has been delayed twice already since his release
from prison earlier this year and now is scheduled for Oct. 2 in
Las Vegas. Suffice it to say it won't be an October classic.
</P>
<P>
   Had Douglas been knocked into a coma inside a boxing ring, he
would have been banned from the sport long ago, but because it
resulted from family history and obesity, the fact that Douglas
nearly died several years ago after slipping into unconsciousness
has been artfully ignored by boxing officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as a longtime fight trainer said, ``What's the difference?
A coma's a coma. You're either here with us or you ain't, and if
you ain't, you ain't fighting again.''
</P>
<P>
   That apparently is not the case with Douglas, who has been
knocked out since his comeback by lightly-regarded Lou Savarese and
not-even-lightly-regarded Louis Monaco. In his first-round loss to
Savarese, Douglas looked like an old, old man who can no longer
take a punch, yet he has launched another comeback in which he has
several wins against guys Butterbean would not have struggled with
and now is the Tyson people's choice as First Victim.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson may have good reason to worry about Shulz, Mavrovic,
Norris, or any other legitimate heavyweight who can box a little
and has a fighter's heart, but putting him in with Douglas is a
criminal act. While it's true that Tyson is a shadow of what he was
the night he destroyed Michael Spinks in 91 seconds more than a
decade ago, he can still punch like a mule and now he will face a
man who apparently can't take the punch of a fly(weight), to which
the people in boxing respond, ``Good match!''
</P>
<P>
   But in Tyson's near-loss to Frans Botha, Showtime officials
found out that he has slipped terribly not only in the ring but
also at the box office. His pay-per-view numbers proved that. Even
though he remains one of boxing's most compelling figures, Tyson is
no longer considered a great fighter by most ring insiders and is
looked upon by much of the paying public as merely an accident
waiting to happen. These days people watch Tyson for the same
reason they watch NASCAR: They don't want to miss the crash.
</P>
<P>
   If Douglas is tottering in front of him on Oct. 2, there surely
will be one, but it won't be Tyson falling this time. It will be an
overweight and badly slowed Douglas who tumbles to the floor like a
felled Douglas fir the first time he gets hit. Douglas no longer
should be in a ring with legitimate heavyweights because he cannot
take a punch and therefore is in more danger than is acceptable
even in a sport in which death from combat is accepted as a risk of
the trade.
</P>
<P>
   In a fighter with a big punch, speed, reflexes, nerve, legs, and
stamina all go before his power disappears, so Tyson will remain
dangerous _ as Botha found out the hard way after winning every
round until he ran into one punch halfway through an apparently
easy fight and was counted waaayyy out.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Tyson will hit Douglas one time in the face and the
sound of chimes will go off in his head.
</P>
<P>
   The same would likely happen to Butterbean, but at least he is
of sound mind and body. He has fought no one in 47 matches but is
45-1-1 with 33 knockouts, and has made nearly $1 million in purses
and more from public appearances where fans flock to his sides (and
there are many sides of him).
</P>
<P>
   Would it be a great boxing match? No.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be great for the sport? A thousand times no.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be great theater? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be a great fight? Sadly, these days it might be.
</P>
<P>
   Would it sell? Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be better than the fistic mugging of a dangerously
impaired Buster Douglas? Most definitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pure boxing is boring,'' Butterbean argued. ``People want to
see a fight, not two guys hugging. Look at Holyfield-Lewis. That
was embarrassing with all the hugging and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who work hard and struggle to make $50 to get these
pay-per-view cards, that can be a day's pay. They deserve their
money's worth. They don't want pure boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   If some promoter gets away with a Douglas-Tyson match, they
won't get pure boxing either. What they'll get is what they've been
asking for all along _ a brutal mugging and, just maybe, a terrible
accident.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although it has yet to be announced, all issues in the Lennox
Lewis-Evander Holyfield rematch seem to have been settled, and a
Nov. 13 bout at the Thomas and Mack Center rather than Mandalay
Bay's smaller arena will happen. HBO has agreed to a contract and
sent it to Don King. The fighters are satisfied. Now King and rival
promoter Panos Eliades, who handles Lewis's affairs, appear to have
ironed out their $1.9 million dispute over how to distribute the
overage from the first fight. King will order TVKO to release $1
million to Eliades and has restructured the rematch deal to give
Lewis a bigger cut of the British TV money and a larger percentage
of any overage . . . International Boxing Federation welterweight
champion Felix Trinidad has hung a rubber chicken at the top of his
double-end bag with the label, ``Pollo De La Hoya'' (``Chicken De
La Hoya''). While De La Hoya trains in solitude in the mountains
around Big Bear Lake, Calif., Trinidad is moving around various
Wyndham hotel properties in Puerto Rico and being paid to conduct
public workouts . . . De La Hoya has begun singing lessons after
signing a record deal with EMI Latin Records to pursue a career
that was launched last year on ``Cristina,'' the Univision TV
version of ``Oprah'' . . . After a lackluster performance in
defeating Aldo Rios, World Boxing Council lightweight champion
Steve Johnston abandoned his familiar Denver training base and
agreed to work in Las Vegas with veteran trainer Miguel Diaz for
Saturday's title defense against Angel Manfredy at Foxwoods.
Against Rios, Johnston looked like a shadow of the fighter he used
to be, and Diaz blamed much of it on his fighter's refusal to train
in Las Vegas. Johnston normally stays in his hometown, where he has
difficulty finding top sparring partners. For the Rios fight, Diaz
said, he sparred with light heavyweights. ``That's why he was
always two steps behind,'' said Diaz. ``If he wants to beat
Manfredy, he better come here to train.'' . . . Light heavyweight
champion Roy Jones Jr. has again tabled the possibility of moving
up to the heavyweight division and will fight WBC ``interim
champion'' Gianfranco Rocchigiani Nov. 6. That fight had been
penciled in for Germany but now appears headed to London, with a
same-day tape delay being shown on a special edition of HBO's
``Boxing After Dark'' . . . Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, has
already set a date for De La Hoya's junior middleweight debut, Dec.
11 at the new Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, assuming he
survives the Trinidad fight. He is expected to face WBC champion
Javier Castillejo of Spain, win another title, and thus set up a
unification fight early next year against World Boxing Association
champion David Reid, a battle of Olympic Golden Boys that would
kill two birds with one stone for De La Hoya. It would, if he
wants, also leave rival Fernando Vargas without a big-money
opponent except him. He could then refuse to fight Vargas if he
wants and put him on financial ice . . . Reid (13-0) defends his
title vs. ex-WBC champion Keith Mullings at the Hard Rock Cafe
Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas Aug. 28. That's a first for the Hard
Rock and a tough test for Reid, who has found himself on the canvas
in each of his last three fights without registering a knockdown. A
Reid showdown with 1996 Olympic teammate and IBF champion Vargas
has been sped up in part because of Reid's lackluster performances
of late and could come early next year.

   World Boxing Organization featherweight champion Prince Naseem
Hamed claimed in Kuala Lumpur that former WBC titleholder Lusito
Espinosa refused to fight him five times and that he can't disagree
with that. ``I don't blame him,'' Hamed said. ``I don't want to
fight with me either.'' Hamed flew to Malaysia from London for a
one-day promotion. Hamed is 32-0 with 29 KOs and is next scheduled
to fight WBC champion Cesar Soto Oct. 22 (the night before the
World Series opens), possibly at the Arthur Ashe Tennis Center in
Flushing, N.Y. That fight nearly fell through after Arum, Soto's
promoter, had heated conversations in Paris and London with Riath
Hamed, the fighter's brother and manager, last month. The story is
that Arum mentioned something about the West Bank and Hamed, who is
Lebanese, said, ``You mean in Palestine?'' Arum snapped back, ``No,
I mean in Israel.'' End of conversation. Later, Arum called Hamed's
brother ``a giant pain in the ass'' and said, ``We've met a lot of
weirdos in boxing over the years but nothing like we encountered
over there. If there are worse people in the world, please show
them to me.'' Arum went on to say he would no longer negotiate with
him directly. Hamed's brother was equally angry but has been
counseled that thin skin is not an asset in boxing . . . WBO light
heavyweight champion Darius Michalczewski defends his title Aug. 28
vs. champion-for-a-minute Montell Griffin in Bremen, Germany.
Griffin is a late replacement for David Telesco. Michalczewski is
40-0 and has made 15 successful title defenses . . . Several
sponsors of the comeback fight card of Tony Ayala Jr. in San
Antonio Aug. 20 pulled out after Ayala called local hero Jesse
Leija ``a coward'' and claimed he quit in his 1995 loss to De La
Hoya. Fact of the matter is, the overmatched Leija may have done
that but he also is one of the most popular athletes in San
Antonio, a brave fighter who twice defeated Azumah Nelson, beat
four world champions, and held several world titles while Ayala was
serving 16 years in a New Jersey prison for aggravated sexual
assault. Ayala did not want Leija connected with his comeback fight
because years ago Leija fired Ayala's father, who was training him.
Said promoter Lester Bedford, ``It was like a guy from the NBA
going to prison for 16 years, getting out and ripping David
Robinson and Tim Duncan.'' Bedford called Ayala's comments a ``PR
nightmare.'' Ayala (22-0, 19 KOs) returns anyway vs. Manuel Esparza
(19-4-1, 5 KOs) on a pay-per-view show of Bedford's creation . . .
Former middleweight and junior middleweight champion James Toney
looked as fit as he has in three years in stopping Adolpho
Washington in the 10th round to push his record to 56-4-2. Although
he fought at the cruiserweight limit, Toney still hopes to return
to 175 pounds and force a rematch with Jones, who defeated him
handily in the biggest fight of his career. ``That fight still
haunts James,'' trainer Freddie Roach insisted.

COOPERSTOWN QUANDARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Wade Boggs in a Yankees cap in
Cooperstown? Or a Devil Rays cap?
</P>
<P>
   Sure sounds that way.
</P>
<P>
   It's a new, somewhat fabricated controversy, this Hall of Fame
cap deal. It's the residue of free agency. In the old days, fans
knew that Ty Cobb was a Tiger and that Lou Gehrig was a Yankee.
Sure, the Babe played for three teams, but there was no doubt he'd
be a Yankee in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs had three hits against the Indians Saturday &UR;  &LR; night,
hitting a two-run home run in the sixth inning off Chris Haney for
his 3,000th career hit and assuring his place in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of modern, multi-team players, he'll have to choose a
cap when Cooperstown calls. Frank Robinson was MVP in both leagues
and played for five teams, but went to the Hall as an Oriole
(perhaps agitated with the O's, Frank wore a Reds hat when he
joined 30 Hall of Famers to honor Ted Williams at Fenway last
month). Nolan Ryan, inducted July 25, was enshired as a Ranger even
though he also pitched for the Mets, Angels, and Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Boston doesn't sound high on Wade's list, even though Boggs
rapped 2,098 hits for the Sox, including a lifetime Fenway average
of .369, and seven straight Sox seasons of 200 or more hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I make it, I'll weigh all the possibilities,'' said Boggs.
``Not just my performance in the city. I'll talk about it with my
family. What matters is how a city treats you. The response you get
when you go back to a city. What people have forgotten and what
people remember. I'll take all those scenarios and weigh 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. All of the above sounds bad for the Hub. Boston has not
been kind to Wade since he left. He gets the Parcells-Clemens
treatment when he's announced in Fenway. And there's no golden glow
when he speaks of his long career in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters gathered around his locker Saturday and asked him
about his streak of 200-hit seasons in Boston, the Chicken Man
snapped, ``No one wrote anything except (one curley-haired guy who
shall remain nameless) and it was all bad. It was like landing on
the moon and no one knows about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why this (3,000 hit chase) is special. I finally have
meaning in my career. I'm doing something that means somthing. It's
finally something they can write on my final resting place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives my career substance. Before, they could say, `Oh
yeah, he made some All-Star Games. Oh yeah, he won some batting
titles. Oh yeah, he won a couple of Gold Gloves.' But now it's
like, `Wow, this guy got 3,000 hits!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton Fisk and Roger Clemens are another pair of future Hall
of Famers who had their best years with the Sox. Like Boggs, both
left Boston spitting nails.
</P>
<P>
   Fisk's anitpathy for Haywood Sullivan was obvious and the big
catcher vowed that he'd shun the Sox if Cooperstown ever beckoned.
All that may have changed because Fisk went to work for the
despicable Jerry Reinsdorf and came away from Comiskey more bitter
than ever. The Sox have undergone a total front-office
housecleaning since Fisk left town and he took a ceremonial job
under Dan Duquette last spring. Look for him to go into the Hall as
a Red Sox next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is another matter. Like Boggs, he did his best work in
Boston. Sure, he had two Cy Young seasons with the Blue Jays and he
may still win a ring (as Boggs did) with the Yankees, but the
Rocket won 192 games in 13 seasons with the Red Sox, tying Cy Young
for most franchise wins. It's hard to believe Clemens could want a
Blue Jay cap on his plaque. And his Yankee experience may yet prove
unpleasant. He'll face the same dilemma that awaits Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   What about it, Wade? Your list of criteria sounds bad for New
England. Is Boston ruled out?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's ruled out,'' said Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not true,'' said a Florida reporter. ``His dad told me it'll
be the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade played five seasons with New York, hit .300 four times, and
won his only World Series championship. But there were hard
feelings there, too. Boggs's dad, Win, told the Tampa Tribune,
``This Gwynn guy snuck right up on him and 3,000. It's New York's
fault. Joe Torre could have played Wade every day. Wade says it
don't matter to him, but I don't need no Tony Gwynn getting there
first. We worked too hard to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn got there Friday night. Wade did it Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
Sometime in the next century we'll wait again when he reveals which
team he'll represent in Cooperstown.

NUMBERS DON'T GIVE ACCURATE MEASURE OF GWYNN 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When Tony Gwynn worked out for the first time
in Yankee Stadium last October in preparation for Game 1 of the
World Series, he said there was just one place left where he wanted
to play: Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the man that despite a strained left calf
that made him unavailable in the All-Star Game, Gwynn still flew
across the country to be in Boston, take some balls off the
Monster, and be present for perhaps the sport's finest moment this
summer, steadying Ted Williams as he threw out the ceremonial first
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was the only player whose name appeared in the premiere
edition of Talk Magazine, on its list of 50 people who elevate the
quality of discourse in this country. He is beloved in San Diego,
where his alma mater, San Diego State, named its baseball field
after Gwynn, the man who donated the money to build it. And despite
the inane comments by former teammate Jim Leyritz, who dared
suggest that Gwynn does not have some of the intangibles present in
other greats with whom Leyritz has played, the newest member of the
3,000-hit club is beyond being smeared in a game he has made richer
by his mere presence for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old Gwynn, who could have made far more money had he
chosen to leave San Diego, collected his 3,000th hit (and three
more) Friday night in Montreal on the 64th birthday of his mother,
Vendella. His 2,000th hit also came on Mom's birthday six years
ago, a bit of sweet serendipity from a man who once called his
greatest thrill in baseball the division-clinching hit collected by
his younger brother Chris.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight, of course, would have been far greater if Gwynn,
who had five hits in four games in St. Louis, had collected No.
3,000 on the same night that Mark McGwire hit his 500th home run.
But in some ways it was fitting that Gwynn, who has played so much
of his 18-year career far from the madding crowd, achieved his feat
before a sparse gathering in Montreal, in a fashion that was so
much like him _ a two-strike liner over second base on a tough
down-and-in curveball.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the TV cameras didn't see, a scene described by Tom
Krasovic in the San Diego Union-Tribune: The best hitter of our
generation, on his knees in the tunnel leading to the clubhouse,
sobbing while thinking of his late father, Larry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the tunnel, I did, I really did,'' Gwynn told Krasovic.
``Because all week I kept hearing his voice. `You can get 3,000,'
and my voice is laughing in the background because I'm saying, `I
just got started.' ''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem possible, but the level of sniping that has gone
on in Anaheim almost makes Mo Vaughn's fights with the Joint Chiefs
of Staff in Boston look good-natured by comparison. Virtually every
player of note has weighed in about the cause of the Angels' woes
(example: Darin Erstad called his teammates ``soft''), GM Bill
Bavasi was faced with a mini-revolt after extending the contract of
manager Terry Collins and reportedly has barely talked to Vaughn in
a month, and both Collins and Angels president Tony Tavares have
ripped the team in the last week. Any wonder, then, that Vaughn,
who is out with a staph infection, pointedly dodged the visiting
Boston media this weekend? Vaughn, asked about the Angels trading
Randy Velarde, arguably their most consistent player, said: ``I'm
not getting into this. My opinion doesn't matter. I'm not getting
into a situation here like I did (in Boston). Everybody just needs
to shut up and do their job, play the game first, that's the bottom
line. It doesn't matter what we like or dislike. We all know it's
been a tough season. What we have to do now is work toward the
first day of spring training. Do your job. Stop blaming other
people.'' But don't for a minute believe the Angels' brass believe
they made a mistake with Vaughn. They'll remind anyone who asks
that Vaughn has five more years on his contract to deliver the
impact presence they expected when they signed him to an $80
million deal last winter . . . There's poignancy in the news that
Joe DiMaggio Jr., who was estranged from his famous father to the
end but was a pallbearer at Joe D's funeral, died Friday night at
age 57 of what was reported to be natural causes . . . In the midst
of the A's surprising run at a wild-card spot, Oakland players are
demanding that erratic pitcher Jimmy Haynes step up and be a major
contributor. Jason Giambi threw down the gauntlet after Haynes was
lit up for seven runs in 4 2/3 innings against the Orioles. ``Jimmy
has no business pitching like he did today,'' Giambi said. ``I
don't know if he doesn't understand it, but his stuff is as good as
Kevin Appier, or Omar Olivares, or Tim Hudson. I don't know why he
struggles the way he does. Maybe that's something you need to ask
Jimmy Haynes _ why he can't make the transformation, why he isn't
dominating; he should be unhittable. He could very easily be our
ace. He could very easily win 15 games. You can't motivate him or
talk to him. It's just . . . the day Jimmy Haynes decides he'll be
unhittable, that's the day it'll happen.'' . . . The A's moved 12
players in three deals before the trading deadline, but the player
happiest about not packing his bags may have been Tony Phillips,
who planted a kiss on GM Billy Beane when he came to the ballpark
the day after the deadline. ``I feel like a kid with a brand new
red bike on Christmas,'' said Phillips, who has played six
positions for the A's this season and whose leadership becomes even
more vital now that Rock Raines has been diagnosed with lupus and
will miss the rest of the season. ``I can play this game a little
bit,'' Phillips said. ``Just a little. The year hasn't gone like
I've wanted, but it's not over yet. There's a long way to go.'' The
A's haven't been as high as second place this late in a season
since they won the AL West in 1992, but the East Bay isn't buying
into a title race just yet, judging by the 11,267 who showed up for
Friday night's 9-1 win over the White Sox, which gave Oakland a
major league-best 38-17 record at home.

   You can't tell by Jeff Fassero, who gave up first-inning home
runs to Chuck Knoblauch, Bernie Williams, and Paul O'Neill of the
Yankees and later was also taken deep by Scott Brosius, but
Seattle's Safeco Field appears to be a boon to the much-maligned
Mariners pitching staff, especially in comparison to the Kingdome.
``It's a beautiful field, and I think it's more fair than the other
field,'' M's pitching coach Stan Williams said. ``The other field
was a terror for pitching. The infield was lightning-fast, the
fences were short, and the ball carried. The biggest asset over
there for pitchers was the mound. They could throw, and hide behind
it.'' . . . After using Tom Davey, the pitcher they got in the
David Segui deal, the Mariners have now used 25 pitchers, tying
their club record set in 1996. Davey became the 13th rookie to
pitch for the M's, and there are still two months left in the
season . . . Rangers All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez, who went on a
.487 tear right after the break, said he now accepts an occasional
day off from manager Johnny Oates. ``I was mad every time Johnny
Oates sat me down in the first half,'' Rodriguez said. ``But now I
understand. I'm thankful for getting little breaks. Now, I feel
healthy and strong.'' Rodriguez often has worn down in the broiling
Texas sun in August. ``Keeping him fresh is our goal,'' Oates said.
``I'm not sure how much rest he's going to get right now, though.
It's been a while since I've seen somebody in a groove at the plate
like he is now.'' . . . Newton native Jim Corsi finally got back to
the majors when the Orioles traded Juan Guzman to the Reds and
promoted him from Triple A Rochester . . . Tampa Bay GM Chuck LaMar
is sensitive about his reputation for not pulling a trigger on a
deal. There was considerable interest in Devil Rays closer Roberto
Hernandez, starter Rolando Arrojo, and first baseman Fred McGriff,
but the Devil Rays held onto all of them. ``For anybody, any
national press, any local press, anybody that thinks the lack of
trades is a lack of aggressiveness or a lack of preparation or a
lack of being able to pull the trigger to make a trade, I think is
asinine,'' LaMar said. ``It's either a reflection that they want to
dwell on the negative for whatever reason or they truly don't
appreciate the position we're in this year.''

   Another example of why St. Louis fans are often considered the
best in baseball came last week, when a sellout crowd at Busch
Stadium gave repeated ovations to Gwynn during his quest for 3,000
hits, including a standing ovation after his grand slam. Rick
Hummel of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, who has covered the
Cardinals for 28 years, said he has never seen a visiting player
receive a better reception. Cardinals manager Tony La Russa, asked
if he resented the red-carpet treatment for Gwynn, said, ``Hell,
no. I'm clapping for him. You have to have a certain lack of sense
to not appreciate what's happening with the greatest hitter of our
generation.'' . . . Besides staging a terrific race in the NL West,
the Giants and Diamondbacks are developing what appears to be a
genuine dislike for each other. In April, D-Backs pitcher Todd
Stottlemyre brawled with Giants third baseman Charlie Hayes. Then
last week, Arizona manager Buck Showalter set off the Giants when
he suggested the Sons of Dusty Baker were ``tooting their horns''
about winning despite injuries. ``Our guys have been playing with
bumps and bruises all year,'' Showalter said. ``Quite frankly, to
hear some of the stuff about other people's problems, I don't want
to hear it. I'm proud of our guys. They just don't go around
tooting their horns about how tough they are.'' Baker, already
annoyed because the D-Backs had made some late lineup changes,
fired back. ``I'm tired of him talking, to tell you the truth,''
Baker said. Giants second baseman Jeff Kent went further: ``Buck's
crying. Buck talks too much. Tell Buck to manage a team that
doesn't have a $100 million payroll and then come and cry about
injuries.'' The Diamondbacks signed $118.9 million worth of free
agents last winter . . . The Cubs looked to get younger by trading
36-year-old lefthander Terry Mulholland and 30-year-old shortstop
Jose Hernandez to the Braves last weekend for 24-year-old lefty
Micah Bowie and 20-year-old righthander Ruben Quevedo. They also
called up 24-year-old Jose Nieves to play shortstop every day.
``When you're in the hunt, you invest in major league players. When
you're out of of the hunt, you divest major league players for
young players and that's what we've done,'' general manager Ed
Lynch said. ``I think the message is that the price of starting
pitching is such that if you have a chance to acquire guys of this
caliber, you have to do it. The bottom line is that we've acquired
two pitchers. We're trying to restock our organization with
pitchers, who in the past when we were in contention, I've dealt
away to try to improve the club.'' The trades didn't pay off
immediately for the Braves. Mulholland, who will replace Bruce Chen
in the Atlanta rotation, gave up a three-run home run to Brian
Giles in his first appearance, while Hernandez, auditioned in the
Braves' leadoff spot, went 0 for 4, striking out twice and hitting
into two double plays . . . Kerry Wood, the Cubs phenom who has
missed all of this season after undergoing tendon-transfer surgery
on his right elbow, recently played catch at Wrigley Field, the
first time he's thrown since his April surgery. ``I haven't had any
pain since the first day after surgery,'' he said. ``Everything
feels good. I'll be excited when I'm able to throw off the mound
and don't have any pain. That's going to be my biggest step. My
goal is to be pitching for the Cubs next season.''

   Steve Avery, who was paid $8.75 million to win 16 games over two
seasons with the Sox, cost the Reds $2.4 million this year for the
six wins he collected before going out with season-ending shoulder
surgery. Avery's base salary was $500,000. But he earned another
$900,000 in performance buyouts, and he has a $1 million buyout,
which the Reds will have to exercise unless they pick up his $3
million option for next season, which isn't likely . . . Outfielder
Darryl Hamilton, traded to the Mets by the Rockies last weekend,
took some shots at his former club. ``Obviously, when you get in a
situation where you lose so much, you look for changes,'' Hamilton
said while the Mets were in Milwaukee last week. ``That team is not
fundamentally sound. I think the Brewers have a better team
baseballwise than the Rockies. I don't think anybody on the Rockies
team goes out saying, `We're going to lose.' But I think a lot of
guys go out there and say, `I've got to get two or three hits, or a
home run or a RBI or whatever,' and forget about the big picture.''
. . . Despite a club-record 13 players on the DL, Pirates GM Cam
Bonifay has set a goal of finishing with a winning record, which
would be a first for Pittsburgh since it won the last of three
straight division titles in 1992 . . . In the spring of '98, Darren
Bragg was the base runner in the rundown drill in which Jeff Frye
of the Sox tore the ACL in his left knee, when he tried to react to
Bragg's feint and his spikes caught in the dirt. On Monday night,
while trying to avoid a collision in the outfield with Cardinals
rookie J.D. Drew, Bragg tore the ACL in his right knee and, like
Frye a year ago, will require reconstructive surgery. Bragg said he
hopes to be ready for spring training. Frye had another operation
this spring and has barely played in two seasons. ``It's not
good,'' Bragg said. ``But when you're handed something like this,
you just have to overcome it and work hard to get back. There's
nothing you can do about it. It's done. And you try to take a step
forward.'' . . . Marlins outfielder Preston Wilson, who was leading
all rookies with 19 home runs, has a big booster in teammate Cliff
Floyd. ``Of all the guys I've played with, I think he's got the
most power,'' Floyd said. ``And I've played with Larry Walker,
Moises Alou, Bobby Bo (Bonilla), Sheff (Gary Sheffield). He has
more power than all those guys. Call me crazy. I know he hasn't
produced numbers like them yet. But give him time. He will.''

   The Phillies' failure to make a deal before the trading deadline
while both the Mets and Braves were active didn't set well with
staff ace Curt Schilling, the pitcher the Phils refuse to move.
``I'm incredibly disappointed,'' said Schilling, unhappy not
because he was still in Philadelphia, but because the Phils failed
to upgrade what he considers a contender. Back in May, Schilling
had said that if the Phils were in contention and didn't make a
move, he wanted out. Meanwhile, Phillies GM Ed Wade, who tried to
make a deal but couldn't find a match he liked, is looking
long-term and thinking of ways to tie up the talented nucleus of a
team that could be a winner for some time to come: third baseman
Scott Rolen, right fielder Bobby Abreu, catcher Mike Lieberthal,
and center fielder Doug Glanville. Rolen is the youngest, at 24.
Glanville, who turns 29 later this month, is the oldest. ``Next to
winning a championship, it's the most important thing for us,''
Wade said. Lieberthal is making $2.2 million, is unsigned for next
year, and can become a free agent after the 2000 season. Abreu, who
is making $400,000, will be eligible for salary arbitration for the
first time this winter. He turned down $8.5 million for four years
last spring. Rolen and Glanville are signed through 2001.

THEY STAY _ NOT PLAY _ TOGETHER

 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ Some husbands and wives just don't belong in the
same golf pairing.
</P>
<P>
   They can be lovey-dovey off the course, raise a family, share
the harmony of Ozzie and Harriet, but put them in the same group
and they turn on each other and look like the litigants standing in
front of Judge Judy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they don't like each other. Fact is they try so
hard, nothing works.
</P>
<P>
   So when Denise Killeen made her move on the back nine Saturday,
her husband and veteran caddie, John, was elated. He smiled when he
saw the areaWEB.com Challenge leaderboard, with his wife's name on
it, but that's all he could do.
</P>
<P>
   You see, he wasn't carrying her clubs. He was on Beth Daniel's
bag.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't see his wife's blitz of five straight birdies,
something she hasn't done in several years. John was two groups
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beth and I saw her hit a skanky shot on No. 11,'' said John.
``We waved, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise salvaged a par on the 11th, then quickly found her
groove.
</P>
<P>
   Killeen's birdie barrage began on No. 12 with a 15-foot putt.
She followed with a 5-footer on 13 and a 20-footer on 14. Killeen
knocked down a 10-footer on No. 15 and canned a 6-footer for a 2 on
the par-3 16th ``to bring me back from nowhere into the hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Killeen, however, had to punch out of the woods on No. 17, made
bogey, and completed her round with a par to fashion a 2-under 70
for a total of 6-under 210 after three rounds, five strokes behind
leader Sherri Steinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, Killeen and Daniel were tied and could have been
paired in Sunday's final round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't have been awkward if we were paired together,''
said Killeen. ``John and I were in the same pairing at Youngstown
two years ago. John was carrying Dottie Pepper's bag. They shot a
64 and I was 2 under but it felt like I shot 80.''
</P>
<P>
   John and Denise Killeen met on the LPGA Tour. He has been a
caddie for 17 years and for seven years carried Patty Sheehan's
bag.
</P>
<P>
   Before John and Denise were married on Feb. 3, 1996, he was her
caddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for only a year,'' said Denise.
</P>
<P>
   And don't expect him to pick up her bag again.
</P>
<P>
   Will they talk about her round afterward? ``No, we don't talk
much about what I do on the course,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too tough to caddie for your wife,'' said John. ``You try
so hard for each other that sometimes it just doesn't work. Some
husbands do it. Foster Forbes does it for his wife (Cathy
Johnston-Forbes) and they both deserve a medal because it's
tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we leave the golf course, we are too busy playing with
our son Drew to talk about our golf game,'' said Denise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she asks anything, it might be what club did we hit on a
certain hole or something like that,'' said John, who normally
caddies for Meg Mallon, who took the week off to move. Since Denise
was coming to Pleasant Valley, John thought he would try to catch
on with another player. As luck would have it, Daniel needed
someone.
</P>
<P>
   And they are faring pretty well. Daniel carded a 3-under 69,
highlighted by an eagle chip-in on the par-5 11th, to finish just
three shots behind Sheinhauer.
</P>
<P>
   Killeen credits her good play to patience and advice from former
LPGA star Donna Caponi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't been playing well and I had a talk with Donna,'' she
said. ``I thought a lot about our talk today and things just
started to drop.''

 &HT;    Bush touts increases in Texas spending on education, child
welfare as compassionate
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In his bid for the presidency, Republican Gov.
George W. Bush touts increases in state spending on education and
child welfare as compassionate. He calls $3 billion in tax cuts
part of his conservative side.
</P>
<P>
   But as the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, the
question of whether Bush has balanced tax cuts and state spending
is being debated in Texas and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of limited government are critical of the
2000-2001 budget that Bush signed this year because it increases
state spending by 12.6 percent. Advocates for consumers and
low-income Texans complain that few people have felt the tax cuts
that have taken effect. For example, a $1 billion property tax cut
in 1997 was estimated to have saved the average family $140 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balancing act,'' said Albert Hawkins, Bush's budget
director. ``I don't know that anyone is ever 100 percent
satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Congress began debating tax cuts last month, one of
Bush's Republican opponents began challenging the governor's
tax-cutting boasts.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, who advocates a flat federal income tax rate of 17
percent, says Bush actually has proposed dozens of tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is trying to defend the indefensible (proposing
tax increases), by claiming to have passed dramatic tax cuts,''
Forbes said. ``That's simply not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes complains that in 1997, Bush first proposed increasing
business taxes to replace local school property taxes. He then
endorsed an alternative to expand the state sales tax. Eventually
he agreed to cut local property taxes by using $1 billion from
lower-than-expected state spending and increases in state income,
mostly attributed to the strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say increases in property appraisals and local tax rates
immediately consumed the intended savings.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins acknowledgesthat tax rates and property appraisals went
up. But he insists the tax cut was meaningful, especially for
homeowners 65 and older, who had their taxes cut and frozen, and
for owners of moderately valued homes, who saw a larger portion of
their homes exempted from taxation. Besides, he said, without the
Bush-backed cuts, state and local taxes would be higher.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said that left out renters, but Hawkins said many
renters benefited from rent discounts and property improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said Bush's willingness to raise any taxes undermines the
governor's tax-cutting claims.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker disagrees, pointing to
the end result as the proper test of Bush's tax-cutting
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for voters to know that the governor
signed tax cuts,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cuts, Texans still pay roughly 4.6 percent of their
income to state taxes, about the same as before Bush was elected in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said the tax cuts that have taken effect wouldn't change
the amount of state taxes paid because they were targeted at local
taxes. But even a measure of combined local and state tax burdens
probably shows little change because of increases by cities,
counties and other taxing entities, Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Focus on presidential issues
</P>
<P>
   As debate continues over his fiscal accomplishments in Texas,
Bush and his campaign staff are focusing on presidential issues.
</P>
<P>
   Without offering specific proposals, Bush says he supports
cutting federal taxes, including a reduced inheritance tax and
marriage penalty. He also has said he would offer $8 billion in new
tax incentives for charitable donations and would veto any increase
in corporate or personal income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   The pledges and record of tax-cut measures in Texas play well
with many voters, though some national polling shows strong support
for shoring up the Social Security and Medicare systems and
reducing the national debt before cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor last month said he supports a $792 billion tax-cut
package approved by the U.S. House. But he also has said that tax
cuts should come after Social Security, Medicare and national
defense needs are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   That and the growth of the state budget lead some people to
question Bush's commitment to limited government.
</P>
<P>
   The next two-year state budget, which begins Sept. 1, is 30
percent larger than the 1994-95 state budget, the last one over
which Democratic Gov. Ann Richards presided. Population growth over
that period is estimated to be about 1.4 million people, or 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000-2001 budget is about 13 percent higher than the 1998-99
budget, a slower growth rate than the nearly 20 percent increase
between the 1992-93 budget and Richards' last spending plan.
Population between those years grew by about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said factoring in population growth and inflation, state
spending has increased 3.7 percent under Bush's administration.
That proves the governor's ability to limit growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest challenge has been constraining your spending
decisions,'' Hawkins said. ``The state's not always been good at
that. Texas does not have a tradition of cutting taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins said the slower budget growth has come as the state has
poured money into education, children's health and child protective
services. He said better school test scores, reductions in welfare
rolls and improvements in other social indicators prove the state
is meeting basic needs.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about inadequate services come from those who support
more government spending, Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Wes Clarke, an assistant professor of public administration at
the University of North Texas, agreed the state is doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most scholars rate progressivity and regressivity. The Texas
sales tax system has become a little more progressive under
Governor Bush,'' Clarke said, noting that the sales tax, which
takes a greater percentage of money from low-income families, has
been eliminated for over-the-counter medicines and some clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that most people are probably slightly better off,
though maybe not perceptibly so, but certainly no worse,'' Clarke
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Kennedy, a senior analyst for the Texas Taxpayers and
Research Association, a business group, said he believes Bush
policies have helped and Texans clearly are better off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've produced growing surpluses without tax increases and
have had significant tax cuts in the last two sessions,'' Kennedy
said. `` I would think that one would be hard-pressed to say that
we haven't done well.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie James, head of Consumers Union Southwest Regional Office,
said the problem with doing well under the Bush administration is
that everyone hasn't benefited from the economic boom, which James
attributes to global forces, not Bush policies.
</P>
<P>
   James and others say Bush has put some money and attention on
education and human services. But the money and attention haven't
been enough and have come at the same time that Bush has put too
much focus on tax cuts, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a (budget) shortfall, and the policymakers
know that,'' James said. ``They are living in the present and not
thinking about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins and Tucker said more spending, not tax cuts, poses the
real threat of budget shortfalls because once money is spent to
expand or create programs, it must continue to be spent in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But James and others, including Dick Lavine of the Center for
Public Policy Priorities, a nonprofit advocacy group for low-income
Texans that's backed by private foundations, insist the tax cuts
cost too much.
</P>
<P>
   For example, business and sales tax cuts approved this year will
reduce state income by about $500 million in 2000 and 2001, when
the two-year state budget will be $98.1billion. The cuts will cost
$564 million in 2004 alone, according to the state's nonpartisan
Legislative Budget Board.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of revenue comes while the state's population grows and
demand for services balloons, James and Lavine say.
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins and tax-cut advocates, including Peggy Venable of Texas
Citizens for a Sound Economy, a limited-government advocacy group,
say the tax cuts won't cost as much when increases in jobs and
consumer spending are factored in because those jobs and spending
will add to state income.
</P>
<P>
   Venable said any tax cuts are positive for everyone because they
stimulate the economy. But she acknowledged that the 1997 tax cuts
didn't put money into most Texans pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that school districts were probably going to raise
local school taxes even higher so I'm not sure that savings wasn't
realized. Perhaps it was in a lower percentage of increase in local
school taxes,'' she said.

   IOWA-BIKE _ IOWA CITY, Iowa _ After spending seven days riding a
bicycle 550 miles through 61 small towns, we take a look at the
folks who are deciding the fate of the presidential candidates. For
months hey have been part of an intensive campaign which for some
candidates could come to end on Aug. 14 during the Ames, Iowa straw
ballot. This event has become so important that George Bush paid
$46,000 to rent the best piece of lawn outside the hall where the
voting takes place. Candidates may love Floridians for their cash
but it's Iowa's small town voters who may stop some of them from
ever getting their campaigns to Florida. (Crowley, Palm Beach

   BUSH-AFFIRM _ When Texas Gov. George W. Bush speaks of his views
on affirmative action, opponents and supporters of the concept
applaud roundly. It seems as if Bush and his ``affirmative access''
stand have been able to strike a middle ground in a divisive fight.
But what does it mean, and what is his record in Texas? Here is a
look at the issue as he prepares to address the National Urban
League convention in Houston this week, where affirmative action
will be a topic of interest. (Brooks, Austin American-Statesman).

   BUSH-TAXES _ Gov. George W. Bush takes credit for the two
biggest tax cuts in Texas history. And in terms of over-all
dollars, he's right. But how do those cuts look when you show the
percentage? And does the picture change when the total tax load is
taken into account? Plus, some criticize the governor for allowing
the 2000-2001 state budget to increase more than 9 percent when the
economy's good and welfare and unemployment caseloads are down.

   LONDON - The sun will vanish. The air will chill. The birds will
fall silent. The grid will lock.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning at 11:11 (6:11 a.m. Eastern Time), the sky
over the fingerlike jut of southwestern Britain known as Cornwall
will darken as the moon briefly blots the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The last solar eclipse of the millennium will last only about
two minutes, but it's arrival has been keenly awaited -- or dreaded
-- by the inhabitants of that rugged, remote region for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   And as it is with Big Events these days, the eclipse brings with
it the increasingly familiar mix of commerce and consternation.
</P>
<P>
   While it will be visible elsewhere in England -- and indeed as
far away as Pakistan but not North America -- no where will the
eclipse produce a more striking affect, weather permitting, than
Cornwall. The Path of Totality -- not the title of a self-help book
but instead the narrow band of the moon's most intense shadow --
will cut directly across the region producing within 15 minutes the
experience of sunset and sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   And no where will it touch a place so rich in history, myths and
magic. Cornwall is full of religious sites and monuments and other
little understood curiosities that predate the Romans. This is the
supposed land both of King Arthur and the Druids. Merlin, the
wizard, is said to have been born under such a darkened sky here
near the end of the First Century.
</P>
<P>
   If predictions hold true, a little magic may be needed to cope
with the throngs of eclipse chasers expected to descend on the
quaint green and largely undeveloped region.
</P>
<P>
   More than six times the normal summer holiday traffic has
already begun jamming the region's already overtaxed highways.
Police are warning that gridlock is nearly inevitable, and advise
travelers to stay away from the roads during peak times and to
carry bicycles to get around.
</P>
<P>
   The last total eclipse in Britain was in 1927, and it attracted
more than 3 million people to Yorkshire in Northern England.
Between 500,000 and 1 million visitors have been expected in
Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, officials expressed some concern that the crowds were
building slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have calculated that 82,000 extra people are in Cornwall
compared to a normal year,'' said Cornwall County Council spokesman
Mark Nicholson. ``Obviously that leaves a large number compared to
the quantities of people that we have planned for. An influx over
the remaining days is still likely.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather was one problem as the main routes to Devon and
Cornwall were hit by severe downpours, in some cases causing
flooding Saturday night and Sunday morning. The heavens may be an
issue Wednesday as it is iffy whether it will be clear enough to
tell if it's getting dark.
</P>
<P>
   But for some local officials, the hassle of coping with
additional outsiders also brings on fears about the historic sites.
Mike Rosendale, an official with the Penwith district council, is
worried about the influx of alternative groups that place special
significance to the eclipse and its passage through what is seen as
a mystically rich land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area has the highest concentration of prehistoric
monuments in Western Europe, and the eclipse and the Millennium are
disaster for them,'' Rosendale said. ``They have never been under
so much pressure, never faced this level of threat for 4,000
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, about 30,000 acres near Penzance have been sealed
off to protect monuments. Additional police and military forces
will be on alert during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Norfolk, a member of the organization Pagan Federation,
believes these concerns are exaggerated. Norfolk has been on the
speaking circuit for months warning fellow pagans to behave
themselves. ``It is the most important event for pagans this
decade,'' he said. ``The Millennium has no significance for us, but
an eclipse sees the major symbols of paganism coming together,
where masculine and feminine forces are balanced and it is a time
for great chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to avoid lighting fires, burying things or
doing things with candles,'' Norfolk said.
</P>
<P>
   Bed-and-breakfasts, hotels and even spare rooms are largely
booked up. Many are demanding minimum stays of five days. As many
as 100,000 sea vessels are expected to gather near the coast,
causing concerns about conflicts with commercial shipping lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Another major fear here is that people will stare at the moon
and sun causing severe eye damage. The World Health Organization
last week warned about the dangers. After a 1970 solar eclipse, 145
people reported serious cases of sight loss. After the 1980
eclipse, there were 112 such cases.
</P>
<P>
   While a source of consternation for many, such an event is
mother's milk to entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Barlow, a local former waiter turned businessman, is
banking on getting his share of the mystical margin.
</P>
<P>
   With his brother Ian, Barlow over the past 18 months has snapped
up rooms, cottages and condos, organized train expeditions and even
chartered a supersonic Concorde for high-rolling eclipse hounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my initial reaction to the eclipse was 'So what?' until I
found out more,'' Barlow said. ``It's been the equivalent of
Cornwall trying to organize the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the significance is even more universal. Robin Cole
of Gloucestershire UFO enthusiasts group Circular Forum thinks the
eclipse could catch the attention of observers from other galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1991 eclipse visible from Mexico City marked the dawn of a
new era in UFO sightings in the area,'' Cole told the
Gloucestershire Echo. ``Thousands of people standing to watch the
eclipse saw and photographed a UFO hovering over the city. Who
knows if the same thing could happen here?''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Option add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The aliens would be treated to a rare treat. A total eclipse
occurs when the moon's orbit places it precisely between the Earth
and the sun. The sun travels faster across the sky than the moon
and as it passes behind the moon the sun is blotted out, casting a
shadow over the earth. The temperature drops, the wind kicks up and
birds sensing nightfall cease their songs.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist for the Daily Express described the 1929 eclipse --
which lasted 15 seconds compared to the more than 2 minutes
predicted Wednesday -- this way: ``I caught my breath as I looked
up. The gray shadows near men were really men and women but they
looked like ghosts. Their faces were dry and dead. This, I thought,
is what it must e like to be dead -- gray colorless and quiet, all
standing together in an unearthly light, waiting, rather
frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   But missing this eclipse needn't be the end of the world. North
America will be visited by a total eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017, and
the phenomenon will come again to Britain in 2090. Book early.

develop and deliver Internet-based data, voice and video services
to its business and consulting clients. It will also build six
technology centers _ four in the United States and two abroad. In
return for its investment, Cisco will own a stake of less than 20
percent in KPMG's U.S. unit.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., is
evidence that KPMG has embraced the idea of offering professional
services to its business customers via the Internet. Stephen
Butler, chairman and chief executive of the U.S. unit, said KPMG
had selectively wooed potential technology partners in recent
months to complement existing relationships.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the telecommunications upstart Qwest Communications
International announced that it was forming a joint venture with
KPMG to provide services like order processing through Qwest's
Internet network. The Denver-based Qwest now owns 51 percent of the
venture, called Qwest Cyber.solutions, and KPMG owns 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Qwest combination though, Cisco is making a direct
investment. The two companies have cooperated on various
initiatives for six years. But Butler said it was not until two
months ago that he and his colleagues began to think about a closer
alliance with Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   The market for business services on the Internet is growing at a
rate of more than 40 percent a year, Butler said. ``It's a young
market for the types of services we provide,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, here is how the Cisco-KPMG alliance will work: If a
corporate customer wants to transfer business functions like
accounting or financial reporting to the Web, Cisco will provide
the hardware and KPMG will set up and maintain the computer and
software systems needed.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy behind the alliance, executives from the two
companies said, rests on the conviction that dominance in the
Internet economy will be achieved not by being the first to notice
a trend, but by being the first to exploit it effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the realization that you can be out of business in
three years,'' John Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, said
Saturday. ``Whoever moves quickly first are those who will benefit
over the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Carefully conceived alliances and joint ventures represent the
best business model for the burgeoning Internet economy, Chambers
said. And it is likely Cisco will seek alliances with other
consulting firms. The company has already formed strategic
relationships with many of the industry's biggest players,
including software giant Microsoft Corp. and telecommunications
equipment maker Motorola Inc.

MARKETPLACE: THE INTERNET FAULT LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investing in Internet stocks is like building a beautiful
hilltop mansion _ one that just happens to sit right on the San
Andreas Fault. It's hard to enjoy the view when every time you hear
a noise, you wonder whether this might be the big one.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the most minor rumblings among Internet companies _
fears of slow sales growth over the summer and increased price
competition for Internet service providers _ has lead to extreme
drops in the price of most Internet shares in recent weeks. Even
the most bullish Net investors paused, ever so briefly, to wonder
about the strength of their foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Thestreet.com's index of the stock prices of major Internet
companies fell by 25 percent over the last month, and is now 37
percent below its peak in April. And while prices appeared to
stabilize at the end of last week, the volatility shows how much
this very prominent part of the market is dependent on the psyches
of a relatively small number of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment, of course, is always an important factor in stock
prices. But most of the time there are some checks and balances.
With mature companies, like banks or oil refiners, stock trading
reflects an ongoing debate over the company's market and strategy,
and prices generally stay in a predictable range. As optimism
wanes, value investors eventually scoop up bargains.
</P>
<P>
   There is no plausible case for value investing in ethereal
Internet shares. The Warren Buffet wannabes are not looking at
Yahoo, whose share price of $126.9375 on Friday stood at 260 times
earnings, and saying to themselves that it was an underappreciated
bargain, now that its multiple was down from 550 in April.
</P>
<P>
   People with a ``better safe than sorry'' attitude will neither
live in earthquake zones in California nor invest in most of the
technology companies situated there.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet shares do not even have the modest restraint
provided to other rapidly growing technology companies by short
sellers. The bears who shorted Internet stocks got burned long ago
and moved to more predictable ground.
</P>
<P>
   No. The prices of Internet stocks are simply a Rorschach test
that measures the mix of hope and fear in the minds of a small
group of investors who are willing to soar without a safety net.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is changing everything, the bullish argument goes,
with some justification. And the companies that wind up as the
leaders of the wired world will have value beyond our wildest
imagination, goes the somewhat more arguable corollary.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Benjamin, the well-wired analyst with BancBoston Robertson
Stephens, articulated the Net-bull philosophy when he declared in a
report that he would buy the shares of Internet companies he liked
regardless of any calculation of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found it is particularly difficult to use absolute or
relative valuation metrics as a tool to pick near-term bottoms and
tops,'' he wrote in a newsletter to clients. ``Instead, we try to
remain somewhat disciplined about accumulating stocks based on
improving fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the financial news and analysis service Thestreet.com
conducted an unscientific poll of its audience of active traders.
Only 14 percent said, ``The end is near _ sell.'' Another 27
percent said, ``The end is near _ buy.'' But 48 percent checked the
very cynical choice, ``Waiting for the blowout to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a bullish technical indicator at least in the short run,
as it indicates that the boundless optimism of Internet investors
remains intact. But if that enthusiasm wanes, even slightly, the
drops could be sharp.
</P>
<P>
   So what will feed or starve Internet investor optimism?
</P>
<P>
   To start with, the fundamental picture does, in fact, keep
getting better and better. More people are going online, doing more
things, seeing more ads and _ most important _ buying more. The
rapid fall of computer prices _ to nearly free, for those who
commit to three years of Internet service _ is bringing millions of
new people online. And the same trends are occurring in much of the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The thesis that the leading companies will get the lion's share
of the spoils in the new world has proved true so far. The
continued success of America Online, Yahoo and Amazon.com has
shamed skeptics who said that the fact that anyone can offer a
product or service online meant that the cheapest price would
always win.
</P>
<P>
   But does that mean that the shares of these companies will rise
to infinite values? There are a number of forces that could well
challenge the resolve of the Internet's biggest fans.
</P>
<P>
   One is the immutable law of supply and demand. In response to
investor hunger for the Internet, Wall Street has served up an
astounding number of initial public stock offerings over the last
year. These Internet issues soaked up some of the dollars that
would otherwise have bid the prices of existing stocks even higher.
As it becomes clearer which are the flunk-outs of the IPO class of
'99, some investors may expel them from their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a number of professional money managers who missed
the big run-ups in Net stocks are now deleting their spreadsheets
and buying into the purported New Blue Chips in order to bring
their performance to something close to the market averages. But it
remains to be seen if these investors' conversion to the new math
was thorough enough to stand it if times get tough.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may look more at profits as revenue growth begins to
slow among the Internet leaders. The law of large numbers, after
all, says that even the most successful companies can't triple
their sales each year indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some of the companies may encounter difficulties
meeting the ambitious growth forecasts that the analysts have
published to back up their recommendations. There is a lot of
multiplication behind these numbers. Projected sales are based on
growth in the Internet, multiplied by the propensity of people to
use whatever the company's service, multiplied by the company's
projected market share. It doesn't take much slippage in any of
these numbers to make a sales projection for the year 2002 drop by
25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And so what happens if investors start to question their visions
of infinite growth? There are certainly signs that an increasing
number of new investors are buying Internet stocks on margin _ on
credit, in effect _ and that sharp drops could cause a cascading
series of margin calls, and further price declines, as such
investors are forced to settle their accounts. Analysts say that it
was just such margin-related selling that partially fueled the Net
stock decline in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And next time, that rumbling noise outside the picture window
may be more than a summer thunderstorm.

<P>
   As AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's biggest telephone company, has
marched into the cable television business, it has found itself
locked in a battle of legal briefs, lobbying salvos and public
relations campaigns against America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over ``open access'' to AT&AMP;T's cable systems has raged
in local communities from Broward County, Fla., to Portland, Ore.,
and America Online, the nation's largest gateway to cyberspace, has
consistently argued that AT&AMP;T must let Internet carriers link
directly to AT&AMP;T's cable systems. Such connections would bypass
communications systems and Web services developed by
Excite(AT)Home, an Internet-over-cable company that is backed by
many big cable television players _ including AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   All along this battlefront, AT&AMP;T has taken an adamant stance:
Because it is investing billions to upgrade its cable networks to
carry Internet data, AT&AMP;T has argued that it should have exclusive
right to determine how those systems are used for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But behind the scenes, a side deal may now be in the works _ one
that could eventually undermine Excite(AT)Home's business model.
According to executives close to the companies, AT&AMP;T and America
Online are considering an arrangement that would diminish the role
of Excite(AT)Home by giving America Online and perhaps other
Internet providers enhanced access to AT&AMP;T's systems. Such a deal
could be more than politically expedient; it would enable AT&AMP;T and
America Online each to tap the technical and marketing strengths of
the other.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and America Online declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive dynamics of the market place and the industry's
strategic landscape make a compelling case for America Online and
AT&AMP;T to approach the digital future as partners rather than foes.
After all, America Online already has 18 million Internet
subscribers, and AT&AMP;T owns or has agreements to acquire cable
systems with 16 million customers, although AT&AMP;T plans to sell some
systems.
</P>
<P>
   For Excite(AT)Home, the potentially unsettling implications of
such an arrangement became evident about two weeks ago, when its
board convened just before the company staged its first conference
for financial analysts since the merger in May of At Home Corp. and
Excite Inc.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's chairman and an Excite(AT)Home
director, voiced concern that At Home's business of using cable
modems to link consumers to the Internet might not be a great
strategic fit with Excite's Web portal service, according to a
person at the meeting. Armstrong, arguing from the strength of
AT&AMP;T's 58 percent voting stake in Excite(AT)Home, said that it
might make more sense for At Home to focus on delivering high-speed
communications links, while exploring a sale or spin-off of
Excite's Web content business, this person said.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's view is anathema to the Excite(AT)Home management
team and to the venture capitalists from Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP;
Byers who helped build the former At Home. They contend that the
company cannot thrive as simply a ``dumb pipe.'' Instead, they want
to leverage the communications system built by At Home to provide a
rich information and entertainment package offered by the combined
Excite(AT)Home that would directly compete with America Online _
from the customer's mouse to the farthest reaches of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our job is to execute, so we have as many users as possible
and have built as strong as possible a brand relationship with them
so that those people are loyal Excite(AT)Home customers,'' Thomas
Jermoluk, Excite(AT)Home's chairman, said.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T has said it does not want to be in the so-called
content business. And even though Excite(AT)Home has built an
extensive network and has signed up more than 600,000 cable modem
customers across the country, in the grand scheme of the
communications business, AT&AMP;T does not really need Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The former At Home's early cable partners _ which included
Tele-Communications Inc., the cable giant now owned by AT&AMP;T _
invested shortly after At Home was founded in 1995 to develop
systems for delivering Internet data at high speed over cable
wires.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for At Home's developing the technology and related
Web content, the cable companies contributed money and granted At
Home exclusive deals for the Internet-access rights to their
systems, generally for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T, it was only after Armstrong created management
stability by taking over as chairman in 1997 that the company
seemed to develop a coherent long-term plan, one meant to reassert
its primacy in the communications business, especially with
residential consumers. Stymied in its attempts to merge with the
regional Bell company SBC Communications Inc. and unsatisfied with
leasing local telephone access from phone companies, AT&AMP;T began
unspooling its cable strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer AT&AMP;T announced its $31.8 billion deal to acquire TCI
and later agreed to acquire Mediaone Group Inc. for an additional
$58 billion. By acquiring TCI, AT&AMP;T inherited not only the largest
stake in At Home but also the agreement to give At Home exclusive
Internet use of its cable systems into the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   By the time AT&AMP;T completed its acquisition of TCI this year, At
Home had already agreed to acquire Excite, the big Web portal
service. From At Home's perspective, adding Excite's Web content
would enable the company to offer a full package of services to
compete against America Online. But from AT&AMP;T's perspective, the
Excite acquisition, coupled with the existing At Home exclusivity
arrangement, seemed to pose yet another strategic restraint,
according to people close to the company.
</P>
<P>
   For AT&AMP;T, the main enemy is not America Online _ as it is for
Excite(AT)Home. Instead, AT&AMP;T's main competition is posed by the
Baby Bell local phone giants.
</P>
<P>
   A prime motive for AT&AMP;T's entering the cable business was that
the Bells are intent on getting into the long-distance phone
business and eviscerating AT&AMP;T. At the same time, the Bells are
belatedly deploying a high-speed Internet technology for telephone
networks called digital subscriber line, or DSL. As a counterforce,
AT&AMP;T wants to use its cable lines to deliver local phone service,
as well as long-distance, digital TV and high-speed Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   That is where America Online comes in. Its 18 million customers
give the company a far bigger market share than any other Internet
provider and a clientele that is presumably in a better position to
appreciate the benefits of a high-speed service than people who
have not yet ventured online.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To AT&AMP;T, therefore, a deal with America Online might seem a good
way to increase penetration of cable modem service. And once a
customer took AT&AMP;T cable television service and some sort of AT&AMP;T
cable modem service, that might make them a much easier target for
the big-money local and long-distance phone services that will
travel over those same cables.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Excite(AT)Home contends that greater market
penetration is not an issue because the pent-up demand for cable
Internet service already exceeds the supply of Internet-ready cable
systems. ``We're a long way from being a demand-limited system,''
Jermoluk said. ``We have 38 million registered Excite users. You
think we have any problem generating demand?''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, from America Online's perspective, it may make
sense to cut a deal with AT&AMP;T, rather than to continue waging a
political war that might drive AT&AMP;T into a wholehearted commitment
to the full-service concept of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say it is highly unlikely that AT&AMP;T and
American Online could strike a major deal until Excite(AT)Home's
exclusivity pact expires. And unless that exclusive arrangement is
overturned by the courts before then, AT&AMP;T cable customers will
probably still have to pay $9.95 a month if they want cable-modem
access to America Online _ on top of the $40 cable-modem customers
generally pay for Excite(AT)Home, 65 percent of which goes to the
cable partner.
</P>
<P>
   In order for America Online to work cooperatively with AT&AMP;T
while it is still under obligation to Excite(AT)Home, all parties
would probably have to accept less money from each customer.
</P>
<P>
   And after Excite(AT)Home's exclusivity pact with AT&AMP;T runs out?
It would be foolish for AT&AMP;T to totally turn its back on the
national Internet network that At Home developed and to forswear
use of At Home's technology for managing local networks. And for
America Online, it might make economic sense to lease access to
that technology, rather than spend money duplicating it all.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, in the end, is content _ whether AT&AMP;T cable-modem
customers will get America Online's gateway to chat rooms, e-mail,
e-commerce, news and information, or use the Excite(AT)Home-brand
portal to many of the same kinds of offerings out on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   It is the portal piece of the network where the Excite content
business could end up perhaps the biggest loser in this epic battle
for cable access. In the end, even Jermoluk of Excite(AT)Home may
have little choice but to go along with whatever course is set by
the AT&AMP;T chairman, Michael Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's goal is to maximize the total number of subscribers on
his system by whatever means at his disposal,'' Jermoluk said.
``The only way we have to win is to make AT&AMP;T successful doing what
it is that they're doing.''

PUBLISHER WORRIES AS A LIBEL CASE CROSSES BORDER
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Along the leafy lanes of County Armagh in Northern Ireland, the
hostility over a television documentary and a book about a secret
ruling committee of Protestant terrorists has raged for eight
years, finally landing in a U.S. court in the form of a
$100-million libel suit.
</P>
<P>
   The debate about allegations that such a committee existed
divided Catholics and Protestants in Portadown, a County Armagh
community so riven by violent sectarianism that it has been
described by outsiders as Northern Ireland's Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   But in the age of the Internet and global book publishing,
County Armagh's intractable tensions have seeped to the United
States with the publication of an updated paperback version of the
documentary's findings: ``The Committee: Political Assassination in
Northern Ireland,'' which like the film is by Sean McPhilemy.
</P>
<P>
   The various challengers of the book _ who range from a pair of
luxury car dealers in Portadown to the leader of Northern Ireland's
Ulster Unionist party, David Trimble _ have literally hunted the
book around the world in an attempt to stop sales. Their efforts
have prompted some publishing giants to halt distribution in the
United States and Britain. And the campaign raises significant
questions about libel jurisdiction in the age of the borderless
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Committee'' _ which was published in the United States by
a small Colorado house, Roberts Rinehart _ has not been published
or generally sold in bookstores in Northern Ireland or Britain,
where libel laws are more restrictive than in the United States.
But the book remains available there from online booksellers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Internet enabled ``The Committee'' to become one of
Amazon.com's 10 best-selling books in Europe for a time, alongside
popular fiction like the ``Harry Potter'' series and Thomas Harris'
``Hannibal.'' But such sales have forced American publishers and
distributors to confront the reality of British standards.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a demand by Trimble and his lawyers prompted Amazon to
withdraw ``The Committee'' from its site in Britain, though the
book is still on sale at a lower price on its American site.
Several other online booksellers with British Web sites have also
pulled the book, including Bertelsmann A.G., which is rapidly
expanding its Bol.com network of electronic bookstores in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who is also the first minister of the new Northern
Ireland Assembly, has singled out only Amazon.com with a lawsuit.
He denies the book's allegations that he was aware of the
influential committee and provided political cover for its members.
He is demanding an apology and compensation from Amazon, partly
because the Web site listed its own review of the title along with
critical letters from readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, we are concentrating on the U.K. side because
the publication would be in the English jurisdiction,'' said Paul
Fox, a partner with Henry Hepworth, the firm of solicitors
representing Trimble. ``But once that is resolved, we may turn our
guns on the American side.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox conceded the difficulties of stopping a book from
circulating across borders with a few computer clicks, but, he
said, ``That doesn't mean that you shouldn't try.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The reason why I'm bothering is to establish that
this book isn't true.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingram Book Group, the largest American book wholesaler, also
stopped stocking and distributing the title in July after it
received letters from a Belfast law firm demanding a halt and
invoking the name of Trevor Forbes, a former assistant chief
constable in the Royal Ulster Constabulary who denies the book's
claim that he provided intelligence for the secret committee.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Barnesandnoble.com has received similar letters,
but is still selling the hardcover and paperback versions on its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers who are car dealers in Portadown, David and
Albert Wesley Prentice, have taken a more traditional approach,
filing a $100-million libel suit in a Washington court against the
publisher and author in connection with the book's allegations that
the Wesleys used their various businesses in County Armagh to
finance the activities of Unionist terrorists and murderers.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Baron, executive director of the Libel Defense Resource
Center, a New York information clearinghouse on libel and privacy
issues, said she expects to see more such lawsuits. ``I think that
as the world becomes more globally literate _ the more we read each
other's books, each other's magazines and newspapers _ the more
likely you're going to see litigation about that literature
crossing borders,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may expand the pool of potential plaintiffs, and that may
be something that distributors have to pay attention to if they're
going to sell books about non-U.S. residents and sell them
overseas,'' she said. ``They may expect to be sued.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   McPhilemy's book grew out of a documentary that was shown on
Britain's Channel 4 in 1991. The program, researched by McPhilemy's
television production company, contended that an influential group
of some 60 middle-class professionals in the Protestant community
in County Armagh had coalesced in the late 1980s and forged links
with British special police forces and Unionist terrorists to
preside over nearly 60 killings of Republicans and Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry that followed the program had a drastic effect on
McPhilemy. He was forced to close his production company after
newspaper reports in London contended that the story was a hoax and
accused him and his researchers of deceptive reporting practices.
</P>
<P>
   McPhilemy, who is 52, reacted by pressing several libel claims.
He collected damages and received an apology from The Sunday
Express, which accused him of manufacturing security threats
against himself. He remains embroiled in another libel suit,
scheduled for trial in January, against The London Sunday Times,
which accused McPhilemy of creating a ``collage of unsubstantiated
rumors and fabrications.''
</P>
<P>
   The credibility of the program was undermined by the changing
statements of a critical Unionist source for the original program,
James Alfred Sands, who was the only direct witness to provide the
producers with taped, detailed descriptions of the committee's
structure, meeting locations and members, along with the supposed
plots behind various murders. Sands later recanted, then withdrew
that declaration, saying in a sworn statement in May that the Royal
Ulster Constabulary had threatened him with prosecution or death if
he did not recant. And finally, he recanted yet again, backing away
from his support for the program.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was partly because of the libel litigation that McPhilemy
continued the investigation of a conspiracy in Northern Ireland,
which eventually resulted in the book, ``The Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to decide whether I would stand by the program or
whether I would continue the investigation into the murder
conspiracy or follow the advice of people who said you cannot
expect to win,'' he said last week. ``I decided my duty was to
pursue the story.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   McPhilemy said he took his manuscript to the United States after
a British publisher told him that it would be extremely difficult
to publish in Britain with its tougher libel laws.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts Rinehart, in Boulder, Colo., agreed to publish the book
in May 1998. The company, which specializes in Irish literature,
was founded in 1981 by Frederick R. Rinehart, the scion of an
old-line New York publishing family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when we were served with a lawsuit,'' said
Rinehart, 45, whose company is finding it difficult to obtain
financing with the threat of a $100-million lawsuit in Washington.
``We genuinely thought that we were doing a good thing because
there was no investigation looking into these murders in Northern
Ireland. We thought we were doing a public service. But as this
case unfolds, I think that they are literally trying to destroy us.
This is a distraction from the real issue that nobody wants to
confront.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer for the Prentice brothers, William W. Taylor,
said the publisher should not have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no choice, because the book was not published in the
United Kingdom,'' Taylor said. ``Their only opportunity to get a
forum for the truth or falsity was in the United States.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   In Britain, booksellers can face libel sanctions. But it is
extremely rare for a bookseller or a distributor in the United
States to be drawn into the tangle of a lawsuit. Ingram, for
example, has never been named in a libel lawsuit, according to a
spokesman, Keel Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the Nashville-based Ingram sought a guarantee
from Roberts Rinehart that it would cover any legal costs
associated with a claim. When the publisher declined, Ingram
returned the books. ``It doesn't have anything to do with respect
to the content,'' Hunt said. ``Ingram is not in any position of
judging content. They carry more than a quarter-million titles and
there's no time to check out the books.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the book keeps selling _ with more than 55,000 hardcover
and paperback copies in print, and more scheduled for production
next week. The title's chief distributor, Publishers Group West in
Berkeley, Calif., is preparing to finance another paperback
printing because Roberts Rinehart cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Winton, chief executive of Publishers Group West, said
he wondered whether ``The Committee'' was merely the first of many
books that will raise the issue of whether publishers will have to
satisfy libel standards in all countries if titles circulate
internationally via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the greater degree that English becomes the world's
language,'' Winton said, ``we are seeing the first example of the
tactic where if you feel wronged, you have to fight it in the
United States.''

<P>
   The marquee stars of the government's antitrust assault on the
Microsoft Corp. have been David Boies, the trial lawyer who proved
a master at catching Microsoft witnesses off-guard, and Joel Klein,
the chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the outcome of the government's case _ win or lose _ will
largely hinge on whether the federal courts are impressed by the
work and judgment of Phillip R. Malone.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old senior staff lawyer in the Justice Department's
San Francisco office led the agency's investigation of the software
powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It was Malone and his San Francisco team of ``hawks'' on the
Microsoft issue, according to people involved in case, who strongly
urged Washington to file a major antitrust suit against the
company. After internal debate and review, Klein eventually agreed
with the San Francisco recommendation and the Justice Department
sued Microsoft in May 1998, joined by 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   Then, before the start of the trial in October, Malone managed
the campaign to add new evidence to the case and crisscrossed the
country taking dozens of new depositions. He also coordinated the
government's trial preparation, a painstaking effort that paid off
repeatedly in the courtroom during the eight months of witness
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case that has been presented is Phil Malone's case,''
Boies observed. ``Take Phil and his San Francisco staff, and this
case could have progressed without anyone else _ and that includes
me. It may not have been quite as dramatic in the courtroom, but
the case would have been the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the Microsoft case occurs Tuesday, when each
side presents the court with its ``proposed findings of fact.''
These amount to legal storytelling, as each side presents its view
of the facts established in the trial citing witness testimony,
e-mail or documents. And they will be tomes; though still being
edited at the end of last week, the government draft was nearly 800
pages, and Microsoft's was about 250 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence cited will not be new. But these documents are
efforts by both sides to organize and present the evidence to Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, giving him a source book and a lens for
viewing the case. The two sides, of course, will present very
different views. And there is more to come, with both sides
scheduled to submit revised findings of fact next month.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, once again, is at the center of things. He and his San
Francisco team found the facts the government is presenting as
evidence, while Microsoft is rebutting them as hearsay, irrelevant
or inconsequential in an antitrust case. Even Microsoft concedes
that its witnesses got roughed up and occasionally embarrassed by
Boies during the trial. But with the focus now turning to a cool
assessment of the testimony, evidence and law, Microsoft's legal
team insists that the advantage is shifting to their side.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they much prefer opposing Malone's case on paper than
opposing Boies in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good theater in the courtroom, but the government left
vast portions of our direct testimony untouched,'' said William
Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel. ``And this is our opportunity
to tell our story based on the unchallenged facts in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft story is that contrary to the government's
allegations, it has not illegally used the market muscle derived
from its control of desktop personal computer software to stifle
the challenge from Internet software. Consumers, Microsoft said,
benefited from its decision to fold Internet browsing software into
its industry-standard Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The government's view was perhaps most cogently expressed by a
senior Justice Department official in the hallway of the federal
court building in June. After a morning of testimony about
Microsoft's reported arm-twisting tactics, the official told a
colleague, ``If that stuff isn't illegal, we should shut down the
Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone was largely responsible for making that the received
wisdom within the Justice Department _ though, of course, the
policy decisions are not made by the staff but by the top
appointees in the antitrust division, Klein and A. Douglas Melamed,
the second in command.
</P>
<P>
   With the case still pending, Malone will not discuss the
investigation in detail. But he did say that it was the
accumulation of evidence _ and not any single episode or document _
that persuaded him that Microsoft had gone too far. ``It was the
mountain of evidence, all those Microsoft e-mails keep coming back
over and over again to the same theme,'' Malone said. ``Its own
documents make it very clear that Microsoft knew what it was doing
_ protecting its monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Malone is regarded within the Justice Department as one of the
top staff lawyers in the antitrust division. Colleagues describe
him as soft-spoken, focused and driven. He grew up the son of a
railway technician in Thoreau, N.M., a rail stop and logging town
of 500 people at the time, and then made his way to Harvard
University as an undergraduate, before getting his law degree at
the University of Arizona and joining the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to thrive on a grueling work regimen. During the course
of the Microsoft investigation, Malone would often be called back
for one-day meetings at Justice Department headquarters in
Washington. His routine, colleagues said, was to work the day in
San Francisco, take the overnight flight to Washington, work the
day in Washington, take the red-eye that night back to San
Francisco and show up early for work the next day. Klein calls
Malone the antitrust unit's Cal Ripken, referring to the ironman
infielder for the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who is single, bought a house in San Francisco last
August. But the moving boxes remain mostly unpacked, since he has
been back to see it only three times on brief visits, he said,
because he has spent the last year in Washington for the trial.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Since he took over the Microsoft inquiry in 1996, Malone has
pursued the company with an intensity and stamina others find
remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, a lawyer who worked for Netscape
Communications, recalled Malone asking for a briefing from software
engineers on how Microsoft melded its browser into the Windows
operating system. The Silicon Valley session in the fall of 1997,
Ms. Varney recalled, began late in the day and lasted eight hours,
with Malone quizzing the programmers with detailed questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astounded by his depth of knowledge of the technology
and the industry,'' Ms. Varney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal team is also impressed by Malone as a
hard-working investigator. But they said that his knowledge of the
industry had been a one-sided tutorial administered by Microsoft's
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is a genuine cultural divide between the Justice
Department's staff lawyers, like Malone, and the Microsoft legal
team from Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, an elite law firm. The culture gap _
different worlds of affluence and attitudes _ add a certain edge to
their confrontation. Members of the private firm are the ones with
the half-million-dollar-a-year partners' salaries, who ride in the
front of the plane, wear expensive suits and stay at four-star
hotels. Malone is paid about $100,000 a year and while in
Washington rents a room with a kitchen. But he said he has never
regretted not taking the more lucrative path in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I love doing,'' he said. ``You take a case,
investigate it and file it because it is the right thing to do, not
because some client paid you.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the government's walking encyclopedia of the Microsoft case,
Malone also plays a key role in the occasional settlement talks
between the two sides. ``You don't want to have detailed settlement
talks without Phil in the room because he's the one who really
understands things,'' one person involved in the case said.
</P>
<P>
   If no settlement emerges and the trial concludes, the appeals
process could take two years or more. By then, Klein, a political
appointee, and Boies, a renowned litigator hired to present the
case against Microsoft, will most likely have moved on, legal
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the whole group, the guy who will still be around in two
years or so will probably be Phil Malone,'' said William Kovacic, a
law professor at George Washington University.

FOR MAGAZINES, THE POWER TO STIR PUBLIC DEBATE SEEMS LOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willie Morris, the editor of Harper's magazine from 1967 to
1971, was both back-porch storyteller and urban intellectual, a
Rhodes Scholar who was at home sipping tea in the Waldorf-Astoria
and slugging back bourbon in the bars of Jackson, Miss. As a young
editor during the late 1960s, he helped oversee an especially
provocative period in American journalism, publishing dozens of
articles that reflected the energy and turmoil of the era and, more
importantly, got people talking and thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, David Halberstam, William Styron and several
other writers and editors who knew Morris traveled to the town of
his birth, Yazoo City, Miss., to deliver the eulogies at his
funeral. Among such writers and in the world of magazine journalism
at large, Morris' death seemed to have a symbolic resonance. For
the funeral came during a week when a new magazine, Talk, a joint
venture of Miramax Films, owned by Walt Disney Co. and Hearst
Magazines, arrived on newsstands, complete with a kickoff party out
of Fellini _ or Quentin Tarantino _ that featured a rapping
publisher, fireworks and enough disco-dancing demi-celebrities to
populate a small town.
</P>
<P>
   The days are long gone when magazines published articles that
regularly stirred public debate and pushed the limits of sheer
length _ under Morris, Harper's published Norman Mailer's ``The
Steps to the Pentagon'' at 90,000 words, which took up the entire
March 1968 issue.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding the fuss surrounding Tina Brown's Talk magazine,
it has been years since magazine articles _ as opposed to magazine
editors _ have consistently ignited sweeping public dialogue. There
are exceptions, of course. Last year, Michael Isikoff's
investigation for Newsweek eventually helped lead to the
impeachment of the president, and Steven Brill made headlines with
the dissection of the Kenneth Starr investigation in the first
issue of Brill's Content _ but both of those stories stemmed from
the same presidential indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's Time magazine, meanwhile, desperately tried to get
people talking about its series on corporate welfare that ran last
November. And while the series by Donald Barlett and James Steele
won a National Magazine Award, even Walter Isaacson, the magazine's
managing editor, admits that it did not generate a lot of talk
among readers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: It has been a while since a single magazine
article could carry immense clout. Twenty, 30 and 40 years ago,
magazine articles created a stir _ as did Norman Mailer's
``Superman Comes to the Supermart,'' an essay published in Esquire
in 1960 that portrayed John F. Kennedy as the first American
politician able to manipulate television; The New Yorker's
serialization of Rachel Carson's ``Silent Spring'' in 1961, or Joe
McGinniss' ``The Selling of the President 1968'' in the August 1969
issue of Harper's, or Hunter Thompson's ``Fear and Loathing''
chronicles of the 1972 presidential campaign for Rolling Stone
magazine. The writers themselves took on larger-than-life
personalities. And the articles prompted action.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Mailers and Halberstams of the world seem to have
mostly disdain for American magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're glitz bags,'' said Mailer, when asked to sum up his
thoughts on magazines. ``You can't tell one from another. They are
so obviously driven by the ads, that the ads take prominence over
the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Halberstam, who writes for Vanity Fair magazine, said: ``Most
magazines are much less diminished in seriousness. A magazine is
now a television show, in which a celebrity journalist, if there is
such a thing, interviews someone from Hollywood who is also either
a celebrity or is this week's celebrity killer, or is someone who
knows this week's celebrity killer.''
</P>
<P>
   But is that really fair? After all, one could argue that
Halberstam's editors had it easier: There was plenty of history
going on around them to write about. If one assumes that the
historian Francis Fukuyama was right in his assertion in ``The End
of History and the Last Man'' (Free Press, 1992) that liberal
democratic capitalism is here to stay and the culture wars are
over, shouldn't magazine editors wonder, well, what are the pivotal
points of contention to write about?
</P>
<P>
   There are several plausible reasons why American magazines
appear to not drive public debate. The most glaring is that there
are simply fewer general-interest magazines that unify a broad
national audience.
</P>
<P>
   Some magazine editors reluctantly agree. ``If you have a
25,000-word piece that attempts to make a big, serious argument
about the state of the world, there aren't many places you're going
to get that published,'' said Michael Kelly, the editor of National
Journal. ``And there were more 25 years ago. There is a world that
to some degree does not exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Most new magazines that come into the marketplace are niche
publications _ after all, last year's crop of typical new magazines
included Mary Beth's Beanie World Monthly, Southern California's
Divorce Magazine and Christian Motorsports. Neil Gabler, a cultural
historian and author of ``Life: The Movie, How Entertainment
Conquered Reality'' (Knopf, 1998), said: ``In the old days, when
people did talk about magazines, they talked about the big ones
like The Saturday Evening Post, or Life, or Look, and they were not
niche magazines. They generated heat because they were a way for
the entire national community to communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers are no longer central to our culture, or to the culture
of magazines, Gabler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magazines are not writer-generated,'' he said. ``They are
subject-generated. Almost no one would go buy a magazine because
Norman Mailer has a piece in it. They buy a magazine because
there's a story about Tom Cruise in it. The franchise is on the
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Television, of course, commands the greatest clout. ``Now you'll
find people talking about `Seinfeld' and the `master of my domain'
episode much more often than they are talking about magazine
articles,'' said David Abrahamson, a professor of media studies at
Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Abrahamson also links the lack of compelling magazine journalism
to what he sees as the lack of burning issues: ``Magazines have
been trivialized, in a way. They've been dumbed down. And that's
partly because the topics that make up the national discourse have
over the last 20 years been trivialized. Rather than some larger
issue, it's Madonna's latest misbehavior.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to the inevitable question: In a time when no people
of even the most evanescent fame are interviewed without a flotilla
of public relations executives forming a protective barrier around
them, could a profile of Madonna ever reveal anything surprising or
new about Madonna? (That is, assuming the public has an appetite
for another profile of Madonna.)
</P>
<P>
   Gay Talese, who became famous for his human, intricately
detailed profiles that revealed the frailties of characters like
Joe DiMaggio and Frank Sinatra, said that magazines no longer have
that kind of intimate access; he argued that these days, when
celebrities are guarded by publicity agents with the avidity of
Cerberus, the result is bland, lazy reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, an interview is a monologue where the subject does most
of the talking. It has been reduced to a one-hour chat in a suite
in the Plaza Hotel, with the agent sitting there, `Do you want more
tea?' and eyeing the clock because in another 20 minutes another
writer was coming in with his tape recorder,'' Talese said.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the editors complain is to hear the same lament:
Magazines are no longer the center of attention in the swirl of
media. Bill Powers, who covered the magazine industry for The
Washington Post and is a columnist for National Journal, said that
readers share less reading material. ``About five or six years ago,
there was a common database of magazines that people were checking
out regularly, and if something caught your eye, everyone you knew
had read it and chatted about it. Now, there doesn't seem to be any
one magazine that everybody makes a point of keeping up on.''
</P>
<P>
   David Granger, the editor in chief of Esquire, made a similar
concession. ``You're talking about 40 years ago,'' Granger said,
``a time when television was basically not a factor. When there was
no Internet. And there were, what, one-tenth of the magazines that
there are now. And the few magazines that were around had a great
deal more power. But I would contend that the best magazine writing
today _ while not nearly as influential _ is every bit as good as
what was being written by Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese.''
</P>
<P>
   Some magazine editors dispute the notion that magazines are
losing ground. ``I totally disagree that people talk about
magazines less these days,'' said Isaacson of Time. ``They talk
about them more. Folks who have the option of doing things in all
sorts of media _ such as Tina Brown or Steve Brill or John Kennedy
_ choose to launch magazines when they want to make a difference or
have a good platform. Because magazines stick to the ribs and get
people thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Isaacson acknowledged that Time's series on corporate
welfare did not generate much discussion. ``Barlett and Steele won
a lot of awards,'' he said. ``A lot of people read it and commented
on it and debated it, but it was not a buzz-producing piece along
the lines of Hillary talking about the president's childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, defended his writers
and his magazine. ``Believe me, there are still plenty of editors
out there willing to follow a writer's passion as far as it takes
and for as long as it takes,'' he said. Carter pointed out recent
pieces in Vanity Fair by the writers Sebastian Junger, Marie
Brenner and Michael Herr.
</P>
<P>
   Herr's book about the Vietnam War, ``Dispatches,'' originated as
a series of magazine articles, and he recently contributed his
first piece of magazine journalism in 20 years to Vanity Fair. But
despite being offered up by Carter as living proof of the vitality
of magazines, Herr himself said that magazine journalism is blander
now than 20 years ago. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because all the terms of media have changed so completely,''
Herr said. ``There's too much of it. You don't know where
television ends and print begins anymore. It's all one sort of
horrible media stew that has so many ingredients in it no one can
taste anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Magazines now confront a strange irony: They belong to an
enormous media apparatus that includes the Internet, television
magazine programs, 24-hour cable news. So magazine articles can now
be amplified by the same media apparatus that simultaneously
leeches attention from them.
</P>
<P>
   That is what made last week's coincidental passages _ the death
of the Harper editor Willie Morris and the birth of Tina Brown's
Talk magazine _ so significant. No one understands how to
manipulate the new media structure better than Tina Brown, and no
one would have felt more estranged from it than Willie Morris.

`KNOWN DEAD': A WAR ZONE IN THE TALL GRASS OF IOWA
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Houseman is a deputy sheriff in Nation County, Iowa. There
have been some murders there, strange ones, the kind that start out
sort of simple and then ramify into so many corners that all the
world seems to be involved. So loaded with potential are these
murders that before you know it, various federal officials are
taking over the investigation, pursuing their own mysterious,
vaguely international agendas that seem at times to take priority
over bringing the killers to justice.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's good old Houseman, who is more sophisticated
than his down-home manner would suggest and pretty effective in the
bureaucratic maneuvering that is necessary if justice is to be
done. We like Houseman for other reasons, too. He has a blunt,
self-effacing sense of humor; he is middle-aged, overweight and
breaks his diet by eating doughnuts. In other words, he is all too
human, although he's faithful to his wife, dependable and cool
under fire.
</P>
<P>
   He is the narrator of ``Known Dead,'' Donald Harstad's
entertaining mystery, set in a small-town Midwest that is so
unpretentious, so ordinary as to appear exotic. Houseman is also
the main reason that Harstad's novel, his second, is as breezily
entertaining as it is, another important reason being a complicated
little conundrum of a plot that keeps Houseman, the Feds and the
reader guessing all the way through. The only problem with this is
a couple of loose ends remaining after the last page has been
turned, loose ends that seem inconsistent with a guide as reliable
and thorough as our deputy sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   The murders take place one very muggy, buggy afternoon in a
large and heavily wooded park a few miles from Maitland, where
Houseman lives and works. We discover in the very beginning that we
are going to get good, authentic police work from Harstad. The dust
jacket informs us that the author is a 26-year veteran of the
Clayton County Sheriff's Department in northeastern Iowa, the very
territory of his novel.
</P>
<P>
   The coded talk on the radio, the forensic analysis of the local
medical examiner and the descriptions of weapons and crime scenes
make it clear that ``Known Dead'' will depend for its effect more
on its authentic description of police procedure than on whodunit
suspense.
</P>
<P>
   What Harstad knows in particular, no doubt from experience, is
the inevitable operation of Murphy's Law in the business of crime
solving. If it can go wrong in ``Known Dead,'' it will go wrong,
whether it is somebody putting in the paper with the wrong side up
when sending a critical, urgent, life-determining fax, or somebody
else getting blown away just when you least expect a person to be
killed. There's a moment when a counter-terrorism expert
portentously announces that a wad of green rubberized cloth found
at the crime scene suggests some ominous foreign involvement in
Iowa. This announcement produces the following embarrassed
confession from Houseman:
</P>
<P>
   ```Uh,' I said, `uh, that's mine. My rain jacket.' He just
stared at me. `It has a tear in the right elbow ... and I tore the
label off because it irritated my neck ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked. It did. Total silence.
</P>
<P>
   ```I, uh, tossed it aside that day, when I got to the scene
because it was too hot. I guess I forgot about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The murder victims in the park were a policeman who was
conducting surveillance on a large marijuana patch that had been
discovered by the Iowa Division of Narcotics Enforcement, and a
local small-timer named Howie Phelps. Phelps was cultivating the
patch for somebody else, a slightly bigger-time hoodlum named
Johnny Marks. The crime, which brings Houseman and his sidekick, a
likable female detective named Hester Gorse, into the drug world of
Iowa, demonstrates that there's more to Iowa than the ladies of
Dubuque.
</P>
<P>
   There's even more than either Houseman or Hester can fathom.
Things, it seems, are not what they seem. There is a Murphy's Law
that applies to criminals as well as to the police, a Murphy's Law
that muddies the investigation, since criminals, too, stumble
across unexpected situations leading them to do things that they
had not initially intended to do.
</P>
<P>
   Fairly quickly Harstad's intrigue branches out to include the
possibility that foreign terrorists may have been responsible, or
perhaps right-wing militias of the sort that seem to grow in the
Iowa soil. More killings occur, and this time drugs certainly have
nothing to do with them. Instead, Harstad brings us convincingly
into the sad world of overindebted farmers who think that the Jews,
the United Nations and the federal government are responsible for
all of their problems.
</P>
<P>
   His book is a mystery story, not a piece of social commentary.
But he is an author who knows his territory, and his description of
it is gritty and realistic.
</P>
<P>
   From the literary point of view, Houseman's account of these
goings-on and the eventual solution of them is not problem free.
One grisly murder is unaccounted for in the book, which sometimes
gets so crammed with plots and actions that the thread of causation
gets left behind someplace in the maze. The criminal mastermind at
one point, for example, catches on that a female newspaper reporter
is working for Houseman, but how he discovers this is left out of
the picture. Other actions on the part of the main bad guy are
inexplicable, like why he bothers with the reporter in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   There are two competing theories here. One is that a
crime-solving story ought to leave no unanswered questions behind.
The other is that unanswered questions are symbolic of the murky
real world in which everybody can be sure that he will never be
sure.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Harstad's message seems to be that evil is too great
for us ever to shed an all-clarifying light on its activities. That
may be so, but loose ends are loose ends, and his sophisticated,
funny and diverting book would have been even better without them.

PILOTS' PACT WITH AMERICAN FALLS APART
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A tentative agreement between American Airlines and the union
representing its pilots fell apart over the weekend, dashing hopes
that a bitter eight-month dispute over the acquisition of Reno Air
would be resolved soon.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at American, which is the nation's second-largest
airline and is owned by the AMR Corp., last month agreed to a
settlement proposed by a mediator, George Nicolau, and was waiting
for the board of the pilots union to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, the Allied Pilots Association, which represents
American's 9,500 pilots, announced that it had accepted Nicolau's
proposal ``with certain amendments.''
</P>
<P>
   But American said Sunday that the changes made by the union were
so great that they amounted to a renegotiation of the proposed
settlement. ``We accepted this agreement,'' said Andrea Rader, a
spokeswoman for American. ``The APA board made such substantial
changes to it that it amounts to the APA rejecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rader said that American would go ahead with its planned
integration of Reno Air later this month but that any deal with the
union was off. ``We are basically back to square one on this,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the pilots union did not return several calls
seeking comment Sunday. The union's 18-person governing board voted
unanimously on Friday to approve the amended agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognize that the past several months have been difficult
for all concerned at American Airlines,'' Rich LaVoy, the union's
president, said in a statement after the vote. ``It is our hope
that this positive step by APA's board of directors will enable us
to begin building a better relationship between management and our
union.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Reno, a small airline that flies mostly in the
West, led to an eight-day sickout by the pilots in February that
resulted in the cancellation of 6,700 flights at American,
disrupting the plans of hundreds of thousands of travelers and
costing the airline $225 million. The job action ended only after a
federal judge ordered the pilots to return to work. He later
ordered the union and its two top officers to pay $45.5 million in
damages to American.
</P>
<P>
   The union said that the Reno deal violated a key clause in its
contract that guarantees that members of the pilots association
will do all the flying of large jets. It demanded that all Reno
pilots be raised to the higher American pay scale immediately.
</P>
<P>
   American said the pilots' demands would add as much as $50
million to the $124-million cost of Reno. It said that it would
gradually increase the pay of Reno and American pilots as they
assumed their new positions.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rader of American said that the mediator's proposal called
for American to begin paying Reno pilots at American's higher pay
scale beginning Aug. 31 instead of retroactive to Dec. 23, as the
union was demanding. But the deal also included several retroactive
payments to make up for the time gap.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, the agreement contained a protocol for how future
mergers with other airlines would be handled, including the use of
a neutral mediator to settle disagreements. The protocol was a key
element of the settlement because the union was concerned that the
Reno deal would set a negative precedent for much larger airline
acquisitions by American in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rader said that the union's amendments to the mediator's
proposal made substantial changes to both the protocol and to the
details of the integration of Reno, but she declined to say what
they were. LaVoy, in his statement, said that the union had agreed
to a request by the mediator not to divulge the details of its
amended proposal until American had a chance to see it.

NEW YORK FIRMS CHOSEN TO DESIGN CLINTON LIBRARY

 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For more than a year, some of America's leading architects and
designers have been competing eagerly _ but oh so discreetly _ for
a commission in downtown Little Rock, Ark.: President Clinton's
$125-million library and museum.
</P>
<P>
   There was coast-to-coast conjecture. Would the prize go to Frank
Gehry of Los Angeles, designer of the polymorphous Guggenheim
Museum in Bilbao, Spain? (``I can see it all now in Arkansas,'' the
president told him.) Or Charles Gwathmey of New York, designer of
three houses in which Clinton has stayed? (He was seated at the
president's table at a White House dinner.)
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it turns out, was in the stars. Or at least in the
new Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The team responsible for that project _ the Polshek Partnership,
architects, and Ralph Appelbaum Associates, museum planners and
exhibition designers _ has been chosen to design the library in the
27-acre Clinton Presidential Park, which is planned on the south
bank of the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that there is a Polshek style, one might expect a
structure that is crisply modern, intricately detailed and
generally understated, with a broad expanse of suavely articulated
glass curtain wall and at least one bold geometric gesture like an
arc, an oblique angle or a sphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people at home will be quite excited about it when
they see what we're going to do,'' Clinton said in June, ``and will
be thrilled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, one can only imagine It is too early to say what the
library will look like, what exhibits it will contain or even when
construction will begin, said Skip Rutherford, president of the
William J. Clinton Presidential Foundation in Little Rock, who is
coordinating the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team was just completed, and it's premature to speculate
on anything else,'' he said, confirming a report in The Arkansas
Times on Thursday that named the design team.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, Rutherford said. Visitors will be able to
walk to the library from hotels, the convention center and other
museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a downtown location,'' Rutherford said, ``which is far
different from other presidential libraries.'' The Clinton
Presidential Park will occupy an old warehouse district just across
Interstate 30 from an emerging shopping and entertainment quarter
known as River Market.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Little Rock is acquiring land for the park,
Rutherford said.
</P>
<P>
   A 100-year-old railroad passenger depot on the site will be
preserved and incorporated into the new complex. An abandoned
railroad bridge nearby will be converted to pedestrian use.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very accessible site,'' said James Stewart
Polshek, who will design the building with his colleague Richard M.
Olcott. ``That's one of the reasons the president selected that
one, because of its visibility and accessibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Polshek and Appelbaum, both based in New York, are working
together on the Hayden Planetarium, which is part of the new Rose
Center for Earth and Space, and on a master plan for the Museum of
the City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not approach the library project as a team.
Instead, they met independently with Clinton at the White House
earlier this year. Rutherford said the president had been advised
that ``it was very important to bring an exhibition designer on at
the very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The George Bush Presidential Library and Museum in College
Station, Texas, includes a restored Avenger fighter similar to the
one Bush flew in World War II, a 1947 Studebaker similar to the one
Bush drove to Texas and a Capitol dome similar to _ though
considerably smaller than _ the one under which Bush served as a
U.S. representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all presidential libraries built recently have an
interpretative component,'' Appelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized that the process of designing the Clinton
library was in its most embryonic stage. In time it will involve
the National Archives and Records Administration, which oversees
the 10 presidential libraries.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Neither Polshek nor Appelbaum would hazard a guess as to why
they were chosen. But they both noted that the president and
Hillary Rodham Clinton were familiar with their work.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at the dedication of the United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum in Washington in 1993 and later awarded Appelbaum a
presidential award for design excellence for his work there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton attended the dedication of the King Juan Carlos I
of Spain Center at New York University, which the Polshek firm
completed in 1997. And she wrote the preface for the catalog of
``Hands and Minds,'' an exhibition designed by Appelbaum at the
Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Clinton has visited the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Center
for Visual Arts at Stanford University, another Polshek project.
And the president visited the National Inventors Hall of Fame in
Akron, Ohio, designed by the Polshek Partnership, as it neared
completion in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been scrutinizing other presidential libraries.
``The president spent a tremendous amount of time studying the
issue,'' said Rutherford, a longtime friend. ``I sent him up
numerous books and proposals. We had several architects come to
Little Rock and actually look at the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many people he talked to. But the list was
long.''

TALENT AGENCY SHAKEN BY EXECUTIVE'S DEPARTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rm) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The town turns quiet in August. Producers, studio
and television executives and talent agents leave for vacations in
Hawaii, the Hamptons and other exotic locales. Business slows down.
</P>
<P>
   But not this past weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Friday by Jim Wiatt to quit as co-chairman of
International Creative Management, one of the top talent agencies,
has rippled across Hollywood. Within ICM, executives are deeply
concerned not only that Wiatt will take along several other agents
when he settles into a new job, but also that some of his
high-priced clients like Eddie Murphy, Sylvester Stallone and Tim
Allen _ as well as directors and producers like Nora Ephron, Penny
Marshall, Kevin Williamson and Richard Donner _ will join him.
</P>
<P>
   Rival agencies, seeing ICM as vulnerable, were already phoning
and seeking to lure Wiatt's clients as well as other actors,
writers and directors affiliated with ICM.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's list includes Julia Roberts, Mel Gibson, Jodie
Foster, Jay Leno and Dustin Hoffman and the directors James L.
Brooks, Spike Lee and Francis Ford Coppola.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer unexpectedly left the
Creative Artists Agency in 1995 has the agency business plunged
into such turmoil. Although Creative Artists was left reeling, and
lost a handful of clients, it has regained its footing and remains
one of the top agencies.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the departure of Wiatt significant is not just his
high-profile role at ICM, but also the fact that agencies, as well
as even lavishly paid clients, are extremely nervous as Hollywood
studios seek to limit productions because of soaring costs. With
the exception of several stars like Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks and Ms.
Roberts, actors and directors are often finding a scarcity of
projects. As a result, some talent agencies have laid off agents.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, 52, who has worked at ICM for more than 22 years, is in
discussions with rival talent agencies, notably the William Morris
agency. That agency, which fell into disarray in the late 1980s,
has seen a resurgence in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Should Wiatt join William Morris, or another agency, he may take
along several colleagues at ICM once their contracts expire. ICM
has lost several important agents in recent years, including the
group that founded the Endeavor talent agency.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely why Wiatt left remains unclear. By all accounts, money
was one issue. Wiatt's contract was up shortly and, his associates
said, he was dissatisfied with the pay package offered to him. (His
pay was estimated to be about $1.5 million.) Beyond this, agents at
ICM said, Wiatt had a chilly, even unhappy, relationship with
Jeffrey Berg, the co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The men have different personalities. Berg is cerebral and
sometimes brusque, and has increasingly involved himself in the
Wall Street and high-tech arena. The personable Wiatt is one of the
more popular agents in Hollywood, dispensing advice even to
nonclients and being friendly with the power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Katzenberg, a partner at Dreamworks and a friend of
Wiatt, said the agent had a somewhat rare trait in Hollywood: he
spoke the truth. ``It's so hard to find someone who will speak his
mind and give you a straight answer, even if it's not necessarily
what you want to hear,'' Katzenberg said. ``When it's bad news, he
does it in a generous and calm way. You can't put a value on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ephron, the director of ``You've Got Mail,'' said, ``He's a
great agent and a great friend, and one of the dozens of things
that makes him a great agent is he loves being an agent.''
</P>
<P>
   A further reason for Wiatt's unhappiness was the restructuring
of the agency last year that promoted two agents, Ed Limato, who
represents Gibson, Michelle Pfeiffer and others, and Nancy
Josephson, a top television agent, to the co-presidency. Agents
friendly with Wiatt said he was upset that his powers had
diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt was holding meetings this weekend at his home to discuss
his future. He said he would probably make up his mind in the next
day or two. ``I'm excited, I'm nervous,'' he said. ``It's best that
I left. I'll be a competitor of sorts somewhere else.''

ADVERTISING: THE GREEN GIANT WALKS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Christmas in August for fans of advertising icons as the
character most associated with ``Ho! Ho! Ho!'' next to Santa Claus
makes a comeback meant to be, well, giant.
</P>
<P>
   The character is of course the Jolly Green Giant, who has for
decades symbolized the Green Giant brand of canned and frozen
vegetables. The character ranked third in a recent list compiled by
the trade publication Advertising Age of the century's top 10 ad
icons, behind only the Marlboro Man and Ronald McDonald, but since
the early 1990s the giant had been relegated to a supporting role
in marketing efforts for Green Giant, now owned by the Pillsbury
Co. unit of Diegeo PLC.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference scheduled for Monday in Minneapolis, where
Pillsbury is based, executives will outline plans to capitalize on
the resurgent popularity of familiar ad characters with an
ambitious campaign by Leo Burnett USA in Chicago intended to _ yes,
all together now _ wake the sleeping giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to bring him back in a much bigger way,'' Heidi
Thom, vice president for the frozen foods category at Pillsbury,
said in a telephone interview last week as she offered a preview of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's probably even more relevant than before,'' she added,
``with the emphasis on the importance of eating vegetables for
adults as well as for children.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign returns the giant front and center, presenting him
as a hero in an initial batch of 14 print advertisements with a
retro-chic look that are intended to resemble posters. Gone are
secondary characters like the Little Green Sprout and the residents
of the imaginary land known as the ``Valley of the Jolly Green
Giant.'' They were added when the giant came to television
commercials to address viewer anxieties about a spokes-character
large enough to crush the produce _ and the farmers harvesting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became too complicated and overthought,'' said Gerry
Miller, executive vice president and senior creative director at
Burnett USA, part of Leo Burnett Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you `left brain' something that's a right-brain creation,
you get into all sorts of trouble,'' he added. ``Green Giant didn't
feel like a big, powerful brand anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is also infused with a wry humor not typically
found in pitches for broccoli florets and Brussels sprouts. The ads
carry headlines like ``Give peas a chance,'' ``Can I pick 'em or
what?'' and ``I never met a vegetable I didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a twist to make him more friendly,'' Ms.
Thom said. ``And it shows we don't take ourselves too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that the campaign emanates from the same
creative group at Burnett that works on the striking series of
tongue-in-cheek magazine ads for Altoids mints, which have won
awards for the irreverent way they portray a venerable consumer
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to figure out how such brands interact today with
consumers and their needs,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice I ever had in advertising was from the actor
James Stewart, which was to make the audience your partner,'' he
added. ``It's letting them in on it, not just imparting information
but engendering a smile, not just a sell but allowing them to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant is emblematic of the longtime brand figures that were
once Madison Avenue mainstays but began to lose their appeal in the
1970s and 1980s as consumers deemed them outdated or _ particularly
apt here _ corny. Those figures, often called critters, have been
specialties of Burnett, which also created the giggling Doughboy
for Pillsbury baked goods and the roaring Tony the Tiger for
Kellogg's Frosted Flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Why are characters like the giant; Charlie the Star-Kist tuna,
another Burnett critter; Peanut, and Buddy Lee, the doll
representing Lee jeans, back in vogue?
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand equities are so deeply ingrained,'' said Chris
Mistretta, business team leader for Green Giant frozen foods at
Pillsbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talked to consumers about him, we got such raging
positive results,'' she added. ``They break into the `up in the
valley' song and the `Ho! Ho! Ho!'''
</P>
<P>
   Miller agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These characters resonate in memory and are therefore some ore
hidden away that you can mine again,'' he said, adding: ``They're
big, visual symbols. And when you live in an age where pictures are
fast and words are slow, they allow you to write a brand's
signature quickly _ and in a proprietary way if they're part of
your heritage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The giant's heritage is intertwined with the histories of both
agency and client. The character was born in 1925 as a grumpy giant
in a scruffy bearskin, borrowed by Minnesota Valley Canning Co.
from a book of Grimm's Fairy Tales. In 1928 or 1931 _ the date
varies _ Leo Burnett himself transformed the character into a
friendly representation of nature's bounty by clothing him in a
leafy green suit and replacing his scowl with a smile as wide as a
cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   When Burnett left Erwin, Wasey &AMP; Co. in 1935 to open his own
agency, Minnesota Valley Canning became one of his first three
clients _ and even renamed itself in 1950 after its adman's
brainchild. Burnett later made the giant ``jolly'' by inserting the
word into an ad before it ran in The Ladies' Home Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burnett got into the giant in a big way, like he had met his
soul mate,'' Miller said. ``He understood the power of these
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury plans to spend more than $20 million on the campaign,
which like the Altoids campaign includes ads that are tailored for
specific publications. For example, an ad to run in the ``Best and
Worst Dressed'' issue of People magazine will carry the headline
``When you dress like this you'd better eat your vegetables,'' and
an ad to run in The National Enquirer will carry the headline
``I've been digging up dirt for years.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be promotions, Ms. Thom said, like a cookbook
offer and the placing of 4- and 8-foot-tall plush and inflatable
versions of the giant in the aisles of supermarkets nationwide. In
addition, Pillsbury is considering TV spots and outdoor posters.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference Monday will start a yearlong celebration by
Pillsbury of the giant's 75th anniversary. When the character first
appeared in 1925, he promoted a variety of oversized peas that
Minnesota Valley Canning dubbed ``green giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho-ho-ho-ly hyperbole!

PATENTS: AUCTIONING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (lb) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aficionados of eBay, one of the most popular and successful
commercial sites on the Internet, often spend hours scrolling
through lists of items offered for sale there, submitting bids for
antiques, computer equipment, art, furniture and even cars. But so
far, no one has tried to auction any intellectual property _
patents, trademarks or copyrights _ on the vast site.
</P>
<P>
   Like the seller with a closet full of Elvis dolls or a cherry
1957 Chevy convertible, independent inventors own a piece of
property that many of them would like to sell outright or license
to someone who can turn a patented idea into a tangible product.
But most independent inventors flounder when it comes to getting a
patent into the hands of the right investor or manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that while independent inventors may have
a special idea born of a specific profession, skill or hobby, they
frequently lack business, manufacturing or marketing know-how.
</P>
<P>
   They usually take the first step of contacting the biggest
manufacturers in their field, hoping that their invention can be
licensed and added to the company's product line. That's when they
learn their first hard lesson _ manufacturers are often reluctant
to embrace ideas from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   EBay, though, has demonstrated that buyers can find sellers when
people from around the country or the world come together
electronically, and that has inspired copycat Web sites. Borrowing
from the eBay model, a Texas entrepreneur and inveterate inventor
has started a similar Internet auction clearinghouse for
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   The inventor, Brian Donzis, has faced the ``what next?'' hurdle
that stymies many others. Donzis holds 200 patents for innovations
ranging from construction equipment to immune-system drugs to
tennis-court designs.
</P>
<P>
   One of his biggest successes came in 1977, after he bribed his
way into the hospital room of Dan Pastorini, the injured Houston
Oilers quarterback, and persuaded him to try a protective vest he'd
patented. Donzis sold his vest to the National Football League, and
the rest is rags-to-riches history. Since then, he has made the
patenting and marketing of inventions his life's work, and passion.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that most independent inventors don't have the
nerve, opportunity or foresight to barge into a hospital room,
Donzis hopes to eliminate the need for those circumstances with a
2-month old Web site called PatentAuction.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife is the reason I got into auctioning,'' said Donzis,
67, who lives in San Antonio. ``She got into eBay, and I saw the
excitement among people all over the world in affinity groups who
were in contact with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I had spent so much time beating my brains out
finding a way to let people know what I had, to make a product or
sell a license, that I got interested in the Web as a way to
communicate my stuff and then everybody else's stuff all over the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   PatentAuction's home page bills it as ``a comprehensive online
auction for buying, selling or licensing intellectual property;
patents, patent applications, technical know-how, trade secrets,
trademarks, copyrights, music, art, registered domain names and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first pages on the site is the Intellectual Property
Catalog, which the site ballyhoos as ``the California gold rush,
the diamond mines of South Africa and the Alaskan oil boom all
rolled into one.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, it is something less than any of those. Recently, the
database offered 90 categories of inventions listing 255 patents
for auction.
</P>
<P>
   The descriptions were so brief as to be of little use to an
interested buyer: A patent for a wireless color camera, for
example, was described only as a ``low-cost wireless color camera,
utilizing new CMOS camera technology.'' There was no definition of
CMOS technology for the uninitiated, and no further explanation of
why this particular camera was innovative enough to win a patent
and pique the interest of investors.
</P>
<P>
   A random look at other listings found that they all skimped on
detail, and many had spelling or grammatical errors, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Donzis said that a patent for a pharmaceutical product and
another for an athletic shoe have already been sold through
Patent-Auction, and that eight more involving kitchenware, toys,
medical and cigarette products were ``in the transition stage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of inventors are very, very cautious about going
online,'' Donzis said in explaining the inadequate patent
descriptions submitted by sellers. ``I'm not thrilled with the way
it looks now. But most of them said they'd put out a brief
description, and if someone signs up and wants to talk to them,
they'll provide more. We're trying to convince them to show the
patent and provide more details. But we just got started, and I
think people will relax as they see things moving.''
</P>
<P>
   Each patent listing is followed by a form allowing interested
buyers to submit a bid. Bidders must first register with the site;
they get a user name and a password. Winning bidders pay
PatentAuction a buyer's premium of 15 percent on purchases up to
$50,000 and 10 percent on anything higher.
</P>
<P>
   The site cautions that bids of more than $100,000 ``require a
financial authorization form,'' but the form included asks only for
a name, street and e-mail addresses, phone and Social Security
numbers, birth date and a signature.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers are charged a ``display package fee'' that is
automatically credited to the commission they must also pay if a
patent sells. The commission can be hefty _ 20 percent for patents
sold for $2,000 or less, 15 percent on sales up to $7,500, and 10
percent on sales up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The display fee ranges from $195 to $595, and buys the seller a
180-day posting on the site. If the patent idea does not sell in
that time, the posting can be renewed for six months, free of
charge. The costlier fees include extra pages on the site for
additional descriptions of the patent or graphics, and translation
into one or two foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
   The site assures buyers and sellers that ``PatentAuction
facilitates the tedious aspects of technology transfer,'' promising
that a certified check or credit-card charge will be deposited into
``an escrow account managed by a well-known international
intellectual-property law firm.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Donzis says he does not just post the patent on the
Web site. He also e-mails the listing to U.S. embassies around the
world through an agreement with the Commerce Department to
encourage the export of intellectual property, and to a roster of
Web sites and databases that he believes represent interested
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   He also offers consulting services for inventors who need help
with business plans, financing, industrial design, building
prototypes, or marketing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd have more sellers than buyers, but we have a
lot more buyers, maybe 20-to-1,'' Donzis said. He adds patents
every day, he said, and remains optimistic. At the bottom of each
page of PatentAuction, he has added a caveat: ``This site and its
method of doing business are patent pending.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington DC 20231.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ For every small business owner who has struggled
with personal computers that crash, printers that won't print and
networks that don't network, Sheldon Laube says he has the answer.
His new company, Centerbeam Inc., will offer complete outsourcing
of information technology, all for a single monthly per-user fee.
</P>
<P>
   Laube, the co-founder of U.S. Web Inc. and former chief
technology officer for Novell Inc. and Price Waterhouse, said
Centerbeam would offer the first truly ``free'' PC, as in free of
hassles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea is you don't buy computers anymore,'' said
Laube, who intends to announce Centerbeam's plans on Monday. ``You
buy a service from us and we buy all the pieces and worry about
making them work.''
</P>
<P>
   For the monthly per-user fee of $165, customers get PCs loaded
with Microsoft Corp.'s forthcoming Windows 2000 operating system,
the Microsoft Office suite of applications, a wireless network
using equipment from Lucent Technologies Inc., and a fast link to
Centerbeam and the Internet using a type of high-speed telephone
connection known as digital subscriber line, or DSL. Centerbeam
will provide remote management and service, including backing up
all data every day, and automatic software upgrades. The personal
computers will be upgraded at least every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the venture gains credibility from the track record
of Laube, who directed the first major installation of Lotus Notes
for Price Waterhouse, and who helped U.S. Web _ now known as US
Web/CKS _ create its business of providing Internet technology and
marketing services on a contract basis. But they said it might be a
tough sell to companies that already had substantial investments in
information technology unless Centerbeam can show clear evidence of
cost savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the large-account market, we've seen a clear trend toward
technology being treated almost as a utility, and this brings that
cost-per-seat model to small accounts,'' said Charles Smulders, an
analyst with Dataquest. ``I think there will be a period of concept
testing, and it will be very important for Centerbeam to use
companies as evidence of the worth of their offering.''
</P>
<P>
   Based in Santa Clara, Calif., Centerbeam raised $20 million in
its first round of venture capital. Investors included Crosspoint
Venture Partners, Accell Partners, New Enterprise Associates,
Microsoft and US Web/CKS. Laube said he was in negotiations with a
major personal computer manufacturer to be the exclusive supplier
of hardware, and that the service would commence as soon as
Microsoft makes Windows 2000 available, which is expected this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Laube said Centerbeam would not have been possible without
Windows 2000, which promises to be much more stable than previous
Microsoft operating systems, or without inexpensive PCs, wireless
networking and digital subscriber lines. ``The key is the pieces
have all come into place,'' he said. ``That's why this is the
moment.''

   AGREEMENT BETWEEN UNION AND AMERICAN AIR COLLAPSES
</P>
<P>
   A tentative agreement between American Airlines and the union
representing its pilots fell apart over the weekend, dashing hopes
that a bitter eight-month dispute over the acquisition of Reno Air
would soon be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Allied Pilots Association, which represents American's 9,500
pilots, announced late Friday that it had accepted a mediator's
proposed settlement of the disagreement ``with certain
amendments.'' But American, which agreed to the proposal last
month, said that the changes made by the union were so great that
they amounted to a renegotiation of the proposed settlement.

   MINOR TREMORS CAUSE INTERNET SLIDE
</P>
<P>
   The prices of Internet stocks are a Rorschach test that measures
the mix of hope and fear in the minds of investors who are willing
to soar without a safety net. That is why the most minor rumblings
among Internet companies _ fears of slow sales growth and increased
price competition for Internet service providers _ have led to
extreme drops in the prices of most Internet shares recently.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. SETS RULES ON TALKING TO PRESS
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, the United Nations has issued
written guidelines on how its officials will deal with the news
media. And to the surprise of many, the new rules, initially
approved by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in April and now being
circulated in final form, allow almost anyone to speak on the
record. How this will work in practice is something else, of
course. The organization has often been secretive about even the
most mundane information.

   START-UP OFFERS TO END PC HASSLES
</P>
<P>
   Centerbeam, a new company started by Sheldon Laube, the
co-founder of U.S. Web, plans to solve the computer hassles of
small businesses by offering to provide a complete system and

   RETAILERS TURN TO PITCH BY E-MAIL
</P>
<P>
   After experimenting with various marketing techniques, Internet
retailers have finally found a cheap way to virtually guarantee
visitors and sales: e-mail. Carefully aimed e-mail messages may be
the best means to cut through the clutter of the medium and deliver
a personalized pitch to the consumer.

   GOTTI'S JAILHOUSE PHILOSOPHY
</P>
<P>
   Last week, everyone was talking about Hillary Clinton's remarks
on Bill in Talk magazine. But the most compelling reading about
family life could be found in The New York Daily News, which ran a
two-part series based on videotapes of visits to the former crime
boss John J. Gotti in a federal penitentiary.

   ADS WAKE A JOLLY SLEEPING GIANT
</P>
<P>
   The Jolly Green Giant, who has for decades symbolized the Green
Giant brand of canned and frozen vegetables, is making a comeback.
The character, which ranked third in a recent list of the century's
top 10 ad icons, had been relegated to a supporting role. But a new
campaign returns the giant front and center, presenting him as a
hero in an initial batch of 14 print ads with a retro-chic look.
Gone are secondary characters like the Little Green Sprout and the
residents of the ``Valley of the Jolly Green Giant.''

E-MAIL ADS BEING USED TO LURE CUSTOMERS TO RETAILERS' WEB SITES
</HEADLINE>

 By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After experimenting with various marketing techniques, Internet
retailers have finally found a cheap way to virtually guarantee
visitors and sales _ and, predictably, they cannot get enough of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing darling du jour is electronic mail. In recent
months, E-commerce companies have learned that carefully aimed
e-mail messages may be the best means to cut through the clutter of
the medium and deliver a personalized pitch to the consumer _ not
to mention profits to the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce executives say the trend will very likely produce a
glut of what is known as ``opt-in'' e-mail _ so called because,
unlike unsolicited commercial messages, consumers agree to receive
it. Though e-mail overload threatens to dull the effectiveness of
such campaigns in the long term, for now, companies are stepping up
their e-mail efforts in hopes of establishing a dialogue with
customers before their rivals do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opt-in e-mail is a critical part of our marketing strategy
going forward,'' said Kent Anderson, president of Macys.com, a
division of Federated Department Stores, which sends 12 to 15
e-mail messages annually to each person on a customer list that he
says now numbers hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with most companies' mailing lists, those people
signed up to receive e-mail updates and offers while they were
visiting Macy's Web site, and they can unsubscribe to the list at
any time. They can also stipulate that Macy's not share their
e-mail addresses and other personal information with outside
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Like other executives, Anderson said e-mail's chief value was
that it enabled companies to conduct direct marketing campaigns
without having to pay millions of dollars for postage. ``We can
take demographic elements and say, `Give me everybody who looks
like this customer,' and test different offers, so the odds are
much better they'll respond,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Anderson said, customers who respond to the opt-in
e-mail messages by visiting Macy's Web site buy, on average, five
to seven times more frequently than other visitors to the site.
This so-called conversion rate of visitors to buyers ``is why
everybody likes this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, ``click-through'' rates, or the rate at which people
visit a Web site after viewing an advertisement or a promotional
message, are sharply higher for opt-in e-mail campaigns than for
Web banner advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester Research, an Internet consulting firm,
such e-mail marketing messages generate click-through rates of
between 10 and 20 percent. Banner advertisements, on the other
hand, have seen click-through rates fall to below 1 percent in
recent months. Given those numbers, it is not surprising that in a
recent Forrester survey of 50 Internet companies, more than
two-thirds said they viewed opt-in e-mail messages as ``important''
or ``very important'' to their marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Sugar, director of new media for J. Crew, said that the
company had two types of opt-in e-mail campaigns. The first is a
message sent every Thursday night, giving recipients early access
to the site's weekly sale items, which are posted to the public at
noon on Friday. Sugar said that J. Crew had compiled a list of
e-mail addresses ``in the millions'' by offering the site's
visitors the opportunity to sign up for such updates.
</P>
<P>
   The second type of e-mail message is sent to distinct segments
of J. Crew's mailing list, informing recipients of new products or
promotions about once a month. In those mailings, Sugar said, the
company sifts through customer demographic and purchase information
and sends different people different offers. Or, for those who have
not ordered anything online, the company will sometimes send an
e-mail coupon for $20 off a purchase of $80 or more, as it did last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar said that J. Crew was forecasting much better response and
conversion rates from its e-mail campaigns than from its off-line
direct-mailing efforts. ``With our ability to slice and dice the
data,'' he said, ``we can send personalized offers to women buyers,
men buyers, or men buyers who only buy black medium-sized shirts _
and the cost is so much less, we can focus on more personalized
offers like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said, though, that companies with little or no
direct-marketing experience could have difficulty running such
programs, given the extensive data base analysis needed to send
millions of e-mail messages to specific client segments _ unless
the companies want to risk alienating recipients with misguided
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, companies that conduct e-mail promotions on
behalf of Internet retailers have reported brisk demand for their
services in recent months. These companies, like Messagemedia and
Digital Impact, take opt-in e-mail lists compiled by clients and
run the mailings on their behalf, analyzing results and refining
the pitches as the campaign proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The companies maintain what they say are strict policies
regarding the privacy of consumers' personal information, and offer
plenty of opportunities to be removed from the mailing list.
Clients typically pay these firms 2 cents to 4 cents each e-mail
delivered, while maintaining complete ownership of the customers'
data.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, these companies often use technology that can recognize
the sophistication of the recipient's e-mail software. As a result,
users who can receive more sophisticated e-mail messages _ which
essentially look like a Web page _ are sent messages that include
rich graphics and photos of merchandise. When recipients click on
these images, they are immediately sent to a Web page where they
can buy the product.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forrester, such capabilities can double the
response rate of a mailing, though many Internet users can't
receive such messages.
</P>
<P>
   Internet businesses can also rely on opt-in mailing lists
generated by third parties like Netcreations, which solicits e-mail
addresses on numerous Web sites, including Alta Vista, the Internet
search service. By asking visitors if they would like to receive
e-mail about various topics and products, Netcreations has gleaned
close to three million e-mail addresses, said Rosalind Resnick, the
company's president.
</P>
<P>
   Netcreations then sends e-mail offers to segments of that list
on behalf of clients like Dell Computer and Microsoft, Ms. Resnick
said. Netcreations does not disclose the recipients' names or
personal information to those companies, she added.
</P>
<P>
   No matter who sends them, e-mail marketing messages will have to
become more refined, analysts agree _ given the number of
e-commerce sites already using e-mail to maintain relationships
with customers and the growing number of companies planning to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the sites I look at understand that you have to
approach the customer as a valuable asset, and you have to give
them something of value,'' said Anderson of Macy's.com. ``E-mailing
them just to say the sky is blue, and reminding them that Macy's is
out there is a problem.''

`AS YOU LIKE IT': AS ROSALIND GROWS, SO DOES GWYNETH PALTROW 
</HEADLINE>
 (rm) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ For a moment it looks like Oscar night all
over again. There she is in a Grace Kelly ball gown, as pale and
luminous as a moonbeam. Yes, it's unmistakably the same swan-necked
Gwyneth Paltrow who accepted the Academy Award for best actress for
``Shakespeare in Love'' earlier this year. Yet there's something
not quite right about the picture.
</P>
<P>
   That dress, for example: it fits perfectly, but it seems to be
wearing her, as the saying goes, rather than vice versa. Ms.
Paltrow curiously appears less at home in such attire than the
person with whom she is sharing the stage at the moment, another
ice-blonde actress named Megan Dodds. What is it that is making Ms.
Paltrow so self-conscious? Just opening-night jitters?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the awkwardness is as deliberate a choice as her
tightly pulled-back hair. Portraying Rosalind in the Williamstown
Theater Festival's jaunty and bumpy new production of ``As You Like
It,'' directed by Barry Edelstein, Ms. Paltrow turns her entrance
into a witty comment on her image as an elegant clothes hanger,
while reminding us that there is a sharp and playful intelligence
beneath the gloss.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosalind who climbs onto the stage through a trap door,
revealing plenty of the well-turned leg beneath her long skirt, is
both spirited and uncertain, a colt still waiting to grow out of
awkwardness. But just watch how her confidence blossoms once she
changes into something more comfortable. In this case it clearly
takes some time in men's clothing to make a woman out of a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Let's all heave a sigh of relief. Returning to the theater where
she cut her teeth as a performer and where her mother, Blythe
Danner, has long reigned as a favorite actress, Ms. Paltrow
winningly claims for herself a role stamped by interpreters from
Lillie Langtry to Vanessa Redgrave. Granted, she has already proved
she is quite capable of bringing flair to Elizabethan-style speech
and courtship by cross-dressing in ``Shakespeare in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Paltrow isn't recycling cinematic tricks. Her take on
Rosalind has a boldness and broadness, a way of suggesting
spontaneity in stylized terms, that could work only in the theater.
If there is occasionally a curl of affectation in her line
readings, you never doubt that Ms. Paltrow knows exactly what she
is saying and why she is saying it. It is a thought-through
performance that refuses to coast on charm and is poised between
delicate moments of insight and comic exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot always be said of Edelstein's production, which
deliberately emphasizes the artificial nature of Shakespeare's
great pastoral comedy. The evening's themes and its blend of
merriment and melancholy are established with precision and
inventiveness in its opening scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But as the production continues, its controlled balance is
tipped toward a looser, anything-goes burlesque, typical of
summertime Shakespeare but less than worthy of the higher ambitions
in evidence here.
</P>
<P>
   The show doesn't drag. But it needs to whittle down its farcical
elements to set off properly not only Ms. Paltrow's fully
integrated performance, but also that of Mark Linn-Baker, as the
play's verbally dextrous clown, and of Michael Cumpsty, who gives
an intriguing new edge to the sardonic and brooding Jaques.
</P>
<P>
   Edelstein's central conceit is a good one. The production _
which makes prominent use of original music by Mark Bennett,
suavely rendered by a four-piece band and the singer-actor Keith
Byron Kirk _ uses jazz to reflect the play's sense of creative
improvisation in life. All the characters in ``As You Like It''
are, in a sense, trying to figure out just what they do like, what
tones and rhythms suit their specific selves. The final sorting out
of lovers, orchestrated by Rosalind and providence, is a
progression into sweet harmony after a series of experimental
riffs.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, when we first meet Rosalind and Celia (Ms. Dodds),
her cousin and the daughter of the Duke who ousted Rosalind's
father (Byron Jennings takes on both roles with gusto), they are
playing dress-up, trying on different attitudes with props pulled
from a trunk. It is Celia, played with appealing, waspish wryness
by Ms. Dodds, who takes the initiative and shows the greater elan
here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paltrow's Rosalind, more than any I've seen, is all too
aware of her position as a barely tolerated outsider in her uncle's
court, and this insecurity heightens her callowness. When she first
spots Orlando (Alessandro Nivola), who comes to challenge the
usurping duke's favorite wrestler (an amusingly gangsterish Mark K.
Smaltz), her response is as goony as that of a lovesick teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the game of dress-up begins in earnest, when Rosalind,
disguised as a boy, flees from her uncle's court to the forest of
Arden, does she begin seriously to sort out who she is. Arden is
where her exiled father dwells; it is also where Orlando,
dispossessed by his vengeful brother (Stephen Barker Turner), seeks
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In the celebrated scenes in which Rosalind, as the boy Ganymede,
tutors the unwitting Orlando in the aspects of love, Ms. Paltrow
makes it clear that she is giving herself an education as well. The
deception forces this Rosalind to temper and channel the rushing
current of previously unknown passions, and Ms. Paltrow does some
lovely things with tempo and inflection to chart her character's
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   One wishes that the Orlando here were more up to the challenge
his Rosalind presents. Nivola, an actor of chiseled handsomeness
and willowy build, is delightful when he is simply reacting,
whether in wonder, bewilderment or enthusiasm. But he is less at
home with the language than Ms. Paltrow is.
</P>
<P>
   As the mock-classical, rustic lovers of pastoral idylls, Silvius
and Phoebe, John Ellison Conlee and Angelina Phillips are straight
out of Dogpatch, as is the lusty goatherd, Audrey, as embodied by
the ever-vivid Lea DeLaria. They are all funny at moments, but
often in pandering ways that need to be reined in.
</P>
<P>
   As Audrey's suitor and the resident philosopher-clown,
Touchstone, Linn-Baker, best known for the television series
``Perfect Strangers,'' has an assured, ebullient delivery that does
indeed become the touchstone of the play's love of language. And
Cumpsty is a fascinating Jaques, a reformed libertine who has still
to come to terms with his own erotic impulses.
</P>
<P>
   Cumpsty sounds the evening's most insistent notes of darkness
with style and wit, and it's a shame that by the production's end
it has no place for the subtleties of his performance. Even Narelle
Sissons' setting, which begins as an elegant study in surrealism
and makes droll use of blatantly fake livestock, seems to become
garish and overblown.
</P>
<P>
   So does the music, which turns Hymen's ode to marriage into the
schmaltzy standard ``What a Wonderful World,'' sung (nicely enough)
by Larry Marshall as Orlando's trusty old retainer, here bizarrely
transformed into a Cab Calloway figure.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, eclipses the genuine grace of Ms.
Paltrow's final metamorphosis, when Rosalind returns undisguised
for the wedding scene. In a simple, fluid white dress (the
good-looking costumes are by Anita Yavich) that is eons away from
the stiff ball gown of her opening scene, this Rosalind has a new
composure combined with the vulnerable air of someone who has
emerged from protective disguise to face the world as herself.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paltrow, too, has undergone transformations since she last
appeared in Williamstown, as Nina in ``The Seagull'' five years
ago. At that time, she had the shimmering presence that would
translate so beguilingly to film but little of the necessary
assurance for a complicated part. This actress' growth into
maturity becomes an enchanted mirror in ``As You Like It'' for that
of the character she plays.

U.N. ISSUES GUIDELINES ON DEALING WITH THE PRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ For the first time in its history, the United
Nations has issued written guidelines on how its officials will
deal with the news media. And to the surprise of many, the new
rules allow almost anyone to speak on the record.
</P>
<P>
   How this will work in practice is something else, of course. The
organization, many of whose member countries are not known for
condoning a free press, has often been extremely secretive about
even the most mundane information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations is committed to being open and transparent
in its dealings with the press,'' say the new guidelines, initially
approved by Secretary-General Kofi Annan in April and now being
circulated in final form to all the organization's departments.
</P>
<P>
   Under Annan's predecessor, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, most officials
in the Secretariat, the organization's international headquarters
in New York, were forbidden to give interviews, or were afraid to
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of principle, every member of the Secretariat may
speak to the press, within limits,'' the new policy states. Those
limits are three: that an official speak ``only within your area of
competence and responsibility''; that the person speaking ``provide
facts, not opinions or comments,'' and that ``sensitive issues''
should be left to designated people within a department or the
organization's official representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Every employee in effect becomes responsible for judging what a
``sensitive issue'' is and when to buck it up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   No one, however, will be allowed ``to presume or pretend to
speak for the secretary-general.'' This follows reports last year
in several newspapers quoting ``confidants'' of Annan, whose
opinions the secretary-general later disavowed as unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, an American, is the
secretary-general's official voice. Shashi Tharoor, an Indian with
a string of books to his name, is the secretary-general's
communications director. Both have argued for a more liberal
information policy, as has the organization's inspector-general,
Karl Theodor Paschke, a German.
</P>
<P>
   Annan remains aloof from the U.N. press corps, holding very few
news conferences at headquarters. But he makes many public
appearances in the United States and abroad, and is considered to
be a great asset to the organization, which is often under attack
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting terminology familiar to American reporters working
around government departments, the U.N. guidelines list three kinds
of conversations that may take place with journalists: on the
record, not for attribution (other than to cite a ``U.N.
official,'' for instance) and on deep background, with no mention
of a source.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Journalists develop their own relationships with U.N. officials
with or without guidelines, but the new rules may relax the general
atmosphere at U.N. headquarters, and more phone calls may be
returned.
</P>
<P>
   But the policy change does not help television reporters much.
Cameras are still severely restricted and confined to a few static
positions to record formal diplomatic exchanges or brief encounters
with passing officials.
</P>
<P>
   For reporters, the potential land mine in the two pages of
guidelines may be at the bottom. Rule 13 says: ``Officials should
not feel that they have to answer every question, in particular any
hypothetical ones.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ROSSORE, ITALY _ On his first day of vacation in a secluded
villa in Tuscany on Saturday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair
donned a white linen shirt, grasped the hand of his wife, Cherie,
and, smiling tensely, admired the view.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 British and Italian reporters, armed with
microphones, television cameras and satellite dishes, stood roped
before him, straining under the urgency of questions about his
Tuscan holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been coming here for 20 years _ we really like it
here,'' Blair explained, a pleading look in his eyes. ``I don't
want to spoil anyone else's holiday. I just want to have a good
time with Cherie and the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is unlikely. This is Blair's third contested vacation
as prime minister, and this summer, under the general heading
``Chianti Socialism,'' the British press has whipped the prime
minister's use of a villa that is owned by a foreign government
into the kind of sizzling front-page fever once reserved for the
Profumo scandal or royal divorces.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Blair is not the only European leader spending the summer
in Italy. Gerhard Schroeder of Germany is in Positano, the prime
minister of Belgium is in Sardinia. Cynics might see the British
treatment of Blair's holiday abroad as another example of how the
British press inflates facts and discards objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   But it actually seems to conform to a more old-fashioned British
trait: respect for tradition. The British, who are so fond of
Tuscany they call the region ``Chiantishire,'' have established a
custom of criticizing the prime minister's holidays there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Blair goes to Tuscany, it's like Henry VIII _ people give
over their stately homes to him and become his servants,'' Bruce
Johnston, the Rome correspondent of The Daily Telegraph and the
dean of Blair holiday reporting, explained.
</P>
<P>
   Packs of sun-blistered British reporters have filled nearby
hotels, combing the beaches and restaurants for locals enraged by
the Blairs' use of a government-owned property. (One enterprising
English journalist rented horses for himself and his daughters to
investigate the estate and interview the groom.)
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, headlines in England have promised huge protests by
local leftists, environmentalists, and even English fox hunting
enthusiasts, angry over the prime minister's efforts to curb the
sport in England. (It isn't one in Tuscany).
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, however, the only tangible sign of discontent was a
thin red banner hung from a tower in the resort of Viareggio, more
than 10 miles away, by a local Communist leader, which read, ``Tony
Blair you are not welcome. Go on Holyday ((sic)) to Kosovo.''
Turnout for a protest was small, however, and may have been fueled
less by rage than appetite _ the local Communist Party was holding
its annual feast (pasta and a Bakunin wine bar) next door.
</P>
<P>
   But Blair's resort choices help fuel press fury. In August of
1997, the Blairs were guests at a neo-classical villa on a 10-acre
estate near San Gimignano (known as ``San Jimmy''' to English
expatriates) owned by a millionaire Labor Party member of
parliament, Geoffrey Robinson, who later had to resign from his
post as paymaster general under accusations of tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Blairs and their three children stayed at a
50-room villa owned by Prince Girolamo Strozzi, a prominent local
winemaker. That holiday buckled under newspaper charges that their
hosts had been forced to move into the servant's quarters to give
the Blairs privacy.
</P>
<P>
   English journalists on the scene also reported indignantly that
during their grueling stakeouts under the hot Tuscan sun, the
prince did not offer them a single glass of his local Vernaccia
wine.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Blair accepted an invitation from Vannino Chiti, the
president of the Tuscany region, to stay at Villa del Gombo, a
former seaside presidential estate, tucked in the San Rossore
natural park, which is now owned by the regional government.
</P>
<P>
   The local authorities are spending almost a half million dollars
this year to restore the villa and the surrounding nature park,
which they hope to revive as an official guest house and high-level
conference center. The estate is quiet, secure and isolated, but
the 1950s modernist lodge, surrounded by 7,500 acres of woods,
seems less like a classic Tuscan luxury villa then a Soviet VIP
guest house _ in fact, Tito once slept there.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is not paying rent and has instead pledged to give money
to a local charity, though he has not named the sum. But British
headlines have also hammered at Blair's unpatriotic preference for
Tuscany over Brighton or Cornwall. His Italian host, Chiti, seemed
baffled by those charges. ``I myself am planning to go to Scotland
at the end of August,'' he said. ``Nobody in Tuscany is demanding
to know why I am not going to Orbetello.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer's scandal blossomed in full when British newspapers
reported that locals would be denied access to about three miles of
beach in front of the villa throughout the Blairs' stay.
</P>
<P>
   As local officials explained, plaintively, there had never been
public access to that beach, except by boat. But the headlines in
Britain (``Tony's No-Go Zone'') were so lurid that the prime
minister's office issued a statement on Friday, asking local
authorities to re-open a beach that had actually never been closed
because it had never been open.
</P>
<P>
   A few locals can be found who complain that the Blairs are
vacationing at Tuscan taxpayers' expense, but that requires a
tabloid reporter's zeal and expense account. Mostly, Tuscans seem
confused by the fuss from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a problem with it, what is the problem, exactly?''
said Lia Ghilarducci, a retired cook in Viareggio. ``Everybody else
vacations in Tuscany. Why can't he?''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Cool air will spread from eastern Canada into the Northeastern
states in the wake of a cold front Monday. The chilliest air will
be over northern parts of New York and New England where daytime
temperatures will average more than 10 degrees below normal. Gusty
winds from the northwest will add to the chill of the day in these
areas. A few showers will form over the mountains. Farther south,
plenty of sunshine will be mixed with a few puffy clouds from
southern New England to the Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   Much cooler air will reach southern Virginia and North Carolina
as a cold front moves off the coast. Clouds and showers will linger
in the morning, but less humid air and sunshine will arrive by
afternoon. Elsewhere in the Southeast, very warm and humid
conditions will persist. Clusters of thunderstorms will erupt in
the sultry air, especially over Florida and near the Gulf of Mexico
coast.
</P>
<P>
   An area of clouds and thundershowers will move east from
northern Minnesota to the western Great Lakes Monday morning as a
surge of very warm, humid air is forced to rise over cool air near
the ground. Monday afternoon, a few strong thunderstorms will erupt
in the hot air from southern Minnesota to eastern Iowa and western
Illinois. Meanwhile, heat and plentiful sunshine will persist over
most of the central and southern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, afternoon thunderstorms will be common over the
central and southern Rockies as high-level winds draw moist air
from the south. Elsewhere, mainly dry and warm conditions will
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DELUGE
</P>
<P>
   When an inch of rain falls in 24 hours, it's a wet day. When
nearly an inch of rain falls in 15 minutes as it did in Omaha,
Neb., early Saturday, it's a deluge. Bursts of rain are most common
in summer when the vigorous air currents in thunderstorms combine
with moisture-laden air. Rainfall rates at the center of
thunderstorms are often over three inches an hour, but any given
spot usually stays in the heaviest rain for only a few minutes. The
greatest burst of rain ever recorded in the United States occurred
in Unionville, Md., on July 4, 1956, when 1.23 inches of rain fell
in only one minute.

   ``I never mugged anyone. That was my goal every day, to steal

STAR-STRUCK GIRLS ACCUSE A MEXICAN IDOL OF ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico _ Karina Yapor's parents fight back tears as
they recall how their daughter left home when she was 12, carrying
her Bible and her school bag, to begin music lessons at a boarding
school from Gloria Trevi, Mexico's most famous rock star.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Karina is at the center of a scandal rocking a
Spanish-speaking entertainment world that stretches from Madrid,
Spain, to Mexico City. Her parents have accused Ms. Trevi and her
manager, Sergio Andrade, of preying on the youthful ambitions and
adoration of Karina and then sexually abusing her during her years
in their care as an aspiring starlet.
</P>
<P>
   The Yapors have adopted a baby boy whom Karina, then 14,
conceived and later abandoned while living with Andrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just keep praying these people will let our girl come home
now,'' Teresa Yapor, Karina's mother, said, weeping softly in her
living room in a desert subdivision here. For half a year, her
daughter, now 16, has been nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Several other young women have emerged to accuse Ms. Trevi of
luring them and dozens of other girls into Andrade's itinerant cult
of pop music and abusive sex over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   One woman says in a best-selling book that when she was one of
Andrade's hopefuls at the age of 14, the manager beat her with his
belt and forced sex on her, and then kept her beneath his desk.
Another woman says Andrade made pornographic movies using 12-and
13-year-old girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing as monstrous as this has occurred in the history of
Mexican show business,'' Pati Chapoy, an on-screen personality at
TV Azteca who has known Andrade for 19 years, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Yapors and two young women have lodged parallel criminal
complaints. Neither Ms. Trevi nor Andrade has been charged with
crimes, although prosecutors in Chihuahua and Mexico City have
subpoenaed them for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Trevi and Andrade _ an obese, unkempt man who is the
brother of a governing-party senator _ have gone underground. They
are playing cat-and-mouse with police, joining a list of drug
traffickers, a former governor and other wealthy Mexicans who thumb
their noses at law enforcement here.
</P>
<P>
   A man who said he was their lawyer called television stations
last month to announce that Ms. Trevi would appear publicly to deny
the swirling accusations, but she did not. The lawyer has
disappeared, and leaders of Mexican bar associations said in
interviews that he was unknown to them.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Gonzalez, president of a network of Gloria Trevi fan clubs,
said in an interview that Ms. Trevi, now 29, phoned him a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said she told him: ``Don't worry, I'm in a safe place in
Mexico. I'm innocent, and the little girl will return home. This'll
turn out OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and television stations across Latin America and
Spain have made the rock star's fall as tumultuous a spectacle as
her glitzy rise.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trevi, whose real name is Gloria de los Angeles Trevino,
shot to fame in the early 1990s as an iconoclast who sang of
youthful frustration while undressing male fans. She posed for
pinup calendars that made her Mexico's No. 1 heart-throb. Offstage,
she was outspoken about topics like virginity and drugs, attracting
the admiration of some intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of our most authentic artists,'' Elena Poniatowska,
a respected journalist, wrote in a 1995 profile of the rock star.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographing Ms. Trevi's image behind the scenes was Andrade,
43, a successful pop composer with his own production company and a
stable of female musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trevi was a blockbuster success partly because Andrade and
Televisa, Mexico's largest television network, promoted her to
adults as a sex symbol even as they were marketing her zany antics
to audiences of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an example of how television can magnify audacious
little spectacles, transforming performers into symbols of
rebellion,'' Carlos Monsivais, an intellectual who wrote an
admiring essay in 1991 on Ms. Trevi, said in an interview. ``The
conclusion I draw now is that the show-business culture makes
people so crazy they even feel themselves beyond the law.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During Ms. Trevi's rise, Televisa organized a beauty contest for
little bikini-clad Trevi imitators, and thousands of first-graders
were carried to her concerts by their mothers. One fan was Karina,
who at age 8 shrieked in delight at the sight of Ms. Trevi's wild,
beribboned mane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria! I love you!'' Mrs. Yapor recalled Karina shouting at
one of Ms. Trevi's concerts. Karina screamed so insistently at
successive concerts that Ms. Trevi began to distinguish her from
her thousands of other tiny fans, and in 1994, when Karina was 12,
Ms. Trevi invited her and her mother to her hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look how big you've gotten,'' Ms. Trevi said, stroking
Karina's red hair, Ms. Yapor recalled. At the time, Andrade had
recently divorced his fourth wife, Aline Hernandez, whom he had
married when she was his 15-year-old student. Ms. Trevi urged Mrs.
Yapor to take Karina to Mexico City to try out for a scholarship to
attend Andrade's music school.
</P>
<P>
   After the audition, Mrs. Yapor was introduced to Andrade, a
brooding man who paced his hotel room throughout their
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karina's a little diamond that just needs polishing,'' he told
Mrs. Yapor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They painted this like a huge opportunity,'' Mrs. Yapor
recalled. ``Gloria said she had a little sister just like Karina.
It was very difficult not to trust these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Days later, Karina's parents agreed to enroll her, signing a
notarized statement giving two women working with Andrade
permission to travel freely with Karina in their custody, even
outside Mexico. But the day after Karina's departure for Mexico
City in November 1994, her mother panicked, telephoning Andrade's
office to plead for Karina to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother, please!'' Karina responded. ``This is my opportunity.
Don't make me come home!''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Karina called home every week, but the pace of the
calls then fell off to once every month or two. Later, Mrs. Yapor
discovered the phones for Andrade's school had been disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   Karina's first visit home came a year later. She played the
piano beautifully, but her face was covered with acne and she
seemed troubled and distant. After that, there were four other
visits over three years. She was never home for her birthdays or
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Trevi accompanied Karina on one visit home in 1997, and both
of them warned the Yapors not to read a forthcoming book by Ms.
Hernandez, Andrade's former wife. Ms. Trevi said it was filled with
lies.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``To Glory Through Hell,'' published last year,
contained the first public accusations. Like Karina, Ms. Hernandez
was recruited by Ms. Trevi, and her book details the process of
psychological subjection by which she says Andrade gradually cut
her off from her family and dominated her sexually before marrying
her when she was 15.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the image of Ms. Trevi as a bold and independent
woman, Ms. Hernandez portrayed her as a passive waif so compliant
with Andrade's demands that she helped him overwhelm dozen of
teen-age girls and at his request frequently joined him in bed with
Ms. Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   The Yapors said they did not read the book. But soon after its
publication, authorities called to inform them that Karina had been
living in Spain with Andrade and a dozen other girls, where she had
given birth at age 15 to a baby, Francisco Ariel. When Karina
abandoned the malnourished 7-month-old infant last year, he weighed
just 8 pounds. The Yapors agreed to take custody, and an official
flew the child from Madrid to Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Yapors filed their criminal suit accusing Ms.
Trevi and her manager of kidnapping and of corrupting the morals of
a minor. Their suit has encouraged other women to come forward to
testify about abuses. One of Andrade's former students brought the
Yapors a pornographic 1996 calendar, produced by Andrade, which
features Karina as its April pinup. She was then 14, wearing a tiny
bikini and a come-hither gaze.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Yapor spread Miss April out on her table for a reporter
to see, she broke again into tears, provoking wails from Karina's
20-month-old child, crawling at her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't give Karina to you,'' Mrs. Yapor muttered. ``You've
wronged her, now let her come home.''

 ANOTHER OUTAGE FOR EBAY  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Online auctioneer eBay suffered its third major system crash
yesterday in the past two months, when it was rendered totally
inaccessible for nearly 10 hours following routine early morning
maintenance.
<P>
   Even after access was restored around 2 p.m., the site still was
not fully operational. Some auctions remained in a holding pattern.
</P>
<P>
   EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove said the system was being
restored to life ``slowly and carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   He said an initial hardware problem was corrected in the wee
hours of the morning, but a separate inability to reconnect the
site to the Internet prevented users around the world from logging
on.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time eBay had experienced a network problem,
Pursglove noted. The company's engineers were still working to
determine the cause of the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   EBay's engineers are growing increasingly experienced with
chasing down technical snafus following a slew of system troubles.
The most severe, a software glitch, caused the site to crash for 22
hours in June. That didn't sit well with investors, and eBay's
share price subsequently tumbled 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The stock didn't fare much better yesterday, dropping more than
10 percent to $83.25.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the June outage, eBay said as much as $5 million
had been shaved from its second-quarter revenues. The San Jose
company does not yet know the cost of this latest blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Whitman, eBay's chief executive, said late last month that
steps had been taken to install a ``warm backup'' system capable of
restoring at least partial service within a couple of hours of a
crash.
</P>
<P>
   But Pursglove said the warm backup was never even brought into
play yesterday. Without a network connection, he noted, there was
no need to utilize emergency resources.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would extend all pending auctions affected
by the crash and refund fees paid by customers.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Zeilstra, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read in New York,
said that while existing eBay users likely won't abandon their
favorite Beanie Baby emporium, the continuing technical snags may
prove troublesome in attracting new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a great customer base, but there are millions and
millions and millions of others who have yet to try an auction,''
she said. ``EBay used to be the only game in town. They're not
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it has had a strong head start. As of the end of June,
eBay said it had 5.6 million registered users, up more than 550
percent from a year before. It hosted 29.4 million auctions in the
quarter ended June 30, compared with 22.9 million in the first.
</P>
<P>
   EBay offers more than 2.5 million items for sale. By contrast,
Yahoo and Amazon.com, two of the site's most prominent competitors,
can boast only a fraction of this amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay is now going to have to work very hard to regain
credibility with their user base,'' said Steve Weinstein, an
analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland. ``Longer term,
their business model is sound. Shorter term, they're losing some
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone were to benefit, it would be Amazon, which is doing
a good job with its auctions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   No one was gloating at the online bookseller over eBay's latest
stumble. ``These are large, complex systems, and it's going to
happen,'' said Amazon spokeswoman Sharon Greenspan. ``It's
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   She admitted Amazon's own auction system has had ``a few
hiccups'' of late, the most recent being an outage a few weeks ago
lasting a couple of hours.

INTERNET SALE OF NAZI BOOKS IN GERMANY IS ASSAILED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contending that the two largest online booksellers are violating
German laws against the distribution of hate literature, the Simon
Wiesenthal Center has called on Barnesandnoble.com and Amazon.com
to stop selling books like ``Mein Kampf'' to customers in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter this month to Germany's minister of justice, the
center, an educational group in Los Angeles that monitors
anti-Semitism, wrote that ``the books ordered by Internet are sent
directly to the homes of the customers, thereby circumventing the
German laws.''
</P>
<P>
   With electronic commerce making international transactions far
more common, the case raises questions about the extent to which
cyberspace merchants are bound by terrestrial laws.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of both online booksellers said that their policy is
to sell any book in print to any customer who wants to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a U.S. store,'' said Lizzie Allen, an Amazon
spokeswoman. ``We view this as though a German was on vacation here
and went into a physical bookstore and bought the books.'' She said
Amazon's German-based site, www.amazon.de, would not sell any
literature that was banned in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The issue arose when a German-based researcher for the
Wiesenthal Center successfully ordered ``Mein Kampf'' and other
banned books from the two online booksellers. Rabbi Abraham Cooper,
associate dean of the center, said he had received confirmation on
Friday from a German official that the Justice Ministry intended to
investigate. The companies declined to say whether they had
received any other German orders for the books.
</P>
<P>
   Liz Young, a spokeswoman for the German-based media giant
Bertelsmann AG, which owns an equity stake in Barnesandnoble.com,
said that the company was also investigating after receiving a
letter from Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lawyers are looking into the applicable law to this
specific question,'' she said. ``We want to give a correct response
to the letter.''
</P>
<P>
   Such circumstances are expected to arise with greater frequency
as more companies market their products online. But Jack Goldsmith,
an expert at the University of Chicago Law School, said plenty of
precedents exist. When a merchant ships a product, he said, the
merchant is obligated to uphold the laws of the jurisdiction to
which it is being sent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions are the same but the answers are more important,
because transnational transactions are going to be more
important,'' Goldsmith said. ``It used to be consumer transactions
across borders were rare unless someone was traveling abroad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller von der Heidi, a lawyer for the 7,000-member German
Booksellers and Publishers Association, said he believed that it
was illegal for Internet companies to ship Nazi propaganda into
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not permitted to distribute `Mein Kampf' in Germany,'' he
said. ``Our members have long been forbidden to distribute this
book.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Amazon, Cooper also objected to the Amazon.com
feature that recommends books to customers based on the selections
of other customers who purchased a given title.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher who ordered ``Mein Kampf'' from Amazon received
e-mail suggesting that he might also like ``White Power,'' by the
American Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had to worry before that the Book of the Month Club
was going to take the lie of the century and make it a selection,''
Cooper said. ``That's what Amazon has done, and to me it raises
serious alarm bells.''

 Unfolding the Origin of a Confection  &HT;     By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Everyone agrees that the fortune cookie was invented in America.
But where, and by whom, is entirely another matter.
<P>
   The mystery may never be solved.
</P>
<P>
   Most cookie aficionados credit a Cantonese immigrant named David
Jung with concocting the first fortune cookie in 1918. As the story
goes, Jung was moved by the number of unemployed men gathered on
the street near his Hong Kong Noodle Co. in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   To offer some encouragement, he made them sugary snacks
containing short, uplifting messages. The rest, as they say, is
history.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. Some insist that years before Jung was
contemplating his cookie, Japanese immigrant Seichi Kito had his
own brainstorm at a small shop called Fugetsudo in L.A.'s Little
Tokyo section. The molds for what is claimed to be the world's
first fortune cookie still sit in the store's window.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco also stakes a claim to the fortune cookie's
creation. By this reckoning, Makoto Hagiwara, a caretaker at the
Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park, came up with the idea of
putting little thank-you notes inside cookies in 1907.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Kelly, reference librarian of the San Francisco History
Center at the San Francisco Public Library, admitted that the
historical record is murky when it comes to the origins of the
fortune cookie.
</P>
<P>
   But after scouring local archives, he was forced to concede that
Jung appears to be the most likely inventor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, there was some controversy involving Hagiwara,''
Kelly said. ``There doesn't seem to be any proof that he was the
inventor of the fortune cookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa there, countered Daniel Bacon of the San Francisco
Historical Society, who points to a 1983 San Francisco ``Court of
Historical Review'' that determined Hagiwara was indeed the father
of the fortune cookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to make sense,'' Bacon said. ``They've always had a
tradition of serving tea and cookies at the Japanese Tea Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the industrial revolution reached the fortune
cookie business in 1972, when Edward Louie, then proprietor of San
Francisco's Lotus Fortune Cookie Co., invented the first automatic
folding machine. Until that time, all folds were made by hand or
with chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, a Boston engineer named Thomas Lee did the process one
better by inventing a machine that not only handled the folds, but
also automatically removed each pancake from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, the Eli Whitney of fortune cookies, received three U.S.
patents for his device and launched his own company, United
Automation Technology, now the leading manufacturer of fortune
cookie machinery and one of the largest producers of messages.
</P>
<P>
   But things change fast in the fortune cookie world. Lee said his
business is facing new challenges from machinery-makers in Japan,
Taiwan and China, and that ``the profit margin is not as great as
before.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate, he's developing new gadgets to package completed
fortune cookies. He aims to automate virtually the entire fortune
cookie production process.

 Makers of Chinese treats are under pressure to modernize
or  crumble  
 By David Lazarus 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Simon Chow cracked open his fortune cookie at a Chinese restaurant
and read the message inside. ``Your present plans are going to
succeed,'' it assured him.
<P>
   Like many people, he tucked the little white slip of paper into
his wallet for luck. Unlike just about everyone, though, Chow had a
pretty good idea where his fortune had originated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was one of my cookies,'' he said. And even though
it may have come from one of his own creations, he still took the
prediction of future success as an auspicious sign.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a century of business, the fortune cookie industry
is at a crossroads. Traditional shops, where each cookie is folded
by hand, quickly are giving way to larger factories with intricate
machines that turn out more than 1,500 message-bearing cookies an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, enterprising firms are finding new
opportunities in producing custom fortune cookies for corporate
meetings, weddings and other events. And a number of cookie-makers
are taking advantage of that largest fortune cookie of all: the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Chow, co-owner of Chinatown's Mee Mee Bakery, which calls itself
the oldest fortune cookie-maker in San Francisco, represents the
future. He has abandoned the handmade system used by his uncle when
the store first opened in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the back of the shop now holds three large, circular
ovens churning out individual little pancakes. Then, one at a time,
a Rube Goldberg-type contraptions grab hold  &LR;   &LR; of each pancake,
insert paper fortunes and make neat folds. The finished cookies
slide down a chute into a waiting container.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do it by hand, the cookie is contaminated by the worker,''
Chow said. ``The machines give us better quality control.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Shangri-La brand, Mee Mee provides fortune cookies for
numerous hotels, stores and restaurants in the Bay Area. ``We have
the best cookie in the city,'' Chow declared.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away at the Golden Gate Fortune Cookies Co.,
proprietor Franklin Yee held up a freshly baked, unfolded wafer.
``My cookie is best,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   At Golden Gate, each cookie still is produced the old-fashioned
way. A pair of women, their fingers bandaged, pluck pancakes from
the two ovens, manually insert the fortunes and make the folds.
Finished cookies are placed in trays to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Yee, who established Golden Gate in 1962, said each woman can
turn out 1,000 cookies an hour. This seems a bit of an
exaggeration. A brief examination of the shop's productivity
suggests that actual output is perhaps half of Yee's estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this makes any difference to the steady stream of
tourists who peek into the small factory to watch cookies being
made and to savor the sticky-sweet aroma. Samples are for sale near
the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 37 years, I have never had a complaint about my cookies,''
Yee said. But he nevertheless recognizes a need to change _ not how
his cookies are made, but the messages within.
</P>
<P>
   Like all fortune cookie-makers, Yee maintains a stock of
prepared fortunes, mostly culled from Confucian proverbs. Now, he
wants to include more modern messages aimed at encouraging children
to do their homework and to respect their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fortune is like a school,'' Yee said in a suitably
fortunelike manner. Then a mischievous gleam entered his eye, and
he handed a visitor a box full of messages printed on yellow paper.
``For special occasions,'' Yee said.
</P>
<P>
   The special fortunes feature observations from ``Fu Ling Yu''
along the lines of: ``The difference between a wife and a mistress
is night and day'' and ``Girl should use what Mother Nature gave
her before Father Time takes it away.''
</P>
<P>
   His dedication to educating children notwithstanding, Yee
inadvertently has hit upon an important trend in the fortune cookie
world: niche marketing.
</P>
<P>
   With growth now limited among Chinese restaurants, cookie-makers
are seeking new customers by producing custom cookies with
tailor-made fortunes. Such cookies generally sell for about three
times the price of regular cookies, which go for approximately $4 a
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fry, head of Fancy Fortune Cookies in Indianapolis, boasts
of having been the first to come up with ``gourmet'' cookie flavors
like strawberry and lemon. He does much of his business cooking up
brightly colored cookies with personalized messages for trade
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Heiland, owner of Evangelistic Foods in Minneapolis, goes
in a slightly different direction by producing ``Scripture
Cookies'' that contain tidbits from the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up one morning and got the idea that I should be
putting Scripture verses in fortune cookies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Heiland sells about 800,000 cookies a year through
Christian bookstores and catalogs, he said not all Scripture makes
for a good fortune cookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drew some criticism by using Jesus' last words _ `My God,
why have you forsaken me?' _ as a fortune,'' Heiland recalled. ``I
find it's better to stick to honor-thy-mother-type stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For New York's Wonton(cq) &LR;  Food, &UR;  &LR; the largest producer of
fortune cookies in America, the wave of the future is humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people pick up a cookie today, they want to have a
laugh,'' said David Tong, Wonton's head of marketing research. ``We
incorporate American humor that touches on people's daily lives. We
keep trying to update our cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of that effort, Wonton invites visitors to its Web site
to submit their own fortunes. However, Tong said most such
submissions are ``too provocative,'' and fewer than 5 percent of
the approximately 150 e-mailed messages received each month
actually are cookie-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Wonton, established in 1973, produces ``billions'' of fortune
cookies annually, Tong said, but growth has been hampered in recent
years by increased competition.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be a time when most fortune cookies were produced
by a handful of factories on both coasts and then shipped to
Chinese restaurants nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the relatively easy availability of cookie-making
machinery has allowed for regional factories to spring up in most
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   This has made things tough for fortune cookie companies that
haven't quite changed with the times.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are quiet at Lotus Fortune Cookie Co. in an
unmarked storefront in San Francisco's Mission District. Inside,
company President Greg Louie, whose father invented the first
automatic cookie-folding machine 27 years ago, can only shake his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is slow,'' he said. ``It's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus, launched in 1946, also lays claim to being the city's
oldest fortune cookie-maker, but the company got stuck somewhere
between the old family run, made-by-hand era and today's age of
mechanized efficiency. Lotus, when operating, uses a
``semiautomatic'' process requiring a worker to snatch pancakes
from the oven and manually insert them into the folding machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad wasn't a businessman,'' Louie admitted. ``When the
market grew larger, he didn't know how to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus dropped out of the restaurant business about five years
ago. The company now focuses almost exclusively on the
custom-cookie market, relying on mail-order catalogs to reach
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But Louie is finding this an equally challenging business.
``Non-Asians are getting into it, and they're doing a better job
supplying to corporate customers,'' he said. ``We're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   To survive, he's pinning his hopes on fortunes that zero in on
working stiffs _ messages intended to offer encouragement to
nine-to-fivers as they go about their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are ready to let your creative talents blossom,'' reads
one Lotus fortune. Louie isn't sure where he found it. ``I see
something I like, I take it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, messages aside, how good are Lotus' cookies?
</P>
<P>
   Louie shrugged. ``They aren't the best,'' he conceded. ``They're
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he reconsidered. ``No, change that,'' Louie said. ``You're
going to put this in print. Ours are the best. The best cookie.
Gourmet cookies.''
</P>
<P>
   He's finally catching on.

COMMENTARY: SOUTH AFRICAN REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ If anyone can see South Africa plain,
without romance or sourness, it is Dr. Mamphela Ramphele. She is
the vice chancellor of the University of Cape Town, the first woman
and the first black to head that great institution, and she is
famously outspoken. So when I asked her how she thought the new
South Africa was doing, her answer had an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so optimistic as now,'' she said. ``We've gone
through the real messy part of the transition. Mandela was the
Moses who brought us to the promised land, but he did not come to
grips with what it would take...
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, in Thabo Mbeki (the new president), we've got a manager.
He's seen the folly of some extravagant claims. He won't get away
with a hundredth of what Madiba (Mandela) did. He has to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ramphele was not brushing aside the problems faced by this
wonderful, daunting country. Underlying everything is the need to
bring into leadership positions throughout the society a black
majority that for centuries was systematically deprived of
education and elemental rights.
</P>
<P>
   At the university, she enlarged the role of black students and
faculty while being intolerant of poor performance _ brutally so,
some would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to tell people `this is not good enough,''' she said.
``You have to make students rewrite inferior essays. Each time you
tolerate nonsense, you encourage more nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's engineering department had no black students in
the past. It was said that blacks could not think spatially.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ramphele's predecessor, Stuart Saunders, extended the
four-year course to five, with an extra first year to bring black
students from bad schools and poor families up to speed. ``They
didn't grow up with power lawn mowers,'' Dr. Ramphele said. ``If
you pretend they did, you actually reinforce the disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the department graduates 100 black engineers a year. Two
years ago, the top-ranking graduate was a black woman from a poor
rural area.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ramphele said there was too much political correctness
around, and she scorned it. ``Pretending is the fashion,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it true, I asked, that whites are reluctant _ out of
guilt or fear _ to hold blacks to tough standards? She answered:
``We had to overcome barriers all around us. Why can't you overcome
your small inhibitions?''
</P>
<P>
   The apartheid government banished Dr. Ramphele to a remote
village for seven years. She never mentions that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whites haven't paid the price in the old South Africa or the
new,'' she said. ``The price is honesty. That requires a bit of
courage. Richard Leakey is regarded as a madman because he tells
Moi (President Moi of Kenya) the truth. But he does it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her emphasis on the need for honesty is not limited to whites.
She worries about corruption in the new government, as in the old.
Dr. Ramphele was encouraged when Mbeki said in his inaugural
address that corrupt officials would be rooted out. But a recent
episode troubles her. When a judge appointed to investigate
corruption, Willem Heath, pointed at some black provincial
officials, an African National Congress leader accused him of
``racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ramphele does not play down the problem that people talk
about more than any other. That is violent crime: rape, assault,
murder. Black communities are even more vulnerable to it than
white.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem,'' she said, stemming in part from the
moral inheritance of 350 years of white supremacy. ``Blacks had to
create a system of lies in order to survive. Normal behavior was
criminalized, and criminal behavior by the police was normalized.
You eroded the hope of honesty. You lost respect for law, and you
couldn't suddenly regain it in 1994.''
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate among young black men is around 50
percent. ``But it's a much deeper problem than material
deprivation,'' Dr. Ramphele said. ``It's a spiritual depravity _
giving up on humanity. You see it in the levels of the abuse of
women.''
</P>
<P>
   The human challenges in South Africa are great. But so is the
commitment of realists like Mamphela Ramphele. ``I care about this
country,'' she said, ``and nobody's going to mess it up.''

A MEMORABLE BRUSH WITH THE MASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice on the other end of the phone asked, ``How would you
like to go on the set of the new Alfred Hitchcock picture?''
</P>
<P>
   It was July of 1975, and I was speaking to a Universal Studios
executive, a friend of a friend. I was in Los Angeles on my
honeymoon, but the answer to that question was obvious. Who would
pass up the chance to watch Hitchcock direct a movie?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not a critic, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right.'' At the time I wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because Hitch is enormously suspicious of critics. Journalists
of all kinds, in fact. His sets are always closed, but since
tomorrow is the last day of shooting, I think I can get you in.''
</P>
<P>
   I drove out to Universal City the next morning, and the
executive walked me to one of the huge sound stages where
Hitchcock's 53rd feature - originally called ``Deception,'' but
changed only that week to ``Family Plot'' - was about to wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Before turning me over to the unit publicist, he gave me the
ground rules. ``Don't even think about talking to Hitchcock - if
you approach him, he'll have you thrown out. If you talk or make
any noise or write anything in your notebook, he'll have you thrown
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be surprised if he stares at you because strangers make
him extremely uncomfortable, and he may even make a derogatory
remark. He's not exactly the lovable old guy you see on television.
He can be very intimidating and scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Properly warned, I followed the unit publicist into the
cavernous sound stage where the camera was set up to film an
``insert,'' a shot of actor Ed Lauter's hands as they hold a
license number he has just scribbled - which the audience will see
in extreme close-up.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was not there. But the entire crew was, in place and
waiting for him. I stood by the director's chair and also waited.
When a half-hour had passed, and he still hadn't shown up, I
wandered around and began to engage some of the crew in
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a happy set. The filming was way behind schedule.
Well into the production, Hitchcock had suddenly fired his star,
Roy Thinnes, without explanation. The other actors - except for
Bruce Dern, the only cast member Hitchcock seemed to like - had
spent the entire movie in a state of terror.
</P>
<P>
   Even the unit publicist, normally the most bubbly and positive
man on a set, admitted that Hitchcock was hell. ``He's frankly
something of a tyrant. He makes everyone wear a coat and tie, even
in this heat. He doesn't talk to a soul unless he absolutely has to
- not even a `good morning.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One of the camera crew - who had worked for Hitchcock on ``Torn
Curtain'' and ``Topaz'' - explained to me that the shooting of the
film was ``an ordeal'' for the director. ``Every minute on the set
is agonizing for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he worked out every detail of the movie in his head and
storyboarded ever scene long before the cameras rolled, the
physical process of filmmaking was always just an irritating
compromise of his vision. ``For him, the movie has already been
made, and this is the non-creative part,'' the cameraman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this has been a particularly tough shoot for him - one
problem after another. He's physically exhausted, and his health is
bad. He's just had a new pacemaker implanted and he never feels
well. He's also 76 years old, and enormously overweight and . . .''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, a door opened and an enormous, jowly figure in a
conservative black suit appeared. An amazing hush came over the
assembly, and all eyes were instantly on him. The cameraman did not
dare to finish the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The Master of Suspense moved slowly and deliberately as he
waddled toward the set. As he moved, I could swear that I heard
Gounod's ``Funeral March of a Marionette'' - the Hitchcock TV theme
- in the background. The size and intimidating authority of the man
startled me.
</P>
<P>
   As he passed, he shot me a menacing look. When he plopped down
in the director's chair, he called over the publicist and said
something to him in a low tone, occasionally glancing my way. The
publicist responded, and they both looked my way.
</P>
<P>
   The publicist then came over to me and said, ``He wanted to know
who you were. Believe it or not, he's unhappy that you're not
wearing a necktie. He says you can stay, but he'd like you to move
a little further back, and out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to crawl under a rug, but instead I moved a little
further back and out of the way. Hitchcock stared at a wall for a
few moments while the camera was being lined up on Lauter's hand.
When it was, he nodded. The camera rolled.
</P>
<P>
   Then Hitchcock nodded again and an assistant yelled cut. He
asked for a minor adjustment in Lauter's hand and the process was
repeated. Then one more time with a slightly different camera
angle. And that was it. ``Family Plot'' was in the can.
</P>
<P>
   No one applauded, cheered or said a word. With considerable
difficulty, Hitchcock rose from the chair, and began to waddle off
the set. As he passed, he glared distastefully at me one more time
and made a little grunting noise. Then he was out the door.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't know it until four years later, but I had just been
privileged to witness a moment of movie history. ``Family Plot''
would be Hitchcock's final film, and that innocuous insert would
represent the last scene he would ever direct.

A CENTURY OF SUSPENSE: ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S POPULARITY ENDURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly two decades after his death and just days before what
would have been his 100th birthday, Sir Alfred Hitchcock's
reputation as the most famous, most instantly recognizable and most
critically acclaimed director in the history of film seems more
than secure.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, his Aug. 13 centennial (falling, appropriately
enough, on a Friday) has inspired an explosion of tributes:
retrospectives, exhibits, conferences, television specials, special
video/DVD collections of his films and the dedication last week of
a permanent monument in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is the Hitchcock-mania of 1999 is not really all
that more pronounced than in any other year of this decade. Indeed,
since his 1980 death, fascination with the man has skyrocketed, and
his pouty, rotund figure has been as famous _ and as merchandisable
_ as Elvis, Bogie or Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't believe this, tune into the QVC shopping channel
this Friday, where some 18 of the hundreds of Hitchcock products on
the market will be hawked _ gifts, stationary, fine art, toys,
interactive collectibles and the ``first-ever customized Clue Game:
The Alfred Hitchcock Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Or journey down to Universal Studios in California or Florida,
where his omnipresent image is equated to Frankenstein's monster
and the Wolfman, where millions of visitors each year walk through
the popular ``Psycho'' attraction and buy Hitchcock souvenir mugs,
T-shirts, bumper stickers and wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
   Or wander into any video and DVD store in the country or around
the world, where a Hitchcock section (often identified solely by
his famous silhouette caricature) is always a given. The Master of
Suspense has no competition as the most-rented filmmaker of
Hollywood's golden era.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood just can't forget him. In the past few years alone it
has cranked out remakes of ``Suspicion,'' ``Rear Window,''
``Strangers on a Train,'' ``Dial M for Murder, ``Sabotage'' and, of
course, Gus Van Zant's ``Psycho,'' which was so respectful of the
original that it was a shot-by-shot copy.
</P>
<P>
   We also have seen a record-breaking, 70 mm rerelease of
``Vertigo'' (with a similarly restored ``Rear Window'' due out this
fall); an award-winning Canadian film set against the filming of
Hitchcock's ``I Confess''; and a theatrical documentary about
Hitchcock's feud with producer David O. Selznick.
</P>
<P>
   Books? During the past two decades, Hitchcock has become the
filmmaker most written about, a publishing phenomenon second only
to Princess Di and the Kennedys _ biographies, memoirs, critical
studies, trivia and quiz books, chronicles of the making of
``Psycho'' and ``Vertigo.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the TV anthology series, ``Alfred Hitchcock
Presents,'' which ran between 1955 and 1965 (``Gooood eve-ning,
laaadies and gen-tell-men''). It has been regularly in syndication
ever since, engendering its own books, fan following and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   He's everywhere, as much a presence on the cultural landscape as
he ever was _ a personality, an icon, a name that, according to
Peter Bogdanovich in last month's New York Times, ``remains a
synonym not only for suspense but for an entire genre of film.''
</P>
<P>
   And what an unlikely candidate he was for such immortality! The
chronically shy and overweight son of an East End London grocer,
deeply traumatized by a guilt-ridden Catholic childhood, Alfred
Joseph Hitchcock grew to manhood without displaying much aptitude
for anything.
</P>
<P>
   But he fell madly in love with the movies (an art form almost as
old as he would have been), and landed an entry-level job in 1920
as a designer of titles. He gradually worked his way up through the
London studio ranks to direct his first film, ``The Pleasure
Garden,'' in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   During the next decade, he would become the boy-wonder director
of British cinema, forging his own unique visual storytelling style
and turning out a succession of distinctively playful suspense
classics _ ``The Lodger,'' ``The Man Who Knew Too Much,'' ``The 39
Steps'' and ``The Lady Vanishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Selznick brought him to America in 1939, and their first film,
``Rebecca,'' won the best-picture Oscar in 1940. His seven-year
relationship with the producer would be an unhappy one, but it
produced ``Shadow of a Doubt'' (Hitchcock's personal favorite),
``Lifeboat,'' ``Spellbound'' and ``Notorious.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Selznick, Hitchcock came into his own with a
string of elegant, star-studded, suspense masterpieces: ``Strangers
on a Train,'' ``Rear Window,'' ``Vertigo,'' ``North By Northwest,''
and, of course, ``Psycho,'' with its shower scene that a 1995
French poll named ``the most famous single scene in movie
history.''
</P>
<P>
   For many critics, these '50s classics _ typically about an
innocent on the run, cast with major stars (Grace Kelly, Cary
Grant, Jimmy Stewart), buoyed by the edgy-dissident music of
Bernard Herrmann, filled with technological innovations and
outrageously perilous scenes (Grant hanging from Mount Rushmore) _
represent the pinnacle of elegant Hollywood entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Something of an intuitive public-relations genius, Hitchcock had
early on became a familiar figure to his audience by making
walk-on, signature cameos in his films; and he became even more
familiar from the introductory appearances of his TV series, in
which he developed the self-mocking image of a petulant and
mischievous school boy.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe today, but Hitchcock was largely snubbed by
the critics in this greatest period of his career. Though hugely
popular with the public, his '50s films won no Oscars (and few
nominations), and the reviews invariably dismissed him as a sellout
to commercialism who had peaked during his British period.
</P>
<P>
   But in the '60s, he became an idol to the French New Wave; books
by Francois Truffaut, Eric Rohmer and critic Robin Wood reassessed
his Hollywood career; and his critical reputation has not stopped
growing since _ to the point where he's now the subject of a
veritable library of admiring critical studies.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, he became the patron saint of the movie-brat
generation of Scorsese, Spielberg and De Palma. His reputation took
a giant leap after his death in 1980 when five of his '50s films,
owned by his estate and long out of circulation, were rereleased
over a period of several years to lavish critical praise and
box-office success.
</P>
<P>
   Another development that has curiously enhanced his posthumous
mystique has been the testimony of several of his former leading
ladies that _ despite his seemingly happy, 54-year marriage _ he
displayed a streak of sexual sadism toward them on the set and even
tried to control their lives offscreen.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1983 biography, ``The Dark Side of Genius,'' Donald Spoto
compiled some of their testimony into an impressive argument that
Hitchcock's sexual repression intricately worked itself out in his
films, in his blatant celebration of voyeurism, and his delight in
putting his blonde actresses in scenes that are, quite frankly,
bondage situations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's become increasingly clear since his death that all
of Hitchcock's films, and especially his masterpieces of the '50s,
were as personal, as self-revealing and as reflective of their
maker's childhood trauma and sexual confusion as the poetry of
Baudelaire, the paintings of van Gogh or the novels of Kafka.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the playful entertainer and the innovative stylist,
through 50 feature films and over a 50-year career, there was a
tortured artist who manipulated the studio system and used
Hollywood's biggest stars to nurture his private demons and
obsessions. That's a feat that no other big-budget Hollywood
filmmaker has come close to matching, or likely ever will.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A remote and rugged mountain region in southern Russia
turned into a freshly opened war zone Sunday as federal forces,
including army units, opened fire from the ground and the air on
Islamic militants who late last week occupied four villages along
the border with the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Facing one of the most direct challenges to Moscow's authority
in the troubled Caucasus region since the disastrous 1994-96
Chechen War, Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin arrived Sunday in
Dagestan, joining a lineup of top military and Interior Ministry
commanders, including Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the Russian army
general staff.
</P>
<P>
   Federal forces Sunday redoubled artillery and rocket attacks
begun Saturday on the militants' strongholds after more than 2,000
residents _ mostly women and children _ had fled the area. No
casualty figures have been reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no losses among the civilians,'' said Kvashnin
in a television interview Sunday. ``To destroy a bandit if he
covers himself by a civilian, we must first separate the civilians
from the bandit, and then take care of the bandits.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces were using helicopter gunships and tanks against
several hundred heavily armed commandos, although details of the
fighting were sketchy and at times conflicting. The use of the
army, which has become badly demoralized since the lost war in
Chechnya, signaled the seriousness with which Moscow regards the
militants' increasingly aggressive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, a former interior minister who played a key role in
the opening phase of the Chechen war, said Sunday upon his arrival
in the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala, that he was ``not afraid''
to take responsibility for the government's fierce response to the
militants' challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by Russian television correspondents, the refugees
said the militants were led by two well-known Chechen field
commanders, Shamil Basayev and a shadowy Jordanian-born figure know
merely as Hattab, who reportedly runs a commando training center in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have been waging an undeclared war against Chechnya's
elected president, Aslan Maskhadov, whose control of his breakaway
region has been enfeebled by widespread lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from one of the evacuated Dagestani villages told a
Russian television reporter that Hattab told residents of her
village that he would celebrate his birthday on Saturday by raising
the green flag of Islam near the local mosque.
</P>
<P>
   According to another television news report, Basayev, a militant
Chechen warlord who in June 1995 led a violent raid in the southern
Russian city of Budyonovsk, told local Dagestani authorities that
he would withdraw his men from the region only if federal troops
left first.
</P>
<P>
   Attacks have increased along the Chechen border with neighboring
Russian regions in recent months, as armed commandoes clash with
Interior Ministry troops in what Russian security officials have
described as an organized terrorist campaign.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Interior Ministry personnel have been killed in almost
80 such incidents this year, according to a recent report in a
Russian military newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Defense Ministry recently began to transfer army
units into Dagestan at the request of the regional government,
which had reported increasingly aggressive activity on the part of
local Wahhabi groups. Wahhabis, a militant Islamic sect, have set
as their goal the establishment of an independent Islamic state in
Dagestan, copying the Sharia rule of law already in place in
neighboring Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officials in Makhachkala view these events as an attempt to
overthrow the lawful authority, and that is why the latter asked
Russia for military assistance to suppress the revolt,'' the Moscow
newspaper Izvestia reported last week.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of army units may have triggered the militants to
step up their campaign inside Dagestan now and to push things to a
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mission of the army units,'' the Izvestia report added,
``is to knock the Wahhabites out of Dagestan territory and regain
control over the mountain passes'' along the Chechen border.
</P>
<P>
   The Wahhabi militants reportedly have had the backing of Chechen
field commanders, some of whom are members of the Shura, a council
of radical Muslim leaders established in Chechnya, or Ichkeria as
the self-proclaimed independent republic calls itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a report Sunday from Grozny, the Chechen capital, a member of
the Congress of Ichkeria and Dagestan said that a new television
station has started broadcasting in Dagestan, with the goal of
``explaining to the local population the real tasks of Dagestan's
Islamic armed formations.''
</P>
<P>
   In another statement, a spokesman for the Congress _ a group
that is headed by Basayev _ acknowledged that members of the
Islamic Legion, said to include several thousand armed volunteers,
had crossed into Dagestan this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone of them knows what task they have been given and
where it should be carried out,'' a congress source told the
Russian newsagency Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a spokesman for Chechnya's armed forces said it
was sending troops to reinforce its border with Dagestan to stop
incursions and provocations ``in both directions.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian news reports, Hattab _ also known as the
Black Arab or One-Armed Ahmed _ is a well trained guerrilla fighter
who has taken up residence in Chechnya, after 15 years of commando
experience in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   His training center, reportedly located on the territory of a
former children's summer camp, has attracted volunteers from
predominately Muslim states in the former Soviet Union. One former
hostage recently identified Hattab's fighters as one of Chechnya's
notorious kidnapping gangs.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian statistics, more than 1,000 people have
been kidnapped in Chechnya over the last two years, of whom some
500 are still held captive.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who have been released, many have been ransomed for
enormous sums which have become a source of income for the
impoverished region. Last year, four foreigners working for a
British telecommunications company were killed by their captors,
and their severed heads left on the side of a highway.
</P>
<P>
   Russian and Chechen authorities have failed to stop the
kidnapping epidemic, which is seen as an example of how far the
situation has spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The violence in Chechnya has been attributed to numerous causes,
including rivalries between warring clans and religious groups, a
lucrative black-market in gasoline and efforts by militant warlords
to topple Maskhadov and disrupt any efforts to normalize Chechnya's
troubled and ambiguous relations with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   After winning a bloody war against federal forces in 1996,
Chechnya's self-proclaimed independence from Russia has not been
recognized either by Moscow or its allies in the Islamic world. But
in reality, Moscow has lost any real influence over the region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Maskhadov, who has been open to a dialogue with Moscow, has also
tried to stem the influence of the Wahhabi sect inside Chechnya,
seeking an alliance with more traditional Muslim muftis, or imams.
</P>
<P>
   Other regions of the north Caucasus have been swept up in
violence. A bomb went of in a crowded market of the North Ossetian
capital, Vladikaz, killing more than 50 people earlier this year.
Sunday, six gunmen attacked an army base in Northern Ossetia,
killing two soldiers who were guarding a warehouse and taking three
others hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Dagestan, a mountainous region roughly the size
of Austria and home to 33 ethnic groups, managed to stay outside
the conflict that engulfed Chechnya. But last year, the violence
spilled over the border. In May 1998, gunmen briefly seized the
main government building in Makhachkala, and in August, the
region's top Muslim cleric was killed by a bomb.

DEACTIVATING THE LAND MINES IN FOREIGN MENUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My friend Bob has a problem. He likes to travel. And he likes to
eat. But he risks starvation whenever he crosses an international
boundary.
</P>
<P>
   He inspects foreign menus as though they contain instructions
for deactivating a land mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porc means pork, right?'' he asked me one night after a
20-minute reading of the menu at a brasserie in Nancy, France.
</P>
<P>
   I assured him they were one and the same, but I could not
identify what cut of pork he was considering. ``How bad can it
be?'' he wondered aloud.
</P>
<P>
   The waiter provided the answer 15 minutes later when he
delivered what looked very much like a deep-fried pig's elbow. It
was not only inedible, it was obscene. It should have been served
in a specimen jar filled with formaldehyde.
</P>
<P>
   I told Bob about the night in Paris when the waiter stuck out
his tongue at me, when I asked about a lamb dish described on the
menu. It turned out the waiter was not being impertinent. The dish
I was considering was a casserole of lambs' tongues.
</P>
<P>
   ``See,'' I told Bob, ``it happens to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The next night _ despite my assurances that ``boudin noir'' was
a form of sausage _ he refused to formalize his order until the
chef actually brought the uncooked banger out on a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course even the most experienced travelers can encounter
culinary surprises, or disasters.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sound reason a grapefruit should be called
``pamplemouse'' in Paris. It sounds like a French rodent. Who would
suspect that ``cuisses degrenouilles'' would bring an order of
frogs' legs? Why do the Germans insist upon calling a beet a
``runkelrube'' or a cauliflower ``der blumenkohl?''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants in some English-speaking areas also offer large
portions of confusion on their menus. In Scotland, the blue-plate
special might include Tattie Drootle, Inky Pinky and an item listed
as ``Stoved Howtowdie Wi'Drappit Eggs.''
</P>
<P>
   International culinary agents are conspiring to trick Bob into
ordering something inedible. He has adopted the defensive strategy
of ordering quiche Lorraine if he can't locate anything else
recognizable on a French menu.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who extend their boundaries to southeast Asia and are
wary of ordering something called Kanom Bang Na Moo, have decided
you can't go wrong ordering Chicken Satay. Here is our favorite
recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Skewers for Bob
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds chicken tenders
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground coriander
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground turmeric
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chili powder
</P>
<P>
   You'll need some disposable wooden or bamboo skewers. No, not
chopsticks. They're too thick and don't have pointy ends. You can
buy the skewers at any Asian market or general store.
</P>
<P>
   Soak the skewers in water for at least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Slice the chicken tenders in half, lengthwise. You could also
use chicken breasts, cut into thin slices. Thread the skewer
through each tender two or three times. You can probably put two
pieces of chicken on each skewer.
</P>
<P>
   Moosh together the honey, soy sauce, sesame oil and spices. Stir
until the honey is absorbed into the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the honey mixture into a dish just long enough to hold the
skewers. Yes, we're doing a lot of skewering around here.
</P>
<P>
   Roll each chicken skewer around in the sauce, then spread them
out on the dish. Cover with some plastic wrap and refrigerate most
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner time, transfer the skewers to an oven broiler pan,
covered with aluminum foil so you won't have a big mess to clean up
afterward. Broil the chicken 2 or 3 inches from the heat about 3
minutes. Remove the broiler pan, turn the skewers upside down,
paint with the soy marinade, then broil another 3 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Two pounds of chicken should make eight to 12 skewers. Serve two
or three to each guest with peanut sauce and a side dish of fried
rice.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut Sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup crunchy peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup coconut cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chili sauce (like Heinz)
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have or can't find any canned coconut cream, you
can use coconut milk. Or you could substitute evaporated milk with
a few drops of coconut flavoring stirred in. You should be able to
find the flavoring on the grocery shelf next to the vanilla
extract.
</P>
<P>
   In a small skillet, saute the onion in the oil until soft. Add
the remaining ingredients and stir over low heat for a minute or
two. Serve warm with the chicken skewers.
</P>
<P>
   In case you were wondering, Kamon Bang Na Moo is a Thai version
of deep-fried pork. I think I just saw Bob heading for McDonald's.

25 YEARS AFTER WATERGATE, AMERICANS ACCUSTOMED TO SCANDAL LOOK BACK
AT NIXON'S

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Making her way last week through a new exhibit of
photographs commemorating Richard Nixon's fall from power 25 years
ago, an elementary school principal who was just 5 when the
disgraced president resigned wondered aloud just why he had to go.
</P>
<P>
   When she heard how the president had ordered hush money paid to
the Watergate burglars, she gasped. Told about his use of the
Internal Revenue Service against political enemies and how his
``plumbers'' broke into Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office,
she recoiled.
</P>
<P>
   Then she retraced her steps through the Smithsonian's Museum of
American History and looked at some more of Fred J. Maroon's
striking photographs of the basement door that burglars taped open
to get access to the Watergate, of Nixon aides who were implicated
in the coverup, of their appearances before the Senate Watergate
Committee, of the House Judiciary Committee voting for impeachment,
of the president saying farewell.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon educator said the exhibit ``fills in some of the gaps
in my history.''
</P>
<P>
   Those gaps are hardly uncommon in a country where the press has
treated so many scandals that followed Watergate as if they, too,
were constitutional crises that three Americans in four consider
Nixon's offenses no worse than the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treating them all with the same level of breathlessness that
Watergate deserved has done nothing but reduce the amount of oxygen
to our brains,'' complained James M. Naughton, director of The
Poynter Institute for journalism in St. Petersburg, Fla. He said
that if the public cannot tell the difference, ``there is a measure
of responsibility of the media, particularly journalists in
Washington, for having cried `wolf.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago this Monday when the 37th president told his
staff ``never be petty, always remember, others may hate you, but
those who hate you don't win unless you hate them and then you
destroy yourself.'' He climbed into a helicopter and had Alexander
M. Haig Jr., who was running the White House, deliver his
resignation to Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger at 11:35 a.m.,
while Nixon was airborne.
</P>
<P>
   Like the principal from Oregon, half of all Americans who are
alive today had not yet turned 10 when Nixon stepped down. And with
the events of Watergate often given short shrift in the last few
weeks of a high school survey of American history, the principal's
ignorance was not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   But almost everyone still has an opinion about the most
controversial president of the 20th century _ a man generations
grew up admiring for his anti-communism, his doggedness and his
humble, nonestablishment background, or opposing for his rough
campaign style, his falsehoods and the four years he took to end
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallup Poll in February showed that 34 percent of the public
approved of how Nixon handled his job as president, up 10 points
from the week he resigned. Three percent said he was the best
president since World War II, and 28 percent said he was the worst.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC News/Wall Street Journal Poll last month was slightly
more positive. It asked: ``When you think back to the high and low
points of his term in office, do you think, on the whole, that it
was good for America or bad for America that Richard Nixon served
as president?'' Fifty-two percent said it was ``good.'' That number
had dropped sharply from the time of his death in 1994, when
eulogies that dealt only with the high points had produced 73
percent saying his presidency was good for the country.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most telling finding in the poll last month was
that while 18 percent of the public said Watergate was ``worse than
other political scandals in the past 25 years,'' 76 percent said
``there have been other political scandals that were just as bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, who conducted the poll with Robert Teeter, said
there was very little variation by age in the results. Twenty-three
percent of those 65 and older said Watergate was worse; only 14
percent of those 35 to 49 thought so. Agreeing with Naughton, Hart
said the press had dulled Watergate's prominence by ``attaching the
word `-gate' to each and every scandal, making them equivalent to
Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Norton Smith, a presidential scholar and the director of
the Gerald R. Ford Library and Museum, in Grand Rapids, Mich., said
he thought the decline of Watergate was at least as much a matter
of forgetfulness as anything else. He said Nixon's unpopularity was
a result of his status as ``a political orphan, disowned by the
right because it has discovered he did not want to abolish
government but make it work,'' while still disdained by the left.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are now most likely to learn about Watergate in high
school, where it is often an object lesson on the separation of
powers among the legislative, executive and judicial branches of
government. The amount of detail varies greatly from one textbook
to another.
</P>
<P>
   Tedd Levy, a middle school teacher in Norwalk, Conn., and the
immediate past president of the National Council for the Social
Studies, said most textbook presentations were ``drained of the
emotion of that time,'' and generally end with an upbeat lesson:
``The Constitution worked.'' He said ``an alert student with a
decent teacher will have at least a cursory understanding of what
happened and why Nixon resigned.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But there are other sources of information, too. Dueling
historians argue the relative importance of his foreign policy
record, his domestic record outside Watergate and the scandal
itself, disputing whether Nixon was fundamentally good or bad,
ultimately exposed or fundamentally misunderstood, a statesman who
opened the way to China and ended the Vietnam War, or an
opportunist who sought to gut the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   No similar debate goes on in popular culture, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox television cartoon show ``The Simpsons'' regularly tells
Nixon jokes, and imitates his voice and face. Another Fox cartoon
drama, ``Futurama,'' shows Nixon's head in a jar, occasionally fed
fish food to keep it alive. David Cohen, the executive producer of
the program about the 31st century, said an episode this fall would
have Nixon's head running for president of Earth in the year 3000.
Cohen would not say if the head will win.
</P>
<P>
   And just last week, ``Dick,'' a comedy movie, opened with a
portrayal of Nixon as a dim-witted, foul-mouthed heavy drinker,
surrounded by clueless aides, whose Watergate crimes are discovered
through unlucky accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The accomplishments of his presidency are portrayed to the
public most clearly at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and
Birthplace at Yorba Linda, Calif., where he was buried. Exhibits
allow visitors to ask the late president questions he answers
through recordings, and show statues of foreign leaders he dealt
with. A Watergate exhibit does ``the best it can with a hopeless
case,'' as Stephen E. Ambrose, whose Nixon biographies were without
hostility, wrote when it opened.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the steady pace of tourists kept coming to Yorba
Linda, saying they had grown more appreciative of his foreign
policy achievements. ``I think my feelings have mellowed over the
years, especially since China has opened up so much,'' said Aud
Henderson of Oceanside, Calif. Ms. Henderson said she voted for
George McGovern, the Democrat whom Nixon crushed in a landslide, in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Leighton Jones, a minister from Laguna Hills, Calif., said, ``I
think he was a misunderstood man.'' Jones also praised him for
resigning: ``The mere fact that he was willing to step down shows
he was not willing to allow his personal life to affect the
political process.''
</P>
<P>
   John Taylor, director of the library and museum, said its
approximately 150,000 visitors a year, even including the
occasional Nixon hater, generally seemed well informed.
</P>
<P>
   He said no special notice of the anniversary was planned for
Monday. In Washington, which has finally come to share the nation's
fatigue with scandal, none is planned either.
</P>
<P>
   But in Grand Rapids, Smith's institution will celebrate a
different sort of Aug. 9, the 25th anniversary of the first day of
the Ford presidency. Hugh Sidey, a Time columnist, will speak on
the events of the 8th and 9th of August 1974. The regular $4
admission fee will be reduced to 25 cents.

CHOICE OF AMBASSADORS IS HAMPERED BY POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-drawn-out approval of Richard Holbrooke as
the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations has focused fresh
attention on a process of picking ambassadors that is increasingly
mired in bureaucratic delays and political infighting.
</P>
<P>
   The delays of a year or more that often attend the filling of
important diplomatic posts are threatening to drive away some of
the nation's most talented diplomats, administration and
congressional officials, as well as outside experts, say.
</P>
<P>
   It is a process that has come to pit career diplomats against
political donors for posts abroad, and one that holds nominees
hostage to the Senate in exchange for demands on the White House
that often have nothing to do with the qualifications of the envoys
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nominating process is becoming a demolition derby,'' said
Marshall Adair, a diplomat with 27 years' experience who is
president of the American Foreign Service Association, which
represents the government's 15,000 Foreign Service officers. ``If
you create a perpetual system that subjects people to abuse, you'll
lower their incentive to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Battles over judicial nominations have seized attention in
recent years, but the long fight over the nomination of Holbrooke,
who was approved on Thursday, is the latest in a string of
contested diplomatic postings.
</P>
<P>
   William Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, withdrew his
nomination as ambassador to Mexico two years ago after a bruising
fight with fellow Republicans in the Senate, including Jesse Helms
of North Carolina, the strong-willed chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Atwood, the departing director of the government's major
foreign aid agency, pulled the plug on his nomination to be
ambassador to Brazil in May after clashing with Helms over the
senator's plan to merge the Agency for International Development
into the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   In June, President Clinton resorted to a rarely used executive
privilege when he appointed James Hormel as ambassador to
Luxembourg, making him the United States' first gay envoy. Senate
conservatives, led by the majority leader, Trent Lott of
Mississippi, had blocked a vote in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Republican-controlled Senate blame each
other for the diplomatic mire. But career diplomats and scholars
say both are at fault, in part because most ambassador nominations
are no longer treated very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this post-Cold-War period, most ambassador nominations are
just not a high priority to Congress, so they can fall victim to
other agendas,'' said Marshall Wittman, director of congressional
affairs for the Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on Holbrooke's nomination was made possible only after
the last of four Senate Republicans exercising a senatorial
privilege relinquished a ``hold'' on the nomination. But that
senator, Charles Grassley of Iowa, simply shifted his hold to three
other pending ambassador nominees: Peter Burleigh to the
Philippines, Carl Spielvogel to the Slovak Republic and Richard
Fredericks to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Grassley has said he is holding up the nominations over the
State Department's transfer of an employee he regards as
whistle-blower who exposed mismanagement. The State Department
denies that the employee, Linda Shenwick, is being punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost our sense of proportion,'' an exasperated Sen.
Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign
Relations Committee, declared on the Senate floor last week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Burleigh is a career diplomat who has been filling in for
Holbrooke at the United Nations. Spielvogel and Fredericks are both
large donors to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are quick to blame Helms as the root of most
nomination problems. But from 1997 to 1998, the panel approved 90
percent of the 209 ambassador nominations referred by the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke and Hormel won approval from the Helms committee. On
the other hand, Atwood and Weld openly antagonized Helms, sealing
their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of nominations go through, but occasionally
we make a strategic decision to hold one up if the administration
is not enforcing the law or up to some other kind of mischief,''
said Marc Thiessen, a spokesman for the Foreign Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, for instance, has told the State Department that
its ambassador nominations will move along more quickly if it
applies sanctions against a Spanish hotel chain, Sol Melia, for
doing business in Cuba with U.S. property purportedly expropriated
by the government of President Fidel Castro, in violation of the
Helms-Burton law.
</P>
<P>
   But career diplomats say the administration, perhaps
anticipating more grueling fights with the Senate, is now
deliberating, some say cowering, over nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration might be more vigorous in pushing for some
of their nominees and not be so willing to appease or placate
individual senators,'' said Howard Schaffer, a former ambassador to
Bangladesh who is director of studies at Georgetown University's
Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassadorships in Brazil, Argentina and China are all vacant
now, although all are likely to go to political appointees, people
who have typically served or donated heavily to the Democratic
Party. Roughly one-third of the 150 ambassador and chief-of-mission
posts are now held by political appointees as opposed to career
diplomats, higher than the ratio in the Bush administration but
down from the Reagan administration, Adair said.
</P>
<P>
   Problems have cropped up with some of these political
appointees, suggesting a lack of proper vetting, Senate Republican
aides say. Before leaving for the summer recess last week, the
Foreign Relations Committee sent back to the White House Clinton's
choice as ambassador to Argentina, Hassan Nemazee, a New York
investor and large donor to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and even many Democrats on the committee challenged
the qualifications of Nemazee, who has succeeded as an entrepreneur
but has no diplomatic experience. A top Democratic aide said the
procedural move was a polite way of telling the White House he did
not have a chance of being approved. A spokesman for the National
Security Council, David Leavy, said it was too soon to tell whether
Clinton would renominate Nemazee.
</P>
<P>
   In another apparent stumble, the National Security Council let
it be known in May that Adm. Joseph Prueher, a retired four-star
commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific, was Clinton's choice to be
ambassador to China. But the council leaked this information before
going through the diplomatic protocol of asking the Chinese
government if it would accept the admiral. The White House has not
yet formally nominated Prueher.

SOUTH AFRICA ORDERS RUGBY TEAMS TO INTEGRATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The national rugby league,
acknowledging that the game is integrating far too slowly, has
announced that in a year, the 14 top teams will each have to have
three black players. To prevent them from being used as
bench-warmers, there will have to be two on the field at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Imposing racial quotas on rugby has great symbolic significance
for South Africa, which has long been one of the world's great
rugby powers and where the game, seen as a symbol of Afrikanerdom,
has a passionate following, almost exclusively among whites.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules are a radical shift by the South African Rugby
Football Union, which previously urged its teams to bring black
players along voluntarily. Since the 14 provincial teams failed to
meet even the minimum request _ two nonwhite players per 22-man
squad in the south and one per team in the north _ the league
imposed a solution.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of rugby to recruit black players has become a
national embarrassment. There are black players even on the Welsh
and Australian teams, while South Africa, a country that is 89
percent nonwhite, had only one nonwhite player, Chester Williams,
on the national team that won the World Cup in 1995, and has had
only two _ very briefly _ since.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Thabo Mbeki, imitating a famous gesture by
former President Nelson Mandela, donned the captain's shirt as he
visited the South African national team, the Springboks, to wish it
well as players prepared to face their longtime archrivals from New
Zealand in a game they ended up losing on Saturday, 34-18.
</P>
<P>
   As he did so, sports commentators snidely observed that more
black presidents had worn the green-and-yellow shirt than black
players had.
</P>
<P>
   Williams and his two colleagues, Breyton Paulse and Deon Kayser,
are ``colored'' _ of mixed race _ so the 77 percent of the
population that is black African barely identifies with them.
</P>
<P>
   Some nonwhite South Africans, like Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel, who is colored, make a point of attending games against New
Zealand and cheering for the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's team is called the All Blacks, but the name refers
to the color of its uniform. It has had many Maori players.
</P>
<P>
   League executives have reluctantly acknowledged the need to
change, but some of the provincial teams have dragged their feet on
recruitment, with coaches saying they will use ``merit selection''
as their only criterion and sneering at affirmative action for
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial teams are essentially professional, while the
Springboks are an all-star team chosen from them by the national
coach. Below the provincial level is a hodgepodge of university,
high school and club teams from which players are drawn largely at
the whim of provincial coaches.

   Traditionally, few black colleges or schools have rugby teams,
although blacks in the Xhosa territory of the southeast and
coloreds near Cape Town play the sport. The Xhosa learned it at
English missionary schools, the coloreds from their close
identification with Afrikaners.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer and cricket are the two other most popular sports. Soccer
has always been popular with blacks, and the national team, Bafana
Bafana, is very racially mixed. Cricket has had some problems
integrating at national level, but it has long been popular among
coloreds and Indians, and the provincial teams are seen as more
cooperative.

<P>
   The imposition of racial quotas is a ``boot to the head,'' to
use a rugby term, that comes as the national team is already
reeling. In the last few months it has swung from triumph to
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   After it was allowed back into world competition in 1994 when
two decades of anti-apartheid sports boycotts ended, it soared to a
thrilling last-minute World Cup victory in 1995, beating New
Zealand in Johannesburg in a victory that for the first time turned
some blacks into fans of the ``Boks,'' whom they called
``Amabokoboko'' in Zulu.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the current national coach, Nick Mallett, took over
in 1997, the Boks equaled the world record of 17 straight
victories. They beat Wales 96-13, a new record high score, and
topped that by beating Italy 101-0.
</P>
<P>
   But early this year, things fell apart. They lost to Wales for
the first time, lost by a record 28-0 to New Zealand and then lost
32-6 against Australia, conceding more points than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   But through victory and defeat, while soccer remained integrated
and cricket kept its veneer as a gentleman's game, rugby has been
marred by racist incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months ago a revolt among sponsors forced the league
president, Louis Luyt, to resign after he sued to stop a national
investigation into charges of racism, nepotism and corruption in
the sport. His lawyers spent two days trying to humiliate Mandela
on the stand in a hearing over how he had appointed the
investigating commission. Luyt is now in Parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
   After 40 years of debate among doctors, medical review boards
and law-enforcement officials, state legislatures have begun
passing laws to shield doctors from being prosecuted for
prescribing powerful medications against intractable pain.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, leaders of major medical institutions said, a
fundamental change was occurring in the willingness of doctors to
prescribe narcotics and other such medication to treat pain.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the agency that accredits most of the nation's
health-care organizations adopted standards under which the
organizations must ``recognize the right of patients to appropriate
assessment and management of pain.'' The agency, called the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, accredits
about 20,000 hospitals, nursing homes and home-care agencies, which
together provide some 96 percent of the nation's in-patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unrelieved pain has enormous psychological effects on
patients,'' said Dr. Dennis O'Leary, president of the joint
commission, ``and research shows that unrelieved pain can slow
recovery, create burdens on patients and their families, and
increase costs of the health-care system. And we believe patients
have an explicit right to effective assessment and management of
existing pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, half of the state medical boards in the nation have
in recent years adopted model guidelines, written by the Federation
of State Medical Boards, to protect doctors from losing their
licenses for prescribing morphine and other narcotics, so long as
they are given strictly for relieving pain.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, doctors have been caught between complaints of
undertreating pain and concern about being disciplined or
prosecuted for being too aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials have been watchful for doctors who may
supply narcotics to addicts for profit, or overprescribe drugs as a
form of mercy killing or assisted suicide, and patients or their
families have complained bitterly that they or their loved ones
have often been left without relief to suffer needlessly for long
periods.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, for example, Dr. Harvey Rose, a pain
specialist in Sacramento, Calif., was accused by the California
Medical Board of overprescribing pain medication. He succeeded in
fighting the charge, but only after spending four years and
$140,000. He then helped lead the efforts to make California one of
the first states to enact the protective laws, in 1990, for doctors
who use narcotic medications to treat chronic and intractable pain.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few criminal cases of overprescribing narcotics have
actually been brought against doctors, ``but the ones that were had
a tremendously chilling effect,'' said Dr. Allen Licher, past
president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. ``Doctors
just did not want to take the chance of getting caught up in
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pendulum has swung. ``Doctors and policy-makers both
have finally come to see that treating chronic, intractable pain is
one of the essential tasks of caring for a patient,'' Licher said.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states now have laws that protect doctors from
prosecution by state and local law-enforcement agencies for
overprescribing painkillers so long as the medications are needed
to treat pain caused by medical disorders. The states are:
California, Colorado, Florida, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin and
New Mexico, according to the National Conference of State
Legislatures. A decade ago, no states had such protection.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the changes have come in the last three years, and dozen
more states, along with the U.S. Senate, are considering similar
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the new legal protections, medical advances in recent
years and broad cultural changes have also been factors in the
change, said Dr. Kathleen Foley, a pain-management specialist at
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been such an explosion in science in the
understanding of pain systems, and because of this, along with the
efforts of many brave people to persuade their colleagues to change
their attitudes toward treating pain, the great barriers that have
existed to proper pain control are finally coming down,'' Dr. Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
   One barrier used to be the fear of creating narcotics addicts,
noted Dr. June Dahl, a professor of medicine at the University of
Wisconsin Medical School who was on the panel of the Federation of
State Medical Boards that adopted the pain guidelines. But, Dr.
Dahl said, ``There is absolutely no data that show patients
properly treated for severe pain with painkillers becoming addicted
except for those with a history of drug abuse, and they have to be
screened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Medication for severe, long-term pain usually includes opiates
or a narcotic that in the correct dosage dulls pain and induces
sleep but in overdoses can cause convulsions and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``What one must know is that when the medication is built up
slowly over time, when the doses are gradually increased, a patient
can tolerate levels high enough to relieve very severe pain,'' Dr.
Dahl said, although she cautioned that the doctor, the patient or a
relative of the patient must have some expertise in pain control.
</P>
<P>
   Officials, doctors and researchers at cancer treatment centers,
the National Institutes of Health, the American Medical
Association, patient-support groups and several universities have
been at the forefront to bring about the changes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   They have built on the efforts of people like Dr. Elizabeth
Kuebler-Ross, who as a professor of medicine at the University of
Chicago Medical School in the 1960s was ostracized by fellow
doctors for complaining that they routinely neglected patients once
they became terminally ill and left them to die in pain.
</P>
<P>
   But the medical establishment has been slow to change. Dr.
Melvin Konner, an anthropologist at Emory University in Atlanta and
a graduate of Harvard Medical School, said that as recently as the
1980s interns in university hospitals were routinely told to ignore
the pain of sick or injured newborn babies because their brains
were too undeveloped to experience it. ``We now know that this is
not so,'' Konner said.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, the Journal of the American Medical Association
reported a Brown University study of 13,635 cancer patients in
nursing homes, age 65 or older, showing that only 26 percent of
those in pain were given any medication. And in 1995, the journal
published a survey in which family members of one group of 4,301
conscious patients who died in hospitals reported that 50 percent
of them were in moderate to severe pain during the last eight days
of their life. Though some patients refuse medication, the
percentage was regarded as far lower than the number of patients
who want pain relief if given the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the changes in law and medical board guidelines, pain
treatment remains controversial. In Sacramento, Calif., Rose said
he had to argue vigorously to get the right amount of medicine for
his wife to relieve her pain as she was dying of cancer in 1994 _
and then again last year for himself when he was recuperating from
a quadruple bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, another Californian, Dr. Frank Fisher, was
charged with three counts of murder in the deaths of three patients
treated at his clinic in Redding. Fisher was jailed, unable to post
the bail, set at $15 million, to await trial. He said he treated a
large number of patients, many of them poor, who had chronic
intractable pain but had been snubbed by other doctors. ``I feel
like I'm being punished for behaving in good conscience and for
doing the right thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the California attorney general's office
insisted that enough evidence had been presented at a preliminary
hearing from other doctors, who said ``an inordinate amount of
painkillers'' were being prescribed, to justify a trail on the
case. The prosecutor's concern was that, rather than treating real
pain, the doctor was simply supplying drugs to those who abused
them and who had no medical need.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Fisher's patients came to his defense, including the
husband of one of the alleged victims, who said she had had grave
health problems and did not die from her medications. The head of
the local county health center called Fisher's arrest ``a disaster,
like a natural disaster, like an earthquake,'' and said the county
was suddenly left with hundreds of people who were unable to get
the medication they needed.
</P>
<P>
   On July 16, the murder charges were dropped and Fisher was
released after four months in jail, on the ground that there was
insufficient evidence of an intent to kill. But the doctor is not
free and clear: The three murder indictments were reduced to
manslaughter.

REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ENCOURAGE TOP DONORS TO REACH NEW
HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this year of record-shattering campaign
fund-raising, the Republican Party has quietly created a platinum
standard for its most generous donors _ an elite $1 million club
whose members are treated to a smorgasbord of benefits like private
meetings with congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican threshold for big-money political giving far
surpasses the heights of previous election years. It was only a few
years ago that the Republican Party established a top-donor
category called season pass holders, whose members generally gave
$250,000 each over several years.
</P>
<P>
   The party's 36 season pass holders are being asked to contribute
an additional $250,000 this year and next, Republican fund-raisers
said last week. By November 2000, Republican Party leaders say,
they hope to enlist 100 individuals and corporations to donate
$250,000 a year each, or $1 million every four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party has its own new big-money club, Leadership
2000, whose 67 members have committed to giving or raising $350,000
each over a period that began June 1 and goes through August 2000.
If the Democratic and Republican high-donor clubs both meet their
goals, the Republican Party will have raised twice as much money as
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The new Republican effort, which several fund-raisers say they
have begun calling Team $1 Million, reflects a major escalation in
fund-raisers' expectations _ and in the flood of contributions
already received _ at the dawn of the 2000 presidential and
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   It also demonstrates the growing role of ``soft money,'' the
large, unlimited donations for party-building activities and issue
advertisements, in the nation's campaign finance system. Neither
the Republican nor the Democratic Party depended heavily on soft
money, which is given by wealthy individuals, corporations and
labor unions, until 1988, when both established programs to attract
$100,000 donations.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 election will make those days seem like models of
frugality. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination, raised $37 million from March
to June, a sum so large that he has decided not to accept federal
matching funds in the primaries early next year. By refusing to
accept $16.5 million in matching funds from taxpayers, Bush will
not be restricted by a spending limit of nearly $40 million that
applies to candidates who accept matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision gives him a decided advantage over a Democratic
nominee who accepted matching funds and was therefore subject to
the limits on spending.
</P>
<P>
   The national party committees raised a record $53.6 million in
soft money in the first six months of 1999, a 75 percent increase
in the amount they raised in the comparable period in 1995, Common
Cause reported in a study released last week.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican fund-raisers say their new soft-money push is
intended to counter an enormous drive by Democrats to raise a
record amount of soft money before the November 2000 elections. And
they said they felt confident they could meet their goals.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of an overhaul of campaign financing that includes a
ban on soft money said they were not surprised to hear that both
Democrats and Republicans have raised the ceiling on their
soft-money programs. But they said they were astonished that the
Republicans would try to raise $250,000 a year from their most
generous supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you solicit and institutionalize million-dollar campaign
contributions,'' said Fred Wertheimer, the president of Democracy
21, a nonpartisan group here, ``you are putting the government up
for sale in a manner that is unprecedented in modern times. The
ultimate price here will be paid by the American taxpayer in the
form of billions of dollars of government favors and tax breaks
given to Team $1 Million donors.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey, among leading Democrats, have all called for
the banning of soft money, as has Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
is seeking the Republican presidential nomination and is co-sponsor
of a campaign finance overhaul bill that would outlaw these
unrestricted contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush has also called for several changes, including the
banning of soft money from corporations and unions when the
shareholders and members are not consulted on how the money is
spent. It is doubtful that Congress will pass campaign finance
legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic Parties each raised $262 million
in soft money for the 1996 elections, but most campaign finance
experts said that the figure would easily double for the 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its fund-raisers' hopes that more wealthy donors will
join its highest donor club, the Republican Party gets about
two-thirds of its money from contributors who write checks for $100
or less. Republican fund-raisers said that the Republican National
Committee's average donation is $32. Democrats, too, get a majority
of their money from small donors.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying the importance of soft money to the
parties. Earlier this summer, the Republican Party formed a new
soft-money program called Media 2000, which was described in a
letter by Jim Nicholson, the chairman of the Republican National
Committee, as ``an aggressive issue advertising campaign designed
to counter the efforts of union bosses and the Democrat National
Committee.'' The letter asked fund-raisers for the Republican
presidential campaigns to ask their supporters to donate money to
the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to avoid a repetition of 1996,'' Nicholson
wrote in the June 18 letter. ``The combined Clinton/Gore, DNC and
union media blitz attacking Senator Dole and Republicans proceeded
uninterrupted from March through August and built a Democrat lead
that we never closed. That must not happen next year.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, Republican Party leaders and
Republicans on Capitol Hill have repeatedly criticized Clinton and
the Democratic Party for selling access to the White House. In
1997, Republicans accused Clinton and the Democrats of giving large
donors special access to the White House, like coffees with the
president in the Map Room and overnight stays in the Lincoln
Bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, while Clinton was the host of those coffees and
overnight guests, the Republicans' season pass program was created
by Haley Barbour, then the Republican national chairman. Among its
first members were 25 corporations and individuals that gave the
Republicans $250,000 each over the two years preceding the 1996
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Finley, a chairwoman of the Republicans' Team 100 program,
who contributed at least $100,000 each to the Republican Party,
said she thought the party would be able to entice 100 corporations
and individuals to give $250,000 each this year and next. ``I think
everyone is excited about our chances of winning back the White
House,'' Mrs. Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   Generous donors have a simple motive to give so much at one
time, Mrs. Finley said. ``What they get is they are left alone,''
she said. ``They don't get calls to buy a table at the gala, they
don't get calls to give to the media program. They have a pass that
lasts all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Finley said there were 255 Team 100 members. Asked how many
more she expected to have by November 2000, she responded,
``Lots.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the current crop of 36 season pass holders, Republican
leaders said 24 were individuals and 12 were corporations. Party
officials refused to reveal their identities, but the Republican
National Committee reports its receipts monthly to the Federal
Election Commission, so the names of all contributors will be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   According to election commission records, one season pass holder
is Richard M. DeVos, the retired president of Amway who, with his
wife, Helen, contributed $1 million to the Republican Party in
1997. Others who have exceeded the $250,000 threshold, commission
records show, include John W. Childs, a Boston investor; Carl H.
Lindner, a Cincinnati financier (he gave $300,000 earlier this
year, and his company, the American Financial Corp., gave another
$75,000) and the Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the party's top donors had dinner with Speaker Newt
Gingrich here. In 1996, they were given gilded invitations to the
party's private sky box at its convention in San Diego and a photo
session with the Republican nominees.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Republicans' season pass holders were treated to a
private breakfast meeting with Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the
majority leader, and a private meeting with Speaker Dennis Hastert
of Illinois, several fund-raisers said. Several season pass holders
have already agreed to contribute $250,000 annually, fund-raisers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee was criticized in 1997 after
it was reported that it had promised a special benefit to season
pass holders: staff members to help with problems in Washington.
The favored treatment was mentioned in some of the party's
brochures, but in recent years the party has stopped listing such
benefits in its literature.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite those benefits, several fund-raisers insisted that the
individuals and corporations gave solely because they wanted to
assist the eventual Republican nominee to win the presidential
election and help the Republican Party maintain its thin majority
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to be an annual deal _ $250,000 every year,'' Mel
Sembler, the finance chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said of his hopes to raise more money from the party's top-donor
club.
</P>
<P>
   Sembler insisted that most donors did not ask for anything in
return. And when it does happen, Sembler said, he always responds
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone ever brings it up, I say there is no quid pro quo in
this fund-raising business,'' said Sembler, who made his fortune
building shopping malls around the country. ``I tell them, if you
don't see this donation as trying to achieve a better America, you
are talking to the wrong guy.''

   BABY-DEATH (Seattle) _ In January 1998, a 3-day-old Port
Angeles, Wash., baby died abruptly, and still, nobody knows why.
Medical investigators were never sent to interview the parents of
the baby, Conor Shamus McInnerney, nor was a forensic pathologist
brought in to perform the autopsy. A hospital pathologist in
private practice did it, instead. For a time, a doctor in the case,
Port Angeles pediatrician Eugene Turner, stood accused of
suffocating the infant and faced a second-degree murder charge.

   MAYOR (WASHINGTON) _ Growing up in Bellingham, Wash., Mark
Asmundson was only dimly aware that a pipeline went through town,
and throughout his years on the City Council and then as mayor, not
much changed. But Asmundson did know the King family, and the
Woods, and the Tsiorvases. So Asmundson, who was traveling in
Russia at the time, was heartbroken when he got an urgent fax from
city hall, informing him that each of those families had lost a son
in the June 10 pipeline explosion in Bellingham.

GOTTI TALKS! _ COMPLAINING IN TWO PARTS  
 FOR SOME LOS ANGELES CRITICS, ENGLISH ONLY  
 A PRIVACY PROPOSAL GETS MIXED REACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, everyone was talking about Hillary and Bill Clinton.
But the most compelling reading about family life could be found in
The Daily News. The New York tabloid ran a two-part series based on
videotapes of visits to the former crime boss John J. Gotti in the
federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   All visits to the maximum-security prison are recorded, but that
did not stop Gotti from baring his soul, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The articles, written by the veteran organized-crime reporters
Gene Mustain and Jerry Capeci, serve as a valuable addition to the
Gotti lexicon of FBI tapes, television movies and a tell-all book
by his former henchman, Salvatore Gravano.
</P>
<P>
   Gotti comes across as bewildered as his family betrays him and
the moral universe crumbles around him. A lot of philosophy is
mixed in with a fair amount of complaining.
</P>
<P>
   On determinism: ``My life dictated that I take each course I
took. I didn't have any multiple choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculing the penchant of prosecutors for using mob nicknames
in court documents, he invents his own. ``I can't even identify two
people,'' he said. ``I don't even know Sigmund the Sea Monster,
Tony the One-Handed Leprechaun. Philly Jump Over the Fence Moon.
Where did these people come from? I'm not away 100 years! I'm only
away seven years! Where did these creatures emerge from?''
</P>
<P>
   On his family: ``You can't be more disappointed than I am in my
family. Utterly impossible. Impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   On athletes: ``To be a good basketball player or baseball
player, first of all you got to be a good liar. A good lowlife and
an imbecile. And you got to take steroids! You must take steroids,
and anybody who takes steroids is a garbage pail.''
</P>
<P>
   Blaming his daughter, Victoria, for not sending him a family
group picture, he said: ``I don't want to hurt you. I want to die
before you have a toothache. But I got nothing! I got no group
picture!''
</P>
<P>
   On someone telling him that inmates in less secure prisons eat
better meals: ``He was telling me what they eat _ forget about it.
They have lasagna once a week, linguine with clam sauce.'' Pointing
to another inmate, he describes him as one of the terrorist
``idiots from Idaho,'' and adding, ``To him, the greatest meal in
the world is hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   For Some Los Angeles Critics, English Only
</P>
<P>
   In the homogenized world of television news, Claudia Trejos is
about as much an anomaly as can be: Colombian-born, with fairly
accented English and a height of 5 feet 3 inches.
</P>
<P>
   And since she began as anchor of the weekend sports report last
month on KTLA, a WB Network affiliate in Los Angeles owned by
Tribune Broadcasting, Ms. Trejos' delivery and her command of
English have been material for ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Stewart, a sports media columnist for The Los Angeles
Times, said Ms. Trejos could not read English and called her
performance ``hands down, the worst debut in the history of Los
Angeles sports broadcasting.'' The Daily News of Los Angeles was
kinder, but not much: ``She just has one real shortcoming _ she
doesn't speak English,'' Tom Hoffarth wrote in his column.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of Los Angeles residents are Hispanic, and
the top radio and television stations in the city run
Spanish-language programming.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Trejos, 30, this is her first job on English-language
television, after spending seven years at various Spanish-language
stations. In an interview, she said she could understand why people
would be taken aback by her after she replaced Ed Arnold, who had
been at the station for 14 years. Reading the first criticism of
her performance ``was a little painful, but then I just said, `That
which doesn't kill you makes you stronger,''' Ms. Trejos said.
</P>
<P>
   The news director who hired her, Jeff Wald, has not taken it so
lightly. He said the criticism came in part from loyalists to
Arnold and was in part xenophobic.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that Ms. Trejos was hired to appeal to Hispanic
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were tons of tapes, and every tape I saw, it was almost
like a cookie cutter,'' Wald said. ``Everyone looked the same,
sounded the same.'' But with Ms. Trejos, ``we decided, even though
she did not have a great deal, if any, English-language experience
as an anchor on television, that her personality, her knowledge and
her love for sports were certainly there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a bias,'' Wald said. ``Let's call it that, No. 1
against a woman doing sports, and secondarily a Latina doing
sports. And that's, I think, where this conflict seems to be.''
</P>

<P>
   A Privacy Proposal Gets Mixed Reaction
</P>
<P>
   After the death of John F. Kennedy Jr., news organizations
re-examined how they reported the event, from the search mission to
the relentless coverage of the memorial service. And the publisher
Steven Brill is leading the brigade.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week of July, Brill sent a letter to several hundred
members of the news media, soliciting their reactions to a proposal
that news organizations exercise restraint when reporting about
children and, especially, grieving families. It read in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``To protect the privacy of grieving families, our news
organization will not publish current photographs or show current
video images of family members who have lost a loved one within one
week following the death of that loved one, nor will we post
reporters or photographers outside their homes, at the funeral, or
in other places where we can accost them for interviews or
photographs without their permission.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to respond to Brill's proposal, titled
``Voluntary Restrictions to Protect Privacy,'' were Jonathan Alter,
a Newsweek senior editor and columnist, and Walter Isaacson, the
managing editor of Time magazine, who both appeared on television
during the search effort and who both wrote letters explaining why
they would not sign such a petition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm opposed to the concept of industry-adopted rules and
guidelines,'' Isaacson said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Effron, the editor of Brill's Content, said the proposal
was eliciting hundreds of responses. ``I think we're certainly
comfortable at this stage saying that all news organizations should
consider adopting it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Goldstein, dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of
Journalism, said it was unlikely that many news organizations would
agree to the terms of such a document. ``The intentions are
honorable, but news organizations are not joiners or signers,'' he
said.

   IOWA-BIKE _ IOWA CITY, Iowa _ After spending seven days riding a
bicycle 550 miles through 61 small towns, we take a look at the
folks who are deciding the fate of the presidential candidates. For
months hey have been part of an intensive campaign which for some
candidates could come to end on Aug. 14 during the Ames, Iowa straw
ballot. This event has become so important that George Bush paid
$46,000 to rent the best piece of lawn outside the hall where the
voting takes place. Candidates may love Floridians for their cash
but it's Iowa's small town voters who may stop some of them from
ever getting their campaigns to Florida. (Crowley, Palm Beach

But what does it mean, and what is his record in Texas? Here is a

taken into account? Plus, some criticize the governor for allowing
the 2000-2001 state budget to increase more than 9 percent when the
economy's good and welfare and unemployment caseloads are down.

`LENNY BRUCE: SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH': APPRECIATIVE DOCUMENTARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area. See local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lenny Bruce's sad life and short career are by now solidly
entrenched in legend. Having won audiences by mocking the hypocrisy
of official attitudes toward obscenity, this comedian suffered the
revenge of the law and succumbed to his own worst temptations. He
died in 1966 of a drug overdose. His story, as told in ``Lenny
Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,'' Robert Weide's appreciative
documentary, makes it easy to understand his appeal yet raises
questions over the role of social critic with which he was
invested.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes toward Bruce were not a close call, whether among his
enemies or his admirers. His fans, who grew in numbers and
enthusiasm in the late 1950s, could count themselves on the side of
the First Amendment, along with the likes of Nat Hentoff and Martin
Garbus, who championed his efforts to crash through taboos. As for
the attacks by the Roman Catholic hierarchy and some New York
prosecutors, they only enhanced the pleasure that hip admirers took
in him as a defier of proprieties and further rallied their
enthusiastic support.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's daring was never in doubt. His opponents were
formidable, but whether he was taking on the church or the military
or finding sharp new laughs in dirty words and racial slurs, he
never held back. The documentary, on HBO Monday night at 10:15,
gives flashes of brilliant comic riffs, like ``How to Relax Your
Colored Friends at Parties'' and his takeoff on the used-car
huckster who certifies that a low-mileage Volkswagen was employed
only to shuttle passengers to death camps.
</P>
<P>
   It still remains a sort of tribute that the words he
relentlessly deconstructed are not deemed fit to print in a family
newspaper even while four-letter epithets have come to serve as
standard punctuation for brainless movies. Bruce understood the
power of the seriously unspeakable, and spoke out. ``Please don't
lock up these words,'' he begged the judges who then proceeded to
end his career by convicting him of obscenity. They would be
reversed by a higher court only after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the inclusion of overdone routines and weak shticks
encountered in the documentary also exposes Bruce's limitations.
Some of the laughter he generated seems to represent the audience's
recognition of his reputation rather than the fun of a particular
performance. Bruce was a pioneer who struck deep when he was on
target yet kept to a narrow range. As things go in the stand-up
comic line, that is no great sin. No one else was doing what he did
or doing it so smartly. At the same time, however, that he was
skewering racists and anti-Semites along with the general run of
citizens more timid or fastidious than himself, he was living the
show-biz life, with an unraveling marriage, heavy drugs and a bent
toward self-indulgence that would finally end in death. Or was it
suicide?
</P>
<P>
   Do a comedian's personal failings or felonies matter? In general
probably not. But suppose he makes his career as a critic of the
moral inadequacies of others or the society as a whole and then
flaunts his own weaknesses? How seriously can he be taken? With
Bruce, the question became acute when in his final deteriorating
years he was so out of control or so in the control of his demons
that he might be pitied but could no longer be taken seriously. He
was a prophet with honor except in his own behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's advocates assume that it was the persecution by the
courts that ruined him. A generous judgment. His stand for the
First Amendment was always courageous, but even if prosecutors and
judges had not cracked down, the man was plainly courting a
crackup. The sick comic was sicker than his admirers realized.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the end so cruel? The roots of his instability, like the
roots of his genius, are beyond the documentary's compass. Maybe
after repeated arrests and a conviction, after his obscenity case
had turned into obsession, the combination of official pressure and
private aberrations proved too much for even his prodigious talent
to survive, and he just gave up.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing needed light into America's dark places, by age
40 Lenny Bruce had nothing left to lighten the darkness of his
final years.

 &HT;    Affirmative action debate grows heated at meeting
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A heated debate over affirmative action erupted Sunday
at the American Bar Association's annual meeting, as lawyers
engaged in a fiery rhetoric similar to that recently displayed by
Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and the city's legal nemesis, the
Southeastern Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In the crossfire sat Gail Heriot, a University of San Diego
professor and backer of Proposition 209, the ballot initiative
passed in California that banned racial and ethnic preferences in
hiring, admissions and contracts. Heriot was decidedly in the
minority among attendees of a panel discussion held in the Georgia
World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   The debate focused primarily on the use of affirmative action
preferences in college admissions. Heriot urged for the abolition
of preferences, contending that they stigmatize the minorities who
receive them.
</P>
<P>
   Heriot also cited a study showing that 42 percent of all
African-American students attending the University of
California-Berkeley dropped out before getting a degree, compared
to 16 percent of all white students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students who get the preferences are much, much more likely to
drop out,'' Heriot said. ``Better academically prepared students do
better at the better schools....Anyone who thinks otherwise is
engaging in wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Focus more energy and funding on attacking the education
problems facing minorities in the elementary and high school
levels, she said. ``If we're going to solve this problem, it's
going to happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   But numerous attendees disagreed strongly with Heriot, at times
engaging in shouting matches with one person interrupting another.
Some recited the history of slavery and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker, Anthony Upshaw, a Miami, Fla.-based attorney, said
that if racial preference admissions programs are abolished, the
country may return to ``a separate but equal society,'' with blacks
excluded from the nation's top public colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Some minority students will continue to gain admission to top
schools without preference programs, Upshaw said. But the abolition
of affirmative action will result in ``cascading,'' he said, where
minority students once able to gain admission to upper-tier public
universities will attend only the lower-tier schools.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw, the only black in his class to graduate from his Coast
Guard Academy class, acknowledged that fellow students likely
thought he gained admission because of his skin color.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not what kept me at the school and got me through
it,'' he said. ``Initially, there might be some stigmatization, but
it's up to the individual to rise above it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hamilton III of the U.S. Equal Opportunity Commission
noted that 92.5 percent of the nation's lawyers are white, while 30
percent of the nation is comprised of people of color.
</P>
<P>
   The country needs a more integrated society, he said, and that
may mean black applicants may have to be granted opportunities at
the expense of equally qualified whites. ``Somebody's going to have
to pay the price for it,'' he said. ``The sooner we get there the
better.''

 &HT;    Rueter, Giants silence Braves
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On a day when they might have recaptured first place,
the Braves were instead confronted by the red-haired presence of
Kirk Rueter, who had not beaten them in more than six years.
</P>
<P>
   In the strange summer of '99, this could only empower Rueter in
a walk-over, a pedestrian 5-2 loss Sunday that came after the
Braves had generated 22 runs Friday and Saturday, the biggest
two-game output Turner Field has yet seen. So make that Mr. Kirk
Rueter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really pretty uneventful,'' said Braves manager Bobby Cox,
whose club opens a three-game series tonight against the Houston
Astros, who are still first in the NL Central. The Braves are 12-12
since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored too many runs (Saturday),'' third baseman Chipper
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Kevin Millwood (12-7) finds himself 1-3 since the
All-Star break, losing this one through a critical fourth inning
that included a two-run single by Marvin Benard and a two-run home
run by Ellis Burks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give up a four-run inning,'' Millwood said, ``it's tough
to come back from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the day went to Rueter, who allowed two runs
over six innings, striking out just one but leaving the Braves
2-for-9 with runners in scoring position. He had beaten the Braves
the first time he saw them as a Montreal Expos rookie in 1993 and
then gone 0-4 in 10 subsequent starts. The Braves had recorded 26
hits the first two games off Giants pitching. Rueter (10-6) held
them to seven.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't throw that hard and he took a lot of speed off his
change-up,'' Andruw Jones said. ``So his fastball was kind of
sneaky. He didn't make any mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   With New York being demolished by Los Angeles 14-3, the Braves
might have ended the Mets' hold on first in the NL East. While
Sunday's loss prevented the Braves' first three-game sweep since
taking three in a row from Tampa Bay June 7-9, the team thinking
falls back to the individual series. Since being swept in Toronto
July 18-20, the Braves have lost just one of six series.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do is win every series,'' right fielder Brian
Jordan said. ``And that's what we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will find a Braves team that has been near its best
against front-runners. The Braves are 13-6 against clubs currently
in first place, though this will be the first try without the
injured Javy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this team cares who they're playing,'' second
baseman Bret Boone said. ``I don't think any series is bigger than
any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless they start losing them.

 &HT;    Vandy makes changes, commitment to winning
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They've ripped up the artificial turf at Vanderbilt's
Dudley Field and replaced it with grass. They've switched the home
and visitors' sides as well and even changed the school logo.
</P>
<P>
   These may seem like superficial alterations to those outside the
Commodores' community but, to those within it, they are indicative
of the changes taking place within the football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it signals a commitment from the university to the
football team,'' senior H-back Todd Yoder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just feels like a new beginning,'' said senior safety
Ainsley Battles, who certainly deserves one.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt has won only seven games since Battles arrived in
Nashville, Tenn., three years ago. And until the South Carolina
game last season, Battles hadn't experienced the joy of an SEC
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But Battles and the rest of the Commodores believe there are
more SEC celebrations to come this season. Vanderbilt returns 19
offensive and defensive starters, tops in the SEC. Coach Woody
Widenhofer believes that and the positive effects of his two
seasons of influence will translate into more victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year I got here, we had only two guys who could
bench press 400 pounds or more. This year, we should have 25 or
30,'' said Widenhofer, who as an assistant coach helped the
Pittsburgh Steelers win four Super Bowls. ``This is the first year
since I got here that we've had a proven quarterback with a
supporting cast around him. ... It's all about winning and
establishing a tradition and that's what we're trying to do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt has long been the doormat of the SEC. The Commodores
have won more than two conference games in a season just once in
the past 16 seasons and last played in a bowl game in 1982. But
Widenhofer is not among those who believe Vanderbilt should bolt
from the SEC and join a league in which it could be more
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in a weaker conference, we'd have a better record.
But I think it can be done in the SEC,'' Widenhofer said. ``It's
been done at Northwestern and at other places. I don't see any
reason it can't be done here. We've just got to do a better job
recruiting. They're out there. We just have to go find them.''
</P>
<P>
   They're starting to pop up on Vanderbilt's roster. The
Commodores placed a player on the writers' All-SEC preseason team _
a rarity in their world _ in sophomore linebacker Jamie Winborn and
they have at least two other legitimate all-conference candidates
in junior cornerback Jimmy Williams, a second-team All-SEC pick
last year, and sophomore running back Rodney Williams, the leading
freshman rusher in the SEC with 608 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Greg Zolman enters the fall as the undisputed starter
at quarterback, another rarity in Vanderbilt's recent history.
Zolman (6 feet 4, 200 pounds), the No. 1 rated prospect in Ohio
when he came out of high school, started four of the last five
games last season and finished with 969 yards passing and four
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   With both lines returning, most of the skill players and all of
the kicking specialists, it would appear the formula is there for
vast improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing about college football is you can't cut
them, you can't trade them and you can't waive them,'' Widenhofer
said. ``We're not going to run them off. You can only graduate
them. So it takes time.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and a subtle change or two.

EDGY `TRUTH' IN HBO PROFILE OF LENNY BRUCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-three years have gone by since his death, but comedian
Lenny Bruce still wouldn't be a cuddly bear on ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Yards of footage in ``Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,'' a
documentary showing Monday night on HBO, attest to the fact that
not only did Bruce ``cut much deeper than anyone else in his
generation,'' as Nat Hentoff puts it, but his material also remains
edgy.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that he'd have a whole lot more company today, when
the offending language of Bruce's era has tumbled onto prime-time
TV.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Robert Weide and narrated by Robert De Niro, the
documentary has already been seen by some moviegoers. It played
briefly earlier this year because it was an Oscar nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Weide pieces together a personal portrait with just enough
information to explain, maybe, why Bruce became the sort of comedy
icon he did, and then tracks Bruce's bitter war with censorious
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Sally Marr, who died in 1997, is the apparent key to
Bruce's identity. A divorced dance instructor and comic, she
treated her young son like an adult and raised him, she told Weide
on camera, ``free, guiltless, no guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   That much seemed evident in Bruce's material, and life, early
on. But the bold humorist who would challenge the limits of
language and taste took time to evolve. Weide includes a few old TV
clips in which a young Bruce works the hoary fringes of slapstick
comedy and delivers bad impressions of Jimmy Cagney and Kate
Hepburn.
</P>
<P>
   The risky excursions into social satire, blasphemy and profanity
came later, and with it official retaliation. Bruce's first arrest
on obscenity charges was in San Francisco, but it was a 1961 arrest
in Philadelphia that set his worst troubles in motion. Bailed out
of jail in Philly, Bruce told reporters that he'd turned down a
chance to bribe a judge. He named the judge, and from that moment
he became fair game for district attorneys everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nightclub owners grew reluctant to book Bruce, and then a New
York City arrest in 1964 led to his snowballing descent into
melancholy and drug addiction. Bruce died of a drug overdose in
1966. Eighteen months later, his New York conviction was
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The film becomes a locomotive bound for Bruce's ultimate
destruction. It's also a brutal demonstration of government
overzealousness; while Bruce could win in court, the accumulated
weight of the busts brought him to ruin.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that most HBO viewers who'll see the film are too
young to remember Lenny Bruce. Weide could have been more cognizant
of that and, however briefly, given viewers a broader familiarity
with entertainment in Bruce's era. All the better to show how far
ahead of his time he was, and why he is such an abiding influence
on comedy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a quibble. It's energizing to watch a manifestly
gifted comic at work in vintage clips, and genuinely sad to witness
his downfall.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rarest clips, shown on TV for the first time, is
Bruce's performance for Steve Allen's syndicated variety program in
1964. Censors snipped Bruce's act from the show.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce playfully told the audience that night that he wanted to
talk about a four-letter word beginning with ``s'' and ending with
``t.'' The word, snot, never sounded so seditious.

   KASIGLUK, Alaska _ Crisscrossing the vast gray-green tundra of
southwestern Alaska, the bush pilots of Yukon Aviation fly high
school teams to games, shoppers to the market, patients to
hospitals, jurors to court, criminals to prison, and people in body
bags to the coroner.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone call came in a few weeks ago from a famished
surveying crew out in the bush near Napaskiak, unreachable by any
road but just a seven-minute flight across the Kuskokwim River from
Yukon Aviation's base in Bethel, which also happens to have a pizza
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for a dozen large pies plus air transport was $237,
recalled J.J. Taylor, a bearded 60-year-old pilot for the company.
The pizza was still hot when it was delivered to camp, near the
gravel-strip runway at Napaskiak. ``Domino's ain't got nothin' on
Yukon Aviation,'' said Taylor, with evident pride. Still, he didn't
get a tip.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than in any other state, airplane travel is a way of
life in Alaska, which has the most pilots per capita (six times the
national average), and the most planes (16 times the average),
according to the Federal Aviation Administration. A third of
Alaska's population has no access to the state's roadway system,
meaning their communities are reachable only by airplane or boat.
</P>
<P>
   And so bush pilots like the four men who fly for Yukon act as
virtual taxi drivers in the sky, hopping over the kettle ponds and
grassland of the tundra to deliver people for reasons sometimes
critical, and often mundane.
</P>
<P>
   But if airplane travel is an everyday and necessary affair in
Alaska, it is also a dangerous one. And while state and federal
authorities have launched a campaign this year to equip bush pilots
with better navigational aids and weather reporting, they and the
pilots themselves say there are huge obstacles to cutting accident
rates that routinely run two to four times the average, per flying
hour, than elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The safety problems are due partly to the rugged terrain and
harsh weather, and partly to the ramshackle conditions and lack of
navigating equipment at the ubiquitous dirt-strip runways in the
Alaskan bush country. But they may also be due to what a National
Transportation Safety Board report on aviation safety in Alaska
once termed ``the bush syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome, which many Alaska bush pilots dismiss as a term
coined by bureaucrats who have no concept of the realities and
pressures of flying in the bush, was defined as ``an attitude of
air taxi operators, pilots and passengers ranging from their casual
acceptance of risks to their willingness to take unwarranted
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   That 1995 study and subsequent surveys of the accident rates
have sparked a series of recommendations to improve flying safety
here in the Last Frontier, only a fraction of which have been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is in the midst of a
three-year, $11 million test project in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta
that will put new display equipment in the cockpits of many air
taxis here. Known as the Capstone Program, it will give pilots much
more detailed information about weather conditions and the location
of other airplanes in the area. They eventually hope to bring to
the great majority of planes.
</P>
<P>
   But even those in charge of safety acknowledge that it is only a
start, and weather reports are still often shared, not always
reliably, by word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you can see as far as you can see,'' recalled Cindy
Andrecheck, co-owner and dispatcher for Yukon Aviation. ``That's an
actual weather report from Hooper Bay I got on the telephone one
day.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of the recommended improvements to runways, many so
short that they leave little or no margin for a landing error,
remains steep. Alaska has more than 1,100 ``designated landing
areas,'' only 285 of which are public airports, according to Paul
Bowers, director of Alaska's statewide aviation division. That
figure doesn't include beaches, many of which are legal to land on
but not exactly conducive to a smooth landing.
</P>
<P>
   The delta region here is particularly reliant on air transport,
because many communities are inland and nowhere near any roads that
could bring people to Bethel, which is something of a regional hub,
with 25 landing strips within a roughly 40-mile radius. Rivers can
be navigated by snowmobile or even trucks in the winter and boat
during the summer, but during ``break-up'' and ``freeze-up,'' the
times of the year _ several weeks each spring and fall _ in which
the ice melts or forms, airplanes are the only way in or out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We help people do just about everything you can think of,''
said Ms. Andrecheck. Dogs, too: One of her pilots recently took a
man and his dog all the way to a veterinarian in Anchorage, a
$1,000 trip, and last year another pilot brought a planeload of
dogs out for the Kuskokwim 300, an annual sled race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some sensational thing,'' she added, with a shrug.
``This is life as we live it.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel is expensive, with rates of $150 per hour and up, but
not prohibitively so. Many trips, from villages such as the Yup'ik
Eskimo community of Kasigluk to Bethel, take 10 minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly some sort of disconnect between federal
regulators and the bush pilots themselves over the idea of a ``bush
syndrome,'' as many pilots here contend that what bureaucrats see
as risks are also vital missions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people calling up who are in labor, and you have to
get there,'' said 24-year-old Daryl Smith, a Yup'ik Eskimo who has
already flown three such women from Yup'ik villages to the hospital
in Bethel during his three years as a Yukon pilot. ``I just wanted
to get them there. What I was really scared about was that they
might have a baby in the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans such as Taylor contend that if a bush pilot knows what
he is doing, flying in Alaska is actually safer than flying in the
Lower 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more comfortable here in the wide-open spaces,''
contended Taylor, who has 42 years of experience flying small
planes, starting as a crop-duster in the Midwest but eventually
gravitating to the Alaskan tundra. ``There are a whole lot more
places to land, actually. You might ding up your airplane, but
you'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been OK, but when pressed, he can tick off the names of
23 friends and acquaintances in the business who have been killed
in flying accidents over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there's risk,'' he said. ``Statistically, I'd be crazy to
deny that. But there's risk everywhere. I still say you're safer
here.'' With that, a call came in to the Yukon dispatcher, Ms.
Andrecheck, from a woman in the village of Nunapitchuk who wanted
to take her father to the hospital in Bethel.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Nunapitchuk, we'll be there in 15 minutes,'' said Ms.
Andrecheck. Taylor hopped into his red Cessna Skyhawk, maneuvered
onto the runway behind a cargo plane flown by Arctic Circle Air,
and took off.
</P>
<P>
   The sky was clear, but the weather can quickly turn ferocious
here. The safety improvements are intended to at least cut in half
the number of flying accidents in Alaska, said Jim LaBelle, state
director for the NTSB. The average now is about 170 accidents a
year, and 40 fatalities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the process is expensive and other moves, such as much
stricter regulatory standards that the FAA set last year for
hunting and fishing guides who fly clients to remote locations,
have met bitter opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tedious process, it is a slow process, and much of it
has yet to bear fruit,'' said LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the bush pilots fly on much as they always have, and
they are clearly a big part of the state lore. ``Alaska and
aviation were made for each other,'' wrote Joe Rychetnik, a former
state trooper and reporter, in his book ``Alaska's Sky Follies: The
Funny Side of Flying in the Far North'' (Epicenter Press, 1995).
``Bush pilots _ with usually a meager financial investment but with
200 percent of their energy and courage _ soon became the binding
sinew of the vast territory.''
</P>
<P>
   They still are, all the way down to food deliveries. As Ms.
Andrecheck said, there wasn't much of an alternative for the
surveyors craving their pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they could have gotten it by boat, down the Kuskokwim
River. But then the pizzas would have arrived cold. And wet. And
late.''

JAPAN WEIGHS BAN ON NORTH KOREANS' SENDING CASH HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan is turning up the heat on North Korea, threatening
to suspend all cash remittances by Koreans to that communist
country if it proceeds with plans to test-fire a new long-range
ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   In his strongest warning yet, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura
of Japan said on Sunday that the government was considering barring
Koreans living in Japan from sending cash and goods to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The remittances, estimated at $600 million to $1 billion a year,
are a major source of capital for North Korea. Their loss would
have dire consequences for a country whose economy is in shambles
and whose people are facing dire food shortages and even famine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe the United States and South Korea would oppose
it if Japan decides to take such action,'' Komura said during a
television news program.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister's comments follow a bipartisan effort by
Japanese lawmakers along the same lines _ to revise the country's
foreign exchange law to permit the government to halt payments to
countries that pose a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and the main
opposition Democratic Party said last week that they planned to
submit the revised legislation to the Parliament before it closes
for summer recess on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While it is uncertain whether the legal revision is necessary
for the government of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi to halt the
transfer of money, it is clear that there is widespread support for
the action in the government and across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing this to send a strong message to North Korea that
if you launch the missile, we are going to hit you where it
hurts,'' said Ichita Yamamoto, a Liberal Democratic Party member of
the Upper House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cutting off their cash flow from Japan, even if only 30 or 40
percent of it, will certainly do a lot of damage because they are
using this money for weapons production and other military
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Keiichiro Asao, a member of Parliament from the Democratic
Party, the largest opposition force, said, ``The underlying message
here is tit for tat.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan and North Korea, which do not have diplomatic ties, have
had strained relations since last August, when North Korea fired a
Taepondong-1 ballistic rocket over the Japanese mainland and into
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Western and Asian diplomatic and security officials
said that North Korea was preparing to test a second missile,
Taepondong-2, which has a longer range and greater accuracy.
Launching the missile would upset the balance of power in Asia and
cause an arms race, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, South Korea, and the United States have repeatedly warned
North Korea that if it launches the rocket, they will retaliate
with sanctions. North Korea maintains that the missiles are being
used to ferry satellites into space, but intelligence experts say
the rockets are designed to transport nuclear and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking the transfer of funds to North Korea is perhaps Japan's
strongest means of retaliation. North Korea is heavily dependent on
the cash and goods that Koreans living in Japan send to relatives
in the North. About 750,000 Koreans live in Japan, half of whom are
loyal to North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the remittances are transferred in suitcases filled with
millions of yen hard currency and crates of food and other
commodities that government officials say Koreans take to North
Korea on tour boats from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But most are illegal transfers of money laundered through third
countries and unreported earnings from pachinko pinball parlors,
mainly operated by Koreans, and other businesses in Japan, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the government does crack down, it could begin searching
luggage headed for North Korea and looking closely at transfers of
money and proceeds from pachinko parlors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Japanese legislators said that in recent weeks, following news
reports that North Korea was preparing to launch a second missile,
they have received a flood of calls and letters from constituents
demanding that they take more decisive action in dealing with North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, there were also unconfirmed reports that North
Korea has bought 40 MiG-21 jet fighters from an unidentified state
that was a member of the former Soviet Union, to modernize its air
force.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After North Korea fired the first Taepondong missile last
August, the Japanese government immediately withdrew its $1-billion
contribution to an international consortium that is building two
safe nuclear reactors in exchange for North Korea's promise not to
pursue its own nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, though, Japan restored the financing at
the urging of the United States and South Korea. For that reason,
the legislators said threatening to suspend money for the
international consortium was no longer an effective bargaining tool
and that they have been seeking other means.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers said Japan's current foreign exchange and trade
control laws do not allow the government to suspend financial
transactions like the remittances unilaterally, even when there are
security threats. But the legislation they plan to present this
week would change that.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers said that while the legislation may not be
approved before the summer recess on Friday, they believe that its
introduction will send a strong message to North Korea.

CLINTON TRIES TO ENLIST GOVERNORS IN BUDGET BATTLE WITH CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ President Clinton warned the nation's governors
Sunday that the Republican tax cut would force drastic cutbacks in
many programs that could hurt states, including Medicare, veterans'
benefits, farm programs, support for immigration and mineral
leasing payments.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who has vowed to veto the $792-billion tax cut
passed by the Republican-led Congress, used a low-key,
nonconfrontational appearance here to cajole the National
Governors' Association into siding with him in this fall's budget
battles _ not an impossible task, given the governors' fears that
congressional Republicans will raid state budgets to pay for the
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   As the president talked to the governors about their ``common
vision,'' his goal, aides said, was to build support to put
pressure on Congress and pave the way for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that election-year politics might intercede and
prevent a compromise, Clinton said, was ``dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people are about
the prospects of our reaching an agreement, and I am determined to
try to do it,'' he said, striking a conciliatory tone with a group
he once headed as governor of Arkansas and whose members he
identifies with closely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used many of his powers of persuasion to suggest that
the governors' interests were more in line with his own than they
were with those of the Republican Congress. He referred approvingly
to Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio and Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine,
both Republicans, for voting against the tax cut, noting that they
did so because of their familiarity with a governor's
responsibilities. Voinovich is a former governor and Ms. Snowe is
married to a former governor, John McKernan.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a new argument to its reasons to veto the tax cut, the
White House said Sunday that under current budget laws the tax
reductions would trigger automatic, across-the-board cuts in
spending on social programs, including Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that if Clinton signed the tax bill in the form
that the House and Senate passed it, without offsetting spending
reductions or revenue increases, the budget laws would require cuts
in several categories of spending, including veterans' programs,
farm credit and crop insurance and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare would have to be cut by $2 billion in 2000, and by $9.2
billion, or 4 percent, in 2002, according to a study by the White
House budget office. Over the next five years, the study said,
Medicare would have to be cut $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton worked the room slowly, steeping
himself in conversations with individual governors. He had a warm
chat with Gov. Jesse Ventura, the independent from Minnesota, a
former wrestler with whom he talked at length about wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the governors said afterward that the president's
approach was effective, if not persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the door wide open for a compromise on tax cuts,''
said Gov. John Engler, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he believed the president was not trying to drive a
wedge between the governors and Congress. ``He's too sophisticated
for that,'' Engler said. ``He was trying to be positioned well in
the debate, and I thought it was a very artful talk. His skills
have always been significant in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, governors who listened to the president's speech
were divided along party lines. Republicans were not buying his
arguments against a big tax cut. Democrats said his reasoning made
perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very effective, very smooth, and he certainly made a
strong argument,'' said Gov. Tommy Thompson, R-Wis. ``But I still
disagree with his conclusion that we can't afford a tax cut at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he believed he spoke for ``the vast majority'' of
Republican governors, adding, `'It's hard to believe any of them
would not support the position I advocate. We have a chance for a
major tax cut. If not now, when? If we can't do it now, we will
never get the ability to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California, who last November became the
first Democrat in 16 years to be elected governor of the state,
said Clinton ``hit a home run'' and suggested that some of his
Republican colleagues might actually agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura promised to keep an open mind about the size of tax cuts
until he familiarized himself with details of the congressional
action and the administration alternative. He said he listened
closely to Clinton's remarks, as well as to the speech that
preceded it by Sen. Don Nickels, R-Okla., who criticized an array
of administration programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I venture out and make an opinion, I want to study both
proposals,'' Ventura said. ``With all I've had to do in Minnesota,
I haven't had time to focus on federal tax cuts. I don't want to
make any judgments based on two speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican governors said they did not understand why
Clinton used his speech to chide state executives for not doing
more to provide medical coverage for children from low-income
families.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Children's Health Insurance Program began in 1997,
giving states billions of dollars and wide latitude to implement
programs, about 1.3 million children have been enrolled. Clinton
pressed them to do more, even though many states have made
significant strides in drawing more children into the program in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's absolutely wrong,'' Thompson said of Clinton's
belief that the states are not doing enough. Gov. Jim Geringer of
Wyoming, another Republican, said it was pure ``chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   So why would Clinton tweak the governors on the issue? Thompson
said he did not know until he perused a chart showing how many
children the states have added to the program over the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' he said, pointing to Texas, which was the only
state showing a drop in enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, one of a handful of governors who
was not attending the governors' meeting, is the leading Republican
presidential candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, John Signor, a spokesman for the New York State
Department of Health, said the state had been a model for other
states in providing the new benefits to children. Federal officials
have agreed in the past, saying that indeed as many as 30 percent
of all children nationwide benefiting from the program are in New
York. That fact makes the national figures look better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dwarf any other state in terms of the number of kids we
have in the program or in the amount of state support that we give
to the program,'' Signor said. ``Under Governor Pataki's
leadership, this program has flourished and New York state is a
national leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Signor said that the state provides about $200 million for the
program compared with about $250 million from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   But New York has not done so well in another area on Clinton's
agenda, providing Medicaid benefits to poor people as they leave
the welfare rolls. The number of people in New York on Medicaid has
dropped 9 percent since Clinton signed the welfare law three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials have conceded that something is wrong,
and in January a federal district judge ruled that New York City
had improperly denied applications for Medicaid from needy
individuals on the grounds that they had failed to comply with the
work requirements of the city's welfare program.

<P>
   NEW PALTZ, N.Y. _ John Bradley has stared into the face of the
worst drought in recent history. From the bone-dry stream beds and
parched trails of the Shawangunk Mountains, something is staring
back. It is black and furry and has inch-long claws.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a management consultant who owns 2,500 acres in
southern Ulster County, about two hours from Manhattan, is
continually on his cell phone these days. The calls are from his
tenants, panicked weekenders confronting black bears on the porches
and lawns of their cabins, and even in their living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, we have a bear on our porch,'' came the recent call from
David Rockwell, the restaurant designer, who rents a log cabin on
Bradley's land. A dutiful landlord, Bradley scooped up a gravel
rake and some dirty shirts and ran to the scene. He uses the smelly
clothing to distract the bears while an escape is made, in a
technique he calls ``drop and run.''
</P>
<P>
   In the New York region, the problems of the drought extend
beyond dry wells and dead corn. Record heat and little rain have
withered berry bushes _ an important summer food supply for bears _
and dried up streams on the mountaintops. Park rangers and
naturalists say this has forced bears, and even rattlesnakes, down
from the mountains in search of food and water.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had movement of snakes,'' said Tim Sullivan, supervising
forest ranger for the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which
closed 200 miles of hiking trails last week to avert forest fires.
``Raccoons, they're traveling. Bears aren't any different, because
moist food is not that abundant.''
</P>
<P>
   A steady increase in the bear population has made the problem
worse, said Heinz Meng, a biology professor at the State University
of New York at New Paltz. ``The blackberries have dried up,'' he
said, ``and the bears are looking for other sources of food.''
</P>
<P>
   Bears are popping up throughout the region. Bob Eriksen, the
supervising wildlife biologist for New Jersey's Division of Fish,
Game and Wildlife, said that nuisance complaints about bears had
reached a record high this year: 1,200 so far, compared with 892
for all of last year. New Jersey has had about 25 bear break-ins
this year, compared with 18 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a result of bears' living in close proximity to
people'' rather than drought conditions, Eriksen said, but he added
that if the drought continued, ``It will be a problem because the
food crop will be reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Shawangunks, the bear migration has changed life for
Bradley and his six tenants on the exclusive Awosting Reserve.
Bradley has spotted seven bears near the houses in the last month.
The last time he saw a bear below the mountain range _ just one _
was during the severe drought of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The bear Rockwell spotted had worked its way to the home of
another tenant, a Wall Street executive, by the time Bradley
arrived. A cub about the size of a golden retriever, it was eating
from a bird feeder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I approached, it got up and walked directly through his
front door,'' Bradley recalled. ``I'm yelling, when it exits and
leaps over the side of the porch.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the sound of knocking brought Bradley, in the
buff, from his swimming pool. In his driveway, a mature bear was
lifting the lid of the shed for his emergency generator. Bradley
grabbed dirty socks and got ready for the ``drop and run.'' The
bear scooted eight feet up a tree and made off over a fence.
</P>
<P>
   The bears are less like ravaging Huns, and more like thoughtless
guests who turn weekend visits into protracted stays. They returned
repeatedly to the cabin of the Wall Street executive, rustling
through his garbage, licking the grease off his barbecue grill and
munching from his bird feeder _ as he lay in a nearby hammock. ``I
finally drew myself up to my full height and told them to scram,''
said the executive, who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Henry, a big-game biologist in the New Paltz office of
the state Department of Environmental Conservation, says that the
rock ridge above the Awosting Reserve is part of a ``travel
corridor'' for bears, extending from New Jersey to Pennsylvania.
While there are about 5,000 bears in New York state, no one has
been hurt by one in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Rockwell's tenants, Daniel Sullivan and Alysa Wishingrad,
said on Saturday that they felt no pity for the hairy and
disfranchised. They had survived the ultimate encounter: A mature
black bear had charged at them full-tilt, dust rising behind its
paws.
</P>
<P>
   They were up by Awosting Lake, a shady area blessed with rare
surviving berries, when two bucks bolted out of the forest, making
a sound like a speeding train.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deer are running this fast for a reason,'' Ms. Wishingrad,
who is eight and a half months pregnant, recalled musing.
</P>
<P>
   The mature black bear _ capable of hitting 30 mph _ was right
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were falling all over each other, running and making
noise,'' said Sullivan, an executive recruiter for Internet
companies. They even broke into the soccer song ``Ole! Ole! Ole!''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the bear peeled off. The drought, however, continues.

   MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights _ Lining up among the tents pitched
in the apple orchards of this mountain village, the Druse children
belted out their summer camp cheer as two Syrian flags fluttered
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria! Syria! Syria!'' they shouted, fists raised, as morning
fog lifted from Majdal Shams, at the foot of Mount Hermon on the
northern edge of the Israeli-held Golan Heights. ``Golan, Golan,
Golan! Withdrawal, withdrawal, withdrawal!''
</P>
<P>
   The cry was for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, a
strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war
and annexed by Israel in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawal _ ``al-jalaa'' in Arabic _ is in fact the name of the
pro-Syrian summer camp here where more than 300 youngsters spent 10
days of patriotic fervor, within sight of Syria and under
occasional surveillance by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel and Syria gingerly feel their way toward a possible
renewal of peace talks broken off three years ago, Syrian
nationalist sentiment is running high among many of the 18,000
Druse who live in four villages in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Members of an offshoot from Islam that numbers about 400,000 in
Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, the Druse in Golan are
contemplating the prospect of a return of their villages to Syrian
control. Syria is demanding an Israeli withdrawal as the price of
peace, and the Druse villages may well be the first areas handed
over if a treaty is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have enjoyed relative prosperity under Israeli
rule while Syria's economy has struggled, few Druse will say they
prefer what is widely viewed here as a foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic situation comes and goes, but your homeland comes
first,'' said Zeid Aweidat, a grocer in Majdal Shams. ``Just
because you drive a Mercedes doesn't mean you abandon your poor
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Withdrawal, now in its eighth season, Syrian patriotism
and Arab solidarity were flaunted openly, in defiance of the
Israelis. Two Syrian flags and a Palestinian banner flew in the
middle of the encampment, tents bore names of cities and ancient
sites in Syria and a surrounding fence was covered with posters
made by campers celebrating ``Arab Syrian Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp T-shirt bore a map of the Arab world and the words:
``My homeland, no matter how long forgotten. Thousands have come to
occupy it, but they will melt away like the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with sports, music, art and outings to a swimming pool,
the camp offered field trips to ruins of Golan villages that were
emptied when Israel captured the area in 1967. Dozens of villages
were destroyed in the aftermath of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Campers were told about the history and geography of Syria and
regaled with tales of famous battles like Saladdin's 12th-century
campaigns against the Crusaders and the Battle of Maithalun in
1920, when Syrian nationalists fought French troops who marched on
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Ayman Abu Jabal, 33, a director of the camp, said it was set up
to counter the Israeli-controlled curriculum of schools on the
Golan Heights, where Druse children learn Hebrew as well as Arabic
and Middle Eastern history devoid of Arab nationalist content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is trying to turn them into Israelis, and we reject
that,'' Abu Jabal said. ``We want to teach our children that we
have a homeland, a nation, a people that we're very proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   That nation is Syria, not Israel, and the people are Arab, not
Druse, said Fawzi Abu Jabal, 45, another camp director, who served
10 years in jail for spying for Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Syrian Arabs living under Israeli occupation,'' he
said. ``We're part of the Arab nation. There is no Druse people
with a separate history. That disinformation is spread by Israel,
to divide and rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The campers, who included a few Israeli Arabs and Palestinians
from East Jerusalem, clearly got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned to love our homeland, defend our nation and hate
Zionism,'' said Badia Sabra, a 13-year-old boy from the Druse
village of Masadeh.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled Abu Shahin, 14, from the neighboring village of Buqata,
said that after three summers at the camp, his perspective on
Israel had changed. Visiting the ruins of a village destroyed after
the 1967 war made him feel that ``Israel is unjust,'' he recalled
in the eloquent Hebrew he learned in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it, I couldn't believe the Israelis could be so
harsh,'' Khaled said. ``I had thought they were good. Now I believe
that only our people are good for us. We want to return to Syria
and live with our true people, like our grandparents did.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The yearning for Syria is not only political. The Golan Druse
have relatives in Syria from whom they have been separated for
years by the mines and fences along the dividing line.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the summer camp, across what is called here the
Valley of Tears, members of the divided Abu Salah clan, living on
both sides of the fence, used megaphones to console each other
after the death of a relative in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in traditional black, with white headdresses, the Abu
Salahs from Majdal Shams took turns greeting relatives clustered on
the opposite hill in Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you?'' said an old woman in a white kerchief,
listening for the reply wafting over the valley. ``Sister, we
console you from here. We hope we'll meet soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nahi Abu Salah, grieving for her uncle, sang a lament and a plea
for the fences to come down. ``If only I could have been with you,
even at your funeral,'' she chanted into the megaphone as women
wept beside her. ``Let the missing return. Have mercy on us. Let a
mother see her long-lost son.''

KYLE EASTWOOD'S DEBUT RECORDING A TESTAMENT TO HIS ECLECTICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEITH RAETHER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, Clint Eastwood produced a film, ``Bird,''
about saxophonist Charles ``Yardbird'' Parker, who had this to say
about jazz: ``They teach you there's a boundary line to art ... but
there's no boundary line. If you don't live (jazz), it won't come
out of your horn.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one years ago, Eastwood and his first wife, Maggie
Johnson, also produced a son who is trying to live what Parker
preached. Kyle Eastwood is a jazz bassist whose heroes are Paul
Chambers, Ron Carter and Ray Brown, and whose way of life is ``to
eat and read and sleep music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, that's about all I do _ write music, make music
and spend time with my family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz is the music Eastwood makes, but the kind of jazz he favors
has direct links to rock 'n' roll, rhythm and blues and world beat.
He's quick to admit he's ``not a purist'' and he sees no conflict,
aesthetically or practically, in retooling a rock anthem or reggae
tune to fit a jazz context.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep an open mind,'' said Eastwood, whose quintet was
in Vancouver, B.C., last month to open for the Cowboy Junkies at
the du Maurier International Jazz Festival. ``I know there are a
lot of people who believe you should just play the music in the
(jazz) tradition, and that's fine. It's definitely important to
absorb that tradition. But I think it can be limiting to play music
the way it's been played for the past 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood's debut recording, ``From There to Here,'' is a
testament to his eclecticism. His choice of material ranges from
Tom Waits' ``I Beg Your Pardon'' to Marvin Gaye's ``Trouble Man.''
Several tracks are buoyed by orchestral arrangements from Vince
Mendoza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Miles Davis' collaborations with Gil Evans' orchestra
many years ago,'' Eastwood said. ``They made a big impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood also had the good fortune to meet the likes of Davis,
Count Basie, Stan Getz and Sarah Vaughan at the Monterey Jazz
Festival, an annual pastime for his father. There he heard Dave
Brubeck's quartet, Stan Kenton's big band and Basie's Super Chief
of an orchestra. He was charmed by the musicians and mesmerized by
the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 6 or 7 when I met Miles,'' he said. ``He was pretty
intimidating just because of his stature in the jazz world. But
everyone I met, even Miles, was fairly gregarious and had great
stories to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is hard-pressed to recall those stories, but he's clear
about the influence each brush with greatness had on his own
interest in music. ``Bass was the instrument that caught my ear,''
he said. ``Even in rock bands, I was always drawn to groups that
had strong bass players _ John Paul Jones in Led Zeppelin, Jack
Bruce in Cream. Some of the first things I ever learned on piano
were the bass lines in boogie-woogie.''
</P>
<P>
   Clint Eastwood taught him those lines. Growing up in Pebble
Beach, Calif., Kyle Eastwood remembers regular jam sessions at the
piano, playing bass lines in his left hand while his father
embellished the melodic line in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz was always in our house, and I've always been an avid and
serious listener,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood didn't take up music seriously until he was 18. He had
piano lessons when he was young, but it wasn't until a friend
loaned him an electric bass in high school that he played any
instrument with purpose. He bought his first upright bass when he
was 19 and now plays both instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the discipline early on to learn music and
really practice it, which I regret a bit now,'' he said. ``But it's
never too late to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   During his short-lived college days at the University of
Southern California, Eastwood made up for lost time. He enrolled as
a film major but before he finished his freshman year, he was
otherwise occupied by music theory and composition.
</P>
<P>
   He took a year off from school to study music and never went
back. With his parents' blessing, he studied privately with Bunny
Brunel, the French bassist known for his work with Chick Corea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bunny made sure I was a well-rounded player, and he forced me
to read music,'' Eastwood said. ``He didn't stop at jazz. He had me
reading Bach etudes and taught me bowing techniques so that I'd
have the tools to become a complete player.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood formed his first band, West Quintet, when he was 23.
The group played ``the usual L.A. haunts'' such as the Baked Potato
and appeared at a few high-profile festivals, including Montreux.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. was good because of the experience I gained through
studio work,'' he said. ``But it really isn't a place to develop
your own music, and there aren't nearly the places to play that
there are in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood and his wife, Spanish actress and former model Laura
Gomez, recently moved to New York City with their 4-year-old
daughter Graylen. There the bassist enjoys the best of two worlds:
a music community of like-minded players and plentiful jazz venues
to guarantee that his music will find an audience as it develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to develop is to keep (playing music),'' he said.
``Besides being with my family, that's all I care about doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood says his parents fully support his decision to ditch a
film career to play music because ``they know I'm approaching it
whole-heartedly and not just screwing around.''
</P>
<P>
   Would the younger Eastwood be able to lead a band and boast a
recording contract with a major label (Sony) were it not for his
famous father? The young bassist allows that being the son of Clint
Eastwood ``draws a lot of attention'' and that ``if it brings
people to a gig, that's fine.'' But he wants to be judged on his
own merit and the integrity of the music he and his band create.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music isn't a hobby in my life,'' he said. ``Jazz especially
is something you have to concentrate on completely if you're ever
going to play it right. The rhythmic element in the music is
subtle, implied. You can't fake playing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Late bloomer notwithstanding, Eastwood is quickly learning what
Parker said of the music 50 years ago: If he doesn't live it, it
will never come out in his instrument. A day doesn't go by that
Eastwood doesn't pick up his bass, a bass he holds like a young
daughter who knows only possibilities in the world.

 &HT;    Hawks finish a clean sweep
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A huge team photo in the Hawks' reception area tells
the story of the startlingly different team that will open in
Philips Arena three months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 players in that photo from two seasons ago, only three
_ Dikembe Mutombo, Alan Henderson and Chris Crawford _ will hang
their clothes in the team's deluxe new locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, even though we were so bitterly
disappointed at the way things turned out last season, I never
thought it would come to this,'' Hawks president Stan Kasten said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not a clue ``that we would be trading Mookie
Blaylock and getting such a dynamic young guard (Jason Terry) out
of the draft. I didn't know we would be trading Steve Smith and
getting two terrific players (Isaiah Rider, Jim Jackson) from
Portland. I didn't know we'd be getting a fine young big man like
Lorenzen Wright.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season starts, only Mutombo and Bimbo Coles and _ if
he's re-signed _ Grant Long will be older than 29. None of this was
accidental. The Hawks understood that their window of opportunity
was closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had waited a year to trade Mookie and Steve, I'm not at
all sure we would have had the same opportunities,'' Kasten said.
</P>
<P>
   They found willing partners in the Golden State Warriors,
desperate for a veteran point guard so they can finally make it to
the playoffs, and in the Portland Trail Blazers, who believe
Smith's leadership and clutch shooting can take them to a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Hawks created the $4.4 million trade exception
that lured Wright by dealing Christian Laettner to Detroit last
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``When opportunity presents itself you have to act,'' Kasten
said. ``That's why Pete (Babcock) has worked so hard to bring
off.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the Hawks' summer of opportunity. Having sent two 2000
first-rounders to the Clippers for Wright, who was the No. 7 pick
in 1996; having shipped Blaylock for the No. 10 pick (Terry);
having taken two more first-rounders (Cal Bowdler and Dion Glover)
in this summer's draft; and having moved Smith, they pushed all the
buttons available to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be players in the next draft,'' Kasten said, ``and we
won't be players in the free-agent market because we're capped out.
Now, of course, that doesn't prevent us from making trades.''
</P>
<P>
   That might happen sooner or later. With 14 guaranteed contracts
on a 12-man roster, the Hawks could make one or more minor deals
before they get out of training camp. In fact, they have so packed
their roster that the door may be closed to free-agent power
forward Long, who wanted to talk to teams like the Knicks and the
Heat. While he deliberated, New York signed John Wallace and Miami
signed Otis Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   Kasten would not preclude the signing of Long (``We still have
our $2million exception'') and management cannot ignore Long's
leadership skills or the brilliant clutch performances that won so
many games last season. But signing him now presents further
complication.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks will make the signing of free-agent small forward
Chris Crawford official this week. They have to renounce claims to
free agents Jeff Sheppard and Mark West. They will part company
with veteran forward Ty Corbin but hope to do it with a trade so
Corbin can make $2.4 million instead of the $1 million veteran's
exception next season. They also will waive small forward Duane
Ferrell, who came along in the Blaylock deal to balance the salary
scales.
</P>
<P>
   The more difficult decisions come when they pare the guard corps
from six to five. If Long returns, they have to move another
player, probably a small forward (LaPhonso Ellis, Roshown McLeod
and Crawford are the incumbents). By rule, the Hawks cannot trade a
drafted player until the 50th day of the season (Dec. 21).
</P>
<P>
   ``It will all fall into place,'' Kasten said. ``Things have a
way of working out.''

JORDAN'S NEW KING ASSUMES FAKE IDENTITIES TO GLIMPSE REAL-LIFE
PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (rm)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ The young new king is wearing new _ well,
different _ clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday he posed as a taxi passenger, spending two hours
watching life unfold on Amman's often chaotic streets. Five days
earlier, his disguise was as a television reporter, complete with
fake white beard and Arab robes, as he and an aide, armed with a
video camera, went to inspect Jordan's free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   For his taxi ride, officials said, the 37-year-old King Abdullah
II wore the kind of beat-up clothes that an ordinary Jordanian
might don in these tough economic times.
</P>
<P>
   He avoided detection even when he and the supposed cabdriver, a
palace aide, stopped to ask a policeman for directions and later,
eager to test local law enforcement, made what a palace aide called
``a maneuver or two that was illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier outing, the disguise had to be doffed when trade
zone officials confronted the camera team to say they could not
work without a permit. In response, one palace official said, the
king reportedly pulled off his fake beard to reveal his real,
stubbly and black one.
</P>
<P>
   The details of each episode have been quickly leaked by palace
officials, prompting what from the public has been the kind of
gotcha glee evoked by an episode of ``Candid Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians, ground down by day-to-day problems, including
the stagnant economy and a widening gap between rich and poor, have
long complained that no one is paying attention to the country's
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is showing that he is a real Arab,'' said Ahmed Batieh, 27,
a laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people here, Batieh said he saw in Abdullah's forays
an echo not just of the common touch shown by his father, King
Hussein, but of undercover missions undertaken among the poor by
Omar bin Khattab, an early successor to the Prophet Mohammed
remembered as one of the most distinguished, devout caliphs in
Islamic history.
</P>
<P>
   In other circles there has been much chortling over the possible
fate of the officious bureaucrats at a free trade zone who told the
``journalists'' that they had no right to keep questioning
investors who had been complaining about red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the policemen, who were reported to have stopped the
errant taxi and to have scolded the ``passenger'' for not wearing a
seat belt, but to have been talked out of issuing a ticket, has
certainly not helped the reputation of a force seen by many people
here as less than competent.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the king seems to have served notice _ to the
public and to the businessmen, bureaucrats and other members of the
establishment who wield considerable power _ that he is willing to
break the mold to shake things up.
</P>
<P>
   The message seems to have been heard. A cartoon this past week
in the newspaper Al Rai showed a bureaucrat surrendering his desk
and singing a pro-monarchy anthem as a troop of visitors descends
on his office, each wearing the exact same disguise. But when asked
Sunday whether the exercises were over, a palace official said, ``I
think there will be more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Adbullah was little known to most Jordanians when he took power
after his father's death six months ago. Until two weeks before,
when his dying father abruptly named him crown prince, he had been
a soldier, with almost no political experience.
</P>
<P>
   But even before plunging incognito into the streets last month,
he plunged into a show of activist leadership, even undertaking
back-to-back personal inspections of a government hospital.
</P>
<P>
   That attention to domestic matters has contrasted sharply with
what critics came to see as Hussein's all-absorbing preoccupation
with foreign policy in the last years of his reign, and it seems to
have won Abdullah a number of converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no grounds for expecting anything from him,'' said
Radwan Abdullah, a political scientist. ``But I have been impressed
precisely because he has made it very clear from the start that he
was not following his father blindly, and that he was going to be
his own man.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, others worry that the missions may be a precedent for a
move in a wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to give the new king the benefit of the doubt and
encourage the new aspects of his character,'' said Labib Kamhawi, a
political scientist. ``But we do not want to see this developing
into the old and tired habit of running the country as a one-man
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is not the first in his family to resort to costuming
and derring-do. Among his Hashemite royal family, leadership has
often been marked by a blend of prankishness and cunning.
</P>
<P>
   His great-grandfather, King Abdullah I, met with a woman wearing
a wig and an Arab peasant dress _ beneath that disguise she was
Golda Meir _ in a meeting that kicked off years of secret dialogue
between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In a reign that lasted 47 years, Hussein wore disguises in his
clandestine meetings with Israelis over the many years before the
two sides signed a peace in 1993. He was renowned for ditching his
bodyguards, and eight years ago he roared through the streets of
Amman on a motorcycle while the police were testing radar gear. It
took the unsuspecting policemen 90 minutes to catch up with him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is sometimes said that in Jordan, being king also requires
being many things to many people, so even public attire requires
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Like that of his father, Abdullah's wardrobe ranges widely, from
Arab headdress to military uniform to business suit, with the
choice depending _ in this small, diverse and politically fragile
country _ on which constituency is closest at hand.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the economy goes, people in Jordan note that Abdullah
so far has also delivered mostly symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to the United States, Canada and Europe in May, he
made almost no progress toward agreements that might ease Jordan's
$7-billion debt, which is a major drag on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only tangible economic change that Jordan's
government has adopted since he became king has been one that is
highly unpopular _ an increase of three percentage points, to 13
percent, in the national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of creating some momentum, the king has now pressed
for an emergency session of parliament, in which one priority would
be legislation aimed at opening the country to investors. But some
Western diplomats and other experts here say they wonder whether
the king has a clear vision yet for Jordan's economic future.
</P>
<P>
   ``His vigor and his fresh approach to things is really winning
him a lot of emotional support,'' Kamhawi said. ``But at the end of
the day, this is more or less like watching a nice movie. When you
go out of the theater, you get hit with the hard facts.''

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ On a blistering hot summer day, a courtly
gentleman named Shu Jao-min wandered inside the cool white walls of
the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall at the center of this bustling
city, talking about past and present.
</P>
<P>
   Shu is 70, which gives him some perspective. And the way things
are going on Taiwan looks pretty clear to him: farther and farther
away from China. The old dream of reunifying the big, lumbering
mainland with this jewel of an island, Shu said, is gradually
evaporating here.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Shu gestured at the grandfatherly-looking statue of
Chiang behind him. He pointed out that although the former leader
is now widely recognized as having been a dictatorial gangster, he
had a vision of a noncommunist China that still thrives, if only on
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China took over, they would not just change the flag and
the anthem,'' said Shu, a retired advertising salesman. ``They
would try to control us, and take away our democracy. Why should we
accept?''
</P>
<P>
   Why, indeed? Taiwan has survived independent of China for 50
years now, and this summer it took a firm diplomatic step to
separate itself further when President Lee Teng-hui asserted that
Taiwan will deal with its neighbor only as a separate state, and
not as two parts of the same conceptual nation.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's new stance infuriated Beijing and irritated the United
States and other countries, which accept the premise that Taiwan
and China should reunify someday. The United States takes that
position at least in part to maintain peace and in part to appease
China, because Beijing has made it clear that any country wanting
diplomatic ties with China must cut off corresponding relations
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   International opinion blames Lee for disturbing the status quo,
but many people here with a longer-term view, like Shu, say that
the constant threat of military and diplomatic pressure from
Beijing is what causes the root tension between China and Taiwan _
more than the diplomatic antics of Lee.
</P>
<P>
   A wide cross-section of people in Taiwan _ from business
executives to schoolteachers to retirees like Shu _ say they want
to stay separate from China. Essentially, they want to be left
alone. And a critical factor in the China-Taiwan equation that
outsiders often overlook is that any reunification would be hard to
achieve without public support of the Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't we two countries _ aren't we really independent?'' said
Shih Min-teh, a legislator who spent 25 years in prison for
supporting an independent stance for Taiwan when the governing
Nationalist Party outlawed such talk. ``If China tries to take over
Taiwan, it will be very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Shih laughed as he pointed out that he spent all those years in
prison for supporting a position that Taiwan's president now
endorses. And as Lee has moved in that direction, public opinion
apparently has moved with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee Teng-hui was right,'' said Lin Ming-kung, 55, who runs a
small toy company just outside Taipei. ``We've been separate for 50
years, we want to stay that way, and it is time we finally say so
openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, opinion polls taken before this summer routinely
showed majority support for no change in relations with China. Yet,
polls indicate, an equally large majority now supports Lee's
assertion that a special state-to-state relationship should govern
talks, describing it as a recognition of a reality that already
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Lee's assertion is only a half-truth, as he stopped
short of recognizing Taiwan's de facto independence. But Lee and
most Taiwanese say openly that there is no need to go so far
because China has threatened to invade Taiwan if it declares
independence outright.
</P>
<P>
   The chances that China will take military action as a result of
Lee's new stance are unclear. Last Monday, China test-launched a
new type of long-range missile that can carry a nuclear warhead,
apparently a reminder of the country's military strength.
</P>
<P>
   Yet its leaders, who call the Taiwan-born Lee a traitor, may
simply wait until he leaves office early next year so that they can
try to work with his successor. The leading presidential candidate,
James Soong, a mainland-born leader, favors friendlier ties with
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a courageous leader, not a reckless one,'' Soong
regularly says at campaign events around Taiwan, implicitly
criticizing Lee without saying exactly what his own position would
be.
</P>
<P>
   But political analysts here say that for Soong or whoever else
wins, it will be difficult to modify the stance inherited from Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Lee has left little room to maneuver,'' said Yang
Kai-huang, a political science professor at Soochow University in
Taipei. ``No one wants to appear to be going backward on a policy
that is popular.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan is a highly politicized society, living under a
near-permanent threat from China, and day-to-day discussion seems
to revolve around the relationship with Beijing. Radio stations are
dominated by talk shows and call-in programs that are devoted to
analyzing every minute factor of the China relationship.
</P>
<P>
   One of the looming factors in any thorough discussion is the
role played by the United States, which has been Taiwan's protector
since 1949. In the previous crisis, in 1996, China's decision to
lob several missiles into the ocean near Taiwan prompted President
Clinton to send two aircraft carriers toward Taiwan, sending a
clear message that the United States would not look kindly at any
attempt to solve the dispute militarily.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Taiwan's leaders and many ordinary people have been alarmed
at what they see as a gradual but steady move by the United States
to embrace more closely China's demands for negotiations leading to
an eventual reunification.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Stanley Roth, the deputy assistant secretary
of state, has traveled to Taiwan to urge Lee and others to accept
an interim agreement that would cede sovereignty to Beijing but
block any direct interference by Beijing in Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee appears to have had multiple reasons for making his
declaration about state-to-state relations, the U.S. pressure was
clearly an important factor. Lee formally remains committed to more
talks, but his new stance effectively ruined any chance that they
would proceed any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   His announcement, made on July 9 in an interview with a German
radio reporter, was handled so poorly that his staff found it
difficult to explain why Taiwan is essentially separate but not
independent _ while still keeping to a goal of eventual
reunification with China, but only when it is democratic and
affluent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many politicians here question why the United States is not
eagerly embracing Taiwan's moves toward self-determination and
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Taiwan is already a country _ we're not a part of
anyone else's territory,'' said Chen Shui-bian, one of the three
leading candidates for president and the leader of the Democratic
Progressive Party. ``This is absolutely not an internal affair of
China. It's an important part of Asia-Pacific security.''
</P>
<P>
   The only sector of Taiwan's political community still wedded to
the idea of reunification is a band of right-wing people from the
mainland here, many of whom broke away from the Nationalist Party a
few years ago to start a party called the New Party. Fractious and
marginal, they have so far been unable to field a viable candidate
for president.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support immediate reunification with China admit
that most Taiwanese disagree with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan people want to be independent because common people
don't think about the results,'' said Liang Su-yung, the president
of an organization called the Straits Peaceful Reunification
Association. ``Taiwan people are like children. They're very
excitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chiang was around, he would never have tolerated
independence.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sgt. Chuck Hagel had watched friends writhe in
agony on the jungle floor. He had killed and nearly been killed,
the shrapnel in his chest an eerie reminder of his close call.
</P>
<P>
   But the dark hours early one morning in April 1968 were the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   As Hagel, 21, and his squad returned to camp, the Vietcong
detonated a land mine. Suddenly, the left side of Hagel's chest and
part of his face were on fire. He reached for a squad mate, his
19-year-old brother, Tom Hagel, only to feel dead weight.
</P>
<P>
   And he was forced, one time too many, to wonder if either of
them would make it out of Vietnam alive.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow they did, after spending time recovering from their
injuries in adjacent hospital beds. Along the way, Chuck Hagel
vowed that he would ultimately try to have some influence over
America's foreign policy, a way to guard against the horrors that
he endured.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his brother return to Vietnam this week for the
first time in 30 years, to attend the opening of a new American
consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, Hagel will go as the junior senator
from Nebraska and an outspoken Republican on the Foreign Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a little emotional, I suspect'' said Hagel, 52, as he
reflected on the war in an interview last week in his Capitol Hill
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't help but carry that experience around with you every
day _ every day _ for the rest of your life,'' Hagel said. ``It's
buried in your subconscious. You don't pull it out all the time.
But it's there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was one reason why he criticized and confronted other
Senate Republicans for delaying the confirmation of Richard
Holbrooke as chief American delegate to the United Nations, which
the Senate finally carried out last week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Hagel's Republican colleagues had been holding
Holbrooke's nomination hostage as they made unrelated demands of
the Clinton administration, and the U.N. post remained vacant for
more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   To the senator, that showed an irresponsible disregard for the
high stakes of international relations _ stakes that Vietnam helped
him to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   In less than three years in the Senate, Hagel has repeatedly
demonstrated a willingness to buck party leaders. While they
questioned American military involvement in Kosovo, he questioned
whether the United States was involved enough _ or, rather, whether
the United States had sent a clear enough signal that it would go
as far as necessary to stamp out Yugoslav aggression.
</P>
<P>
   That might have solved matters more quickly, he said, and the
lesson he gleaned from Vietnam was not that the United States
should not have been there, but that a gradual buildup can be the
least conscionable strategy, keeping American forces in harm's way
for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hagel is a hawk. He said he worries, in fact, about
some of the talk regarding China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we say we're going to defend Taiwan, what are we saying
there?'' he asked. ``Are we saying that if the Chinese send a
missile over, we're at war with China? It's a big thing to say. I
think we're rather careless.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel comes across as a man who is anything but careless. He
said he learned early to be responsible and strong. The oldest of
four boys, he was 16 when his father, a trouble-shooter for lumber
companies in Nebraska, died of a heart attack. His mother, a
secretary, worked both days and nights to keep the family afloat.
Hagel paid for his own clothes by working odd jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He took a break from college before graduating, then enlisted in
the Army. Tom followed, and through a fluke that neither of them
can explain, they ended up in the same squad in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   But while Chuck Hagel came to see the war as a noble cause that
was ineffectually pursued, Tom concluded that it was an immoral
waste. Chuck emerged as a relatively conservative Republican, Tom
as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to literally get into fistfights over this,'' said
Tom, who teaches law at the University of Dayton in Ohio. The
brothers have since mended fences, but Tom still questions Chuck's
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him express any overwhelming concern about
poverty in America, and I think a good example of that is the
tax-cut bill that's going on,'' Tom Hagel said, adding that the
richest Americans will benefit the most. Chuck Hagel, a believer in
more frugal government, voted for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   After returning from Vietnam in 1969, Chuck Hagel finished
college. He worked as an aide to a Republican congressman, and also
as a lobbyist. In 1981, he briefly held the second-highest position
at the Veterans Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Then he struck gold, turning $5,000 into a cellular telephone
company that made him a multimillionaire. His wealth helped him
engineer a surprise victory in the 1996 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel and his second wife, Lilibet, have a daughter, 8, and son,
6. Their photographs share space in his office, along with tributes
to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   His face no longer bears evidence of his burn wounds, which took
a decade to heal. But the memories remain, and he said he takes
from them what he needs while keeping them in their place.
</P>
<P>
   Although he plans to visit the places where he fought, Hagel
said: ``It has nothing to do with closure. I think we get into way
too much psychobabble.''

VIDEO GAME PLAYERS ARE OK, STUDY SAYS 
BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
All players of video and computer games are maladjusted,
sociopathic teens just itching to get their hands on some real
firepower and settle old scores.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not.
</P>
<P>
   A new study commissioned by Computec Media U.S.A., a subsidiary
of European publisher Computec Media AG, has found that 80 percent
of North American gamers are between the ages of 16 and 34, and
that more than 46 percent of male gamers have at least a college
education.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 31 percent of male gamers _ most are indeed guys _
earn in excess of $50,000 a year, compared with 22 percent of the
general population pulling down this kind of cash, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaming is a national pastime these days,'' said Torsten
Oppermann, chief executive of Computec's U.S. business. ``The
average gamer is well-educated and well-rounded. Hardcore gamers
are only the smallest part of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   This contradicts the general impression of gamers hammered home
by the media in the wake of the Columbine High School shootings.
The two teenage perpetrators had a strong interest in first-person
action games like Doom and Quake.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and conservative groups criticized such games as
having a dangerous, desensitizing effect on impressionable young
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine was the result of a lot of different things,'' said
George Jones, editor in chief of Computer Gaming World magazine in
San Francisco. ``Kids are feeling alienated right now. It's hard to
be a kid and always has been.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his own company's research on the demographics of gamers
confirms Computec's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Computec study was conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide, a
research organization, among a sample group of 752 U.S. and
Canadian men and women between the ages of 16 and 44.
</P>
<P>
   It draws a distinction between ``game players,'' who play
computer games simply for fun, and ``gamecentrics,'' who pursue
games more as a serious hobby. Some 84 percent of survey
respondents fell into the former category.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the usual stereotype of gamers being pudgy,
pasty-faced shut-ins, the survey found that nearly half also play
some sort of team sport or indulge in outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   Most game players are eager to stay fit and to look
well-groomed, according to the survey. They also are keen to own
nice clothing and a decent set of wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, strategy, action and sports games were the
preferred genres for most gamers, while only a fraction said they
played slower-moving ``edutainment'' titles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there isn't any mistaking computer games as a group
activity. No matter what their other interests, the majority of
gamers said they played such games alone.

ADVANCED MICRO UNVEILS ITS NEW CHIP TO TAKE ON INTEL 
 
BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
Advanced Micro Devices today will officially launch the Athlon, a
new PC microprocessor that will for the first time give the company
a clear-cut _ though not necessarily long-lasting _ performance
lead over archrival Intel.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two major PC manufacturers _ IBM and Compaq _ have committed to
using the chip in some of their machines. AMD said it now is
shipping the new chip in volume to ``dozens of leading system
manufacturers worldwide,'' and PCs that include it are expected on
dealer shelves by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   At least one local vendor, Polywell Computers of South San
Francisco, said it will have Athlon-based PCs on sale this week.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, which has headquarters in Sunnyvale, initially will offer
the Athlon in four flavors. A 650-megahertz version will sell for
$849 each in wholesale quantities. A 600-MHz Athlon will be $615,
while 550- and 500-MHz versions will be $449 and $249,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Those chips are likely to end up in PCs priced between about
$1,500 and $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected announcement of the 650-MHz chip was clearly an
attempt to trump Intel, which just last week unveiled a 600-MHz
version of its flagship chip, the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, however, says the Athlon outperforms the Pentium III not
only because of its higher clock speed, but also because it is
based on a new, more advanced ``microarchitecture'' _ the design
and organization of its internal components.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III is based on Intel's sixth-generation, or ``P6,''
microarchitecture, which it first introduced in 1995. AMD calls the
Athlon a ``seventh-generation'' design.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip features four times as much ``Level 1 cache,'' or
ultrafast on-chip memory, as the Pentium III. It also allows the
system bus _ the channel through which the central processing chip
exchanges data with the PC's other core components _ to run at 200
MHz, twice the speed of the current Pentium III system bus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new AMD design promises significantly improved
handling of complex mathematical calculations, as well as an
enhanced version of 3DNow, a set of special instructions for
processing 3-D graphics. New 3DNow instructions are specially
designed to help the chip handle high-speed communications and
popular digital audio formats such as AC-3 and MP3.
</P>
<P>
   AMD released test results from a variety of benchmarking tests
and real-life applications to make its case that the new chip
outperforms Intel's best.
</P>
<P>
   On Ziff-Davis' Business Winstone 99, a widely used benchmark
that attempts to measure system performance with popular Windows
business applications, according to AMD, the 650-MHz Athlon
outpaces a 550-MHz Pentium III by only 9 percent under Windows 98
but by 16 percent under Windows NT 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   But on more-demanding applications, including
speech-recognition, CAD, and professional-graphics programs, the
AMD data show an even larger differential in many operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by the wide assortment of results they've now
collected, it seems pretty clear that the chip outperforms current
Intel chips,'' said Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of the
Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. ``They've been
saying it for a long time, but this confirms it.''
</P>
<P>
   With its current K6 chip family, AMD claims about 15 percent of
the worldwide market in ``x86,'' or Intel-compatible, processors.
But virtually all of that share comes from the low end of the
market, where margins are especially tight, while Intel has
maintained its domination of more lucrative corporate markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon was designed to give AMD a chance to move into
high-performance markets. But the company, which in the past has
faced a variety of production problems, still faces the challenge
of convincing corporate managers that it can deliver its product
reliably.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, AMD's somewhat checkered past will give corporate
IT (information technology) people pause,'' Diefendorff said, ``but
I don't see any reason they can't look forward to some incremental
success in that market. At least they now have a weapon they can
fight with.''
</P>
<P>
   With its product line competitive in only one segment of the
market, AMD has been vulnerable to Intel's pricing tactics. In the
quarter that ended June 27, for example, AMD reported operating
losses of $173 million, after Intel slashed prices of its Celeron
chip and forced AMD to respond in kind to maintain its market share
at the low end.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon, by contrast, will compete with Intel offerings in
nearly all market segments, and that could afford AMD some
protection, analysts said, because Intel can't slash prices in all
market segments without doing serious damage to its own bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of next year the company plans to add
``Professional'' and ``Ultra'' versions of the Athlon for technical
workstations and network servers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, however, isn't sitting still. A new version of the
Pentium III, code-named Coppermine, is now slated for release in
November, and at a minimum, it's likely to narrow AMD's new-found
performance lead significantly, Diefendorff said.

EXCITEATHOME PICKS LOOKSMART 
 
BY DEBORAH SOLOMON
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome, the Redwood City high-speed Internet service and
content provider, plans to announce today that it has named
LookSmart as a main provider of directory content for Excite's Web
portal site.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome will license LookSmart's directory of more than
60,000 subject categories and integrate it into Excite's search
engine, located at www.excite.com. LookSmart of San Francisco
provides a directory of Web content, or an organized selection of
Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   A directory is part of a search engine and is content that has
been selected and placed into a category, such as News or Business.
A search engine is a tool to allow someone to go into the depths of
a Web page and find relevant keywords.
</P>
<P>
   LookSmart's listings are cobbled together by a team of more than
200 editors who review every site and weed out hate or pornographic
sites. The LookSmart directory is listed by categories _ such as
Food and Wine, News and Shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1996 by a husband and wife team, is
expected to go public in a week.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest search engine announcement for
ExciteAtHome, which said last week that it would expand its Web
hunting to include up to 300 million Web pages _ more than
one-third of the Internet's public sites. Right now, ExciteAtHome's
search engine accesses about 6 percent of online content.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have been trying to beef up their search
engines in the wake of a study published in the journal ``Nature,''
which stated that search engines only cover a tiny fraction of Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``LookSmart's Web directory is comprehensive and of the highest
quality, so it was an easy decision to expand our relationship with
them,'' said Craig Donato, vice president of search programming for
ExciteAtHome. ``Excite is working hard to provide more
comprehensive coverage of the Web as well as make it easier for
users to find what they are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like ExciteAtHome want to build all-inclusive Web
sites where customers can get everything from weather reports to
home loans. Search functions are an integral part of that, as
people look for ways to weed through the clutter on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search engines and directories are a core part of business for
companies like ExciteAtHome,'' said John Corcoran, who tracks the
company for Stephens Inc. in Richmond, Va. ``That's what drives
people to a site.''
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran said companies like ExciteAtHome want to partner with
as many content providers as possible to drive people to their
sites. That's because the more ``eyeballs'' a site attracts, the
more advertising it gets and the more revenue it generates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few years, we will have a couple of real premier
companies in this segment,'' Corcoran said. ``ExciteAtHome has done
a good job of changing itself. It's extending its offerings and
beefing up what it does. This is the exact same strategy that
America Online used a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   LookSmart already is the exclusive Web-directory provider for
the AtHome part of ExciteAtHome. AtHome provides super-fast
Internet connections and Internet service via cable TV lines. The
company bought Excite, a content provider, earlier this year for
more than $6 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under this agreement, LookSmart will provide its directory
content to both the AtHome broadband portal and Excite's narrowband
portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to expand our previous relationship with AtHome
to include Excite.com,'' said Evan Thornley, co-founder and CEO of
LookSmart. ``They're a leading-edge media company with
sophisticated users who want the best online experience possible.
We'll help give them that.''

   Surf the Net While Riding the Elevator 
 &HT;    BY TOM STEIN 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elevator rides are notoriously unpleasant. Crammed in a small
box with a bunch of strangers, passengers typically stare at their
shoes or do just about anything to avoid making eye contact. But if
Michael DiFranza has his way, a trip to the fifth floor soon will
become an entertaining and informative experience.
</P>
<P>
   DiFranza's 2-year-old company, Captivate Inc. in Westford,
Mass., is installing flat-panel screens in elevator cars. The
screens are linked to the Internet and display news headlines,
sports scores, local traffic and weather reports and even
restaurant reviews. The idea is to put elevator riders at ease and
give then a natural place to rest their gaze.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the technology is in 25 elevators in major East Coast
cities. But DiFranza says his company has just landed a major
account that will put the screens in an additional 200 elevators,
including locations in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle and
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   DiFranza said his flat-panel elevator screens are a perfect fit
for office towers and hotels. ``A person in one of these buildings
rides in an elevator about eight times a day for about 30 seconds
each trip,'' he said. ``Every 10 seconds, we deliver new
information to the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers pay a monthly subscription fee for the service, which
comes complete with the flat-panel screens and installation.
Captivate licenses content for its screens from such partners as
Reuters, Sidewalk.com, AccuWeather and Smart Traveler. The content
is tailored to each location, so that passengers in Boston can
catch up on news about the Red Sox, while those in San Francisco
can get the latest Giants score.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the subscriber model, DiFranza expects to make money by
selling banner ads across the Captivate screens. After all, he
points out, elevator riders represent the kind of captive audience
that advertisers crave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any advertisers yet, but we're targeting dot-com
companies because they are looking to build a brand with people who
buy online,'' he said. ``Office workers are computer literate, and
most e-commerce transactions are conducted from the workplace.
We'll be giving advertisers access to business professionals at a
time of day when they are otherwise out of range.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Zawacki, a managing director at interactive media firm Modem
Media Poppe Tyson, said advertisers are likely to adopt a
wait-and-see attitude. ``The first issue is distribution,'' he
said. ``It's tough to convince advertisers you're reaching enough
of the right people. Then there's a problem with upkeep of these
systems and making sure the connection to the Internet doesn't go
down.''
</P>
<P>
   But DiFranza and his investors, including Olympic Venture
Partners, BT Alex. Brown and Primus Venture Partners, are
undeterred. To date, they have pumped $10 million into the company.
</P>
<P>
   One of the firm's first customers is the Seaport Hotel in
Boston. Hotel spokeswoman Dawn Curtis said guests usually are blown
away by the technology. ``There's a big gee-whiz factor here,'' she
said. ``People really take notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps too much notice. Curtis admitted that some guests become
so engrossed in the screens that they miss their floors _ or even
worse, selfishly hold the elevators until they finish reading.

VIDEO GAME PLAYERS ARE OK, STUDY SAYS 
BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
All players of video and computer games are maladjusted,
sociopathic teens just itching to get their hands on some real
firepower and settle old scores.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not.
</P>
<P>
   A new study commissioned by Computec Media U.S.A., a subsidiary
of European publisher Computec Media AG, has found that 80 percent
of North American gamers are between the ages of 16 and 34, and
that more than 46 percent of male gamers have at least a college
education.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, 31 percent of male gamers _ most are indeed guys _
earn in excess of $50,000 a year, compared with 22 percent of the
general population pulling down this kind of cash, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaming is a national pastime these days,'' said Torsten
Oppermann, chief executive of Computec's U.S. business. ``The
average gamer is well-educated and well-rounded. Hardcore gamers
are only the smallest part of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   This contradicts the general impression of gamers hammered home
by the media in the wake of the Columbine High School shootings.
The two teenage perpetrators had a strong interest in first-person
action games like Doom and Quake.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents and conservative groups criticized such games as
having a dangerous, desensitizing effect on impressionable young
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine was the result of a lot of different things,'' said
George Jones, editor in chief of Computer Gaming World magazine in
San Francisco. ``Kids are feeling alienated right now. It's hard to
be a kid and always has been.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his own company's research on the demographics of gamers
confirms Computec's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Computec study was conducted by Roper Starch Worldwide, a
research organization, among a sample group of 752 U.S. and
Canadian men and women between the ages of 16 and 44.
</P>
<P>
   It draws a distinction between ``game players,'' who play
computer games simply for fun, and ``gamecentrics,'' who pursue
games more as a serious hobby. Some 84 percent of survey
respondents fell into the former category.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the usual stereotype of gamers being pudgy,
pasty-faced shut-ins, the survey found that nearly half also play
some sort of team sport or indulge in outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   Most game players are eager to stay fit and to look
well-groomed, according to the survey. They also are keen to own
nice clothing and a decent set of wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, strategy, action and sports games were the
preferred genres for most gamers, while only a fraction said they
played slower-moving ``edutainment'' titles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there isn't any mistaking computer games as a group
activity. No matter what their other interests, the majority of
gamers said they played such games alone.

ADVANCED MICRO UNVEILS ITS NEW CHIP TO TAKE ON INTEL 
 
BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
Advanced Micro Devices today will officially launch the Athlon, a
new PC microprocessor that will for the first time give the company
a clear-cut _ though not necessarily long-lasting _ performance
lead over archrival Intel.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two major PC manufacturers _ IBM and Compaq _ have committed to
using the chip in some of their machines. AMD said it now is
shipping the new chip in volume to ``dozens of leading system
manufacturers worldwide,'' and PCs that include it are expected on
dealer shelves by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   At least one local vendor, Polywell Computers of South San
Francisco, said it will have Athlon-based PCs on sale this week.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, which has headquarters in Sunnyvale, initially will offer
the Athlon in four flavors. A 650-megahertz version will sell for
$849 each in wholesale quantities. A 600-MHz Athlon will be $615,
while 550- and 500-MHz versions will be $449 and $249,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Those chips are likely to end up in PCs priced between about
$1,500 and $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected announcement of the 650-MHz chip was clearly an
attempt to trump Intel, which just last week unveiled a 600-MHz
version of its flagship chip, the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, however, says the Athlon outperforms the Pentium III not
only because of its higher clock speed, but also because it is
based on a new, more advanced ``microarchitecture'' _ the design
and organization of its internal components.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium III is based on Intel's sixth-generation, or ``P6,''
microarchitecture, which it first introduced in 1995. AMD calls the
Athlon a ``seventh-generation'' design.
</P>
<P>
   The new chip features four times as much ``Level 1 cache,'' or
ultrafast on-chip memory, as the Pentium III. It also allows the
system bus _ the channel through which the central processing chip
exchanges data with the PC's other core components _ to run at 200
MHz, twice the speed of the current Pentium III system bus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new AMD design promises significantly improved
handling of complex mathematical calculations, as well as an
enhanced version of 3DNow, a set of special instructions for
processing 3-D graphics. New 3DNow instructions are specially
designed to help the chip handle high-speed communications and
popular digital audio formats such as AC-3 and MP3.
</P>
<P>
   AMD released test results from a variety of benchmarking tests
and real-life applications to make its case that the new chip
outperforms Intel's best.
</P>
<P>
   On Ziff-Davis' Business Winstone 99, a widely used benchmark
that attempts to measure system performance with popular Windows
business applications, according to AMD, the 650-MHz Athlon
outpaces a 550-MHz Pentium III by only 9 percent under Windows 98
but by 16 percent under Windows NT 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   But on more-demanding applications, including
speech-recognition, CAD, and professional-graphics programs, the
AMD data show an even larger differential in many operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging by the wide assortment of results they've now
collected, it seems pretty clear that the chip outperforms current
Intel chips,'' said Keith Diefendorff, editor in chief of the
Microprocessor Report, an industry newsletter. ``They've been
saying it for a long time, but this confirms it.''
</P>
<P>
   With its current K6 chip family, AMD claims about 15 percent of
the worldwide market in ``x86,'' or Intel-compatible, processors.
But virtually all of that share comes from the low end of the
market, where margins are especially tight, while Intel has
maintained its domination of more lucrative corporate markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon was designed to give AMD a chance to move into
high-performance markets. But the company, which in the past has
faced a variety of production problems, still faces the challenge
of convincing corporate managers that it can deliver its product
reliably.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, AMD's somewhat checkered past will give corporate
IT (information technology) people pause,'' Diefendorff said, ``but
I don't see any reason they can't look forward to some incremental
success in that market. At least they now have a weapon they can
fight with.''
</P>
<P>
   With its product line competitive in only one segment of the
market, AMD has been vulnerable to Intel's pricing tactics. In the
quarter that ended June 27, for example, AMD reported operating
losses of $173 million, after Intel slashed prices of its Celeron
chip and forced AMD to respond in kind to maintain its market share
at the low end.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlon, by contrast, will compete with Intel offerings in
nearly all market segments, and that could afford AMD some
protection, analysts said, because Intel can't slash prices in all
market segments without doing serious damage to its own bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of next year the company plans to add
``Professional'' and ``Ultra'' versions of the Athlon for technical
workstations and network servers.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, however, isn't sitting still. A new version of the
Pentium III, code-named Coppermine, is now slated for release in
November, and at a minimum, it's likely to narrow AMD's new-found
performance lead significantly, Diefendorff said.

   It's Summer Fun for Tech Execs 
 &HT;    BY STAN BUNGER AND JAN BOYD 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Silicon Valley summertime: High-tech executives pack up their
overnight bags and fly off to cram into hotel ballrooms around the
country. They gather to discuss the future and to make darn sure
that they don't miss anything in case someone actually has it all
figured out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Convergence'' is the big buzzword _ it's essentially shorthand
for ``technology is impacting industry X, but I'm not quite sure
how.'' At the recent Red Herring conference on Hollywood
entertainment and tech, executives discussed ``convergence'' at
length.
</P>
<P>
   The most entertaining part of the conference was the sniping
between tech and entertainment executives. During one panel
discussion, Sony Pictures executive Robert Tereck declared, ``Yahoo
has all the brand identity of a phone book in terms of emotional
experience. Sony products make people laugh and cry.''
</P>
<P>
   This statement provoked a few muttered derisive comments from
the techies in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   However, another entertainment executive's claim that ``the
browser is so dead and flat, it's essentially a millstone around
our neck'' actually got part of the audience hissing.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what the future of entertainment will look like,
but apparently Hollywood doesn't want Silicon Valley to take the
lead and ``give us crappy tools.'' And the tech side seems to feel
as if Hollywood ``doesn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   During another panel presentation, the guys sitting in the
audience behind us (it was dark, couldn't read their company name
tags) discussed loudly enough for two rows to hear that the
entertainment executives basically were morons. So much for
interindustry cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Miller, director of Intel's content and commerce effort,
describes it as ``not so much convergence as an intersection.
There's a lot of cars going through, and sometimes accidents
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Chuck D of Public Enemy was the most interesting of the
speakers. During a packed discussion on MP3, the digital music
format that allows anyone to download songs from any musicians who
choose to put their work up on the Internet, Chuck D talked about
the new freedom for artists.
</P>
<P>
   He's given up the security of working with a record label in
order to be ``an owner rather than an employee.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the rap star, MP3 is an example of the future of
entertainment and it wasn't a deliberate convergence development.
``It's technology that the public got to before the industry. S_,
it's revolution, and I'm down to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lise Buyer, director of Credit Suisse First Boston's Technology
Group in Palo Alto, agreed. ``People started talking about
Silliwood four or five years ago, and it didn't happen. No one has
the answers in terms of what will `converge' in the future. Chuck D
is the one who is going to change the way things work.''
</P>
<P>
   THE FUTURE OF THE PHONE: In other news on summer conferences
attempting to divine the future, Phone.com just held a conference
for 1,000 people interested in getting in on the stampede into
wireless communications. The halls of the San Jose Fairmont were
filled with cell phones glued to the ears of polo and khaki-clad
believers in the future of ``communications convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Former FCC Chairman Reed Hundt delivered a lively speech _
lively speech being defined in this industry as one containing a
few decent jokes and not getting to the PowerPoint slides until at
least 15 minutes into the talk. Hundt pushed companies to get into
the game as quickly as possible. ``Being in the market and
reconfiguring your offer regularly is critical. Don't try to be
right the first time.'' Essentially, jump in and figure it out as
you go.
</P>
<P>
   Later in a private conversation, Hundt reiterated the idea that
wireless companies need to move fast, and he lamented the fact that
broadcasters are holding the ``sweet spot'' in the spectrum,
frequencies that easily can penetrate buildings.
</P>
<P>
   When television goes digital during the next several years, each
station essentially will own four digital channels and will be free
to send video, data or a combination of both through those new
pipelines. Will broadcasters actually send anything through the new
pipes?
</P>
<P>
   Hundt predicts that broadcasters won't be nimble enough to take
advantage of the new business opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   BORG'S BIG STEP FOR WOMEN: Finally, an update from Anita Borg,
president of the Institute for Women and Technology. She's just
back from Washington, D.C., and an attempt to better link
government and the world of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton recently appointed Borg to the _ take a deep
breath _ Commission on the Advancement of Women, Minorities and
Disabled in Science, Engineering and Technology. The commission has
one year to come up with a list of recommendations. Its next
meeting is October 6 in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Borg, based out of Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center, continues her own group's crusade to link technical and
nontechnical women. A big priority: training women who are running
for political office in the year 2000 on the workings of the
technology industry. Said Borg: ``How can women make good decisions
if they don't understand the issues?''

   Startup Launching PC Service 
 &HT;    BY HENRY NORR 
 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A startup company with high-powered backing today will announce
a new service that promises small businesses relief from the
headache of maintaining computers and network connections.
</P>
<P>
   CenterBeam Inc. will provide companies that have 10 to 100
employees state-of-the-art personal computers and software,
high-speed Internet access, nightly backups and always-available
technical support, all for a fixed monthly fee, normally $165 per
user, per month.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be launched this fall in the Bay Area,
Sacramento and San Diego, then rolled out nationally next spring.
</P>
<P>
   CenterBeam's service in some ways resembles the increasingly
common ``free PC'' plan, which offer home users PCs in exchange for
committing to a long-term contract with an Internet service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses who sign up with the company will get new name-brand
computers powered by 400-megahertz Intel Celeron chips, plus
17-inch monitors. Notebook computers and other options will be
available at higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheldon Laube, the well-known industry exec who founded
CenterBeam and will serve as its CEO, said the hardware is only a
small part of the picture. ``Freeing people of the cost of the
computers doesn't matter much because they're now so cheap
anyway,'' he said. ``It's getting free of the hassle of keeping
things running that you really care about, and making all the costs
predictable.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts seemed to agree. ``The market has been waiting for
something like this,'' said Rob Enderle, vice president of the Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Boggs, vice president of International Data Corp., said
CenterPoint's program ``will be really appealing for a business
with 50 or 100 employees, especially if you've done your homework
and seen how much it costs to keep all the stuff running.''
</P>
<P>
   CenterBeam-provided systems will come with Windows 2000, the new
business-oriented operating system Microsoft plans to release this
fall, plus the ``Small Business Edition'' of Microsoft Office 2000.
Tech support will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week
under CenterBeam's standard $165-per-month service plan, though the
company also plans to offer weekday-only support as a lower-cost
option.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes Internet access via digital subscriber
line, a high-speed technology that runs over standard phone wiring.
Users will be guaranteed a minimum bandwidth of 384 kilobits per
second, roughly seven times the speed of the fastest conventional
modem.
</P>
<P>
   At the customer site, computers will be connected in a wireless
local area network; no data cables around the office will be
required. The wireless LAN, based on new technology developed by
Lucent Technologies, will move data at about the same speed as the
Ethernet cabling used in most offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Lucent technology is the same one that Apple Computer will
use to offer wireless networking for its recently announced iBook
laptops for students and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Enderle said it's the cutting-edge networking technology
CenterPoint is using that makes its business model possible. ``With
the wireless network and Windows 2000, they don't have to send a
person out to the site at all,'' he said. ``There's almost nothing
to configure except the Lucent hub-router, and they'll set that up
before they ship it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the local network is set up and connected to the Internet,
CenterBeam will use it to provide support, upgrades and backup
``over the wire.'' The ``definition files'' that keep the
preinstalled virus-protection software up to date will be upgraded
every day or even more frequently if necessary, according to Laube.
</P>
<P>
   In case of a hardware failure, the company will send a
replacement machine by overnight delivery, then restore its
software from the nightly backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a local support person wouldn't provide that level of
support,'' Laube said. ``Even the corporate giants don't back up
every machine every night.
</P>
<P>
   Because CenterBeam also will function as its customers' Internet
service provider, it will be able to provide
``industrial-strength'' firewall protection, ensuring a level of
security that small business rarely enjoy, Laube said.
</P>
<P>
   To launch the new company, which is based in Santa Clara, Laube
is leaving his job as executive vice president and chief technology
officer of USWeb/CKS. Previously, he worked as CTO of Novell and
before that, for 10 years, as world head of technology for Price
Waterhouse.cq &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Several other senior execs on CenterBeam's 35-person staff
also have experience at Novell and USWeb.
</P>
<P>
   CenterBeam will announce today that it has raised $20 million in
its first round of financing. Microsoft and USWeb are among the
companies backing the startup, along with three leading venture
funds: CrossPoint Venture Partners, Accel Partners and New
Enterprise Associates.
</P>
<P>
   IDC analyst Boggs said the biggest challenge CenterBeam will
face is logistics _ specifically, coordinating the DSL hook-up and
delivery of equipment to customer sites. ``But they seem to have
the financial resources and management talent to handle the
challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giga Information's Enderle predicted that others soon would jump
into the market that CenterBeam is pioneering. ``I think they've
got an awful lot of upside,'' he said, ``but they won't go
unchallenged.''
</P>
<P>
   CenterBeam will offer its service to selected customers under an
``early access'' program that will begin later this month. Further
information will be available today at the company's Web site, &LR; 
www.centerbeam.com,  &LR; officials said.

SPORTS COLUMN: DEREK AND A-ROD SET A GOOD EXAMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Yankees play in Seattle, Derek Jeter usually
stays with Alex Rodriguez. And when the Mariners play in New York,
Rodriguez usually stays with Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   Most stars tend to choose friends who defer to them, but the two
shortstops have every intention of staying close as their
nine-digit contracts materialize. They have observed other
superstars who do not enjoy their fame, but they plan to keep their
good attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   They are competitors, but in the best sense of the word. If
Jeter needed to barrel into his buddy to break up a double play,
there is not the slightest doubt he would do it. If Rodriguez had
to slap a quick tag on Jeter, he would surely do it.
</P>
<P>
   The two amigos do not lack their combative side, but they draw
the line at blindly joining one of those dumb-and-dumber baseball
brawls, like the one that broke out in Seattle on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis, the spare Yankee outfielder, is torqued off with
Jeter for waltzing with A-Rod while Frankie Rodriguez of the
Mariners and Joe Girardi of the Yanks were grappling near home
plate and Don Zimmer took a tumble while heading toward the fray.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, A-Rod and Derek have passed the cheesiness
detector, but Curtis has flunked. Admittedly, cheesiness is in the
eye of the beholder. Tom Seaver was criticizing Bobby Valentine of
the Mets Sunday on television for using Matt Franco, a position
player, to pitch the ninth inning while using Chuck McElroy, a
reliever, in left field in the 14-3 drubbing by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of baseball ploy that seems to get Valentine in
trouble, while other managers can apparently use a spare player to
save their pitching staffs and not get hammered for it. Sounds like
a double standard to me. Valentine has a rap list of eccentricities
this year, but his move on Sunday passed my personal cheesiness
detector.
</P>
<P>
   The little tiff on the Yankees has more bite to it. Curtis is
not saying that the two friends should have been punching each
other out, but Curtis did not like the smile on Jeter's face as
Derek and A-Rod paired off at the periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jeter was not smiling when Curtis criticized him both
on the field and in the clubhouse, in plain view of reporters. One
gets the feeling that if Curtis wants to see the fighting side of
Derek Jeter, he has a very good shot at it himself.
</P>
<P>
   The crankiness by Curtis has a history. Last year A-Rod whipped
a relay inches past the face of a Yankee runner who, Rodriguez
felt, should not have been sliding that close to him. The two of
them traded chippy sentiments, which brought both teams clumping
onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   That testy Yankee player last year was _ oh, but you guessed it
_ Chad Curtis. Curtis may indeed resent the very public friendship
between his shortstop and the Mariners' shortstop. He may even
dislike them for reasons of his own. But I've got to break it to
him gently _ the age of superstars like spike-wielding Ty Cobb and
brushback-throwing Bob Gibson is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   There is silly talk of the Yankees being divided because Curtis
accused Jeter of not backing up Girardi. In reality, Girardi set a
good example for all of us with our nasty little tempers by
declining to throw a punch even after he had challenged Frankie
Rodriguez. Girardi, a devout Christian, said he had never hit
anybody in his life. I somehow don't think he is going to resent
Jeter and Alex Rodriguez for living out the same commendable
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   It is an insult to Jeter and Rodriguez to expect them to look
militant, and maybe even to strike a fighting pose. I have no doubt
both of them would protect teammates first if a serious brawl broke
out, but the last thing baseball needs is people looking for a
piece of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis had the right idea a year ago when these same two
teams had a little beanball episode a few innings after the Curtis
spat with A-Rod. Davis paired off with Junior Griffey, a good
friend of his, and the two traded comic-opera punches. This was a
far better idea than Davis temporarily throttling a Seattle coach
this past Friday night, an act that made Davis feel sheepish
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Most baseball fights are started by beanball mischief following
a home run. Just the other day, Davis was saying he did not think
pitchers should throw at a hitter just because somebody else had
whacked a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitters look bad sometimes, and we get used to it,'' Davis
said. ``If we hit a home run, the pitcher should take it like a
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Many players do not respect headhunters, even on their own team.
Jason Grimsley was ejected from Friday's game for hitting a Seattle
player, as well he should have been. In the wake of beanballs,
nothing is gained from fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, who is a regular at the Christian chapel services,
should thumb through his Bible to find the quotation in Matthew
5:9: ``Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons
of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez and Jeter were making peace their own way. They found
an opponent, a kindred soul, a close friend, and they got out of
the way, physically and psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Talented and poised, A-Rod and Jeter are the face of baseball in
the next century. If Chad Curtis has a problem with them, he
marginalizes nobody but himself. &QL;

U.S. agency that helped build the Net is pouring money into
countering biological attacks &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
No one was particularly alarmed at the unusual sight of a crop
duster trailing a long cloud of vapor against the city's skyline
just as the morning commute was getting under way.
<P>
   Even the next day, as patients began flooding hospitals and
clinics with complaints of aches and fevers, busy nurses and
doctors simply chalked it up to an unexpected outbreak of flu.
</P>
<P>
   It was only on the third day, after the first patients began to
die and autopsies revealed lungs turned to pulp and brains shrunk
with rot, that health officials realized they were dealing with a
deliberate attempt to infect the city with deadly anthrax bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   This fictional scenario, played out in a recent war game in
Washington, D.C., helped force California infection expert Paul
Duffey to contemplate the potential consequences of the sort of
biological terror attack that federal officials believe eventually
may wreak havoc in some real city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the exercise was to help us focus on the sort of
technological tools we would need to detect the biological agent as
quickly as possible and start figuring out possible treatments,''
said Duffey, a scientist with the California Department of Health
Services Microbial Disease Laboratory in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The war game was sponsored by the Potomac Institute for Policy
Studies, a Virginia think tank that works with the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency, commonly known as DARPA.
</P>
<P>
   Best known for its early support of the technology that grew
into the Internet, DARPA has made the search for countermeasures
against biological attacks an increasingly important aspect of its
overall research funding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, DARPA spent $58.5 million, or 3 percent of its $2
billion research budget, to support bio-defense projects. In fiscal
year 2000, even though its overall budget remains stuck at $2
billion, the portion going to bio-defenses will rise to $146
million, or 7.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in
April, DARPA director Frank Fernandez explained why his agency,
which dabbles in every form of research from satellite technology
to body armor, has focused on measures to counter biological
warfare or terror attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous mismatch between the magnitude of the
threat and our defensive capabilities,'' Fernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   As is typical, DARPA has spread its spending among literally
dozens of projects in four broad areas aimed at detecting,
decontaminating, curing and managing bio-attacks. (See
www.darpa.mil/DSO/rd/Abmt /Bwd.html for a list). Some of its
projects are so cutting edge, they sound downright kooky _ like its
multimillion-dollar grant to help one Bay Area biotech firm develop
an improved form of the detergent Tide to decontaminate areas
sprayed with anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   DARPA's imaginative war-gaming and countermeasures research win
grudging admiration even among groups, like the Federation of
American Scientists, that often are critical of Defense Department
technology policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm impressed with the quality and the cleverness of the
projects they've funded,'' said Lynn Klotz, a consultant to the FAS
committee working on bio-war threats. ``Much of their research
would be just as useful for response to natural epidemics as it
would be for attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   DARPA's support for Redwood City's Maxygen Inc. is indicative of
how its grants, though targeted toward bio-defenses, support work
with civilian spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Aiding Redwood City Firm
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen is an early stage startup co-founded by Dutch scientist
Pim Stemmer and Bay Area biotech entrepreneur Alejandro Zaffaroni,
whose previous startups include Syntex Corp. and Alza Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Stemmer explained the technology Maxygen has developed to
restructure enzymes, proteins and other biological agents to make
them more potent. Maxygen takes two different proteins and, using
the sophisticated tools of molecular biology, grafts portions of
one protein into the other. He used the analogy of taking the drive
train out of a Porsche and bolting it into a Volkswagen to improve
its performance.
</P>
<P>
   This technique is radically different than current drug design,
in which biotech firms build new molecules from scratch, the
analogy being, designing a car from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if you have all these cars available to mix and match
parts, which allows us to make and test many combinations in
hours,'' Stemmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when Maxygen was being founded, Stemmer and
Zaffaroni met Shaun Jones, a DARPA program manager who was making
the rounds of biotech firms, looking for new ideas. Jones cuts
quite a swatch in biotech circles, where young companies know he
has a license to bankroll wild schemes.
</P>
<P>
   A medical doctor, Navy commander and member of the elite SEAL
commando unit, the Man from DARPA seems a bit like a cross between
a venture capitalist and James Bond.
</P>
<P>
   Out of that 1997 meeting with Jones, Maxygen walked away with a
DARPA contract _ currently worth about $2 million a year. Maxygen
will use its mixing and matching technique to restructure the
enzyme subtilisin (``It's the enzyme in Tide that breaks down grass
stains,'' Stemmer said) to make it powerful enough to kill anthrax
bacteria sprayed over people, vehicles or property.
</P>
<P>
   Stemmer said Maxygen is about to publish a paper in the journal
Nature Biotechnology that will show a vast improvement in
subtilisin's potency though the gene-shuffling technology.
</P>
<P>
   Maxygen is just one of several Bay Area firms doing projects for
DARPA. Others include Cepheid, a private firm in Sunnyvale that is
developing a briefcase-size kit that could be used to detect
pathogens _ the scientific name for deadly bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Sniffing Out Pathogens
</P>
<P>
   Genelabs Technologies Inc. of Redwood City has a three-year
DARPA grant worth up to $13.6 million to create stronger
therapeutic drugs to treat potential bio-toxins like the Ebola
virus.
</P>
<P>
   FAS scientists, while concerned about bio-terrorism and
generally supportive of DARPA's efforts, caution that technology
alone is not going to banish the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Star Wars shield here that we can devise,'' said
Mark Wheelis, a professor of microbiology at the University of
California at Davis. He's also a member of the FAS committee trying
to get an international agreement to permit random inspections of
biotech and drug plants worldwide, to try and catch those making
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The FAS thinks that random inspections would put some teeth into
the 1975 Biological Weapons Convention, under which 140 countries
worldwide agreed not to develop or use biological weapons _ without
specifying any means to monitor compliance.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug and biotech industries, while more than happy to do
contract work for DARPA and other agencies on countermeasures for
bioterrorism, have opposed such measures.
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Woollett, with the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, said legitimate drug and biotech firms
would resent having international inspectors drop in, without
cause, because it might suggest that they were guilty of making
toxins instead of medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Don't Want Snooping
</P>
<P>
   ``The raw materials are the same for good uses and bad uses,''
Woollett said, insisting that respectable firms would be tarred by
suspicion if they permitted random inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their position on such policy arguments, the experts
who think about biotechnology and bioterrorism realize that they
are flip sides of the same coin. ``In high schools all over
America, people are doing gene-splicing experiments,'' said
Siegrist, who organized the recent war game. ``Things people used
to get Nobel Prizes for, you can get in a kit.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the Man from DARPA, made a similar observation in an
e-mailed response to a question. ``Bioengineering technology is
becoming more widespread and accessible to experts,'' he wrote,
adding that even small terrorist attacks against civilian targets
could ``immobilize the nation with panic unless reasonable defenses
are available.''
</P>
<P>
   In view of the fact that much of the work being done for DARPA
easily could turn out to have commercial uses, most observers think
that its program, even if not the full answer to bio-terrorism, is
money well spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, DARPA funded the technology that became the Internet
because it was searching for an uninterruptible communications
system in the event of nuclear war,'' said Siegrist. ``Fortunately,
it was never used for that.''

   Crop-Stomping Protesters Killed Scientific Progress 
 &HT;    By TOM ABATE 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The controversy over genetically engineered crops took a
decidedly dumb turn in Berkeley recently when several unknown
zealots stomped a small experimental corn field grown by UC
Berkeley researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The man who called the Daily Californian student newspaper to
take credit for the stunt said he and his fellow clods were
``against genetic engineering'' because crops that are so altered
can harm the environment by killing beneficial insects.
</P>
<P>
   That could indeed be true, but none of corn being grown at the
University of California at Berkeley's experimental field at 1050
San Pablo Ave. was modified with the sort of pest-killing genes
that have caused public protest. Sarah Hake, the UC Berkeley plant
biologist whose corn got stomped, said 95 percent of the thousand
or so corn plants were natural hybrids, cultivated the
old-fashioned way, by cross-pollinating.
</P>
<P>
   The other 5 percent of the corn indeed was grown from seeds that
had been genetically altered, Hake said. The alterations were made
to help researchers learn which genes are responsible for corn's
nutritional traits _ can we tweak its structure to make it sweeter,
or add protein, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may feel as a matter of principle that science
shouldn't go there, that the only permissible way to improve crops
is to cross-breed them. There's a decent argument to be made there.
Perhaps the same argument could be made against in vitro
fertilization, another scientific intervention that goes beyond
nature's processes.
</P>
<P>
   But such arguments can never be made by stomping around corn
fields in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters also killed corn that arguably served a public
good. Hake said all the experimental corn is funded by the National
Science Foundation. The information gleaned from the experiments
will be put into a public database. Scientists like Hake are
rushing to get the genetic maps for important crops into the public
domain before private firms can patent the information.
</P>
<P>
   So the protest set the public scientists back a growing season
and put the private scientists ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel if only people would talk to us, we'd be happy to have
a dialogue about our work,'' Hake said.
</P>
<P>
   An apology from those responsible would be a good start. Hake's
e-mail address is maizesh(AT-SYMBOL)nature.berkeley.edu.
</P>
<P>
   GENENTECH POSTSCRIPT: In recent weeks, I've followed Genentech's
efforts to allow small shareholders to get a piece of its recent
public offering. The offering occurred after Genentech was
purchased by Roche Holdings, and the Swiss firm turned around and
reissued about 17 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
   My coverage chronicled the complaints of small shareholders who
felt that Genentech didn't make a serious effort to let them in on
the offering. Genentech CFO Lou Lavigne phoned me last week to
insist that the company had done the best it could, and offered
this data to explain how the offering went down.
</P>
<P>
   Roche sold 22 million shares of Genentech. Of these, about 4.3
million shares were earmarked for noninstitutional investors. Most
of these noninstitutional shares, 3.9 million in toto, were sold by
the retail arms or allies of the investment bankers who took
Genentech public.
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 shares went to Charles Schwab, the brokerage firm
which was designated to handle sales to former Genentech
shareholders and employees. Lavigne said 1,150 employees and 500
former shareholders got in on the offering.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I covered this issue is because many shareholders had
complained to me that they didn't have enough time to get in on the
special offer or that they didn't hear about it in time. I don't
want to rehash those complaints. I've sent many of them on to
Lavigne, who promised to look into the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But his point to me was that the company had made an honest
effort to let at least some former shareholders take part in a
public offering that was way more popular than the company had
expected. ``Clearly, if there's anything we regret about this, it's
that we couldn't handle all the demand, given how popular the
program was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, as I was writing this item, I read about a software
firm, Red Hat Inc., that is trying to let volunteer programmers who
contributed to its software get in on its upcoming offering _ only
to draw all sorts of complaints from people who got bogged down
following the procedures. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   The morale is that as companies try to let small investors in on
IPOs, they're bound to screw up because they're plowing new ground.
IPOs used to ignore small investors. So even when we criticize the
shortcomings in the programs, we should keep in mind that these
companies are at least trying to open up what has always been a
closed process.

   A Nasty Little War Unfolds in Silicon Valley 
 &HT;    BY TOM STEIN 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Larry Ellison, chief executive of Oracle Corp., acquires enemies
almost as easily as he does wealth. For much of this decade, his
primary target was Microsoft's Bill Gates. Ellison eagerly and
frequently attacked Gates for his monopolistic business practices
and lack of Internet vision.
<P>
   But now, his vitriol is aimed at someone new: Tom Siebel, a
former Ellison disciple who split from his old boss and became one
of Silicon Valley's most forceful entrepreneurs, in the process
competing directly with Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months, Ellison has taken a series of shots at
Siebel, publicly criticizing his business acumen and the future of
his company, Siebel Systems of San Mateo. Siebel has fired back,
claiming that Oracle is spreading malicious lies and is pawning off
inferior technology on an unsuspecting customer base. Lawyers for
both companies have exchanged a blizzard of memos demanding
civility and threatening each other with legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel Systems is the leading provider of customer-relationship
management software _ a market that Oracle is eager to get into.
CRM is the stuff the companies use to manage their sales leads,
marketing campaigns, service calls and help desks. The CRM market
is expected to grow from $2.9 billion in revenue this year to $16.8
billion by 2003, according to AMR Research in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   These are attractive numbers to Oracle, which is reeling from
less-than-spectacular growth in its two core markets: databases and
business applications, such as manufacturing and financial
software. Hoping to boost sales, Oracle now is rolling out products
and services for the CRM market.
</P>
<P>
   But Oracle's interest in CRM has placed erstwhile colleagues
Ellison and Siebel at the heart of what is fast becoming Silicon
Valley's nastiest little war.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel, a computer scientist by training, joined Oracle of
Redwood Shores in the &LR;   &LR; 1980s as one of its first hundred
employees. He quickly rose through the ranks and became the
company's top salesperson. In 1988, he took charge of Oracle's
telesales and direct marketing operations. To do the job
effectively, Siebel says he built an internal sales force
automation system at Oracle called Oasis.
</P>
<P>
   Next, he approached Ellison about turning Oasis into a
commercial software system that could be licensed to other
companies. ``Information technology was revolutionizing the way
companies made products and did general office work, but the sales,
marketing and customer service functions were going largely
untouched,'' said Siebel in an interview last week. ``But Ellison
had no interest in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   A determined and somewhat resentful Siebel left Oracle in 1990
and founded Siebel Systems a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bickering Begins &LR;
</P>
<P>
   That's where the controversy begins. Oracle officials charge
that Siebel walked away with proprietary technology _ namely, the
Oasis system _ that he used to create his firm's first application.
Siebel, for his part, says these allegations are ``patently
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some initial hard feelings, Siebel and Oracle actually
became business partners. After all, Oracle had the leading
database and it was in Siebel's best interest to make sure its
software ran on the Oracle platform.
</P>
<P>
   That, apparently, is no longer the case. ``Now that Siebel has
achieved some market success and Oracle has elected to pursue the
same market, Oracle is on record that it will no longer work with
us in any capacity, regardless of the needs of our common
customers,'' wrote Siebel Vice President Bruce Cleveland in a
private letter to Oracle President Ray Lane in June.
</P>
<P>
   The missive was in response to a leaked internal e-mail sent by
Lane to Oracle employees. ``I would like to put (Siebel) on the
`most wanted' list and make sure we use all resources to compete,
not partner,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers believe Siebel and Ellison were personally behind
that fiery exchange. They say the two CEOs are cut from the same
cloth _ rather than shying away from confrontation, they prefer to
embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Entertaining to Watch &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry and Tom are both table pounding, Darth Vadery,
take-over-the-world type of guys who are totally committed to
winning,'' said Christopher Lochhead, chief marketing officer at
Internet consulting firm Scient Corp. in San Francisco. ``If
nothing else, this makes for great Silicon Valley drama. It's
really fun to watch them go at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Siebel says it will continue to support the Oracle
database, the companies have clearly entered into full-scale war.
Siebel recently optimized its software for two competing databases
_ IBM's DB2 and Microsoft's SQL Server _ in an attempt to get
customers to move away from Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel, with revenue last quarter of $164.4 million, is the
market leader in CRM. Oracle claims to be No.2 in the market with
$90 million in sales last quarter, though many analysts debate the
accuracy of Oracle's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, second place is not a position that sits well with
Ellison. ``Oracle is hungry for that No.1 spot and will do anything
to get it,'' said Josh Greenbaum, a principal analyst with
Enterprise Applications Consulting in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ellison's chief plan of attack has been a barrage of
insults and innuendo in speeches, press conferences and print ads _
all designed to undermine Siebel's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison's favorite refrain is that Siebel's software is not
ready for the Internet and is missing key components. In fact,
Oracle recently took out a series of ads in leading business
publications claiming that, unlike Siebel's, its CRM software is
``100% Pure Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Siebel is primarily a client-server vendor,'' said Ellison,
referring to an outmoded technology architecture that is quickly
being rendered obsolete by the Internet. ``We are the only real CRM
vendor in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lawyers Get Involved &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Siebel has not taken these attacks lightly. Lawyers for the
company have demanded that Oracle cease making ``false and
misleading statements regarding Siebel'' and stop engaging in
``unfair marketing tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Siebel himself is not above getting his hands dirty in the fray.
``It has become apparent to Larry that unless he stops us quickly,
we will be unstoppable,'' he boasted. ``Oracle says they're No.2 in
the market, but no one can find any of their products or customers.
They are just trying to bamboozle people. We do have real
competitors, such as Clarify, Vantive and Baan, but, frankly, we
don't see Oracle in competitive situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Oracle lawyers claim statements like these are libelous and that
Siebel is the one engaging in unfair business tactics. ``Siebel
actively targeted Oracle's CRM sales force for employment and
offered bounties to any employee who hired an Oracle sales
representative,'' they charged in a letter to Siebel.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to put the whole debacle in perspective, the
ever-colorful Ellison said in an interview, ``This is kind of dumb
on (Siebel's) part. But then again, Finland once got into a war
with Russia. We have more lawyers than they have programmers.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the two high-powered combatants have managed to
attract some attention to their market and possibly pique the
interest of potential customers. But by focusing so much on each
other, they may end up neglecting new prospects _ as well as other
competitors, observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tom and Larry show is real entertaining,'' said Tony
Zingale, chief executive of Clarify, a competing CRM firm in San
Jose. ``I'm in the front row with my popcorn and Diet Coke. I hope
they rip each other's heads off. But in the meantime, I'm focused
on my primary objective: winning market share and dazzling my
customers.''

EXCITEATHOME PICKS LOOKSMART 
 
BY DEBORAH SOLOMON
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome, the Redwood City high-speed Internet service and
content provider, plans to announce today that it has named
LookSmart as a main provider of directory content for Excite's Web
portal site.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome will license LookSmart's directory of more than
60,000 subject categories and integrate it into Excite's search
engine, located at www.excite.com. LookSmart of San Francisco
provides a directory of Web content, or an organized selection of
Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   A directory is part of a search engine and is content that has
been selected and placed into a category, such as News or Business.
A search engine is a tool to allow someone to go into the depths of
a Web page and find relevant keywords.
</P>
<P>
   LookSmart's listings are cobbled together by a team of more than
200 editors who review every site and weed out hate or pornographic
sites. The LookSmart directory is listed by categories _ such as
Food and Wine, News and Shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1996 by a husband and wife team, is
expected to go public in a week.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest search engine announcement for
ExciteAtHome, which said last week that it would expand its Web
hunting to include up to 300 million Web pages _ more than
one-third of the Internet's public sites. Right now, ExciteAtHome's
search engine accesses about 6 percent of online content.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies have been trying to beef up their search
engines in the wake of a study published in the journal ``Nature,''
which stated that search engines only cover a tiny fraction of Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``LookSmart's Web directory is comprehensive and of the highest
quality, so it was an easy decision to expand our relationship with
them,'' said Craig Donato, vice president of search programming for
ExciteAtHome. ``Excite is working hard to provide more
comprehensive coverage of the Web as well as make it easier for
users to find what they are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies like ExciteAtHome want to build all-inclusive Web
sites where customers can get everything from weather reports to
home loans. Search functions are an integral part of that, as
people look for ways to weed through the clutter on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search engines and directories are a core part of business for
companies like ExciteAtHome,'' said John Corcoran, who tracks the
company for Stephens Inc. in Richmond, Va. ``That's what drives
people to a site.''
</P>
<P>
   Corcoran said companies like ExciteAtHome want to partner with
as many content providers as possible to drive people to their
sites. That's because the more ``eyeballs'' a site attracts, the
more advertising it gets and the more revenue it generates.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a few years, we will have a couple of real premier
companies in this segment,'' Corcoran said. ``ExciteAtHome has done
a good job of changing itself. It's extending its offerings and
beefing up what it does. This is the exact same strategy that
America Online used a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   LookSmart already is the exclusive Web-directory provider for
the AtHome part of ExciteAtHome. AtHome provides super-fast
Internet connections and Internet service via cable TV lines. The
company bought Excite, a content provider, earlier this year for
more than $6 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Under this agreement, LookSmart will provide its directory
content to both the AtHome broadband portal and Excite's narrowband
portal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled to expand our previous relationship with AtHome
to include Excite.com,'' said Evan Thornley, co-founder and CEO of
LookSmart. ``They're a leading-edge media company with
sophisticated users who want the best online experience possible.
We'll help give them that.''

CHARGES DROPPED AGAINST WRITER BROTHERS ACCUSED OF CHEATING AT
BLACKJACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By BRETT PULLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick and Steven Barthelme, the two Mississippi writers who
have shared an obsession for blackjack tables in the gambling
palaces that straddle their state's Gulf Coast, now have a happy
ending in the latest chapter of their personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   A Mississippi State Circuit Court judge last week dismissed
charges against the two brothers, who had been accused of
conspiring with a casino dealer to cheat at blackjack. The charges
against the brothers, who hail from a family of writers and are
professors of writing at the University of Southern Mississippi in
Hattiesburg, were compelling in part because they came only weeks
after the publication in 1997 of ``Bob the Gambler,'' a
well-received novel by Frederick Barthelme, who has written 11
books and whose prose has been compared to that of Ernest
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted that the case is done with,'' Frederick
Barthelme, 55, said Sunday in a telephone interview from his
Hattiesburg home. ``If they had carefully studied their evidence in
a timely way, then they would have never brought the indictment.''
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Steven, 52, said that the case had been hurtful.
``We've spent two years of being threatened with prosecution and
jail,'' he said, also in a telephone interview from his home in
Hattiesburg.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bob the Gambler,'' Frederick Barthelme told the story of
Ray Kaiser, a middle-class Gulf Coast denizen who turned out to be
very much like the author: a seemingly content, normal guy whose
life is transformed as he is lured into nights of irrational
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   As the gambling business grew in their backyards over the last
several years, so too did the Barthelme brothers' obsession with
betting at the casinos. In an article that they co-wrote earlier
this year in The New Yorker magazine, the brothers revealed that
over a two-year period they had lost more than a quarter of a
million dollars at the casinos. Much of it was money they
inherited.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we were winging along,'' they wrote, ``losing big, waiting
for the life-destroying catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophe came when casino surveillance cameras observed
the brothers receiving what investigators believed were signals
from a blackjack dealer, Cynthia B. Wojciechowski, in the Grand
Casino in Gulfport, Miss. The three were indicted on two felony
counts for attempting to fix the game and they faced a maximum of
two years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the charges against the Barthelmes were dismissed
after a Las Vegas gambling expert hired by the state had examined
the surveillance tapes and said he found no proof the Barthelmes
had cheated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expert concluded that the Barthelmes were not involved in
any kind of a scheme,'' said Tim Holleman, a lawyer representing
the brothers. The dealer's alleged signals, which involved
so-called ``insurance'' bets based on the dealer's hidden card,
were just subtle movements that she made when she was bored or
tired of the repetitiveness of her job, Holleman said. ``The tapes
show that she was doing the same sorts of things with all kinds of
people,'' he noted. ``It proved conclusively to us that there was
no crime. It was just sloppy dealing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holleman said the dealer still faces charges.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Bob the Gambler,'' which was published by Houghton Mifflin,
there were no references to a cheating scheme like the one of which
the Barthelmes were accused. However, many of the main character's
experiences mirrored the author's experiences. Like Kaiser, the
Barthelme brothers would ``go gamble for days at a time, playing 12
to 16 hours a day,'' Barthelme said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their troubles, the Barthelmes are still customers _
albeit far less frequent ones _ of the Gulf Coast casinos.
Frederick Barthelme acknowledged that he and his brother could be
classified as problem or compulsive gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't lose as much as we did without realizing that you
have a problem,'' said Barthelme, who noted that he and his brother
had visited the casinos only a few times this year.
</P>
<P>
   For all their losses and their legal troubles, the brothers
still stand to benefit from their saga. They have co-written a book
about their experiences, called ``Double Down,'' which is expected
to be released by Houghton Mifflin this year.

FLEISHER TRIUMPHS OVER HIS OWN MENTAL LAPSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, N.Y. _ Bruce Fleisher slumped in the chair, slipped the
shoes off his aching feet and, although the trophy was right there
next to him, hardly had the look of the victor.
</P>
<P>
   If you added up the mistakes he had made, which he had to
recount painfully, it would be hard to explain just how he had won.
But his play between the ropes at the Meadow Brook Club this
weekend made up for his mental hooks and slices, providing him with
a two-stroke victory at the Lightpath Long Island Classic on the
Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher, who had led through all three days of the tournament
after tying the course record with a 64 on Friday and was never
really challenged Sunday, had to overcome only his own failings. On
Saturday, he nearly missed his tee time after reading the sheet
incorrectly, making it onto the course with just eight minutes to
spare and not a single practice stroke. Sunday, he was on time for
the start, but nearly blew it all at the finish.
</P>
<P>
   With a four-stroke lead seemingly secured when he sank his final
putt, he was in the scorer's tent tallying his card when a
spectator shouted to him that he had violated the rules. Fleisher's
marker had been in the path of an impending putt by Mark Hayes on
No. 18, and Hayes requested that he move it. Fleisher placed the
marker a club-head length to the side and when his turn came, he
was supposed to have placed the marker in its original position,
then put his ball down and putt. Instead, he putted from the spot
to which he had moved the marker.
</P>
<P>
   With the warning from the spectator, Fleisher was able to confer
with officials and take a two-stroke penalty, rather than sign the
card for an incorrect lower score, which would have disqualified
him and made Allen Doyle, who shot a 67 to finish in second place
at 208, the champion.
</P>
<P>
   With the penalty, Fleisher scored a 73 Sunday, giving him a
10-under-par 206 for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the scorer's tent,'' said Fleisher, who passed Hale
Irwin to move into first place on the Senior Tour money list
($1,668,400). ``Someone yelled in, `Bruce, you didn't put your mark
back.' It was some guy named Ralph, a spectator. I should give him
a hundred bucks, huh? Thank God I had a four-shot lead, that's all
I've got to tell you. Those are two boo-boos that you just can't
afford. I hope I learn from them. It's not like you have a whole
lot to think about here. It's not rocket science. I will learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the mixup, Fleisher was playing the part of the
conquering, but humble, hero. As he walked to the 18th green, the
applause swelled and he acknowledged the fans with a slight tip of
the cap. Then, after sinking his putt to end the tournament, he
pumped his fist slightly, celebrating his fifth victory of this,
his rookie season on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The final putt seemed anticlimactic, with no player ever getting
closer than two strokes Sunday. Hayes, who had been in second place
since the first day, was two strokes behind as they stepped to the
ninth tee. But Hayes, a Monday qualifier who was hoping for a
victory to earn his tour exemption, self-destructed.
</P>
<P>
   While Fleisher birdied the hole to move to 12 under, Hayes
double-bogeyed, slipping to seven under. By the end of the day,
Hayes was at five-under-par 211 in 13th place. Tom Wargo, who had
moved to 10 under with a birdie on the 11th hole, then also fell
apart, bogeying the 12th hole, then double-bogeying No. 13, and
tumbling to four under by the time he limped off the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   The cushion that Fleisher carried throughout the tournament,
coupled with the inability of anyone to sustain a charge, left him
with enough room for error so that even his big mistake did not
cost him this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, in all rights, I shouldn't be here,'' he said. ``The
way I'm going to look at this one, this is going to be a big
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I messed up twice this week. I'm glad it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher just shook his head when asked to explain how he could
endure such a difficult weekend and still be standing at the trophy
stand to collect the $180,000 paycheck. ``I'm not a superstitious
person, but somebody is looking over me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He even had an idea who, commenting that two friends who had
died recently had always anticipated seeing him join the Senior
Tour. Fleisher felt as if they were with him Sunday. Of course, the
more tangible explanation he had came in searching the field for a
player to make a run at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if Hale is going to play next week,'' he said with a
smile. When told that Irwin would probably not play next week, he
added, ``I'm playing, I know that.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: DRAMATIC SPECIAL EFFECTS, COURTESY OF NATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ John Copley, who directed the new production of
Mozart's ``Idomeneo'' for the Santa Fe Opera that opened last
month, had a powerful ally for Thursday night's performance: Mother
Nature.
</P>
<P>
   During the second scene, when Arbace, the trusted confidant to
Idomeneo, the king of Crete, brings the news that a terrible storm
at sea has sunk the king's ship, real lightning flashed in the
black, rainy sky surrounding the Santa Fe Opera's renowned open-air
theater, and winds blew wet mists into the seating area underneath
the renovated roof.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the next scene, as Idomeneo staggered onto a deserted
shore, shaken but safe, the winds relented, and the storm calmed
down. This was the ultimate in special effects, and only those who
failed to bring extra sweaters and jackets could have minded.
</P>
<P>
   Even without nature's assistance Copley and his set designer,
John Conklin, did impressive work with Mozart's sublime opera
seria. The action was predominantly played upon a silver, circular
platform that was mirrored effectively by a round opening in the
back wall of the set. Through that hole we glimpse a series of
dramatic images: the expansive stormy sea, Neptune demanding his
due, an island's barren shore, the king's gilded throne room and
such.
</P>
<P>
   In his directing Copley pays homage to the stylized 18th-century
opera seria tradition. Yet there were some boldly modern effects,
as when the tormented Idomeneo flails about helplessly underneath
an enormous billowy crimson sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Montgomery conducted elegantly. The young tenor Gordon
Gietz as Idamante, Idomeneo's son, still seemed to be coping with
an allergic reaction he had experienced the previous night. But his
singing was mostly ardent and poignant.
</P>
<P>
   In her American debut, the English soprano Catrin Wyn-Davies was
a sympathetic Ilia, who loves Idamante. Though her somewhat cool
sound takes getting used to, she sang with nobility of phrasing and
subtle musicianship.
</P>
<P>
   As Elettra, who is consumed with jealousy over Idamante, the
soprano Janice Watson took vocal risks, tearing into the music even
when the result was harsh tone. But this was an arresting
performance. And it was endearing to watch the strapping young
American tenor John McVeigh in a gray wig earnestly trying to
portray the old man Arbace.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of the tenor Jerry Hadley in the title role was
worrisome. Hadley should be at the peak of an important career. His
singing on this occasion was insecure, overly pushed and often
ungainly. Maybe he was dealing with some unannounced indisposition.
Or perhaps the role is a bad match. You can only hope his voice in
not in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years the conductor and company founder John Crosby has
turned the Santa Fe Opera into a mecca for Richard Strauss' operas,
introducing American audiences to many lesser-known works. His
affection for Strauss was palpable in his pliant and nuanced
conducting of ``Ariadne auf Naxos'' on Friday night, a revival of a
handsome production from 1990 directed by Bruce Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Many productions of this work for American audiences follow the
practice of performing the prologue in English translation and the
opera in German, which makes dramatic sense. The prologue is, in
effect, the real story, happening before us.
</P>
<P>
   A composer has written a grandly serious opera about the
mythological Ariadne, which is to be performed for the guests of
the richest man in Vienna. A silly comedy is also to be presented
that evening. But to the horror of the composer, the host sends
word that the opera singers and the comedians are to perform their
works simultaneously so that the boring parts of the tragedy will
be more palatable and the whole presentation will not cut into a
planned fireworks display.
</P>
<P>
   All the backstage banter is fun to hear in English. Then, when
the composer's elevated tragedy is presented, the singers
customarily switch to the original German.
</P>
<P>
   In this production, however, the comic players kept singing in
English during the presentation of the composer's ``Ariadne,'' an
imaginative idea that aptly juxtaposed the high-minded opera
singers and the lowbrow entertainers. The nimble dancing and
amusing antics of the comedy troupe were choreographed by Daniel
Pelzig, whose directing in Emmerich Kalman's frothy operetta
``Countess Maritza'' earlier in the week had struck me as
exaggerated and silly.
</P>
<P>
   Vocally the cast was uneven. The soprano Christine Brewer as
Ariadne has a voice with the power and presence to slice through
Strauss' orchestra, though her softer high notes sometimes turned
breathy, and her singing at times was strident. As Bacchus,
Ariadne's savior, the tenor John Horton Murray made an admirable
attempt at a relatively short but punishing part. Murray had the
requisite heft and stamina, although his singing lacked lyricism,
and his sound was often bleaty.
</P>
<P>
   The excellent coloratura soprano Elizabeth Futral was a perky,
winsome Zerbinetta, although this brilliant vocalist did not seem
at her freest and most secure on this occasion. Among the other
comedians the baritone Nathan Gunn as Harlequin was especially
good: a robust singer and winning actor. Only some garbled English
diction prevented the mezzo-soprano Kristine Jepson's portrayal of
the composer from being a triumph. Her voice was vibrant and
impassioned.
</P>

<P>
   Opera is not all Santa Fe has to offer music lovers during the
summer. The Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival is in its 27th year.
Whereas the opera draws roughly half of its audiences from out of
state, the chamber music festival draws some 70 percent of its
patrons from the Santa Fe area. The performances are held in an
ideal space for chamber music: the 440-seat St. Francis Auditorium
in the Museum of Fine Arts, built in 1917 and modeled after a
Franciscan mission.
</P>
<P>
   The festival attracts some renowned performers, and the programs
devised by the artistic director Marc Neikrug represent an engaging
mix of old and new, known and unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The early evening program on Wednesday was typical: The British
composer Oliver Knussen conducted two bracing works of his own for
large chamber ensembles: ``Ophelia Dances, Book 1'' (1975) and
``Songs Without Words'' (1991-92). Between these, almost as a
welcomed diversion, was Rossini's Duet in D for Cello and Bass,
music at once ingenious and hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Following intermission the violinist William Preucil, the
violist Paul Neubauer, the cellist Eric Kim and the pianist Cecile
Licad gave an undulant and richly characterized performance of
Faure's Piano Quartet in C Minor.
</P>
<P>
   This season there are some 36 performances of 24 different
programs running through Aug. 23. Last summer more than 12,000
patrons attended festival concerts, an impressive turnout for
substantive chamber music series in a small city. The Santa Fe
Opera runs through Aug. 28.

JORDAN'S NEW KING ASSUMES FAKE IDENTITIES TO GLIMPSE REAL-LIFE
PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
repeating to fix category code  (rm)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ The young new king is wearing new _ well,
different _ clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday he posed as a taxi passenger, spending two hours
watching life unfold on Amman's often chaotic streets. Five days
earlier, his disguise was as a television reporter, complete with
fake white beard and Arab robes, as he and an aide, armed with a
video camera, went to inspect Jordan's free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   For his taxi ride, officials said, the 37-year-old King Abdullah
II wore the kind of beat-up clothes that an ordinary Jordanian
might don in these tough economic times.
</P>
<P>
   He avoided detection even when he and the supposed cabdriver, a
palace aide, stopped to ask a policeman for directions and later,
eager to test local law enforcement, made what a palace aide called
``a maneuver or two that was illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier outing, the disguise had to be doffed when trade
zone officials confronted the camera team to say they could not
work without a permit. In response, one palace official said, the
king reportedly pulled off his fake beard to reveal his real,
stubbly and black one.
</P>
<P>
   The details of each episode have been quickly leaked by palace
officials, prompting what from the public has been the kind of
gotcha glee evoked by an episode of ``Candid Camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians, ground down by day-to-day problems, including
the stagnant economy and a widening gap between rich and poor, have
long complained that no one is paying attention to the country's
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is showing that he is a real Arab,'' said Ahmed Batieh, 27,
a laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people here, Batieh said he saw in Abdullah's forays
an echo not just of the common touch shown by his father, King
Hussein, but of undercover missions undertaken among the poor by
Omar bin Khattab, an early successor to the Prophet Mohammed
remembered as one of the most distinguished, devout caliphs in
Islamic history.
</P>
<P>
   In other circles there has been much chortling over the possible
fate of the officious bureaucrats at a free trade zone who told the
``journalists'' that they had no right to keep questioning
investors who had been complaining about red tape.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the policemen, who were reported to have stopped the
errant taxi and to have scolded the ``passenger'' for not wearing a
seat belt, but to have been talked out of issuing a ticket, has
certainly not helped the reputation of a force seen by many people
here as less than competent.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the king seems to have served notice _ to the
public and to the businessmen, bureaucrats and other members of the
establishment who wield considerable power _ that he is willing to
break the mold to shake things up.
</P>
<P>
   The message seems to have been heard. A cartoon this past week
in the newspaper Al Rai showed a bureaucrat surrendering his desk
and singing a pro-monarchy anthem as a troop of visitors descends
on his office, each wearing the exact same disguise. But when asked
Sunday whether the exercises were over, a palace official said, ``I
think there will be more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Adbullah was little known to most Jordanians when he took power
after his father's death six months ago. Until two weeks before,
when his dying father abruptly named him crown prince, he had been
a soldier, with almost no political experience.
</P>
<P>
   But even before plunging incognito into the streets last month,
he plunged into a show of activist leadership, even undertaking
back-to-back personal inspections of a government hospital.
</P>
<P>
   That attention to domestic matters has contrasted sharply with
what critics came to see as Hussein's all-absorbing preoccupation
with foreign policy in the last years of his reign, and it seems to
have won Abdullah a number of converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no grounds for expecting anything from him,'' said
Radwan Abdullah, a political scientist. ``But I have been impressed
precisely because he has made it very clear from the start that he
was not following his father blindly, and that he was going to be
his own man.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, others worry that the missions may be a precedent for a
move in a wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to give the new king the benefit of the doubt and
encourage the new aspects of his character,'' said Labib Kamhawi, a
political scientist. ``But we do not want to see this developing
into the old and tired habit of running the country as a one-man
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is not the first in his family to resort to costuming
and derring-do. Among his Hashemite royal family, leadership has
often been marked by a blend of prankishness and cunning.
</P>
<P>
   His great-grandfather, King Abdullah I, met with a woman wearing
a wig and an Arab peasant dress _ beneath that disguise she was
Golda Meir _ in a meeting that kicked off years of secret dialogue
between Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In a reign that lasted 47 years, Hussein wore disguises in his
clandestine meetings with Israelis over the many years before the
two sides signed a peace in 1993. He was renowned for ditching his
bodyguards, and eight years ago he roared through the streets of
Amman on a motorcycle while the police were testing radar gear. It
took the unsuspecting policemen 90 minutes to catch up with him.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is sometimes said that in Jordan, being king also requires
being many things to many people, so even public attire requires
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Like that of his father, Abdullah's wardrobe ranges widely, from
Arab headdress to military uniform to business suit, with the
choice depending _ in this small, diverse and politically fragile
country _ on which constituency is closest at hand.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the economy goes, people in Jordan note that Abdullah
so far has also delivered mostly symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to the United States, Canada and Europe in May, he
made almost no progress toward agreements that might ease Jordan's
$7-billion debt, which is a major drag on the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only tangible economic change that Jordan's
government has adopted since he became king has been one that is
highly unpopular _ an increase of three percentage points, to 13
percent, in the national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   In the hope of creating some momentum, the king has now pressed
for an emergency session of parliament, in which one priority would
be legislation aimed at opening the country to investors. But some
Western diplomats and other experts here say they wonder whether
the king has a clear vision yet for Jordan's economic future.
</P>
<P>
   ``His vigor and his fresh approach to things is really winning
him a lot of emotional support,'' Kamhawi said. ``But at the end of
the day, this is more or less like watching a nice movie. When you
go out of the theater, you get hit with the hard facts.''

   He lost a three-shot lead on the final hole of the British Open,
but Jean Van de Velde, the French golfer who will always be
associated with that strange and soggy misadventure at Carnoustie,
has not yet lost his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a risky business,'' he said last Friday.
``Particularly if you stay in the grandstand while I'm coming down
the 18th.''
</P>
<P>
   For Van de Velde, humor is a reflex, a self-deprecating tic that
has proved an effective public defense against his tragicomic
experience in Scotland last month. And he wants the golf community
and the casual fan to know that while he lost considerable sleep
after the British Open, he is neither wallowing in self-pity nor
struggling to keep his sanity as he prepares to play in his first
major in the United States: this week's PGA Championship at Medinah
Country Club outside Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   He has played in European tour events in Dublin and Malmo,
Sweden, since the Open, making the cut on both occasions but
failing to finish in the top 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am aware that there is a feeling I will not be able to
recover from the way things ended in Carnoustie, but I don't
believe that,'' he said. ``To be honest, I am convinced that I can
get back in the same position again.''
</P>
<P>
   That position was an enviable one as he walked to the 18th tee
in Carnoustie. After scrambling and putting with aplomb for four
days on what was quite possibly the most demanding British Open
course in history, Van de Velde, a 33-year-old qualifier, needed
only a double-bogey to become the first Frenchman in 92 years to
take possession of the claret jug.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was as agonizing to watch as it was fascinating:
an errant drive onto the 17th fairway; a two-iron that ricocheted
off the stands and bounced back over a water-filled trench called
the Barry Burn into the deepest sort of rough, and then a wedge
shot that was airborne only long enough to land in the same trench.
</P>
<P>
   After removing his socks and shoes and descending into the
water, Van de Velde ultimately and sagely decided to take a penalty
drop and ended up with a triple-bogey seven: enough to salvage a
place in a playoff with Justin Leonard of the United States and the
eventual champion, Paul Lawrie of Scotland, but not quite enough to
salvage his dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Though he would prove witty and gracious in defeat, when he
walked off the 18th after the playoff he stumbled red-eyed into the
scorer's trailer, where he found a chair, buried his face in his
hands and cried as an Open official patted him gently on the back.
</P>
<P>
   That night he told reporters he would play a wedge instead of a
2-iron next time, but he no longer feels that way. ``Knowing
myself, I think I hit the 2-iron again; you just go with what you
feel comfortable with,'' said the man whose role model has long
been the swashbuckling Spaniard Seve Ballesteros.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only shot I would like to hit again would be the third
one,'' he said of the wedge that landed in the water. ``The lie was
so bad, and I thought about chipping it sideways instead of going
forward. But it was so bad that I thought there was no guarantee I
would make even the fairway chipping it sideways. But in any case,
I probably would have improved my lie and I could have gone for the
green in four, instead of dropping the ball in four.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde defended his caddy, Christophe Angelini _ who was
seriously considering taking a job distributing digital video disks
in his native Paris earlier this year _ from criticism that he
should have urged more caution on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had stood in front of me with a wedge in his hand, I
might have knocked him over,'' Van de Velde said. ``It was my
decision, and I take responsibility for it. And if somebody had
told me before the tournament that I would end up finishing second,
I would have said, `Thank you, sir.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing tied for second still hurt, however. He said he slept
only four hours the first two nights after the tournament, his mind
racing with images and regrets, and as he flew back to France that
Monday night he turned to his wife, Brigitte, and said: ``How could
I have been so stupid? I came so close to a childhood dream.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy for Van de Velde to make golf his career in a
nation where its roots are shallow. At 14, when he announced his
intentions to his father, Jean, a successful businessman, his
father was displeased that he was not going to pursue higher
education. ``It was a new environment,'' Van de Velde said. ``I
couldn't answer for him, but I think he was scared of what I was
going to face. He didn't think I could make it through.''
</P>
<P>
   To help Van de Velde make it through the week after the Open, he
and Brigitte decided to return not to their home in Geneva but to
Mont-de-Marsan, the French town about 50 miles south of Bordeaux
where they both grew up. One of the first things Van de Velde did
was attend a bullfight, in which the matador Jose Tomas dedicated a
bull to him. ``I prayed that the beast wouldn't get him and send
him to the hospital,'' Van de Velde said. ``That would have been
the perfect finish to my bad week.'' Tomas, if not the bull,
emerged unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Van de Velde has resumed sleeping through the night
and begun sifting through the scores of letters and messages _ none
of which, he insists, have started with ``You stupid idiot.'' He
was particularly amused by one missive from a British golf fan that
reached him despite being addressed only to ``Jean Van de Velde
Southwest France.'' On the front of the envelope was a picture of
him barefoot in the Barry Burn with the words ``That's him'' next
to the photo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone saw only the 18th, they might go, `That's
terrible,' and that's fair enough,'' Van de Velde said. ``But I
think the people who are interested in golf will also remember the
last 36 holes, when I took the lead after the second round and then
kept it. I think it was pretty entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the best golfer in a country where golf
remains a minor sport will do his future entertaining mainly in
Europe or in the United States. He said he was still considering
his options, which, since Carnoustie, have increased as much as his
visibility. Ranked 152nd in early July, he now has a spot in the
PGA Championship and a spot in next year's Masters and next year's
British Open.
</P>
<P>
   But what he really wants is a place on the European Ryder Cup
team in September. No Frenchman has taken part in that match-play
event, and he is currently eighth in the table in which the top 10
are guaranteed spots. If he makes it, Van de Velde has a guarantee
of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play,'' he said, ``I will do everything I can to beat my
opponents before the 18th hole.''

<P>
   He'd rather be anywhere but here, which is sad. It wasn't long
ago that Russ Koehler couldn't think of a better place to be than
the baseball park.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, a pitcher, sits behind home plate at ancient Sam Lynn
Field, home to the San Francisco Giants' Bakersfield Blaze of the
California League.
</P>
<P>
   For the fans, minor-league baseball is an inexpensive diversion.
For the players, this is serious business. This is their
livelihood, their dream.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lancaster JetHawks, who are giving away another game, it
is a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when I'm at home or the hotel, I'll look at the
clock and think: `One more hour, then it's back to hell,' '' said
Koehler, whose job this day was to chart pitches from the stands.
``It's painful coming to the park every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the utterly depressing world of the Antelope
Valley-based Single-A club, the losingest team in all of
professional baseball _ a mix of the New York Mets of 1962, the
L.A. Clippers of every year and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before the
uniform change.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where players jokingly worry their manager will
go mad, and the manager wonders whether he'll wake up one morning
to the news his relief pitcher has flung himself off a motel
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sort of dark humor appreciated only by a horrible
baseball team. And make no mistake, the JetHawks, an affiliate of
the Seattle Mariners, are bad.
</P>
<P>
   Their 38-73 record isn't just the worst in the California
League, or among the nation's Single-A teams. It is the sorriest of
any league in which pro baseball is played.
</P>
<P>
   As torturous as this year has been, the JetHawks won't equal the
California League record for losses in a season. In 1987, the San
Jose Giants lost 109 games in a 140-game schedule. But with 26
games remaining, the JetHawks are on pace to finish with the worst
record of any team in organized baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a way to lose a baseball game, trust me, we'll
figure it out,'' said second baseman Jermaine Clark.
</P>
<P>
   This is a place where individual players with selfish goals try
to fit into a team concept _ and fail. A place where the losing
tears at the will of players who dream of reaching the big leagues
but privately wonder if they are good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Single-A ball is the place where organizations begin to weed
players out of the system. A player can pitch one day and be
released the next. The JetHawks made pitcher Donnie Schmidt take a
long bus ride to Lake Elsinore earlier this year, only to release
him immediately upon their arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys will be out of baseball by next year,''
Lancaster hitting coach Dana Williams said. ``That's just part of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, there are two kinds of players: mature and immature. While
one JetHawk pays homage to the ``three B's of the minor leagues:
baseball, beer and babes,'' another prefers to go home each night
and rent a movie.
</P>
<P>
   In this place, protective radio announcers vow to chastise an
out-of-town reporter on the air for what they feel is an overly
critical story. They're even mad at the Modesto public-address
announcer, who they thought didn't show JetHawks players respect
during a lighthearted postgame interview with an 8-year-old fan.
</P>
<P>
   Here, players earn $1,200 a month and a few live off credit
cards. Some Latin players send most of their paychecks home. The
pace is relentless. In one stretch, the JetHawks played 39 games in
40 days _ and lost 25 of them.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a place where a few mentally strong players press
forward each day, despite the losing.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, this is a place where three coaches and 25 players
from all over the world came together one spring with grand hopes,
only to watch everything disintegrate over the course of a
miserable summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like the Bad News Bears,'' said Koehler, a right-hander
with an 0-3 record and 8.62 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   __ The smell from the top
</P>
<P>
   The joke is on the Mariners. Lancaster's struggles epitomize
troubled times in Seattle, which is suffering widespread losing
throughout the organization. The JetHawks are simply the worst team
in a weak system. In fact, of the Mariners' five minor-league
teams, only one has a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any excuses,'' said Greg Hunter, Seattle's
assistant player development director. ``We thought we were going
to have a club (in Lancaster) that would compete and have a chance
to be decent. But you look at the record and it's a bit
embarrassing. I don't have an excuse for that.''
</P>
<P>
   How can a professional baseball team be this dreadful?
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster is the top Single-A team in Seattle's farm system,
which means players advanced through three levels to get here.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, nine JetHawks played on a successful team at Single-A
Wisconsin in the Midwest League. Prior to that, they were all
highly regarded high school or college prospects, drafted and
signed by established talent evaluators.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, somebody thought these guys could play.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``You win with pitching, defense and offense, and you're in good
shape when two are clicking most games,'' catcher Greg Connors
said. ``But we're lucky to get one to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The JetHawks accentuate their physical shortcomings with mental
lapses, bad luck and a dubious understanding of the game. At times
they've been downright dumb, wiping away scoring chances by
bonehead baserunning mistakes, giving away leads with sloppy relief
pitching and committing key fielding errors at the worst times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we pitch, we can't hit, then when we hit, we can't
pitch,'' Jason Regan said. ``And when we pitch and hit, the defense
lets down.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent game against Modesto, Cirilo Cruz was thrown out
trying to steal third base with one out, a baseball no-no. There
had been no steal sign.
</P>
<P>
   A few innings later, Jerry Armador was thrown out at third
trying to stretch a double into a triple. Even the most casual
observer could see Armador had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, manager Darrin Garner shook his head with
astonishment while pacing in the third-base coach's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK to be aggressive, but aggressive/stupid is another
thing,'' said Clark, one of the JetHawks' brightest prospects.
``You would think at this level, guys know how to play baseball.
But that isn't always the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff _ led by the 33-year-old Garner _ is
inexperienced and growing on the job. Garner continually reminds
Lancaster that each day is another opportunity to turn things
around, but his patience is beginning to wane. After a loss last
week, he accused his team of sleepwalking, and when he was asked
how many players have earned promotions to Double-A next year, he
said none.
</P>
<P>
   The JetHawks just roll with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning of the year, were were laughing about the
losing because we just knew we'd get hot and start winning,''
Koehler said. ``But that never happened. Basically, it's been a
complete disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bakersfield blues
</P>
<P>
   Dana Williams is slumped on a sofa in the dingy coaching office
at Sam Lynn Field an hour after the JetHawks' 8-6 loss to the
Blaze. Williams, the JetHawks' hitting coach, wears a tired,
frustrated expression as he clutches a bottle of beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're humbled as a team and we're humbled as a coaching
staff,'' he says between sips. ``Things just aren't working.''
</P>
<P>
   It was another excruciating loss for Lancaster but typical of
this baffling season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jethawks got a solid pitching performance from Koehler and a
clutch home run from Regan in the top of the eighth inning to take
a one-run lead. But in the ninth, Bakersfield tied it with a solo
home run, then won it in extra innings with a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regan gets the big home run and things look good, all we need
is a one-two-three inning right there, but we let them right back
in,'' an exasperated Garner said. ``It's the same old (stuff) every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Garner calls a team meeting and closes the
clubhouse for 40 minutes. He asks the JetHawks if they're still
committed to the season and themselves. These are valid questions.
The difference between first-place Modesto and Lancaster
isstriking. Modesto does everything with a purpose. During batting
and infield practice, players run hard to catch fly balls or chase
down line drives to the outfield. Even the A's stretching sessions
are professional.
</P>
<P>
   Some Jethawks seems bored by those things.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only a few guys respond when Garner speaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stuff we've talked about before,'' Clark said. ``How many
more ways can you say it? I mean, you can't tell somebody to hustle
shagging fly balls in batting practice _ that's in your blood. You
either have it or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark is convinced some JetHawks DON'T have it, pointing out
that a few players are simply collecting a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too bad of a job when you think about it,'' Clark
said. ``You get to travel, you're away from home for six months. It
beats working in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of professionalism frustrates Clark, but he'll never
approach anyone on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got enough to worry about with myself,'' said Clark, who
is batting .306. ``I'm no Hall of Famer, I'm not Joe Morgan. Who am
I to tell somebody how to do it? It's their career.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams thinks the same thing as he, Garner and pitching coach
Greg Harris prepare for the 90-minute bus ride back to Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about being accountable, and right now some guys aren't
being accountable for their actions,'' Williams said. ``It's like
dealing with children. You tell them a hundred times to do things a
certain way, but they still want to do it their way. I don't know
if it's because they don't trust us or it's because they think they
know more than we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Williams is referring to the little things some JetHawks
seem to resist. A pitcher throws to the outside corner when he's
been instructed to pitch inside all night. Outfielders who insist
on catching pop flies with one hand, or losing track of a fly ball
because they don't use proper technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say you have to learn things the hard way,'' Williams
said. ``Well, they're definitely learning SOMETHING the hard way.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Managing to cope
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, the minor leagues are more about player
development than winning and losing. The primary objective is to
cultivate talent that one day could play at the major-league level,
not necessarily to win minor-league championships.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, if one or two players from the JetHawks play in
the big leagues, the Seattle front office will consider this year a
success.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the manner in which Lancaster closes the season could
determine whether Garner returns for a second year. Prior to
managing the JetHawks, Garner, a former first-round pick of the
Texas Rangers who played six years in the minor leagues, managed
the Mariners' Arizona instructional-league team for two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It was a huge promotion and a show of faith by the Mariners, who
determine next year's coaching assignments at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like Darrin a lot, he's a hard worker and a good teacher
and we feel he has a bright future,'' Hunter said. ``It's a big
jump going from Arizona to Lancaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The losing has taken its toll on the young manager, but players
give him credit for remaining optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, all (the coaches) can do is work with what we have
and keep sending them out there and hope they'll start playing
better,'' Garner said. ``We can't play the game for them. It seems
like every night it's the same old (stuff), but we just have to
stay positive and hope today is the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most days that just means another loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine being a manager, let alone going through a
year like this,'' Koehler said. ``I feel sorry for him.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fans take high road
</P>
<P>
   The JetHawks have the worst record in baseball, but that doesn't
matter to their fans.
</P>
<P>
   In Lancaster, the average home attendance is 3,224 per game and
community interest for the fourth-year club is as strong as ever.
The crowds are loud, active and knowledgeable. At a recent
homestand, some fans peppered players with remarks about the poor
record, but for the most part they were supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care if they're winning or losing, we just like to
come watch the guys play,'' said David DeSantis, whose family hosts
Lancaster infielder Joel Ramirez during the season.
</P>
<P>
   The players appreciate the support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best I've ever seen,'' said Connors, who has played
three years in the minors. ``Not just in attendance, but stuff like
the booster clubs we have are awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Lancaster fans, the game's outcome is secondary to
enjoying a night at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket and concession prices are more affordable than at the
major-league level, there is an intimate feel at the smaller
stadiums, and teams usually find innovative ways to entertain the
crowd, especially kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans can come to our games and not go broke,'' Connors
said.
</P>
<P>
   And they also get a chance to watch players who might one day
play in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat to get to know guys at this point in their career,''
DeSantis said, ``and then see them make it to the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   __ When it rains, it pours
</P>
<P>
   It's a half-hour after the JetHawks lost to the Modesto A's, but
the news isn't all bad.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster played a clean, efficient game and didn't blow any big
leads. Relief pitcher Jason Turman, a converted starter, was
outstanding in his best four-inning performance of the year. More
important, the game ended quickly, and the young JetHawks look
forward to enjoying a Saturday night for a change.
</P>
<P>
   That small opening in the the clouds disappears quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The team bus hasn't arrived at the stadium to bring the club
back to the motel. So the players wait in the dark. In a gloomy
season, this seems appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The JetHawks later find out the battery on the bus went dead.
Driver Pedro Gomez worked two hours to fix it. Right now, that's no
consolation for a group of restless ballplayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether to be concerned or (upset),'' Clark, a
fifth-round draft pick from the University of San Francisco, tells
someone. ``I mean, on one hand I hope Pedro didn't wrap the bus
around a tree. But if he didn't, I wish (he was) here right now,
because I'm hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   On a winning team, moments like these are flicked away like lint
on a suit. But for the JetHawks, they're just annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster's challenge is to stay together as a team. It's nearly
impossible to lose day after day with the same 25 guys and not end
up disliking one another, especially when you spend so much time
together on buses, at motels and on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Without winning to hold things together, something's bound to
give. To some degree, that's already happened with the Jethawks.
The squabbles are predictable: Players complain about too much
finger-pointing, selfish play and not enough personal
responsibility. Some even question teammates' desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just once I'd like to see the finger-pointing stop and have
(players) step up and take the blame, just 'fess up for what's
happened,'' Koehler said. ``But that will never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler was drafted in the 11th round in 1995, but his progress
has been stunted by three major arm injuries. Koehler used most of
this season to nurse his arm back to full strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had our staff from Wisconsin, we might be in first place
right now,'' Connors said.
</P>
<P>
   __ The end is near
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is easy for the Jethawks, even a rare win. They ended a
losing streak at seven games with a 7-6 win over the Blaze, but not
before barely averting disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster led 7-3 to start the ninth, but two relievers gave up
three runs, almost ruining one of pitcher Greg Wooten's best games
of the year. The game ended with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had lost this game, Greg might have killed himself,''
Regan said.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, who will pitch the following night, watched the game
from behind home plate. Later, he talked about what, if anything,
he can take from this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe down the road I can use this experience to help somebody
get through something like this,'' he said. ``Nobody on this team
has been through this type of thing, and it's tough looking
yourself in the mirror day after day asking yourself if you're a
loser. But if my going through this can help a young player some
day, then I can at least take that with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler asked a reporter who'd been traveling with the JetHawks
how much longer he'd be following the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just through the weekend,'' the reporter said. ``Then, for me,
it's back to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Koehler smiled wearily. ``Can you take me with you?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler didn't have long to wait: the JetHawks released him
eight days later.
</P>
<P>
   For one player, at least, the nightmare is over. And a dream,
too.

UNUSUAL MIX OF METHODS IN HILLARY CLINTON'S TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With her fifth ``listening tour'' in New York state
set to begin Monday morning in a Baptist church in Brooklyn,
Hillary Rodham Clinton's all-but-announced bid for the U.S. Senate
has evolved into a curious hybrid of pure politics and unorthodox
campaign techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts are remarkable. Mrs. Clinton's trips through the
state resemble a full-throttle, high-stakes campaign tour in the
final weeks of a frenzied campaign, though the election is more
than a year away.
</P>
<P>
   As she travels through towns large and small, she tows along a
press corps of more than 50 journalists _ some from far outside the
state _ as she pulls out throngs of ordinary citizens along the
routes of her motorcade who wait just to get a glimpse of the first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   Her travels through the state have also produced many less
visible but still critical stops for any candidate hoping to win a
statewide election. For example, her trip last week through western
New York, like her previous tours, included a series of private
meetings with scores of local elected officials, party leaders and
influential citizens.
</P>
<P>
   She met on Friday with Thomas Golisano, a Rochester businessman
and the leader of the Ross Perot-inspired Independence Party in New
York, to seek his support. At private receptions in Buffalo, she
met with local ministers, Democratic City Council members and party
foot soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's trips are anything but politics as usual. Her
most public appearances _ the listening sessions themselves _ are
carefully choreographed events whose participants are handpicked,
with name cards on the chairs they are supposed to sit in.
</P>
<P>
   Each session is held at a distinct venue _ an
aerospace-component plant in Binghamton, a school for performing
arts in Rochester _ and centers on one theme, from school violence
to economic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions typically feature a panel of five or six speakers
seated in front of the audience, with Mrs. Clinton holding forth in
the center, like a talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   Often the audience consists of notable residents of the city _
top officials of the Rochester school system were invited to a
session last week, for example. But there are also ordinary
citizens, like plant workers, ministers, students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton prods the program along, asking questions of
panelists and then asking members of the audience for their
thoughts. The events are utterly without discord, with no one
asking confrontational questions.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's aides maintain that the first lady's exploratory
committee has little to no involvement in selecting the
participants. In fact, they contend, a combination of local civic
leaders, political officials, business and educational leaders and
the hosts of the meeting site select the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions, presenting Mrs. Clinton as an eager listener, are
structured in such a way that she can comfortably avoid discussing
any topic she chooses to bypass. And in some cases, she will simply
tell the questioner of her appreciation for any opinion expressed.
</P>
<P>
   At one session, for example, a questioner asked why the western
part of the state lagged behind the rest of the country in economic
performance. Mrs. Clinton's reply contained far more sympathy than
specificity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were you, I would be frustrated, too,'' she said. ``If
you look at upstate New York and compare it to the upper Midwest
and New England, you have comparable climates, comparable work
forces and industrial base that went through a very difficult
transition in the 1980s. But those parts of the country are doing
better than upstate New York is. So I have to ask myself: What is
not happening here that should happen and what should be done in
government?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also freely expounds on whatever themes she likes,
such as the need for expanded arts programs in schools. Twice last
week Mrs. Clinton condemned the tax-cut package passed by Congress,
specifically assailing its impact on education financing for New
York state.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Mrs. Clinton is displaying her increased
knowledge of local issues in the areas along the route of her
listening tour, rattling off, for example, the names of local roads
that have become interstate highways and the impact of high
electric rates on western New York businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all the resources that are needed,'' she said,
opening a session in Jamestown last week on the difficulties facing
the upstate economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've got some obstacles and problems and challenges, and
I want to hear all about those. I have heard so much in the last
week about air-fare costs. I am pleased that Route 17 is about to
become an interstate. But we have to be very sure that the funding
is there to make it absolutely a reality and not just a change in
designation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The state and local tax burden is among the highest in the
country,'' she added, before entering into a critique of the amount
of money New York state pays in federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that she has really done her homework and is
listening hard,'' said Sandra Frankel, the supervisor of the town
of Brighton, just outside Rochester. ``She speaks with a great deal
of knowledge about the issues affecting our part of the state, such
as the fact that we have some of the highest air fares in the
country, and the impact that has on our business community.''
</P>
<P>
   What is also clear in nearly every stop along the ``listening
tour'' is that Mrs. Clinton evokes strong passions from admirers
and detractors alike. At a community center in Buffalo, for
example, Mrs. Clinton was the object of competing camps of
protesters and supporters, each with about a dozen people standing
along the sidewalk. Some yelled, ``Hillary go home,'' with others
chanting, ``Leave Hillary alone.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one event last week, at a furniture-manufacturing plant in
Jamestown, Mrs. Clinton faced her harshest question of the week,
from a woman who criticized the Clinton administration's
championing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.
After hearing criticism of how the agreement had taken jobs away
from western New York, Mrs. Clinton offered only a quick ``Thank
you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Klinkner, associate professor of government and director
of the Arthur Levitt Public Affairs Center at Hamilton College in
Clinton, said: ``Most of the people who attend these things are
generally fellow believers and, regardless of what they think about
Hillary Clinton, are inclined to be extremely polite. The last
thing she wants is someone grilling her about Whitewater or
something that would be embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinkner, who attended a recent listening session in central New
York, said Mrs. Clinton seemed to be focused on ``raising the
comfort level of people in different parts of the state with the
idea of her candidacy, particularly in upstate New York.''
</P>
<P>
   There are people, he added, who are going to be bothered by the
carpetbagger issue, and she is trying to minimize the number of
people who would be bothered by that.''
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain how many more listening tours Mrs. Clinton will
undertake, and she shed little light on the subject when asked
about it in Rochester on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a really good time doing this,'' she said. ``I
intend to continue it for some time. There will be different
formats, different settings. I've gotten a lot of very good ideas
that I will be exploring. So I hope that I can continue it for the
foreseeable future.''

ECTON PARK WINS IN THE MUD AT SARATOGA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Elliott Walden was not even here, but
his big day began at Saratoga Race Course when the lesser light in
his stable, Ecton Park, swept through the mud and won the $300,000
Jim Dandy Stakes by 5 1/4 lengths over Lemon Drop Kid.
</P>
<P>
   Walden was 200 miles away on the Jersey Shore watching his prime
colt, Menifee, win the $1 million Haskell at Monmouth Park. But he
collected at both ends of Sunday's testing arc in a division that
is still searching for a leader in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   His Saratoga winner, Ecton Park, is a son of Forty Niner and a
grandson of Danzig, but the clues end there. At 6-1, he was fifth
choice in a field of seven. He ran third in the Louisiana Derby in
March, fourth in the Arkansas Derby in April, 12th in the Kentucky
Derby in May and second in the Ohio Derby in July, and he had not
won anything but an allowance race since February. Ecton Park was
running Sunday against Lemon Drop Kid and Vision and Verse, who had
run first and second in the Belmont Stakes. And he had Alex Solis,
a substitute jockey, on his back.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was a day when Ecton Park royally confused things, at
least until his stablemate Menifee returned to racing for the first
time since he ran eighth in the Belmont Stakes. Charismatic, who
won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, was injured running third in
the Belmont and retired. Lemon Drop Kid, who won the Belmont, ran
second in the Jim Dandy. Silverbulletday has gone back to racing
other fillies for now. And nobody has seized the opportunity or the
lead in the division with three weeks to go to the $1 million
Travers Stakes, which will be run at Saratoga with a lot of
questions needing answers.
</P>
<P>
   One question got a partial answer Sunday when Mark Stanley, the
owner of Ecton Park, said he doubted the colt would race in the
Travers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran just two weeks ago,'' Stanley said, referring to the
Ohio Derby, ``so I'd be surprised if Elliott suggested going in the
Travers. I'm thinking that he might go next in the Pennsylvania
Derby and then in the Super Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scotty Schulhofer, the trainer of Lemon Drop Kid, saw every
reason for aiming his colt at the Travers after running a strong
race in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``My horse ran great,'' Schulhofer said. ``He hates that kind of
going, but he still ran good. He's got a different kind of stride
over it than over a dry track. But this race should set him up just
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens next in the drama of Triple Crown graduates and
absentees, Ecton Park will be remembered either as a
late-developing player or as a bit player who became something of a
star. He has won four of 10 races and has run in the money nine
times. But he has enjoyed nowhere near the success of Menifee.
</P>
<P>
   Ecton Park ran the mile and an eighth of the Jim Dandy in 1:49
2/5, paid $15 for a $2 bet and earned $180,000. Walden entered two
horses in two stakes and won $780,000 for his owners and $78,000
for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Badger Gold set the early pace but yielded it after
three-quarters of a mile to Vicar, winner of the Florida Derby. As
they turned for home, Vicar yielded first place to Ecton Park, who
came charging in a steady progression from fourth place to second
into the lead. It was a dogfight down the stretch, but Ecton Park
pulled clear and won by daylight over Lemon Drop Kid, who had two
lengths on Badger Gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure how he was going to handle the wet track,''
Solis said. ``But he loved it.''

   &UR; ``THE DESCENT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jeff Long (Crown, $24)
</P>
<P>
   What this horror story loses in bizarre plot twists, it makes up
in audacity and dogged inventiveness. Long's setup goes on for
chapters, during which we meet lots of people and witness lots of
gore. In the end, we're sure of just one thing: Something awful
lives under the ground. It surfaces in an isolated Tibetan cave
where guide Ike Crockett takes refuge from a storm with a group of
wealthy (and doomed) clients. It surfaces in a South African leper
colony where a beautiful nun named Ali hears of a ``hungry God''
who kills men and chops them up for parts. And it surfaces in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where NATO soldier Elias Branch watches
otherworldly creatures rise from a mass grave and attack his
crippled helicopter. The demons have already dispatched Branch's
navigator, hideously, but Branch survives to initiate the discovery
and exploration of a vast network of tunnels deep beneath the
Earth's surface, where are found body parts, crude jewelry and
footprints that aren't quite human. The penetration of the
underground becomes a worldwide military effort until more than
250,000 soldiers are slaughtered in the tunnels in a single day, a
well-planned mass execution that gives world leaders a sense of
what they're facing. ``Hell exists,'' the U.S. president announces.
``It is real. A geological, historical place beneath our very feet.
And it is inhabited. Savagely.'' Yes folks, it's Satan's empire
we're talking about here, and it's not pretty. Branch goes bravely
back into the tunnels, where he finds Ike Crockett alive after
years of captivity underground, and the ravaged Ike finds an odd
romance with Ali the nun. If Satan is a bit disappointing when he
finally shows up, you'll be too busy keeping up with all of the
other action to really care. It's a late summer page-turner that
you're unlikely to put down. &QL; 
 &UR; ``LETTERS FROM YELLOWSTONE''By Diane Smith (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel, written as a collection of letters, is set in 1898
and begins with a formal note from A.E. Bartram, a New York medical
student with a passion for botany, who asks to join a field study
of Yellowstone National Park. The request is greeted with
enthusiasm by the leader of the expedition, Montana Professor
Howard Merriam, and letters fly among Bartram, Merriam and their
families and colleagues before the expedition meets in Montana.
This early correspondence shows Bartram to be a clever, industrious
and ambitious young scientist who relishes the chance to make a
career in botany. Bartram's arrival in Montana causes confusion and
dismay, however, when Merriam learns that Alex Bartram is a woman _
and a determined one at that. She persists quietly as Merriam frets
about her ability to endure wilderness existence and about the
pragmatic obstacles of including a lone woman in a company of men.
But Bartram stays and becomes a delightful character. So does
Andrew Rutherford, a fellow scientist who writes amusingly about
the upheaval Alex's presence causes and about how ably she sticks
to the business at hand. Meanwhile, Howard Merriam's letters to his
mother reflect his growing respect for the woman he wanted so
desperately to send packing. Many things emerge in this story _ a
portrait of scientists at work at the turn of the century, a look
at the West at a time of change, the beauty and danger of
Yellowstone, and the story of a forthright woman and the men who
come to admire her. Smith began with a beguiling idea and has
turned it into an enchanting book. &QL; 
 &UR; ``TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE: THE COLOSSAL BOOK OF URBAN LEGENDS'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jan Harold Brunvand (Norton, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reading this is like going through photo albums _ the pleasure
is in the recognition. The most famous American urban legend is, of
course, ``The Hook'' (a homicidal maniac left it hanging on the car
door of a couple just returned from a lovers' lane). Then there's
``Kentucky Fried Rat,'' or, as New &AMP; Notable has always known it,
``Kentucky Fried Rodent,'' which leaves room for variation. ``The
Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker'' is good, or ``The Killer in the Back
Seat'' (this inspired a testy exchange between Brunvand and David
Letterman, which Brunvand describes here with some remorse). Or
there are the harmless ones, such as that Internet favorite about
the Neiman Marcus cookies. It's true, however, that many urban
legends are disgusting or disturbing or both (we like to tell
stories about the worst possible things that can happen to us), and
that this is where we throw all taste and political correctness to
the wind. There are legends about toilets, AIDS, dead babies, sex,
even pets-in-the-microwave _ something for everyone to enjoy. &QL; 
 &UR; ``BILL AND HILLARY: THE MARRIAGE''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Christopher Andersen (Morrow, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was in Hillary's White House bedroom that Bill Clinton
finally told her that he had, indeed, had an affair with Monica
Lewinsky. As she sat, stunned, on the edge of her bed, Andersen
writes, ``the president of the United States got down on his knees
and, weeping, begged her forgiveness.'' We assume that Andersen was
crouched behind a nearby potted plant during this exchange, and
that he knew where all the White House plants were and moved from
one to the other in search of dirt. Of course, not all of his
information came by way of espionage. Some was procured from former
presidential adviser Dick Morris, who is on everyone's most-admired
list. Andersen (``The Day Diana Died'') looks at the Clintons from
courtship to current status, whatever that may be. Other than
painful descriptions of Chelsea Clinton's misery during the
Lewinsky revelations, it has the feel of old, tired news _ it made
us feel old and tired just to read it. We hope you fare better. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTOVER, Md. _ They call it Camp Somerset, and each July it
springs to life, filling with 700 people. But despite the pickup
soccer game each evening, it should not be mistaken for a summer
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it. Camp Somerset, a former prisoner-of-war camp, is
now a camp for migrant workers. The long, corrugated steel
buildings from the 1940s, when hundreds of German soldiers were
detained here, are now packed with migrants, who squeeze in two's,
three's and four's into cramped, sweltering rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, hundreds of Mexicans and Guatemalans make a
20-hour bus trip from their home base in Florida to Camp Somerset,
where they stay for a month in the harvest season to pick tomatoes
_ some days for more than the minimum wage, some days for less. The
camp, 30 miles inland from the luxury beach communities on the
Maryland shore, is one of the biggest labor camps on the Eastern
Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Some migrants, many of them illegal immigrants who come here to
work and then travel to other parts of the country, put together a
few hundred dollars h each month to send back home. Others come to
take their chances in the United States and, if lucky, save enough
to buy a 10-year-old pickup truck, a symbol of success in the
migrant pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the workers, Alfonso Ortega, a 20-year-old from
Veracruz, Mexico, is not enthusiastic about the camp, although he
loves one aspect of life here: it is rent-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like all the trash that's around _ it stinks,''
Ortega said as a breeze wafted a most unwelcome odor from the
overflowing trash bin some 25 yards from his room. Large garbage
bins dot the camp, a collection of 20 buildings hidden from the
main road by hundreds of trees.
</P>
<P>
   The odor aside, Ortega is not bitter about his life in the
United States. ``You know, in Mexico we're needy,'' he said. ``The
wages are much worse. We're trying to make a better future. I'm
very thankful for the two years here because I've been able to earn
money and take care of my mother and brother.''
</P>
<P>
   He tries to telegraph money home every three weeks, he said. His
biggest complaint was that he had paid a smuggler $500 to take him
to the United States, but the smuggler deceived him and dumped him
just south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was a wetback,'' Ortega said with an awkward grin,
describing his trip across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 in the evening his roommate was asleep, tired from a long
day (the work days are sometimes as long as 12 hours) and from
having woken at 5 a.m. to make tortillas, the staple of Mexican
meals. Their room, a 10-by-11-foot square, has two beds, a
cast-iron hot plate, two beat-up fans, an aging green Hotpoint
refrigerator, several comic-book novels and a picture of the Virgin
Mary. As in many rooms in the camp, a plastic mattress cover _
required to help keep the mattresses sanitary _ is being used as a
curtain to keep out the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its temporary nature, Camp Somerset has a distinct
social pyramid. On top are the crew leaders, who herd 30 or so
workers to the fields each morning. They drive gleaming, new,
oversized wide-body pickup trucks, almost twice as long as regular
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Below the crew leaders is a small group of swaggering pickers
who are not here to send money home so much as to patch together a
life style of fancy boots, silver belts and expensive beer. Next
comes the largest stratum: the hard workers like Ortega, who keep
their heads down and send home as much money as they can.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom are aging workers, often in their 50s, often
somewhat broken after years of hard manual labor. They are usually
unable to save money to send home, and they sometimes bury their
problems in drink.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega, who dreams of becoming a construction worker in Florida,
is known as a hard worker, sometimes picking 160 buckets of
tomatoes in eight hours. At the piece rate of 45 cents a bucket,
that comes to $72 before taxes, an excellent daily haul for a
migrant. But some days, when the fields are stingy, the pickers end
up picking just 80 buckets and earning just $36.
</P>
<P>
   Several workers complained that on some days there is no work
and on other days there is just three hours of picking.

   One day Ortega worked only three hours laying black plastic
sheeting to protect the tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got paid $10, $15 that day,'' Ortega said, less than
the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage. Several workers also grumbled that
they were not paid for the three or four hours spent each day being
shuttled to the tomato fields.

</P>
<P>
   Dennett Butler, president of the Somerset Country Growers
Association, said the tomato companies made sure to raise each
worker's wages to $5.15 an hour when the piece rate left their pay
below the minimum wage.

</P>
<P>
   Camp Somerset's residents give the camp mixed reviews, although
many acknowledge that the conditions are often better than in the
trailers they rent in Florida. While leaning on his scratched,
rusting Dodge Ram truck, Alberto Lara, a sleek, muscular tomato
picker, said: ``Look, the camp is good. It's free. We're here only
a short time. And there are a lot of nice people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Orbelio Martinez, a pencil-thin 49-year-old, said there was
little to rave about. ``It's bad here _ the bed, the stove, the
water,'' he said of his freshly painted, stultifyingly hot room.
``It's not good when you get to the shower. The hot water is
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also complained about being squeezed four to a room.
``They drink, they get up early, it's hard to sleep,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the growers' leader, said the camp is ``adequate for the
time that we use it, which is four to six weeks a year. We provide
all the necessary things that are required by federal, state and
local standards: shower rooms, dishwashing rooms, smoke detectors,
trash removal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s the growers who own and run Camp Somerset renovated
much of it, enlarging the windows. More recently, new shower rooms
were added and the number of water heaters was tripled. But Butler
acknowledged that it was hard to provide enough hot water for 700
workers who return from work at the same time, adding that the
workers had made it even harder by removing the water-conserving
shower nozzles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to supply everything necessary, and we do it free of
charge,'' Butler said. ``I recognize it's not like year-round
housing. It wasn't designed for that.''
</P>
<P>
   David Roberts, who helps oversee migrant housing for the
Maryland Department of Health, said the camp was inspected before
and during each season. The department tells the growers the
maximum number of people who can live in each room, he said, but he
acknowledged that workers sometimes squeezed in an extra friend.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of picking tomatoes, some workers grow frustrated
about saving so little, about sweltering in rooms without air
conditioning and about never swimming at the beaches they pass on
the way to the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to live and be treated like Americans,'' said
Jumaro Zarate, 50, a worker from Guerrero State in Mexico. ``We
have brains like Americans. We have skins like Americans, maybe a
little darker. But we don't want to be treated like dogs.''

DODGERS DRUB METS IN LAUGHER, 14-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Mets needed something to laugh about
Sunday in the middle of a 14-3 drubbing by the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   One of their most dependable starters, Rick Reed, had abruptly
left the mound in the second inning with a finger injury that will
probably cost him his next start.
</P>
<P>
   Then Masato Yoshii, in relief of Reed, gave up a three-run homer
to the first batter he faced _ the Dodgers' pitcher, Darren
Dreifort. Three innings later Yoshii was booed off the mound.
Finally, Raul Mondesi belted a pair of home runs off Pat Mahomes to
drive in five Los Angeles runs.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that went the Mets' way was the Atlanta
Braves' loss to San Francisco, which preserved the Mets' half-game
lead in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   So with the Mets trailing by 10 runs in the ninth on a muggy
afternoon at Shea Stadium when most of the 39,803 fans had already
left, manager Bobby Valentine decided he was going to make a
change.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine brought Matt Franco in from left field to pitch and
sent Chuck McElroy, who had pitched the eighth, out to play left
field for the first time since high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, everyone was asking for Franco to pitch the
ninth,'' Valentine said, referring to his injured closer, John
Franco. ``I figured everyone gets their wish today.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was taking a less than subtle shot at the
second-guessing he received after the Mets' bullpen collapsed in
the ninth in a 7-6 loss Saturday night. Sunday, all Valentine
wanted to do was save his bullpen _ and give his team and its fans
some comic relief.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, to an extent. McElroy made a nice running catch. And
Matt Franco, who gave up a run on one hit and three walks, was
treated to chants of ``Let's go, Franco!'' as he made his way
through the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never hear that with me out there,'' John Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he was not offended by
Valentine's maneuver, although Johnson had looked a little
disturbed when one of Franco's fastballs nearly hit Mark
Grudzielanek's helmet. Of course, fastball was a relative term.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's throwing 78 miles per hour,'' Valentine said. ``You
should be able to get out of the way.'' Grudzielanek did, just
barely, the ball hitting his bat as he ducked his head.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi avoided the weird switch entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was hitting pretty well and he didn't want to hit against
an outfielder _ infielder _ whatever he is,'' said Johnson, who
sent up a pinch-hitter for Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time this season that Valentine had called on
Franco, a reserve infielder and the Mets' best pinch-hitter, to
pitch. On July 2 he took the mound against the Braves with two out
in the ninth after John Franco had strained a tendon in the middle
finger of his left hand. He gave up a home run and a double before
getting the third out.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who will be examined by a hand specialist Monday, felt a
burning sensation in his right middle finger after throwing a
curveball in the first inning. After giving up consecutive doubles
to Eric Karros and Todd Hundley to open the second, he felt the
burning again when he walked Craig Counsell on a curve.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine noticed Reed's grimace, and he sent the pitching
coach, Dave Wallace, and the trainer, Fred Hina, out to check. ``I
didn't know the extent of the injury,'' Valentine said. ``I was
really expecting Reed would pitch to the pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reed was done for the day. ``He said, `It hurts,''' Wallace
recounted. ``And Rick Reed doesn't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (9-11) came to the plate hitting .186. But he fouled
off two two-strike pitches from Yoshii before lining a full-count
fastball over the fence in center field, some 406 feet away, for a
4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he knew that Dreifort is as good a hitter as
he is,'' Valentine said of Yoshii, who left the clubhouse without
comment after the game.
</P>
<P>
   If Reed (10-4) cannot make his next scheduled start in San
Francisco on Friday, Yoshii will most likely take his place.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco, meanwhile, said that this time he did not enjoy his
inning on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' said Franco, who was so unnerved by his near
beaning of Grudzielanek that he telephoned him in the visiting
clubhouse after the game. ``It was fun against Atlanta. Today, I
just wanted to get in and out as fast as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, John Franco was asked if Matt Franco had qualified for
membership in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' he said. ``He has to buy dinner for us all first.''

AUSTRALIANS NOT QUICK TO EMBRACE AMERICAN FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ An 11-year-old who saw his first
American-style football game on Sunday gave a verdict echoed by
many here, where the National Football League is trying to promote
the American game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really exciting in parts, but there were too many stops
in the action _ it was too long between things happening,'' young
Oliver Hopes said after watching the Denver Broncos beat the San
Diego Chargers, 20-17, when Jason Elam kicked a 30-yard field goal
on the final play.
</P>
<P>
   The game, billed as the American Bowl, was played at Stadium
Australia, the new 110,000-seat arena built for next year's Olympic
Games. It was the first NFL event staged in Australia and was
intended to help recruit more players, fans and sponsors. Up to
now, the sport's gains have been small. After 15 years of nurturing
70 local clubs, the sport's boosters, known as Gridiron Australia,
count only 2,500 registered players.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NFL reported attendance at 73,000, reporters with
experience in the stadium _ which has staged major international
rugby and soccer games since opening last March _ estimated that it
was closer to 60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The audience, about 20,000 smaller than the NFL had hoped for,
arrived forewarned that a typical three-hour game contains only
about 60 minutes of action.
</P>
<P>
   The Sydney sports columnist Peter Fitzsimmons, who played Rugby
Union for Australia, warned in pregame comments on national
television, ``Don't expect to be riveted.''
</P>
<P>
   And Darren Bennett, the Chargers' Australian-born punter, who
starred in the long-kicking game of Australian Rules before moving
to the United States in 1993, counseled, ``Gridiron is as much an
entertainment as a sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian sports fans, who grow up watching the four codes (or
styles) of high-speed, nonstop unpadded football that are played
here, will have to be converted if football is to get a grip here.
</P>
<P>
   The fans, accustomed to Rugby League (13 players per team),
Rugby Union (15) and Australian Rules (18), seemed as befuddled on
Sunday by American football as Americans are by cricket, the
national summer game here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't follow it,'' one man said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all glitter,'' another said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only here for the girls,'' said a group, waving to the
52 long-legged cheerleaders whose high-kicking routines and
showgirl smiles won louder applause than some of the plays on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, canned applause was frequently blasted across the
stadium when the audience was slow to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the NFL's attempt to launch the game in
Australia coincided with a rough patch in Australian-U.S.
relations, about which Australians are often ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   A dispute about U.S. tariffs on lamb imports cooled the White
House meeting between Prime Minister John Howard of Australia and
President Clinton last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Australian Olympic organizers and American
promoters have been contesting Sydney's decision to withdraw
invitations to 10 California and Georgia high school bands to
perform at the 2000 Summer Games, although the dispute is
reportedly going to be resolved this week with the invitations
being reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Such differences amounted to little more than background noise
with thousands of Australians willing to pay up to $100 a ticket
and travel an hour or more by train to watch a game about which
they knew next to nothing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Australian reporters were fascinated by the size, salaries and
life stories of many of the visiting players. They quoted the
Broncos' star running back Terrell Davis on his account of a
childhood marred by violence, and approved of the Chargers' veteran
quarterback Jim Harbaugh taking in a Sydney performance of
``Macbeth.''
</P>
<P>
   During the game, Denver's Shannon Sharpe, who got bad press when
he hastily declared that he hated Sydney, after a 20-minute wait
for a taxi, was the subject of a fan banner that read, ``Sharpe,
have a beer not a whine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, who did not play in the game after injuring his right
ankle during practice, laughed when the sign was displayed on the
stadium's big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Masters, a Sydney Morning Herald sportswriter and formerly a
top Rugby League coach, said that because Australian football fans
``will not like the frequent benching and the switching of
specialists,'' it would be unrealistic to think that American
football could hope to become the fifth football code in Australia
``until well into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for those who support the game is that young
Oliver hasn't given up on it. ``I think I would come again,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of any future visits, NFL marketers may find his
other comments useful:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I loved the throws. I couldn't believe how far and straight
they throw.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I liked it when they jumped over the tackles. They are
really brave.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rugby is a lot faster, because after players are tackled,
they get up and keep going. But I saw that American tacklers are a
lot harder and stronger. Some of them don't look very athletic. I
noticed quite a few fat guys.''

RUSSIA TRIES TO UPROOT ISLAMIC REBELS IN CAUCASUS REGION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Government forces launched air and artillery attacks
Sunday against armed rebels holding positions in the Caucasus
Mountains, as Russia faced the most serious challenge to its
authority on its volatile southern frontier since the war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials said they had launched a counteroffensive to
dislodge up to 2,000 militants who seized control of two mountain
villages in the southern Russian republic of Dagestan on Saturday.
The bold incursion has stoked fears of new, widespread unrest in
the North Caucasus, Russia's most restive region.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen, reportedly members of a radical Muslim sect that
seeks to establish an Islamic republic in Dagestan, presented
Moscow with a serious dilemma: how to end the uprising without
getting dragged into another bloody campaign in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed what appeared to be the heaviest
fighting in the region since Russian troops withdrew from Chechnya
in 1996 after a disastrous two-year campaign killed tens of
thousands of people but did not end a separatist rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television showed government troops firing mortars,
heavy machine guns, and heavy artillery into the rugged mountain
territory held by the rebels. Casualty figures from the remote
region were sketchy and unconfirmed. Some reports said four
Dagestani police officers had been killed. Others said two Russian
helicopters had been shot down by the militants.
</P>
<P>
   Russian news agencies reported that up to 2,000 civilians,
mostly women and children, had fled the area of fighting in the
Botlykh region of Dagestan. Refugees told Russian Public Television
that the gunmen were members of the radical Wahhabi sect, which
supports independence for the mostly Islamic republics in the
Caucasus. A police spokesman in Dagestan said the militants had
kept the men in the villages as hostages.
</P>
<P>
   But refugees from the villages said the gunmen didn't threaten
them and asked their help in introducing Islamic law to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to proclaim an Islamic republic. They want the
Russian military forces and police out,'' one unidentified refugee
said on NTV television.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, rushed to Dagestan
Sunday with the leaders of the army and police force to oversee the
counteroffensive. Stepashin's spokesman, Alexander Mikhailov, told
reporters that ``all necessary measures, including artillery and
missile strikes and bombing the gunmen's locations, are being
taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, who as domestic intelligence chief played a key role
in the unsuccessful Chechnya campaign, ruled out a repeat of the
Chechen debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither military nor civilian people should suffer during the
settlement of the situation,'' the Russian premier told reporters
in Dagestan's capital, Makhachkala.
</P>
<P>
   But as estimates of the rebel force grew from several hundred
early in the day to 2,000 by nightfall, it became harder to imagine
how Russian forces would avoid bloodshed to force the militants
out.
</P>
<P>
   It was still unclear Sunday exactly who the militants, or their
leaders, are. Russian officials said the gunmen were led by Shamil
Basayev, a war hero in Chechnya who is wanted in Russia for leading
a deadly hostage-taking raid on a Russian town in 1995. Russian
news reports also mentioned another field commander, Khattab, a
Jordanian of Chechen descent who is one of the leaders of the
Wahhabi movement in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Both Basayev and Khattab are routinely blamed by Moscow for the
kidnappings, shootings, and other violent crime that has spread
throughout Chechnya and the North Caucasus region since the war
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Basayev and Khattab command large, well-trained and equipped
forces that do not obey Chechnya's government. Both are active in a
society that promotes the merger of Dagestan and Chechnya into a
single, independent Islamic republic. They draw on the inspiration
of Basayev's namesake, the legendary Imam Shamil, who used Islam to
weld mountain tribes of Dagestan and Chechnya into a formidable
fighting force that resisted the Russian conquest of the Caucasus
into the middle of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Chechnya's capital, Grozny, said the militants are
not Chechens, but Dagestanis who are protesting Moscow's rule over
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Dagestan avoided being dragged into the Chechnya war even when
fighting briefly spilled into the republic in early 1996. But
Dagestan has been hard hit by Russia's decade-long economic
struggles. Moscow's authority in the region is at an all-time low,
while radical Islamic groups like the Wahhabis have gained a
foothold, especially in the poorest areas in the mountains close to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the North Caucasus region, unidentified
gunmen reportedly killed two Russian servicemen and kidnapped three
others in an attack on a military training facility in North
Ossetia, which is west of Chechnya. About 50 Russian servicemen
have been killed and dozens taken hostage in frequent attacks along
the Chechen border this year.

CLINTON TRIES TO ENLIST GOVERNORS IN BUDGET BATTLE WITH CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Subs 2d graph to clarify where money from state budgets might
be taken, 8th graph to add details of Clinton's stand on tax cuts,
21st and 22d graphs to clarify elements of Clinton's speech.  
 (rm) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ President Clinton warned the nation's governors
Sunday that the Republican tax cut would force drastic cutbacks in
many programs that could hurt states, including Medicare, veterans'
benefits, farm programs, support for immigration and mineral
leasing payments.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, who has vowed to veto the $792-billion tax cut
passed by the Republican-led Congress, used a low-key,
nonconfrontational appearance here to cajole the National
Governors' Association into siding with him in this fall's budget
battles _ not an impossible task, given the governors' fears that
congressional Republicans will raid state budgets, including
unclaimed welfare money, to pay for the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   As the president talked to the governors about their ``common
vision,'' his goal, aides said, was to build support to put
pressure on Congress and pave the way for a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that election-year politics might intercede and
prevent a compromise, Clinton said, was ``dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not nearly as pessimistic as a lot of people are about
the prospects of our reaching an agreement, and I am determined to
try to do it,'' he said, striking a conciliatory tone with a group
he once headed as governor of Arkansas and whose members he
identifies with closely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used many of his powers of persuasion to suggest that
the governors' interests were more in line with his own than they
were with those of the Republican Congress. He referred approvingly
to Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio and Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine,
both Republicans, for voting against the tax cut, noting that they
did so because of their familiarity with a governor's
responsibilities. Voinovich is a former governor and Ms. Snowe is
married to a former governor, John McKernan.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a new argument to its reasons to veto the tax cut, the
White House said Sunday that under current budget laws the tax
reductions would trigger automatic, across-the-board cuts in
spending on social programs, including Medicare. Mr. Clinton has
insisted that he cannot accept tax cuts of more than $300 billion
over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that if Clinton signed the tax bill in the form
that the House and Senate passed it, without offsetting spending
reductions or revenue increases, the budget laws would require cuts
in several categories of spending, including veterans' programs,
farm credit and crop insurance and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare would have to be cut by $2 billion in 2000, and by $9.2
billion, or 4 percent, in 2002, according to a study by the White
House budget office. Over the next five years, the study said,
Medicare would have to be cut $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton worked the room slowly, steeping
himself in conversations with individual governors. He had a warm
chat with Gov. Jesse Ventura, the independent from Minnesota, a
former wrestler with whom he talked at length about wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the governors said afterward that the president's
approach was effective, if not persuasive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left the door wide open for a compromise on tax cuts,''
said Gov. John Engler, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he believed the president was not trying to drive a
wedge between the governors and Congress. ``He's too sophisticated
for that,'' Engler said. ``He was trying to be positioned well in
the debate, and I thought it was a very artful talk. His skills
have always been significant in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, governors who listened to the president's speech
were divided along party lines. Republicans were not buying his
arguments against a big tax cut. Democrats said his reasoning made
perfect sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very effective, very smooth, and he certainly made a
strong argument,'' said Gov. Tommy Thompson, R-Wis. ``But I still
disagree with his conclusion that we can't afford a tax cut at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he believed he spoke for ``the vast majority'' of
Republican governors, adding, `'It's hard to believe any of them
would not support the position I advocate. We have a chance for a
major tax cut. If not now, when? If we can't do it now, we will
never get the ability to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California, who last November became the
first Democrat in 16 years to be elected governor of the state,
said Clinton ``hit a home run'' and suggested that some of his
Republican colleagues might actually agree with him.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura promised to keep an open mind about the size of tax cuts
until he familiarized himself with details of the congressional
action and the administration alternative. He said he listened
closely to Clinton's remarks, as well as to the speech that
preceded it by Sen. Don Nickels, R-Okla., who criticized an array
of administration programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I venture out and make an opinion, I want to study both
proposals,'' Ventura said. ``With all I've had to do in Minnesota,
I haven't had time to focus on federal tax cuts. I don't want to
make any judgments based on two speeches.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used part of his speech to urge the governors to do more
to provide medical coverage for children from low-income families.
He said that about 10 million children had no health insurance and,
noting that states would get extra money from settlements in
tobacco cases, said it ``can be used for preventing youth smoking
but also for expanding health insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had put the governors on notice that Clinton
would press the issue, but some Republican governors said they did
not understand why. Since the Children's Health Insurance Program
began in 1997, giving states billions of dollars and wide latitude
to implement programs, about 1.3 million children have been
enrolled. Clinton pressed them to do more, even though many states
have made significant strides in drawing more children into the
program in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's absolutely wrong,'' Thompson said of Clinton's
belief that the states are not doing enough. Gov. Jim Geringer of
Wyoming, another Republican, said it was pure ``chutzpah.''
</P>
<P>
   So why would Clinton tweak the governors on the issue? Thompson
said he did not know until he perused a chart showing how many
children the states have added to the program over the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it,'' he said, pointing to Texas, which was the only
state showing a drop in enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, one of a handful of governors who
was not attending the governors' meeting, is the leading Republican
presidential candidate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In New York, John Signor, a spokesman for the New York State
Department of Health, said the state had been a model for other
states in providing the new benefits to children. Federal officials
have agreed in the past, saying that indeed as many as 30 percent
of all children nationwide benefiting from the program are in New
York. That fact makes the national figures look better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dwarf any other state in terms of the number of kids we
have in the program or in the amount of state support that we give
to the program,'' Signor said. ``Under Governor Pataki's
leadership, this program has flourished and New York state is a
national leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Signor said that the state provides about $200 million for the
program compared with about $250 million from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   But New York has not done so well in another area on Clinton's
agenda, providing Medicaid benefits to poor people as they leave
the welfare rolls. The number of people in New York on Medicaid has
dropped 9 percent since Clinton signed the welfare law three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials have conceded that something is wrong,
and in January a federal district judge ruled that New York City
had improperly denied applications for Medicaid from needy
individuals on the grounds that they had failed to comply with the
work requirements of the city's welfare program.

HARRY LITWACK, 91, HALL OF FAME BASKETBALL COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry Litwack, the Hall of Fame basketball coach at Temple
University and a popular figure on the Philadelphia sports scene
for half a century, died Saturday at his home in Huntingdon Valley,
Pa. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Litwack had few high-profile players, but the coach known as
Chief produced perennial winners, stressing zone defenses taught
through the haze of his ever-present cigar smoke. Relying on
players recruited from the Philadelphia neighborhoods, Litwack had
a record of 373-193 from 1952 to 1973. His Temple teams had only
one losing season and made 13 postseason appearances, winning the
National Invitational Tournament in 1969 and twice going to the
Final Four of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Philadelphia from Poland at age 5, Harry Litwack
grew up in a home where only Yiddish was spoken, and his father, a
shoemaker, never understood basketball. But the game was a huge
attraction for immigrant youngsters. ``When I was a kid, every
phone pole had a peach basket on it,'' Litwack remembered, and
``every Jewish boy played basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Litwack starred at Southern High School in Philadelphia, then
played guard for Temple from 1927 to 1929, serving as co-captain
his last two seasons. During the 1930s, he played for the
Philadelphia Sphas, a powerful pro team spawned by the South
Philadelphia Hebrew Association and run by Eddie Gottlieb, another
renowned figure in Philadelphia basketball.
</P>
<P>
   While with the Sphas, Litwack served as the freshman coach and
assistant varsity coach at Temple. He developed a box-and-one zone
defense in the 1937-38 season that held Stanford's Hank Luisetti,
an all-American and pioneer of one-handed shooting, to 11 points in
Temple's 35-31 victory. That Temple team defeated Colorado and
Byron ``Whizzer'' White, the future U.S. Supreme Court justice, in
the first NIT championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Litwack served as an assistant to Gottlieb when he was the
owner-coach of the Philadelphia Warriors, in the early years of the
National Basketball Association, before being named Temple's head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   His 1955-56 team, led by a pair of star guards, the brilliant
ball-handler Guy Rodgers, a sophomore, and Hal Lear, a senior, went
23-3 in the regular season before losing to Iowa in the NCAA
tournament semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Litwack's 1957-58 squad, featuring Rodgers and guard Bill
``Pickles'' Kennedy, won the then-prestigious Holiday Festival
tournament at Madison Square Garden, went 24-2 in the regular
season and was ranked No. 5 nationally. But Temple lost by one
point to Kentucky, the eventual national champion, in the NCAA
tournament's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Litwack's 1968-69 team was the last squad selected for that
season's NIT, but won the tournament with an 89-76 victory over
Boston College in Bob Cousy's final game as coach of the Eagles,
snapping their 19-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something magical happened,'' Litwack said after being carried
around the Madison Square Garden court on Temple fans' shoulders.
``The boys all of a sudden came together and played above their
talent.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Litwack's last NIT team. He retired after the 1972-73
season and was elected to the Basketball Hall of Fame in
Springfield, Mass., in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Litwack is survived by his wife, Estelle; two daughters, Lois
Kieserman and Shelley Smoger, both of Huntingdon Valley; three
grandsons and two great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The nickname Chief was supposedly bestowed on Litwack by
Rodgers, later a star with the Warriors, who, after leaving a
huddle when the coach dispensed strategy one night, is said to have
remarked, ``OK, Chief.'' But Litwack's wife said he was called
Chief because that was what he had called people he did not know
when meeting them for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Litwack was known as a low-key recruiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Litwack didn't dazzle recruits with a fancy meal,''
recalled Bill Kelley, who played three seasons for Temple in the
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chief didn't promise his recruits anything _ not playing
time, playgirls, cars or money. They were offered only a solid
education and a chance, if they worked hard, to play in a
nationally respected basketball program.''
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, 1973, when Temple faced Villanova at Philadelphia's
Palestra, the public-address announcer told the crowd that it was
Litwack's last coaching appearance there. The fans roared, but
Litwack seemed oblivious to the tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I got fooled,`` he would recall. ``I didn't think I
was that popular.''

THE OLD BECOMES NEW AS BROWNS ARE REBORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The new owner was named Sept. 8, official ownership
began on Oct. 23, the head coach was selected in January, players
were selected primarily through a special pro draft in February and
then in the annual college draft in April, and renovations to the
team's practice facility and completion of the new stadium
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months of sweeping activity have brought this city and
region to this: a heart-thumping hello and joyous salute to the
return of the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   It is old, it is new. Familiar but reborn.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dallas Cowboys help bring the Browns back to the
National Football League after a three-year absence when the teams
play at Fawcett Stadium on Monday night in nearby Canton, in the
Hall of Fame preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Preseason games are not supposed to mean much. To most people
here, this one means everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure is a big night and a big deal,'' said Browns
linebacker John Thierry. ``And getting to play on Monday night
before America makes it bigger. On Monday night everybody is going
to be watching either football or WWF wrestling. I'll bet on
football.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excitement; that's what this will be,'' said Tim Couch, the
quarterback from Kentucky who was the first collegiate pick of the
new Browns and of the entire 1999 draft. ``When I come out of that
tunnel on Monday night and see that stadium, even though it won't
be Cleveland Stadium, and seeing the Cowboys, too, I'm going to be
thinking, `Hey, I'm in the NFL now.'''
</P>
<P>
   So, once again, is Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a teary journey for the Browns and their fans. The
old Browns played football here from 1946 through 1995. In November
1995, Art Modell, then the Browns' owner, announced that he was
moving the team to Baltimore. Modell's team became the Baltimore
Ravens the following year, but the Browns' name and their team
history remained here because the NFL decided that football would
return to Cleveland in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Al Lerner was selected as owner last year and Carmen Policy, the
former 49ers' president, was chosen by Lerner to become president
and chief executive officer. The two chose Chris Palmer, who had
been offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars, as head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   And then, said Policy, everyone jumped in and began building the
new Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only one from the new team in our offices for a
short time,'' Policy said. ``Back then, to be ready to play a
football game in 11 months seemed impossible. I found myself at
times concentrating on the end game. There were times I was
distracted and disappointed early on by the enormous task ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The last two NFL expansion teams _ Jacksonville and the Carolina
Panthers _ had two years to prepare for their first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I quickly stopped,'' said Policy, ``and realized that what we
had to do each day was take care of that day. We hired good people
and empowered and trusted them. And now here we are on the verge of
a very historic event for this organization, community and its
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be in the business of football, there is no
better place to be than in Cleveland. Football is an essence of
life here. The fans are informed. In San Francisco, I was a part of
five Super Bowl championship teams and the fans had an appreciation
of a winning franchise that radiated efficiency and class. Here,
the appreciation is deeper to the pure concept of football. The
49ers' winning tradition started in '81. The Browns started theirs
in '46.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly $700 million has been spent by Lerner in stadium costs,
player acquisition and facilities. His interest in and love for the
Browns span nearly four decades; he had been a team season ticket
holder for 37 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have ownership with a vision that is willing to do what it
takes to win championships,'' said Browns defensive lineman Jerry
Ball. ``Players here can focus on football. The security is
superior. Meals are served all day. We have a masseuse and barber
available. The practice facility is open 24 hours daily. We have a
travel agent available. There is an 800 number set up for players
or any member of their families to call for any problems. What more
does a player need? What we have to ensure is we don't get caught
up with only being happy that football is back in Cleveland. The
question is back doing what? Winning championships, that's the
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said: ``We won't use being an expansion team as a crutch.
The idea starting with Dallas is to improve each day and each
week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Browns, like all NFL teams, are a mix of veterans and
rookies throughout management, the coaching staff and players. None
here, however, have been this way before, starting something anew
that is old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect difficulties and for this to be a diligent process,''
said Browns rookie receiver Kevin Johnson from Syracuse, N.Y. ``But
we also expect a lot from each other. We'll take a business
approach on Monday night. And you can do that and have a good
time.''

EDITORIAL: THE NEW AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago California voters approved Proposition 209, a
retrograde measure that ended affirmative action programs in public
college admissions and in government hiring and contracts. The
rationale was that minorities should not be given any special
preferences but should instead compete on an equal footing with
others. But now a new lawsuit has made it clear how badly that
stacks the deck against outstanding minority students in
California. Worse yet, a renewed political drive against racial
preferences in California could make it virtually impossible even
to inform minorities of the opportunities available to them.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought against the state by the American Civil
Liberties Union, charges that students at black and Hispanic high
schools have little or no chance to take the challenging courses
that would help get them admitted to California's first-tier public
universities. The suit focuses on the advanced-placement courses
that are designed to give students exposure to college-level work
while still in high school. These courses end with an examination
administered by the College Board, which costs about $75 per
student. Many states view the exams as so important that they waive
the fees for the poorest students.
</P>
<P>
   The examinations are especially crucial in California, where the
elite universities figure the scores into the admissions formula.
As noted in the ACLU suit, black and Hispanic students often attend
schools where the courses are few or nonexistent or where no one
bothers to tell them that they can take the examinations at little
or no cost.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed on behalf of four black and Hispanic students
at Inglewood High School, which offers only three
advanced-placement courses. Inglewood is 97 percent black. Beverly
Hills High, which is 91 percent white, offers 14 advanced-placement
courses. Rasheda Daniel, a 17-year-old straight-A student at
Inglewood, said: ``I feel cheated. There are a lot of bright
students at my school who will work hard and succeed, if only they
had the A.P. courses to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the anti-affirmative action camp in California is
trying to twist the meaning of Proposition 209 to ban outreach and
recruitment efforts that merely encourage minorities and women to
compete for jobs, contracts and college slots. This pernicious
attack, if successful, would take away a crucial remaining tool to
remedy the lingering effects of racial and gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Legal cases challenging the constitutionality of outreach
programs are working their way through the California courts. Gov.
Gray Davis, who was an opponent of Proposition 209, recently vetoed
a bill passed by the California Legislature declaring that focused
outreach to underrepresented groups is legal. To the anger of civil
rights groups, he has also refused to revoke a policy, initiated by
former Gov. Pete Wilson, that ended state data collection on
whether minority contractors are getting any share of the billions
of dollars of government contracts that are given annually. Without
good data, the state cannot know whether its agencies are
discriminating against minority and women-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to outreach programs is an ominous sign of where
the race debate is headed. Until now, opponents of affirmative
action have tended to attack quotas and set-asides, not outreach
efforts. Efforts such as community campaigns to increase awareness
of college or job opportunities do not give minorities any
advantage in the final selection process or in any way lower
objective standards. They only aim to broaden the applicant pools.
</P>
<P>
   Davis apparently believes that diversity in the workplace and on
college campuses can be achieved solely through outreach programs
based on nonracial characteristics like economic status or
geographic residence. But the legacy of racial discrimination is
not fully accounted for by measuring qualities like economic
status. The anti-affirmative action forces sold their position to
California voters as simple fairness for all. But the attack on
outreach programs looks like an attempt to deny minorities and
women the very information they need to compete fairly.

CIVIL RIGHTS GROUP TO OFFER REGULAR EVALUATIONS OF PRESIDENTIAL
CANDIDATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   By LORI RODRIGUEZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The head of the National Urban League, Hugh B. Price,
said Sunday that the civil rights group will grade all presidential
candidates on issues ranging from education to economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made in Houston during the opening of the
league's 89th annual conference.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a dais he shared with Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the front-runner for the Republican Party nomination, Price said
the league will launch a regularly printed scorecard this fall
called ``Opportunity Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The new publication will monitor all policy pronouncements,
position papers, press conferences and debates involving the major
presidential candidates, Price said. The league, whose social
service programs reach more than 2 million people nationally, will
then distribute the results through its 115 affiliates, corporate
partners and sister civil rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Through the November, 2000 election, the scorecard will also be
regularly distributed to the news media and printed on the league's
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign season, we should judge the candidates for
president, and for every other elective office, by how genuine they
are about closing the opportunity gap,'' Price told an estimated
2,000 conferees at the opening session in the George R. Brown
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Price outlined what he called the league's ``Ten
Opportunity Commandments for the 21st Century,'' a far-reaching
list of goals that include offering affordable health care to all
Americans who need it, expanding effective public school programs
and promoting economic growth in poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll rate how committed they are,'' said Price of the
candidates. ``Instead of the stars they use for movies, we'll use
our equal opportunity logo to rate the candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're really serious and actually endorse our plan or
come up with a better idea, they'll get five equality signs. If
they mention our `commandments' on the campaign trail, perhaps
they'll earn a two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they're silent or shuckin' or jivin', they get a big
zero, with no equality sign inside it.''
</P>
<P>
   While the more than 5,000 people expected to attend the four-day
conference will be offered a job fair featuring more than 120 top
corporations, an art exhibit and workshops on a variety of social
topics, politics is high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III, the son of the late civil rights leader
who now serves as president of the Southern Leadership Conference,
was on hand Sunday for Price's keynote address. So was Kweisi
Mfume, president of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Mfume is scheduled to join the Rev. Jesse Jackson, president of
the Rainbow-PUSH Coalition in a session this afternoon on political
power in the next millennium
</P>
<P>
   Vice-president Al Gore, the front-running candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomination, today is scheduled to deliver a
luncheon speech. And Bill Bradley, the former U.S. senator from New
Jersey, who also is vying for the Democratic presidential
nomination and has made closing the racial divide a campaign
mantra, is scheduled to address the conference Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must register and vote in the year 2000 election as though
our future depends on it,'' Price told his cheering audience.
``Make no mistake, it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston was deliberately selected as the 1999 conference site,
Price said, because voters here bucked a national tide of
anti-affirmative action sentiment. The city also has managed to
maintain generally harmonious relations between its diverse groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simpatico with what the Houston leadership is trying to
do,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   In the November, 1997, election, a multi-ethnic coalition of
African-American, white and Latino voters joined forces with
downtown business interests to reject a petition-driven initiative
that would have ended the city's affirmative action contracting
programs. Voters also elected the city's first African-American
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is the ideal site for the last league conference of
the 20th century. For starters, Houston is Mayor Lee Brown's
town,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston is a beacon of inclusion and hope. Business leaders
like Phil Carroll, former CEO of Shell Oil and a trustee of the
league, civic leaders like former Mayor Bob Lanier and community
leaders like Sylvia Brooks, head of the league here, banded
together to beat back an assault on affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, however, who is serving as honorary chair of the
conference, told the conferees that neither they, nor Houstonians,
could ``afford to rest on our laurels. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is not done when a black man is dragged to his death
behind a pick-up truck,'' said Brown, referring to the infamous
killing of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas. ``All of us are forced to
confront the 21st century with the fierce determination that hate
crimes will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who headed the police departments in Houston, Atlanta and
New York City, will participate in a conference session Wednesday
morning entitled ``The Police and People of Color: Can't we all
just get along?''
</P>
<P>
   The panel will include the Rev. Al Sharpton, president of the
National Action Network, and prominent defense attorney Johnnie L.
Cochran, who successfully represented O.J. Simpson in his
celebrated murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   All conference events are open to the public. &QL;

<P>
   EAST BURKE, Vt. _ ``American Pie,'' the gross-out teen-age sex
comedy, may be one of the summer's blockbuster hits, but it bombed
at movie camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another movie that's nothing like high school,''
said Dan O'Reilly, 16, dismissing the crude bathroom jokes, the
drinking parties and the obsession of a group of high school senior
boys with losing their virginity. (Dan, and the other teen-agers at
the camp who are under 17, were accompanied to the R-rated
``American Pie'' by adult chaperones.)
</P>
<P>
   Justin Stronk, 17, said he felt insulted by the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another typical teen-age movie that doesn't apply to
teen-agers,'' he said. ``It's what a bunch of adults in Hollywood
think about teen-agers. It's like they think teen-agers' deepest
feelings are about alcohol and sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Sorrentino, 16, delivered what she and the other
teen-age screenwriters, producers, directors and actors at movie
camp consider to be the worst possible judgment: ``American Pie,''
she said, was ``so cliched.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the discussion, Jay Craven, the Vermont film maker
who is the founding director of the Fledgling Films Summer
Institute, a nonprofit camp based here in northern Vermont, said he
was delighted. One of the reasons he started the camp, he said, was
to help teen-agers become analytical and critical moviegoers.
</P>
<P>
   Craven, who has spent many years teaching film throughout
Vermont, has produced and directed several independent films,
including ``Where the Rivers Flow North,'' with Rip Torn, Treat
Williams and Michael J. Fox, in 1994, and last year's ``A Stranger
in the Kingdom,'' which starred Martin Sheen, Carrie Snodgrass and
Bill Raymond, and packed movie houses, church basements and school
auditoriums across the state. His summer institute, which ended
this year's session last week, is supported by state arts grants
and private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont teen-agers at the camp, most attending on
scholarships, made 10 short films in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Their movies explored, among other themes, a grandfather's
waning interest in church, the relationship between boys and guns,
the relative merits of New York versus Vermont, teen-age
homelessness and the insidiousness of plastic surgery as
demonstrated by one teen-age boy's determination to turn his
girlfriend into a perfect, if artificially enhanced, beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the market potential,'' Craven said. ``It's
about kids' own voices. They don't really want to imitate
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Jay Bartrum, 16, wrote and directed ``Eat the Moon''
about a young author battling writer's block who holes up in the
country with his typewriter and is visited by Optimis, Pessimus and
Cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on me,'' Bartrum said. When he gets stuck, he
added, ``I just sit there and type `writer's block' over and
over.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Bartrum and the other young film makers were not staying up
till midnight shooting their own movies, they were watching others'
films. They requested multiple replays of ``Rushmore,'' last year's
quirky coming-of-age movie about an eccentric, iconoclastic
teen-age boy who gets kicked out of private school.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A few of them drove two and a half hours to Montreal to see
``The Blair Witch Project,'' a low-budget film about three film
makers who go into the woods to shoot a documentary about a witch
and are never heard from again. The movie has become a monumental
hit among teen-agers. The young film makers said they liked it
because it did not rely on gratuitous scary effects.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the institute are devotees of the film director Stanley
Kubrick, and they made a trip to Montpelier to see the last film
Kubrick made before he died, ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my favorite Stanley Kubrick movie,'' said Bartrum, who
hopes to become a film director himself someday. ``It was subtly
creepy all the way through. The plot was unimportant. The mood was
so much more intense.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gabe Calvi, 16, did find something to criticize in the
master. ``A lot of the sex was out of place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tyburski, 15, quickly became known at the institute for
his worship of Quentin Tarantino, who became a celebrity after
directing ``Pulp Fiction'' and is known for his stylized violence.
``Here's a quote'' from Tarantino, the teen-ager said: `` `We're
going to sell you the seat, but you're only going to use the edge
of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   By the second week of the institute, Melissa Edwards, 16, had
made up her mind. Her group had just wrapped ``Losing Sight,'' a
seven-minute film in which she plays the granddaughter of a man who
is not sure he wants to continue attending church.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my life,'' Ms. Edwards, the daughter of a dairy
farmer, said to Craven. ``I want to be an actress. What's the next
step?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step,'' Craven told her, ``is to go back to high
school.''

AFTER DEAL, CLIPPES ARE MOVING ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the Los Angeles Clippers' crowded rear-view
mirror, we now see Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was one of only three players the Clippers wanted to keep
(Eric Piatkowski and Tyrone Nesby are the others) from their
eight-man free agent class. But he now rides with the Atlanta
Hawks, who picked up Wright for seven years and $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's over and now we move forward,'' said Elgin Baylor, the
Clippers' vice president of basketball operations, after completing
a sign-and-trade deal Sunday that delivered Wright to the Hawks in
exchange for two first-round picks. ``There are other things to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   One order of business is locating and acquiring someone who can
portray a backup center/power forward. But don't dismiss
second-year strongman Brian Skinner, who has turned in an
impressive summer audition for the gig of part-time enforcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Skinner) has better offensive skills than
Lorenzen,'' Baylor said, ``and he's going to be a terrific
rebounder.''
</P>
<P>
   And, more important, Skinner seems satisfied with being a
crucial member of the supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   That was the role Wright felt he was doomed to play in the
Clippers production, thanks to the presence of Michael Olowokandi
and Maurice Taylor. (A spokesman from Team Wright said Wright might
start at power forward for the Hawks, although sources in Atlanta
indicate he has more value as a stunt double for Dikembe Mutombo
and Alan Henderson.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to get someone to be our backup center,'' Baylor
said, ``but it's not an easy chore.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Clippers wanted to keep Wright, their choice with
the seventh pick in the 1997 NBA draft. But when Wright and his
agent, Robert Fayne, turned down the team's contract-extension
offer of six years and $30 million, Baylor was obliged to consider
the best sign-and-trade deal Wright could attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this deal is in the best interest of both parties,''
Fayne said, referring to Wright and the Clippers. ``Lorenzen Wright
was able to go to a team that presents an immediate opportunity to
compete for an NBA championship. And he goes to a team that was
prepared to compensate him on a level that's commensurate with his
market value.''
</P>
<P>
   So Fayne either mistakenly thinks he just worked a deal to send
his client to San Antonio or is confident that Atlanta's recent
housecleaning _ Mookie Blaylock and Steve Smith out, Isaiah Rider,
Jim Jackson and rookie point guard Jason Terry in _ will produce
quick glory.
</P>
<P>
   Fayne's alternative was threatening to walk Wright down the
Staples Center hallway to the Lakers, who only had a $2 million,
middle-class exception to offer. This Fayne tactic seemed to
inspire the Hawks to new heights of creativity, after they backed
away from last week's proposed deal that would have produced Wright
and moved the newly acquired Jackson to the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we did this to keep Lorenzen from the Lakers,''
Baylor said, ``but that's not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it, Baylor said, because landing two first-round picks
instead of players they didn't want is a more logical way to move
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us some flexibility,'' Baylor said in reference to
now holding the Hawks' No. 1 pick for the 2000 draft, and a
lottery-protected pick that began in Portland, moved to Toronto,
visited Philadelphia and landed in Atlanta. The Raptors will retain
the pick until they qualify for the playoffs. ``We may not get
anything great with the picks, but at least we have a say in who
they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not just going to take players,'' he added. ``It
wouldn't be fair to a coach to bring in players he may not like,
and it's not fair to the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers' free-agent roll call includes Murray (Cavs),
Wright (Hawks), Rodney Rogers (Suns), Darrick Martin (Kings),
Piatkowski (re-signed), Nesby (Clips will match any offer), Sherman
Douglas (lukewarm interest back East) and Stojko Vrankovic (he
represents $4 million in cap relief).
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Martin, as the Clippers expected and welcomed, left
without compensation.

ADVERTISING: THE GREEN GIANT WALKS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change Monday to Tuesday in 3rd and 25th grafs. No other
changes.)  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's Christmas in August for fans of advertising icons as the
character most associated with ``Ho! Ho! Ho!'' next to Santa Claus
makes a comeback meant to be, well, giant.
</P>
<P>
   The character is of course the Jolly Green Giant, who has for
decades symbolized the Green Giant brand of canned and frozen
vegetables. The character ranked third in a recent list compiled by
the trade publication Advertising Age of the century's top 10 ad
icons, behind only the Marlboro Man and Ronald McDonald, but since
the early 1990s the giant had been relegated to a supporting role
in marketing efforts for Green Giant, now owned by the Pillsbury
Co. unit of Diegeo PLC.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference scheduled for Tuesday in Minneapolis, where
Pillsbury is based, executives will outline plans to capitalize on
the resurgent popularity of familiar ad characters with an
ambitious campaign by Leo Burnett USA in Chicago intended to _ yes,
all together now _ wake the sleeping giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to bring him back in a much bigger way,'' Heidi
Thom, vice president for the frozen foods category at Pillsbury,
said in a telephone interview last week as she offered a preview of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's probably even more relevant than before,'' she added,
``with the emphasis on the importance of eating vegetables for
adults as well as for children.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign returns the giant front and center, presenting him
as a hero in an initial batch of 14 print advertisements with a
retro-chic look that are intended to resemble posters. Gone are
secondary characters like the Little Green Sprout and the residents
of the imaginary land known as the ``Valley of the Jolly Green
Giant.'' They were added when the giant came to television
commercials to address viewer anxieties about a spokes-character
large enough to crush the produce _ and the farmers harvesting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became too complicated and overthought,'' said Gerry
Miller, executive vice president and senior creative director at
Burnett USA, part of Leo Burnett Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you `left brain' something that's a right-brain creation,
you get into all sorts of trouble,'' he added. ``Green Giant didn't
feel like a big, powerful brand anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is also infused with a wry humor not typically
found in pitches for broccoli florets and Brussels sprouts. The ads
carry headlines like ``Give peas a chance,'' ``Can I pick 'em or
what?'' and ``I never met a vegetable I didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a twist to make him more friendly,'' Ms.
Thom said. ``And it shows we don't take ourselves too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no coincidence that the campaign emanates from the same
creative group at Burnett that works on the striking series of
tongue-in-cheek magazine ads for Altoids mints, which have won
awards for the irreverent way they portray a venerable consumer
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to figure out how such brands interact today with
consumers and their needs,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best advice I ever had in advertising was from the actor
James Stewart, which was to make the audience your partner,'' he
added. ``It's letting them in on it, not just imparting information
but engendering a smile, not just a sell but allowing them to
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant is emblematic of the longtime brand figures that were
once Madison Avenue mainstays but began to lose their appeal in the
1970s and 1980s as consumers deemed them outdated or _ particularly
apt here _ corny. Those figures, often called critters, have been
specialties of Burnett, which also created the giggling Doughboy
for Pillsbury baked goods and the roaring Tony the Tiger for
Kellogg's Frosted Flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Why are characters like the giant; Charlie the Star-Kist tuna,
another Burnett critter; Peanut, and Buddy Lee, the doll
representing Lee jeans, back in vogue?
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand equities are so deeply ingrained,'' said Chris
Mistretta, business team leader for Green Giant frozen foods at
Pillsbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talked to consumers about him, we got such raging
positive results,'' she added. ``They break into the `up in the
valley' song and the `Ho! Ho! Ho!'''
</P>
<P>
   Miller agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These characters resonate in memory and are therefore some ore
hidden away that you can mine again,'' he said, adding: ``They're
big, visual symbols. And when you live in an age where pictures are
fast and words are slow, they allow you to write a brand's
signature quickly _ and in a proprietary way if they're part of
your heritage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The giant's heritage is intertwined with the histories of both
agency and client. The character was born in 1925 as a grumpy giant
in a scruffy bearskin, borrowed by Minnesota Valley Canning Co.
from a book of Grimm's Fairy Tales. In 1928 or 1931 _ the date
varies _ Leo Burnett himself transformed the character into a
friendly representation of nature's bounty by clothing him in a
leafy green suit and replacing his scowl with a smile as wide as a
cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   When Burnett left Erwin, Wasey &AMP; Co. in 1935 to open his own
agency, Minnesota Valley Canning became one of his first three
clients _ and even renamed itself in 1950 after its adman's
brainchild. Burnett later made the giant ``jolly'' by inserting the
word into an ad before it ran in The Ladies' Home Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burnett got into the giant in a big way, like he had met his
soul mate,'' Miller said. ``He understood the power of these
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Pillsbury plans to spend more than $20 million on the campaign,
which like the Altoids campaign includes ads that are tailored for
specific publications. For example, an ad to run in the ``Best and
Worst Dressed'' issue of People magazine will carry the headline
``When you dress like this you'd better eat your vegetables,'' and
an ad to run in The National Enquirer will carry the headline
``I've been digging up dirt for years.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be promotions, Ms. Thom said, like a cookbook
offer and the placing of 4- and 8-foot-tall plush and inflatable
versions of the giant in the aisles of supermarkets nationwide. In
addition, Pillsbury is considering TV spots and outdoor posters.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference Tuesday will start a yearlong celebration by
Pillsbury of the giant's 75th anniversary. When the character first
appeared in 1925, he promoted a variety of oversized peas that
Minnesota Valley Canning dubbed ``green giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho-ho-ho-ly hyperbole!

<P>
   John Elway, his hands washed of having anything to do with
running an L.A. pro football team, will scramble through cyberspace
in his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The former Denver Broncos quarterback announced last week that
he has a 50 percent stake in a new Web site that'll be known as
MVP.com, which focuses on health information, nutrition planning
and financial investing.
</P>
<P>
   The site, expected to launch in January around the Super Bowl,
might also have a public stock offering. A Denver Post unnamed
source said Elway and co-founder JWGenesis Financial Corp. ``want
to be the most influential site on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, golfer Greg Norman has also broken out with his new
site (!bold!www.shark.com), another business venture that deals
with travel, health, nutrition and fashion.

   __ An Internet bulletin board that posted the place and site of
a planned soccer hooligan clash proved to be accurate as the
English soccer season opened Saturday with violence between fans of
Cardiff City and Millwall in Wales. The brawl left 14 injured six
arrested, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the National Criminal Intelligence Service in
Wales reported that arrests for soccer hooliganism was up for the
first time in six years as fans were becoming more organized
through the Internet.

AT URBAN LEAGUE CONVENTION, BUSH OFFERS A GLIMPSE AT HIS AGENDA AS
CRITICS ASSAIL HIS RECORD
<TEXT>

</P>

   &QL; 
HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush touted the compassion but not the
conservatism Sunday in a brief address to the National Urban
League's 89th annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is campaigning for the 2000 Republican presidential
nomination on a theme of ``compassionate conservatism,'' told the
predominantly African-American crowd of about 2,000 that the
organization's emphasis on children reflects his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   While omitting any of the references to conservatism that
usually pepper his speeches, Bush shared his proposals for
bolstering the efforts of faith-based organizations with new
government assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lessons of the last 30 years is that we've learned
government can hand out money, but what it cannot do is put hope in
our hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's appearance at the conference comes on the heels of
criticism from some quarters regarding his decisions on whether to
attend similar events across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While his campaign cited scheduling conflicts and the high
volume of speaking invitations he receives, Bush nevertheless has
been criticized in recent months for rejecting overtures from at
least four other minority conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But a spotty record on conference attendance was perhaps the
least of Bush's problems among the Urban League attendees in the
George R. Brown Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he praised the purpose and agenda of the venerable civil
rights organization, Bush was being assailed for his stance on hate
crimes legislation by two of the state's leading black lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, issued a statement
before Bush's speech that said, ``There is a big difference between
talking about compassion and acting with compassion. We as a nation
cannot afford leaders who remain silent as victims are killed or
injured solely because of their differences.'' Jackson Lee later
sat a few seats from Bush on the convention dais.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, similarly criticized Bush
for failing to move Ellis' hate crimes bill through the Legislature
this year. Although the measure passed in the House, it failed to
muster a vote in a Senate committee and Bush rejected overtures
from the White House and other Democratic politicians across the
country to accept the bill that would strengthen the penalties for
crimes committed out of bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who left the Urban League event without speaking to
reporters, declined during the session to take a position on the
hate crimes legislation and later was blamed by its supporters for
letting it die. Bush has said he opposes efforts to legislate
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that this is not a priority for Governor Bush,''
Ellis said. ``However, it is a priority for the African-American
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed unaware of the renewed criticism, even greeting
Ellis from the podium before launching his remarks highlighting
education and his plan that involves ``changing minds by changing
hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a sharp contrast to the enthusiastic, mostly Republican
crowds that have greeted Bush at various stops in his campaign, the
less-than capacity crowd at the convention center showed only a
muted response to his overtures.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush veered momentarily from the relentless
optimism of his campaign and painted a grim picture of the
underside of American life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money can buy things, but it can't buy some of the most needed
things in family life, such as justice and family love,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many are saying the dream is not for me, too many in the
great land of America feel that way,'' Bush said. ``Children
abandoned by their fathers, children captured by addiction and
condemned to schools that do not teach and will not change, young
mothers without self-respect or education, or the supporting love
of a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   His warmest response came from from his exhortations on
education, and declarations regarding the imperative that children
learn to read at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Educating children and equal opportunity and compassion for
the poor and suffering, these are the goals that cut across all
barriers of race and political parties,'' Bush said. ``They are not
partisan goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he is actively campaigning, Bush did not directly
mention his political activities in his speech or ask for the
delegates' support in his contest.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the governor joked to National Urban League President
Hugh B. Price that the title of ``Mr. President'' had ``kind of a
nice ring to it.''
</P>
<P>
   To his second standing ovation from delegates that fell far
short of unanimous, Bush said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what the future is going to hold, but hopefully I
will be meeting with you in the future.''

LOS ANGELES COUNTY OFFICIALS ALARMED BY DEATHS OF 10 CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At least 10 abused and neglected children in the
care of Los Angeles County have died in the past two months,
alarming officials long concerned about the failings of the child
welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past few weeks have been horrible,'' said Victor
Greenberg, who probes such deaths in his role as the inspector
general of county children's services.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg looks into deaths of children under the supervision of
the county Department of Children and Family Services when abuse or
neglect is suspected, or those whose family had some contact with
the department because of allegations of child abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent surge in deaths, officials and critics
outside the county were calling for dramatic improvements to
safeguard the well-being of children in the county's child welfare
system - the nation's largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess, definitely a mess,'' said Jacquelyn McCroskey,
associate professor of social work at the University of Southern
California who specializes in families and children and who is
familiar with the county DCFS.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dysfunctional child welfare system demands attention,''
Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich said. ``It's on fire. And we have
to put out the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky: ``The problems are throughout
the system. It is a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Board of Supervisors created his position three years
ago, Greenberg said he investigated 19 deaths in 1997 and 25 deaths
in 1998. He looks for flaws in the system and recommends changes.
</P>
<P>
   He still hasn't had a chance to probe the recent deaths and draw
conclusions about where things went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say if we have something brewing here or a
statistical anomaly,'' he said. ``I'm going to see if I can spot
any trends in these recent deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   About 67,500 abused and neglected children depend on the county
agency for safety and security - more than any other child welfare
agency in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Though he looks at cases where things went wrong, Greenberg is
not a harsh critic of the county's child welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering the sheer number of kids in the system, the
department does a pretty good job of keeping kids safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Department social workers make roughly 150,000 decisions a year
on whether to remove children from their homes for their own safety
and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the most recent available annual figures, the county's
record has not been unusual compared to other U.S. urban centers
and to the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   According to Los Angeles County's Inter-Agency Council on Child
Abuse and Neglect, in 1997 the county had 15 homicides of children
whose families had a current or prior record of referral to child
protective services. That was one-third of the 45 child homicides
by parents, family members or caretakers reported in the county
during that year.
</P>
<P>
   That figure was below the national average of 41 percent
reported by the National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse,
according to ICAN, the official county agent to coordinate
development of services for the prevention, identification and
treatment of child abuse and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City for the same year, there were 30 homicides of
children whose families were known to the city's Administration for
Children's Services out of a total of 74 fatalities reported, or
40.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Cook County, Ill., which includes the city of Chicago, in
1997 there were 47 abuse- or neglect-related child deaths,
officials say. ``Usually about a third'' of such deaths involve
families that had prior contact with the Illinois Department of
Children and Family Services, said Diane Moncher, who gathers child
death statistics for the department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County supervisors and child welfare experts say the
county's department, with a $1 billion budget, fails too often in
its responsibilities to protect children who are at risk and also
fails to help them grow up with the stability and long-term
nurturing they need.
</P>
<P>
   Too many foster children end up in jail or on the streets as
they get older - meaning both they and society pay a cost because
the system didn't work, the department's critics say.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky and Antonovich say the crisis is particularly acute
in the foster care program, in which several children have died in
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   The department at the end of June stopped referring children to
foster homes through a placement agency it had been using, Grace
Homes for Waiting Children. The decision followed an investigation
into allegations that a foster mother certified by Grace Homes
killed a 3-year-old child in her care; that a 4{-month-old infant
died in an accident while in the care of a Grace Homes-certified
foster home; that children were sexually molested by their father
during monitored visits at a Grace Homes office; and that two
separate sets of certified foster parents physically abused
children in their care.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Homes, which has four regional offices within Los Angeles
County, had placed 181 children in 85 certified foster homes on
behalf of the county.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Grace Homes did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department has to place the safety and security of the
child first,'' Antonovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Watson, executive director of the county's Children's
Planning Council, has a partial solution: ``The department needs to
encourage the development of more `Cadillac' foster care homes,''
she said, referring to nonprofit institutions that raise extra
money on their own to boost the quality of their facilities and
services.
</P>
<P>
   McCroskey said the department needs to make sure regularly that
children removed from their homes are in fact better off.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, we've lost the focus on what would help'' the
children and their families, McCroskey said. ``We're over-focused
on removing the kids (from their homes) and not focused enough on
tracking the effectiveness of foster care and residential
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 10,000 children in foster homes that are on
an adoption track. There were 1,792 adoptions of DCFS children
between July 1, 1998, to June 30 of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been extremely difficult for the department to figure
what each of those cases needs and to move forward,'' McCroskey
said. ``They're sitting in limbo rather than being processed.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four new adoptions social workers just came on board in
recent days, and 25 more are in training.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent departure of Peter Digre after eight years as
director of the mammoth department, county officials say the time
is ripe for changes.
</P>
<P>
   Several deaths of children in foster care sparked a July 6 vote
by the Board of Supervisors to create a blue-ribbon panel that will
review the current system of monitoring foster homes, develop a
system of tracking complaints at foster homes, and make
recommendations for improvement by November.
</P>
<P>
   The new 13-person committee, which will hold its first meeting
Thursday, includes representatives of the county Probation
Department, DCFS, Department of Mental Health, private agencies and
community organizations.

LONDON IS LOGGING ON TO CYBERCAFES  
 ORACLE'S CHAIRMAN BACKS ONLINE VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Bylines follow individual items.) 
(lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intently pecking away at a keyboard, Jon Woolfson tried to
screen out more than 400 other Internet surfers who packed
Easyeverything, the new super-cybercafe in London's Victoria
district that looks more like a scene from Star Trek than anything
from this galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the cybercafe may be a phenomenon whose
time passed without ever quite arriving. But the cybercafe is alive
and thriving in Britain, and elsewhere in Europe, where home use of
personal computers tends to be lower and the telephone rates for
dial-up modems are typically higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to ask me if this place is a success,'' said
Woolfson, who is 26 and goes to Easyeverything three to four times
a week.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 o'clock one evening last week, a line had formed out the
door and down the street as some five dozen people waited in line
for turns at one of the 400 terminals with high-resolution,
flat-panel screens.
</P>
<P>
   Easyeverything, which opened its first branch on June 21, plans
to open four even bigger cybercafes in central London by the end of
the year, bringing its total number of computer terminals to 5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is the brainchild of Stelios Haji-Ioannou, the
32-year-old founder and chief executive of Easyjet, a low-cost
airline in Europe that has successfully mimicked the no-frills
approach of Southwest Airlines in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His new venture is a bit like Easyjet. The service is
considerably cheaper than its competitors, charging 1 pound ($1.61)
an hour for Internet access, compared with five or six times that
price at smaller cybercafes in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most cybercafes are run by nerds for nerds,'' Haji-Ioannou
said. ``The only way for me to bring down the price was to do it
for the masses. The secret is the scale.''

   Oracle's Chairman Backs Online Venture
</P>
<P>
   With an investment of a few million dollars in the start-up
company Netledger, Lawrence Ellison is putting his money where his
mouth is _ and he has plenty of both, it could be argued.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison is worth $12 billion, as a founder, chairman and largest
shareholder in Oracle Corp., a leading database software maker. And
he has been an outspoken advocate of Web-based services as
representing the future of software _ the antithesis of Microsoft
Corp.'s program-on-every-desktop, PC-centric model of computing.
</P>
<P>
   Netledger, of Menlo Park, Calif., is hoping to convert the
market for accounting software used by small businesses into a Web
service. Netledger plans to charge small businesses a base fee of
$4.95 a month for the service, which will hold all their accounts
receivable, payable and general ledger records. They will tap into
the Netledger Web site, which is powered by Oracle's database
software, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be the Yahoo of accounting software and a beacon for
other companies _ to not build software for Windows but for the
Web,'' Ellison explained. He added that Netledger was focusing on a
market that Oracle had no intention of entering.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison is also betting on a former colleague, Evan Goldberg,
the 33-year-old president of Netledger, who is a former Oracle vice
president. In small-business accounting software, Netledger is
taking on a rival with a Microsoft-size market share: Intuit Inc.
and its Quickbooks product. ``It's a Quickbooks market out there _
no question about it,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's Quickbooks line, like so many PC products, is
increasingly adding Web features. But Netledger believes that its
``pure Internet'' model will prove an advantage over Intuit's PC
legacy.

CONE ENJOYS A DAY IN THE SUNSHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ David Cone had grown tired of hearing how he had not
won since pitching a perfect game on July 18, and he put that to
rest Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Cone struck out nine in six innings and the New York Yankees
pounded the Seattle Mariners, 9-3. The Yankees, who swept the
four-game series with Seattle, are playing well and efficiently,
far crisper in their defense. The Yankees have permitted just one
unearned run in their last 15 games. They have 60 home runs in
their last 43 games, including a three-run home run on Sunday from
Scott Brosius, who drove in five runs. Bernie Williams is hitting
.533 with runners in scoring position since the All-Star Game
break.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, with 68 victories and 42 losses and the best
winning percentage (.618) in baseball, begin a three-game series at
Oakland on Monday. The Athletics are 9-1 on their current
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really sharp, and I was really happy with that,''
Manager Joe Torre said of Cone, who improved his record to 11-6.
</P>
<P>
   For all of its aesthetic qualities, Safeco Field is proving to
be a tough place to play in day games. When the game began at 1:38
p.m., the sun shone directly in the eyes of left fielders and
center fielders.
</P>
<P>
   The infielders struggled to see the ball because of the height
of the field relative to the stands. The first rows of seats are
set low on the playing level, and on a beautiful and warm day, the
infielders must discern the ground balls against the background of
fans wearing bright T-shirts. The infield dirt is brightened, Luis
Sojo said, and sometimes it is hard to see the baseball off the bat
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   When Derek Jeter fielded Alex Rodriguez's bouncer leading off
the second inning, he reacted somewhat awkwardly, as if his
reflexes were slow, but he made the throw to first for the out.
Then Jeter turned to Brosius, the third baseman, and yelled that he
could not see the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But hitters might have the most distinct disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   Some have complained about the light-colored signs that intrude
on the background against which the pitcher is set. One Mariner
recently faced a pitcher with a good curveball and found himself
trying to guess the trajectory of the pitch, as well as the type,
and, predictably, struck out.
</P>
<P>
   When the retractable roof is drawn back and the winds blow in a
westerly direction, as they did during this entire four-game
series, every fly ball must fight through the breeze to clear the
wall. Ken Griffey Jr. slammed a high drive off Cone in the first
inning, and Griffey posed momentarily, conditioned by the many
years of hitting balls like this and seeing them soar deep into the
stands at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey's drive hung in the air, quickly losing all of its
momentum, like a malfunctioning rocket, before falling into the
glove of Williams in center field. This must have heartened Cone,
seeing that his margin for error was far greater in this park.
</P>
<P>
   His own stuff made him formidable: Cone had a tremendous slider
on Sunday, a pitch he threw time and again to right-handed batters.
He walked Edgar Martinez and Jay Buhner in succession in the second
inning, but did not allow any runs. In the first three innings, he
did not allow any hits.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the third, Rodriguez slapped a bounder at
Brosius, who reacted slowly, as Jeter did, and the ball thumped off
his glove and chest. By the time Brosius grabbed the ball and
heaved it toward first, Rodriguez was across the bag. The official
scorer, Terry Mosher, ruled it a hit.
</P>
<P>
   That decision began looming large as Cone began a string of
strikeouts: Martinez on a fastball, Buhner on three sliders, Raul
Ibanez on a breaking ball, and Cone kept going, striking out six
straight batters, before David Bell popped out in the sixth inning.
As the seventh inning began, Seattle had just one hit _ Rodriguez's
grounder that hit Brosius in the glove.
</P>
<P>
   Using a home run from Chad Curtis and three consecutive walks in
the top of the seventh, the Yankees scored four runs to take a 7-0
lead, in a long inning. Rodriguez smacked a single leading off the
bottom of the seventh _ Seattle's first clean hit _ and after
Rodriguez stole second and Martinez singled, Cone was relieved. He
allowed just three hits.

COMMENTARY: GIVING MORE, GETTING LESS IN TAX GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton has stopped listening long
enough to address one of New York state's most expensive problems:
the federal government. In a typical year, it collects $15 billion
more in taxes from New Yorkers than it sends back to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sure ought to get more than we're getting now,'' Mrs.
Clinton said in Jamestown last week, adopting a liberal
interpretation of the word ``we.'' Strictly speaking, she is a
resident of Arkansas, which gets more back from Washington than it
pays in taxes. But as a prospective New Yorker, she vowed to
redress the imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were I in the Senate,'' she said, ``I would try to create a
coalition of the big states to stand up for our interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, though, was not interested in working with a
coalition in Congress that is already standing up for New Yorkers'
financial interests. It is called the Republican Party. The nearly
$800 billion in tax cuts just passed by the Republicans can be
criticized on many grounds _ as giveaways to the rich, as payoffs
for campaign contributions _ but there is no question that the cuts
would be a boon to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The New York metropolitan area would benefit more than any other
region because so many of New York City's residents and commuters
are in high tax brackets. The Commerce Department reports that
Connecticut has the highest per-capita income of any state,
$37,598; New Jersey ($33,937) is second and New York ($31,734) is
fourth (just behind Massachusetts, $32,797).
</P>
<P>
   Some local taxpayers are comfortably rich, but many are
struggling with an inequity in the system. Because the Internal
Revenue Service sets tax brackets without adjusting for local
variations in living costs, middle-class New Yorkers get stuck in
upper-class tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   A family in the New York metropolitan area making $100,000 per
year is no richer than a family in Little Rock making $40,000,
according to the cost-of-living index. But that New York family
typically pays some $15,000 to the IRS, while the Little Rock
family pays only $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   And then Congress redirects some of the New Yorkers' money to
farmers, defense contractors, bureaucrats and assorted
beneficiaries in other states. Studies by the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard and the office of Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan have shown that the New York region and the Midwest have
been the big losers in the redistribution of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two decades, the researchers found, New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut have together sent Washington $500 billion
more than they've gotten back; a similar combined deficit has been
incurred by Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's study found that Connecticut's annual tax deficit
was $2,272 per person, the highest in the country. New Jersey
ranked second with a per-capita deficit of $1,946, and New York
ranked ninth with a per-capita deficit of $785.
</P>
<P>
   Those deficits would be reduced if the Republicans' tax cuts
took effect, but most local Democrats oppose them _ even Moynihan,
who has so meticulously documented New York's tax deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that New York would get a larger share of the tax
cuts,'' Moynihan said, ``because we have more people in the higher
tax brackets. But I'm afraid the tax cuts would drive the federal
government back into deficit spending. If we can keep reducing the
national debt, the economy will be much better off, and that just
has to be good for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a plausible argument if you believe that the choice is
between a tax cut and debt reduction. But there are those, like
Martin Feldstein, the former chairman of the White House Council of
Economic Advisers, who argue that the choice is between cutting
taxes and spending the money on new programs.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has said that the Republican tax cuts would
``damage most New Yorkers'' because the money is needed to provide
new benefits for the elderly and aid for schools. But if the past
is any guide, the money would go disproportionately to people and
schools in other states. No matter what kind of big-state coalition
Mrs. Clinton creates, she will be outnumbered by the senators from
the many small states that profit from our tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that Mrs. Clinton possesses such
special skills at this game that she can throw our tax dollars into
the pot and come out even. Maybe she will even return from
Washington with a profit. And maybe then she can show New Yorkers
how to win at three-card monte.

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Iran's conservative mullahs have silenced the student protest
movement that surged through the streets of Tehran last month and
are now moving against its leaders with arrests and threats of long
imprisonment. By using the clerically controlled courts and police
to intimidate supporters of Iran's reform-minded president,
Mohammad Khatami, religious conservatives hope to strengthen their
own authority within Iran's divided power structure and undermine
reform candidates in parliamentary elections early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The mullahs should remember that Khatami and his allies speak
for tens of millions of Iranians impatient to see less oppressive,
more accountable government. That was the platform they voted for
when they overwhelmingly elected Khatami two years ago over a
candidate favored by the clerical establishment. That was also the
demand of last month's student protests, which drew broad public
support.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the pressures for change, Iran's economy is badly
hurting. Depressed international oil prices, skittish foreign
investors and years of economic mismanagement have brought hardship
to poor and middle-class Iranians and sharpened criticism of
clerical rule.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 students are still in jail as a result of the July
demonstrations. Officials have denounced four student leaders for
counterrevolutionary activities and collaboration with Israel and
the United States. Those charges could carry a death penalty. Three
of the four have been shown making televised confessions, almost
certainly under duress. Non-student activists have also been
seized, reform newspapers shut down and top editors arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Under Iran's constitution, President Khatami's power is limited.
The religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, holds supreme
authority. But if next year's parliamentary elections produce a
majority supporting reform, Khatami will exercise greater authority
over government ministries and have more scope to expand the rule
of law and revive the economy. If Ayatollah Khamenei is wise, he
will support such a course, recognizing that Iran's Islamic
republic must modernize to survive.
</P>
<P>
   But to keep this path to peaceful reform open, clerical leaders
must allow Iranians to choose freely and without fear in the coming
elections, informed by an unshackled press. With Iran's economy
sinking, its voters demanding reform and its young people clamoring
for increased personal freedom, inflexible clerical resistance to
change could provoke social and political upheaval.

EX-DODGER CEDENO CONSIDERED RETIRING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New YorkMets' acquisition of Roger Cedeno is
being hailed as the best offseason deal of the year, but it almost
didn't happen because the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the will out of
the outfielder to the point where he contemplated retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that's right. I talked to some people about it,'' Cedeno
said. ``It was hard last season. I had a lot of frustration. To be
honest with you, I felt like I wasn't going to be one of the
players that plays every day.''
</P>
<P>
   It was so bad that when Cedeno made mistakes, which happened
regularly, he was yelled at in the dugout by both teammates and
coaches. He had no confidence and his desire to play dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen with the Mets. When Cedeno threw behind a
runner earlier this season, allowing a player to advance a base,
there was silence upon his return to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who leads baseball with 57 stolen bases and is hitting
.314, went as far as to talk to San Diego's Carlos Hernandez and
Arizona's Omar Daal about retiring. Both were in the Dodgers'
organization with Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they even felt like that in their careers, and they
said my troubles were just part of the game,'' said Cedeno, 24, who
played four seasons in L.A. ``It was hard. I love baseball, I enjoy
baseball. I love being here (in New York), but the way I was
feeling, I felt I couldn't play. I would play winter ball and felt
like I couldn't hit, I felt like I couldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was going wrong, and that's when I thought about
(retiring).''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno is hesitant to rip the Dodgers, mostly, according to
teammates, because he doesn't think the current regime should be
blamed. He was traded to the Mets with Charles Johnson (who was
then sent to Baltimore) for Todd Hundley and minor-league pitcher
Arnold Gooch.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mashing Mondesi: Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi opted not
to try for the first three-homer game of his career when Mets
manager Bobby Valentine used outfielder Matt Franco _ a Westlake
High graduate _ to pitch the ninth inning. Instead, Paul LoDuca
pinch-hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt like he was starting to swing better and didn't want
to mess it up facing an outfielder,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue. Mondesi hit two homers and drove in five
runs, more production than he's had in the last 19 games. Since a
July 21 homer against Colorado, Mondesi had two RBI and his average
dipped to a season-low .241.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working with (coach) Manny (Mota) and (batting coach)
Rick Down the last few days to get my (swing) back,'' said Mondesi,
who's now hitting .248. ``I'm trying to be more patient at the
plate. With Franco pitching, no (way I want to hit). It's like me
if I try to go to pitch. He could hit somebody and they'd be out
for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI.: Mets right-hander Rick Reed left the game with a
strained middle finger on his pitching hand after 12/3 innings. . .
. Eric Karros' second-inning double established a career-high for a
season. He also doubled in the fifth and has 32 this year. . . .
Reliever Jeff Kubenka singled to right in the eighth inning in his
first major-league at-bat. ``My first hit since high school. I was
going up with (Darren) Dreifort's bat and I told Ismael (Valdes),
there's no way I'm going to be able to swing this big thing and get
around on it. But I got a knock,'' Kubenka said. Dreifort's bat is
34 inches and 32 ounces. . . . Albuquerque personnel provided
erroneous information regarding Carlos Perez's second start in
Triple-A, which was supposed to be Saturday. He's slated to start
today against Calgary. . . . Pitching for the second time this
season, Franco allowed one run on a hit and three walks. The big
play, though, was by ex-Angels pitcher Chuck McElroy, who made a
running catch in the ninth while playing left field.

EDITORIAL: PESTICIDES AND POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, in a rare display of bipartisanship and without
a single dissenting vote, Congress passed the Food Quality
Protection Act, ordering the Environmental Protection Agency to
review nearly 500 pesticides and ban or restrict those that posed
hazards to human health. Then the real fight began _ translating a
broad mandate into specific regulations that were almost certain to
displease somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Carol Browner, the EPA administrator, fired her first
shot, announcing tough new restrictions on two widely used
pesticides. Her decision may ultimately improve the safety of
America's food supply, especially for children. But it was merely
the opening round in what is sure to be a long, politically charged
regulatory struggle. Her best hope in this fight is to be
sure-footed in her science.
</P>
<P>
   The two chemicals are methyl parathion, which is used on fruits
and vegetables, and azinphos methyl, also used on foods. They are
members of a class of pesticides called organophosphates, many of
which were developed in the 1940s and 1950s, and which now account
for about half the pesticides used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For years, many scientists have worried about the possible
toxicity of organophosphates to humans, particularly to the
developing nervous systems of infants and children. Congress
clearly had organophosphates in mind when it specified in the 1996
law that the EPA, in setting any new standards, should use
children, not adults, as the benchmark for safety.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ms. Browner put 39 organophosphates at the top of a
priority list of pesticides to be examined in the early stages of
her review. Environmentalists had expected that she would have
ruled on at least these 39 by last Monday. When she announced
restrictions on only two, they accused her of caving in to
agricultural interests and filed suit to compel her to comply with
the review schedule mandated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the growers warned that the decision, however
modest, was merely the first step in a process that would strip
them of vital pest-fighting weapons and leave them at a competitive
disadvantage against foreign growers.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said that the real reason for the slow pace of the
review was that the investigative process, which involves several
layers of scientific review, had proved more complicated than it
had anticipated. That is probably true. The 1996 act required the
agency not only to devise new safety levels for children, but also
to calculate the risks from all sources, including drinking water
and pest-control sprays in the home.
</P>
<P>
   But of course there is politics in this mix. There always is
when Congress passes a broad, well-intentioned law and then passes
the nasty details along to an administrative agency. The pesticide
industry and agribusiness interests have been importuning anyone
who will listen to them, including Vice President Al Gore, and the
environmental groups are surely justified in complaining that EPA's
pace has been sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Browner needs to accelerate pesticide reviews to the extent
possible without jeopardizing their scientific quality. Separating
the bad from the benign among 500 pesticides is a massive task, and
the most important thing is to get it right.

Bradley has sighted seven bears in a month near the houses he owns.
In the New York region, the problems of the drought extend beyond
dry wells. Record heat and little rain have withered berry bushes
-- an important summer food supply for bears -- and dried up
streams on the mountaintops. This has forced bears, and even
rattlesnakes, down from the mountains in search of food and water.

   (NYT8) WASHINGTON -- Aug. 8, 1999 -- HAGEL-PROFILE, 8-8 -- After
30 years, Sen. Chuck Hagel will return to Vietnam this week to
attend the opening of a new American consulate in Ho Chi Minh City.
Hagel will go as the junior senator from Nebraska and an outspoken
Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee. After returning from
Vietnam in 1969, his face no longer bears evidence of his burn
wounds, which took a decade to heal. But the memories remain, and
he said he takes from them what he needs while keeping them in
their place. (Shana Raab/New York Times Photo)

   SAG HARBOR, N.Y. _ As dusk falls on a sticky summer night in the
Hamptons, Brendan Mernin, Alex Schaffer and Jack Schieffer toss a
football across a vast backyard swimming pool. On the deck above
them, Alex Weiner tends a grill piled with steaks and freshly
picked corn.
</P>
<P>
   A boom box in the living room plays Lyle Lovett. Jean Lichty
rushes in, the latest refugee from the stifling city. She is just
in time for margaritas.
</P>
<P>
   The scene would pass for just another weekend in a group house
on the East End of Long Island. But these are not standard-issue
30-something renters, here to get rowdy after a week of work.
</P>
<P>
   They are, instead, top-of-the-line tutors, in such demand among
New York City's elite that they command $300 an hour to prepare
private school students for college entrance examinations like the
SAT. Usually, they work in Manhattan apartments on Sutton Place or
Park Avenue. This summer, their places of business are waterfront
estates and 100-foot yachts from Quogue to East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Their residence for the summer, rented by the Princeton Review,
is a striking example of the college admissions frenzy that has
gripped well-to-do families, especially in the New York
metropolitan region, where competition for Ivy League slots is the
most intense.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, tutors put their vacationing clients on hold
until Labor Day, because traveling to the Hamptons was
prohibitively expensive for the struggling writers and actors who
are the backbone of the teaching corps. But families clamored for
year-round service. So Princeton Review, one of the leaders in the
test preparation industry, complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perfect symbol of fin de siecle America,'' said
Mernin, 34, an aspiring novelist and the company's No. 1 tutor.
``We are choking on our own prosperity. For people making $5
million a year, this is a reasonable way to spend money. They want
their children to do as well as they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mernin and his fellow tutors say most of their clients are
``nice, together people who want the best for their kids.'' Sure,
the tutors sometimes get panicky calls at midnight on the cellular
phones they are required to carry. Sure, they visit homes where a
parent is never in sight and the housekeeper treats them like
another servant. Sure, they feel twinges of envy when they pull up
in a Dodge Neon and park next to a new Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
   But often, they are treated like family. Ms. Lichty, an actress
now playing the Marilyn Monroe character in a workshop performance
of ``After the Fall,'' has tutored one girl since her eighth-grade
entrance exams for private school. In the intervening years, the
family has attended Ms. Lichty's performances, tried to fix her up
with eligible men and invited her to stay at their beach house each
summer so she could continue tutoring their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   That was before the rental, in a development of modest
raised-ranch houses, north of Route 27, which is considered the
wrong side of the tracks here. It is sparsely furnished, in motel
modern, but has six bedrooms, a shared rental car, an
industrial-strength blender, a 12-cup coffee maker and a
20-by-40-foot pool, bigger than the studio apartments that most
tutors live in.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a house manager, Weiner, a longtime Princeton
Review employee. He is spending a laid-back summer before business
school meeting tutors arriving on the jitney, buying produce at the
Scuttle Hole farm stand, going to Cromer's market for the morning
newspaper, pointing the tutors to Gibson Lane beach and Noyak Bay
and gently rebuking those who leave dirty dishes in the sink. In
addition, he is making a profit subletting his shoe-box apartment
in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the house, which Weiner found for a
bargain-basement $16,000 for the season, will be a money-maker for
the company this year. But the Hamptons clients, many of them new
to Princeton Review, expect to continue through the next school
year, creating a top-dollar winter clientele. Also, after exposure
to the company's best tutors, they are likely to recommend them to
their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a business opportunity for us,'' said Andy Lutz, a
company vice president in charge of precollege programs. Those
programs include group SAT classes, popular for decades, which cost
$895 for 56 hours of instruction and testing, and private lessons,
which took off in the 1990s, priced from $100 to $300 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Fees have doubled in the last two years, Lutz said, driven by
demand. ``It's borderline absurd,'' he said. ``But among a certain
socioeconomic niche, this is normal.''
</P>
<P>
   So normal, in fact, that the company made the strategic decision
to charge all the Hamptons' clients $300 an hour, half of which
goes to the tutor. ``People out here would snub their noses at
anything less,'' Lutz said.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton Review also has pilot programs to bring test
preparation into deprived neighborhoods, including collaborations
with the for-profit Edison Project and the state of California,
which has budgeted $10 million a year to prepare minority
youngsters for the SAT exam. But the core business remains a
growing menu of services for the rich.

 &HT;    Bush urges National Urban League to look toward Texas as model
 &HT;    By C. Bryson Hull
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush
urged the National Urban League Conference on Sunday to look toward
Texas as a model for reforms that can, and should, be made on a
national level.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking briefly before an address by league president Hugh B.
Price, Bush praised the civil-rights organization's new motto,
``Our children equal our destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a purpose to prosperity,'' Bush told 4,000 black
community and business leaders and activists. ``Money can buy
things, but it cannot buy some of the most needed essentials _ such
as justice, family love, moral courage and noble dreams for our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   His appearance at the Urban League's annual convention, held
this year in his home state, is part of his ongoing drive to appeal
to ethnic minority voters who have historically supported
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance came two weeks after Bush's absence from the
annual convention of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic
advocacy group, drew sharp criticism from his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Bush turned down a chance to speak at a meeting of
minority journalists in Seattle, though he was campaigning in that
city at the time. He eventually made a brief appearance at that
event.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day Urban League conference is drawing top candidates
from the 2000 presidential race. Bush was the first of several
contestants slated to address to appear.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the front-runner for next year's
Democratic nomination, is due to address the convention Monday. His
closest Democratic rival, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, is
to speak Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Bush suggested two areas where Americans should
work are promoting charity and education. Both were part of ``10
opportunity commandments'' Price proposed during his own address.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the goals that cut across all races and political
parties. They are not partisan goals,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush advocated continuing ``the hard work of compassion,''
saying that government money should support groups with successful
social-aid programs _ such as faith-based organizations, churches,
synagogues and charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had success because they change lives by changing
hearts, but they don't have the resources they need to continue
waging the war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also touted Texas' success at improving public
education, noting that student test scores in the state's public
schools have risen across the board, ``especially African American
and Hispanic students.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, nearly 40,000 failed the third-grade reading
test, Bush said. ``Instead of getting extra help, we just shuffled
them through,'' he said. ``... So our state did something about it
and ended social promotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also lauded his abolition of social promotion of Texas
students as a step toward ensuring that all students are able to
``access the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen what works in this state. We've raised the bar of
expectations,'' Bush said. ``We've aligned authority and
responsibility where it belongs, at the local level.''

UNDATED: the rich.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A second house for tutors is planned for Martha's Vineyard.
Beginning this fall, a White Glove counseling service will walk
families through the college admissions process, from choosing
schools, to completing applications, to learning tax tricks to
lighten the financial load. The service will cost $5,000 for four
years of one-on-one hand-holding.
</P>
<P>
   Hand-holding is a big part of what the tutors do, and few are
better at it than Mernin, a Columbia graduate with a master's
degree in creative writing from the New School for Social Research.
He begins with the irreverent mantra that has distinguished the
company, founded in 1981 by John Katzman, a Princeton graduate and
bored investment banker, from its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The test is rigged, Mernin and his fellow tutors say. It does
not measure intelligence. It's us against the big, bad test
writers. And we will teach you how to outsmart them.
</P>
<P>
   This subversive approach is a big hit with most teen-agers. ``My
kids eat this up,'' Mernin said. ``It's a game.''
</P>
<P>
   In an hour and a half one recent Saturday, he calmed the fears
of a 16-year-old girl who is entering her junior year at the
Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan. It was her first class in
preparation for October's preliminary admissions test, the start of
the college marathon. She sat stiffly in the parlor of her family's
house here, Mernin said, avoiding eye contact and shivering in
shorts and a T-shirt with a damp bathing suit underneath.
</P>
<P>
   When Mernin told her that the test did not measure how smart she
was, she literally sighed with relief. Then he began teaching her
the tricks that Princeton Review tutors say can add 150 points to a
student's score, without having to learn any additional math or
vocabulary. The tricks mostly have to do with concentrating on the
easier questions, which come first.
</P>
<P>
   For some students, aiming for a 600 out of a possible 800 on
either the math or the verbal SAT exam, answering only the first,
easier, 18 of 25 questions is the key to success, Princeton Review
propaganda says. But even the last questions, necessary to make the
750 that most Ivy League schools demand, can be mastered, once
students learn to shun the choices that look like sure bets.
</P>
<P>
   Mernin walked the girl through math problem No. 25, the last and
hardest on a sample test: ``In 1970, the price of a certain antique
car was 30 percent greater than in 1965. In 1975, the price of the
same car was 50 percent greater than in 1970. The price of the car
was what percent greater in 1975 than in 1965?'' She blanched. This
was algebra, and she didn't like algebra.
</P>
<P>
   But Mernin showed her that the problem could be solved with
simple arithmetic, if she assigned a round number _ say $100 _ to
the unknown value of the car, rather than calling it X. What did it
cost in 1965, he asked her? Hesitant, she said $100. By 1970, the
value had gone up 30 percent. She quickly filled in $130. Then an
additional 50 percent, to $195. Answer (A) was 95 percent. A snap.
Without a bit of algebra. ``See,'' he told her. ``You think it's
harder than it is.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left for the day, Mernin said, the girl was
smiling and breathing easy. ``Part of what they're paying for,'' he
said, ``is hearing my voice when they're under pressure. If I do it
right, in the test room, they can hear me say: `You're fine. This
is what you do.'''

DOMINANT DREIFORT DOES IN METS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The only sure thing with Darren Dreifort these days
is that he wants to continue his career as a starter and only
venture to the bullpen when it's his day to throw on the side or
ready himself for a game.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers' decision-makers aren't nearly as
definitive about how the hard-throwing right-hander will be used in
the future. But when the issue is finally resolved, there's no
question the 61/3 innings he pitched in the Dodgers' 14-3
bombardment of the first-place New York Mets will be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   What caught many people's attention was the three-run homer to
center field Dreifort hit in the second inning to give the Dodgers
a 4-1 lead. But what Dodgers manager Davey Johnson saw Sunday at
Shea Stadium was a pitcher determined to show an organization why
he belongs in the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of statement I want to see him make,'' Johnson
said. ``If I can see that consistently, that's what I'm looking
for. Go after guys and not throw many pitches. Pitch-efficient, go
after guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi, who hadn't homered since July 21, had two homers
and five RBI. Eric Karros had three hits and drove in four runs and
Dreifort (9-11) established a career high for wins in a season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won back-to-back games for the first time since July
19-20 and the Mets dropped two straight for the first time since
July 2-3. In tying a season high for runs scored, the Dodgers
(49-62) also jumped out of last place for the first time since July
28. But the development of Dreifor was on top of everyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``His slider is great and the change-up is probably the most
improved pitch of the year,'' Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said.
``To be able to go through the lineup three or four times a game
you have to be able to change speeds and keep them off-balance. You
have to get the soft stuff over.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the opposing bats that got Dreifort, it was the thick,
heavy, humidity-filled air that eventually knocked him out of the
game. Dreifort threw 91 pitches in his most impressive outing since
June but ran out of energy after spending time on the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left, Dreifort did the one thing he'll need to do if
he's to establish himself as a top-notch starter _ using his
off-speed pitches effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was screwing around with too many things earlier in
the season and I went back to what's normal,'' Dreifort said. ``(I
was in) different positions on the rubber and different pitches.
During the season is not the time to be doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort, whose fastball is consistently clocked in the mid 90s,
struck out seven and allowed one earned run. But what most pleased
the Dodgers was the one walk. Earlier this season, Dreifort walked
nine Atlanta batters in a game, but he's walked four in his last
three starts and 14 in his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like his last couple of starts, he was ready to
pitch,'' Johnson said. ``If you're basically (throwing) hard, and
everything is maxed out, generally once through the lineup, guys
have a feel for you. If you're all hard, they get to see a lot of
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why many scouts view Dreifort as a future closer rather
than a marquee starter-in-the-making, but the x-factor remains
Dreifort's reconstructed right elbow. Team doctors advised Johnson
in spring training not to use Dreifort out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a patience issue. He's 27 but in just his second
year as a starter. When he dominates a lineup as he did against the
Mets, it makes the decision to move him into the bullpen more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with an 89 mph fastball low on the
outside corner,'' Johnson said. ``Everything doesn't have to be
maxed out. He's shown me that in the last few starts he can do
that. That's also a measure of trusting your stuff.''

BEAKED WHALE DIES AFTER RESCUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ B.J., the beaked whale found drifting offshore in
Malibu, 25 miles west of downtown Los Angeles, died Saturday night,
moments after going into a frenzied death spiral and sinking to the
bottom of an observation pool in Laguna Beach, Calif., officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But B.J. might leave a legacy of information on a species about
which humans know little, said John Heyning, deputy director of
research at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles. Today
Heyning and other researchers will conduct a necropsy on the whale.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Friends of the Sea Lion Marine Mammal Center in
Laguna Beach said the whale died there around 9 p.m. in the arms of
volunteers who had raised her to the pool surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a deep dweller like she was, for one to come up in shallow
water and even on shore, there was probably a lot going wrong with
her,'' said Michele Hunter, assistant director of Friends of the
Sea Lion.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the center had been treating B.J. to combat the
whale's declining kidney function. Though B.J. had shown some
improvement, Hunter said she only had less than a one-in-100 shot
at survival.

<P>
   B.J. died a day after Los Angeles County lifeguard Bob Janis
spotted her swimming ashore at Point Dume. The whale, which was 10
feet long, 800 pounds and appeared to be about 18 months old, was
named after Janis.
</P>
<P>
   Heyning said the fact that he couldn't be sure which species
B.J. belonged to of the four or five varieties of beaked whale
found around California shows how much more there is to be
understood. Before the necropsy, scientists will weigh, measure and
photograph B.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rarely seen, they rarely strand, so each one adds a
lot to our body of knowledge,'' Heyning said Sunday. ``With an
animal as rare as this, it's more important to do it very carefully
than very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heyning said answers about the cause of B.J.'s death could
emerge as soon as this afternoon.

FRIENDS SEE DANGER IN GATTI'S STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; Pat Lynch, the longtime manager of Arturo Gatti, is worried.
</P>
<P>
   He's witnessed the glory of Gatti's ascension to one of the most
popular fighters of his time and a world title. He's also witnessed
a disturbing number of punches land on the face of his close friend
because of his reckless boxing style.
</P>
<P>
   As one observer put it, ``You can't use your face as your
primary defense and not begin to worry at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Lynch and so many others wonder whether enough is
enough even as Gatti prepares to resume his career against
light-punching journeyman Reyes Munoz on Saturday in Mashantucket,
Conn., on HBO after an eight-month layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti, 27, has heard the talk and appreciates the concern.
However, he feels he's in no unusual danger and plans to continue
fighting indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with me,'' the former IBF junior
lightweight champion said. ``I keep passing my physicals with no
problems. Of course, I understand that my mom is concerned, my
manager is concerned. But this is how I feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say I'll let them know when I no longer love boxing, when I
no longer feel physically right.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti (29-4, with 24 knockouts) is coming off the most
frustrating period in his eight-year professional career: He's lost
his past three fights, all in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   All three were typical thrilling, give-and-take Gatti wars and
could have gone either way. He was stopped in eight rounds by Angel
Manfredy as a result of a bad cut and he subsequently lost two
unforgettable battles with Ivan Robinson over the 10-round
distance.
</P>
<P>
   After the last fight, he returned to his native Montreal _ he
lives in New Jersey _ to spend time with family and try to regroup
psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a rough year, a terrible year,'' he said. ``I think I
needed to get away from boxing for a while and I think I did the
right thing. I feel good now, I'm excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went up to Lake Tahoe (for the Fernando Vargas-Raul Marquez
card last month) and received a great reception. The crowd really
took me in. That made me feel good about myself. It's something I
hadn't felt in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more excited than ever. Hopefully, I'll be a world
champion again soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact Gatti was warmly received is no surprise: Boxing fans
love him because his fights are so entertaining. This why HBO is
interested in him even after three straight losses.
</P>
<P>
   However, again, there's a price to pay: A brain can stand only
so many blows.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti and his trainer, Ronnie Shields, work on defense and the
finer points of boxing before every fight and they plan to employ
it, the fight against Munoz included.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after he takes a few shots, he typically abandons all
caution and the punches begin to fly, to the delight of the fans.
Afterward, he's likely to have two badly swollen eyes, a cut here
and there and a wide grin glued to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Those who care about him have mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the godfather to my youngest child, he's family,'' Lynch
said. ``Do I worry? Absolutely. I don't want to see him with
slurred speech in the years to come. I see that happen to other
fighters and it breaks my heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to drill into his head to box and move. It's just his
character to brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Gatti's plan is to beat Munoz (which shouldn't be difficult),
fight in Montreal before the end of the year and then fight for a
world title early next year. He's negotiating to face either Israel
Cardona or Paul Spadafora, who fight Aug. 20 for the IBF
lightweight championship vacated by Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti said he'd like to win a few more championships before he
walks away, although that isn't necessarily his primary motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Said he: ``I just !ital!love boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's obvious.
</P>
<P>
   __ More Mashantucket: If the prospect of a Gatti fight isn't
intriguing enough, Saturday's main event could be just as exciting.
Stevie Johnston (27-1, 14 KOs) defends his WBC lightweight title
against Manfredy (28-3-1, 22 KOs).
</P>
<P>
   Johnston is one of the sport's finest boxers, Manfredy one of
its most compelling brawlers.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tyson-Douglas: We know what's coming: hype, hype and more
hype.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson vs. Buster Douglas II. Oooooooooooo. Isn't that
exciting? Can Douglas do it again? Will Tyson get his revenge? Does
anybody really care?
</P>
<P>
   No one is naive enough to believe this is a meaningful matchup,
assuming America Presents is able to close the deal for an Oct. 2
date in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is no longer the fighter he was before Douglas shocked the
world by knocking him out in 1990. Evander Holyfield _ and even
Francois Botha, to some extent _ exposed him as less than immortal.
</P>
<P>
   And, much more significant, Douglas is 39, weighed 400 pounds a
few years ago, almost died at one point after slipping into a
diabetic coma and was knocked out in the first round by limited Lou
Savarese three fights ago.
</P>
<P>
   He simply doesn't have the tools to fend off Tyson, who, at 33,
remains one of the better heavyweights in the world when he's not
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's logical that Tyson face a mediocre opponent
after his latest hiatus in prison. However, this is ridiculous. At
this stage of his career and in light of the money he makes, Tyson
should take on an opponent equipped with more than just a
storyline.
</P>
<P>
   __ Golota-Grant? Promoters are negotiating a bout between
heavyweight contenders Andrew Golota and Michael Grant for Nov. 20,
a week after the tentative Holyfield-Lennox Lewis rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides are eager to make a deal, according to Main Events,
which promotes both fighters.
</P>
<P>
   HBO would like to pair the replay of Holyfield-Lewis II with the
live Golota-Grant fight.
</P>
<P>
   __ At last: The bout between Kostya Tszyu and Miguel Angel
Gonzalez for the vacant WBC super lightweight title, postponed
three times, is set for Aug. 21 in Miami. It will be televised live
on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this long-awaited matchup probably won't be
competitive. Prediction: Tszyu, strong and too quick for Gonzalez,
wins an easy decision.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Undefeated junior lightweight Zab Judah, one
of the most exciting prospects in boxing, is expected to fight on
the undercard of the Tyson-Douglas fight.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent has yet to be determined. . . .

EXPECT WEAK NUMBERS IN RETAIL SALES REPORT FOR JULY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the experts are right, another relatively weak shopping month
will be reflected by the {retail sales report for July,} which is
due for release Thursday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a strong 1.2 percent jump in May, retail sales rose only
0.1 percent in June and most analysts don't expect much more
strength from last month's numbers. The consensus from economists
polled weekly by Thomson Global Markets expects a rise of 0.3
percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The weakening retail numbers help explain the deceleration of
growth during this year's second quarter, which early estimates
indicate was off significantly from the previous two quarters.
Retail statistics are particularly important, because personal
consumption is responsible for two-thirds of U.S. economic
activity. &QL; 
Monday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More of the same is expected from {June's data on wholesale
inventories,} which are forecast to have expanded at about the same
rate as the previous month. Most analysts expect a gain of 0.3
percent. &QL; 
Wednesday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Release of the Federal Reserve's latest {Beige Book economic
overview} will be studied by the investment community for its
potential effect on monetary policy. The report tracks economic
conditions at the Federal Reserve Bank districts throughout the
country. If conditions are perceived as too healthy, it might raise
fears of another interest-rate increase by Fed policymakers at
their next meeting. &QL; 
Thursday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The July report on {import prices} may signal added inflationary
pressure, because the consensus forecast calls for a rise of 0.3
percent after a 0.2 percent decline in June. A companion report on
{export prices} is predicted to show a rise of only 0.1 percent,
which could imply further widening of the U.S. trade deficit in
future months. &QL; 
Friday &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the overall {Producer Price Index} increase for July may
seem inflationary at first glance, the core rate result likely will
have a settling effect on financial markets. The consensus forecast
calls for 0.4 percent surge in the wholesale price level, but most
analysts predict the core index, which excludes the volatile food
and energy components, will be up only 0.1 percent. The PPI fell
0.1 percent in June and the core index was down 0.2 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - {Business inventories} are forecast to have expanded 0.3
percent in June, which would match May's increase and continue the
trend of recent months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   - The early August reading of the {University of Michigan
consumer sentiment index} is expected to show a slight decline from
earlier levels. &QL;

   &UR; ``THE DESCENT'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jeff Long (Crown, $24)
</P>
<P>
   What this horror story loses in bizarre plot twists, it makes up
in audacity and dogged inventiveness. Long's setup goes on for
chapters, during which we meet lots of people and witness lots of
gore. In the end, we're sure of just one thing: Something awful
lives under the ground. It surfaces in an isolated Tibetan cave
where guide Ike Crockett takes refuge from a storm with a group of
wealthy (and doomed) clients. It surfaces in a South African leper
colony where a beautiful nun named Ali hears of a ``hungry God''
who kills men and chops them up for parts. And it surfaces in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where NATO soldier Elias Branch watches
otherworldly creatures rise from a mass grave and attack his
crippled helicopter. The demons have already dispatched Branch's
navigator, hideously, but Branch survives to initiate the discovery
and exploration of a vast network of tunnels deep beneath the
Earth's surface, where are found body parts, crude jewelry and
footprints that aren't quite human. The penetration of the
underground becomes a worldwide military effort until more than
250,000 soldiers are slaughtered in the tunnels in a single day, a
well-planned mass execution that gives world leaders a sense of
what they're facing. ``Hell exists,'' the U.S. president announces.
``It is real. A geological, historical place beneath our very feet.
And it is inhabited. Savagely.'' Yes folks, it's Satan's empire
we're talking about here, and it's not pretty. Branch goes bravely
back into the tunnels, where he finds Ike Crockett alive after
years of captivity underground, and the ravaged Ike finds an odd
romance with Ali the nun. If Satan is a bit disappointing when he
finally shows up, you'll be too busy keeping up with all of the
other action to really care. It's a late summer page-turner that
you're unlikely to put down. &QL; 
 &UR; ``LETTERS FROM YELLOWSTONE''By Diane Smith (Viking, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This novel, written as a collection of letters, is set in 1898
and begins with a formal note from A.E. Bartram, a New York medical
student with a passion for botany, who asks to join a field study
of Yellowstone National Park. The request is greeted with
enthusiasm by the leader of the expedition, Montana Professor
Howard Merriam, and letters fly among Bartram, Merriam and their
families and colleagues before the expedition meets in Montana.
This early correspondence shows Bartram to be a clever, industrious
and ambitious young scientist who relishes the chance to make a
career in botany. Bartram's arrival in Montana causes confusion and
dismay, however, when Merriam learns that Alex Bartram is a woman _
and a determined one at that. She persists quietly as Merriam frets
about her ability to endure wilderness existence and about the
pragmatic obstacles of including a lone woman in a company of men.
But Bartram stays and becomes a delightful character. So does
Andrew Rutherford, a fellow scientist who writes amusingly about
the upheaval Alex's presence causes and about how ably she sticks
to the business at hand. Meanwhile, Howard Merriam's letters to his
mother reflect his growing respect for the woman he wanted so
desperately to send packing. Many things emerge in this story _ a
portrait of scientists at work at the turn of the century, a look
at the West at a time of change, the beauty and danger of
Yellowstone, and the story of a forthright woman and the men who
come to admire her. Smith began with a beguiling idea and has
turned it into an enchanting book. &QL; 
 &UR; ``TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE: THE COLOSSAL BOOK OF URBAN LEGENDS'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Jan Harold Brunvand (Norton, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reading this is like going through photo albums _ the pleasure
is in the recognition. The most famous American urban legend is, of
course, ``The Hook'' (a homicidal maniac left it hanging on the car
door of a couple just returned from a lovers' lane). Then there's
``Kentucky Fried Rat,'' or, as New &AMP; Notable has always known it,
``Kentucky Fried Rodent,'' which leaves room for variation. ``The
Hairy-Armed Hitchhiker'' is good, or ``The Killer in the Back
Seat'' (this inspired a testy exchange between Brunvand and David
Letterman, which Brunvand describes here with some remorse). Or
there are the harmless ones, such as that Internet favorite about
the Neiman Marcus cookies. It's true, however, that many urban
legends are disgusting or disturbing or both (we like to tell
stories about the worst possible things that can happen to us), and
that this is where we throw all taste and political correctness to
the wind. There are legends about toilets, AIDS, dead babies, sex,
even pets-in-the-microwave _ something for everyone to enjoy. &QL; 
 &UR; ``BILL AND HILLARY: THE MARRIAGE''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Christopher Andersen (Morrow, $27.50) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was in Hillary's White House bedroom that Bill Clinton
finally told her that he had, indeed, had an affair with Monica
Lewinsky. As she sat, stunned, on the edge of her bed, Andersen
writes, ``the president of the United States got down on his knees
and, weeping, begged her forgiveness.'' We assume that Andersen was
crouched behind a nearby potted plant during this exchange, and
that he knew where all the White House plants were and moved from
one to the other in search of dirt. Of course, not all of his
information came by way of espionage. Some was procured from former
presidential adviser Dick Morris, who is on everyone's most-admired
list. Andersen (``The Day Diana Died'') looks at the Clintons from
courtship to current status, whatever that may be. Other than
painful descriptions of Chelsea Clinton's misery during the
Lewinsky revelations, it has the feel of old, tired news _ it made
us feel old and tired just to read it. We hope you fare better. &QL;

HIDDEN CAMERAS IN LOCKER ROOMS PRODUCE SHOTS SOLD ON INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MARCIA CHAMBERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unauthorized videotapes of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of naked
male athletes in the locker rooms of more than 50 universities are
being produced, sold and distributed on sexually oriented sites on
the World Wide Web, according to a lawyer representing 200 of the
men who were taped.
</P>
<P>
   Without their knowledge, the athletes were videotaped at
urinals, at showers or weighing in unclothed at competitions. No
camera was ever in open view, the students said. The tapes were
made by employees or students working for video companies. Posing
as athletic trainers, they were able to slip into the locker rooms
carrying hidden cameras in gym bags.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a zoom lens was used. The result was a video, with no
sound, that later was edited for sale on the Internet or by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The students' attorney, Louis S. Goldstein of Chicago, filed a
lawsuit in Illinois state court late last month seeking a permanent
injunction to stop the video producers and Web sites from marketing
and displaying the videotapes. ``This is a big business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he and Dennis A. Berkson, another Chicago lawyer,
will seek class-action status for the victims, whose numbers he
expects will increase once a university is identified through
student uniforms or its buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that we have at least 1,000 kids on eight tapes,''
Goldstein said. ``There are many more tapes than eight, and usually
there may be from 5 to 10 schools on each tape. This could
eventually involve thousands and thousands of college athletes
shown naked and being marketed and distributed world wide on videos
and on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The videos of the students, including their faces, are now
marketed through Web sites under such titles as ``Voyeur Time,''
``After the Game,'' ``Wrestle Time'' and ``Shower Time.''
</P>
<P>
   One former varsity athlete learned from a roommate that he had
been taped a few years ago in a locker room at his school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled up the home page and I am looking at myself naked on
the Internet,'' said the former athlete, who spoke on the condition
that neither his name nor his sport be identified. ``And everyone
in the world has access to it. My parents have seen it now, and
they are very upset. It is terrible because I have no control over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint filed initially on behalf of 28 John
Does _ a judge has ruled the students' names may be kept
confidential _ the students were members of football, wrestling and
squash teams. Goldstein said baseball and track athletes were also
videotaped, along with men in a U.S. Marine Corps locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The universities where the taping occurred are identified as
Northwestern, Eastern Illinois, Illinois State, Pennsylvania, Iowa
State, Michigan State, Indiana and Illinois. Two other Ivy League
schools besides Penn are also apparently involved, but Goldstein
would not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said the clandestine operation, which began almost a
decade ago, depends on fresh material for steady Web site users who
typically buy memberships to a site or a group of sites. To
increase the number of people looking at the site, the sites
promote the hidden camera angle and the outright sale of the
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   The video companies earn upward of $20,000 a month, with
virtually no overhead. And who runs them? Mitchell Kamarck, a
Beverly Hills lawyer who represents celebrities whose images
routinely appear on the Web via hidden camera, says it is mostly
``college kids wanting to earn a buck.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in Illinois state court rather than in
federal court because the law on the federal level is limited to
audio wrongdoing _ listening in _ but not to video eavesdropping.
Illinois is one of a handful of states with a statute that bars
secret videotaping in saunas, bathrooms and tanning booths.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the students are suing under statutes that allow
individuals to assert property rights to their own images, and
under racketeering statutes that, if they prove their case, will
entitle them to triple damages.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FBI in Chicago said there was no active
investigation. As is its policy, the U.S. attorney's office in
Chicago would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Within the legal community, there is a debate on what criminal
laws were violated, if any. There is no federal eavesdropping law
regarding hidden video cameras, so prosecutors are examining two
laws: one that makes interstate distribution of pornography or
indecent material a violation, and another that deals with
racketeering statutes. Making the issue more difficult is the
uncertain law governing control over images and words on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is wide-ranging freedom on the Internet, and lawyers for
the companies are expected to use that freedom as their first
defense. ``Their lawyers always begin with that, but the First
Amendment does not hold when it comes to commercial exploitation,''
Kamarck said. ``The use of hidden cameras in bathrooms is illegal,
immoral and impermissible.'' The Web sites are bold, he added, and
``because there are so many of them, they feel they won't ever get
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said, ``The hidden-camera activity, accomplished in
a locker room where students have the presumption of security and
privacy, was extreme and outrageous.'' In addition to the obvious
invasion of the locker room, the students fear employers will
believe they were willing participants.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies named in the lawsuit is a household name.
They are Franco Productions, Rodco, Hidvideo, and HidVidCo-Atlas
Video Release, Logan Gaines Entertainment, D.I.Y. Triangle Video
and Cal Video. None had listed telephone numbers, and no one could
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' owners were also sued individually, as were a
group of Internet service providers, companies that lease the
computer space where the videos are posted and promoted. They were
identified as PSI Net, TIAC.net and GTE Internet and its offspring,
Genuity.net.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pennsylvania has mounted a vigorous attack to
get the videos removed from the Internet. The school's general
counsel, Peter C. Erichsen, wrote letters to two video companies,
Logan Gaines Entertainment of Kahului, Hawaii, and HidVidCo of
Boston, saying the university's legal rights had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   Logan Gaines, whose company displayed and distributed the tape
of the Penn wrestlers on the Web, wrote back saying he would remove
all hidden-camera images of Penn wrestlers from his site, Erichsen
said. Hidvideo has not replied, said Erichsen, who plans further
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said the scheme began to unravel last spring with the
discovery of two tapes. One was found by a University of Memphis
track athlete who recognized wrestlers from Penn and sent the tape
to friends there. Another tape and a hidden camera were discovered
at the Midlands National wrestling tournament at Northwestern,
which attracts scores of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the hidden-camera taping, Penn is renovating its
locker facility, separating the shower section from the rest of the
locker room, to address the problem, a spokesman said. Other
schools are also tightening security at their locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the athlete who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
locker rooms are not the same to him anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, you see a gym bag and you don't think twice about
it,'' he said. ``But now I do.'' &QL;

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ As the Comets were going through pre-game warm-ups
Sunday at sold-out Madison Square Garden, reserve center/forward
Tammy Jackson stepped on a sticky spot on the court, twisted her
left knee and ankle and was unable to play.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That was a vital factor, said coach Van Chancellor after the
Comets lost 74-71 to the Liberty for their fifth defeat of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, was the play of guard Sophia Witherspoon, who came off
the Liberty's bench to tie her season high with 22 points, eight of
which came on four consecutive baskets that broke open a tie at 64
and carried the Liberty into a virtual tie for first place in the
closely contested WNBA Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Sue Wicks rebounded from a two-point performance in the
Liberty's 68-55 loss at Phoenix on Friday to score 14 points and
snatch a game-high nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest factor to work against the Comets (21-5) was
their inability to cope with the full-court defense of the Liberty
over the final six minutes. Seven times during that span the Comets
turned the ball over as the Liberty (14-11) moved percentage points
ahead of the Charlotte Sting (15-12).
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of gave the game away,'' said Comets guard Cynthia
Cooper, who had five assists and was the game's leading scorer with
26 points. ``We had a lot of turnovers in the second half, me in
particular. I had something like four.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we kind of gave it away. You can't have that many turnovers
and play that poorly in the second half and expect to come away
with a win. Especially in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets led most of the game and had a comfortable 60-53
cushion with 7:46 to play. But Witherspoon, Wicks and the pressure
defense began to take hold at that point, and the comfort zone
quickly turned into a danger zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sue was excellent pressuring the ball,'' said Liberty coach
Richie Adubato. ``And you know what? The momentum changed, and the
crowd got into the game. And when that happens, you have to keep
pressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper scored 16 points in the first half as the Comets, after
trailing by as many as four points over the first four minutes,
came back to lead 37-32 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   When the Comets' Sheryl Swoopes fired in a 3-pointer to pump the
cushion to 56-48, the crowd of 19,563 began to lose some of the
enthusiasm that had filled the arena earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Wicks, though, hadn't yet switched into terminator role on
defense, where she would give the Comets fits on each inbounds pass
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon had played earlier, but it wasn't until she entered
the contest with 9:19 remaining that the scoreboard started tilting
in the Liberty's favor.
</P>
<P>
   After ties at 62 and 64, a layup by Witherspoon with 3:41
remaining put the Liberty up 66-64.
</P>
<P>
   Following an inbounds toss, Wicks stole a pass from Swoopes and
fed Witherspoon, whose fast-break layup extended the lead to 68-64.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon had two more baskets as the Liberty took a 72-68
lead. But a pair of free throws by Cooper, who was 8-for-8 from the
foul line, cut the margin to 72-70.
</P>
<P>
   After being fouled by Weatherspoon with 47.5 seconds left, the
Comets' Tina Thompson (20 points, five rebounds) had a chance to
tie the score. But Thompson clanged the only missed free throw in
16 attempts by the Comets on the game.
</P>
<P>
   She made the second one, cutting the margin to 72-71.
</P>
<P>
   A miss by Weatherspoon caromed out of bounds off Wicks, giving
the Comets hope with 17 seconds to go. But with 2.6 seconds left,
Cooper had the ball stolen by Weatherspoon, who before falling out
of bounds got off a pass to Crystal Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was fouled by Janeth Arcain and made two free throws to
make it 74-71.
</P>
<P>
   At the final buzzer, Cooper from near midcourt banged a 3-point
try off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Chancellor talked of how the injury to Jackson
affected his substitution system when starting center Polina
Tzekova picked up three early fouls, and ultimately played a part
in the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that somebody didn't take care of their business
on (cleaning up) the floor before the game and that affects the
outcome of the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor also pointed a finger at the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say this and nothing else,'' he said. ``It's a shame
players don't decide big games.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor praised the Liberty players for their inspired
effort, and Swoopes (15 points, seven rebounds, five assists, three
steals) shared her coach's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seemed like when we needed some big plays, they (the
Liberty) made them,'' she said. ``And then they came back and made
that run (down the stretch). They played well.''

EVOLUTION ISSUE FOCUSES ATTENTION ON STATE BOARD'S MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Evolution could lose its leading role in new state science
standards when the Kansas Board of Education acts this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three state board members on Wednesday will present a modified
version of science curriculum standards that eliminates many
references to evolution, the theory that living species change over
time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are calling the modified version a compromise, but
critics say the changes are merely a way to achieve what
conservatives wanted all along: Science standards without
evolution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The standards are important because they will determine what
Kansas students are supposed to learn and are tested on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The board's two-day meeting begins Tuesday in Topeka, Kan. Much
public comment is expected during the open forum. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty optimistic that we've got a chance at passing
this,'' said Scott Hill, a conservative from Abilene, Kan., who is
one of the three board members behind the changes in the new
version. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Passage would require six votes on the 10-member board, which is
divided 5-5 between conservatives and moderates and has split
evenly on many issues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Harold Voth of Haven, Kan., the board's vice chairman,
has been quoted in news reports as calling for solid majority
backing on the new version. Attempts to reach Voth for additional
comment Sunday, including on how he would vote on the proposal,
were unsuccessful. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Voth helped draft the proposed changes with Hill and another
conservative board member, Steve Abrams of Arkansas City, Kan., who
has played a leading role in challenging the teaching of
evolution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Members of the 27-member state committee of science teachers and
professors that wrote the original standards say these revisions
completely change the tenor of the document. Some of them intend to
remove their names from the standards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it's based on their fundamentalist Christian
faith,'' said John Staver, a Kansas State University professor and
co-chairman of the state committee. ``So in that sense they're
representing a minority of Kansans.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Debate over the science standards has simmered since May, when
the board first received the state committee's version. That
document, based on standards from the National Academy of Sciences,
presented evolution as one of five concepts uniting all scientific
disciplines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the May meeting, Abrams also presented a version of the
standards, written by members of a local creation-science
organization. The Abrams version deleted evolution and in its
glossary defined ``intelligent design.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moderates criticized Abrams' version as out of line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the summer began and board members realized they didn't have
six votes to accept or reject the state standards, they delayed
action on the committee's version. Abrams, meanwhile, said he would
revise his version to make it more acceptable to all board
members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's what board member Janet Waugh was expecting to receive in
her August meeting packet. What she saw instead was the modified
version, the work of Hill, Voth and Abrams, which removed the idea
of evolution being a unifying concept. It also eliminates
references to ``macroevolution,'' the process of change from one
species to another. References to ``microevolution,'' or change
within species, were left intact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Waugh said she immediately asked board Chairwoman Linda
Holloway, a conservative from Shawnee, Kan., whether the modified
version could be discussed, not voted on, during the August
meeting. Waugh said she was concerned that the changes altered the
document enough that it needed some review. But she withdrew her
request when Holloway and Voth said they wouldn't support it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just having a real struggle with this,'' Waugh said Aug.
4. ``Are we doing what's right? I was not elected as an expert. I
was elected as a lay person. I have a problem with board members
writing standards.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the modified standards wouldn't prohibit science
teachers from teaching evolution, leaving macroevolution out of the
standards means it won't be included on new statewide science
tests, which all Kansas public schoolchildren take. So some
districts might decide not to teach the theory of evolution,
favoring instead a focus on the concepts tested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the changes address evolution and earth history. They
create openings for teaching creation science or criticizing
evolution as a theory, said Molleen Matsumura of the National
Center for Science Education in Berkeley, Calif. The center
advocates teaching evolution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And national tests, such as the Scholastic Assessment Test and
the American College Testing exam, which most college-bound
students take, contain many questions on macroevolution, Matsumura
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hill said last week that the Abrams version of the science
standards is dead. His colleagues will either pass or reject the
modified version; the board has other business to attend to, he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wagnon, a moderate from Topeka, said the vote won't settle
the issue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the board approves the modified version, he said, ``we'll
spend the next 15 months with school districts telling us they
don't like the standards. And then an awakened public will vent its
wrath on the Board of Education in November 2000.'' &QL;

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ It is no coincidence the first five finishers in the
Brickyard 400 on Saturday _ Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte, Jeff
Gordon, Mark Martin and Jeff Burton _ are the only drivers who have
a legitimate chance to win at each Winston Cup race.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's also no coincidence many of the drivers who used to be
stars of the sport _ Bill Elliott, Sterling Marlin, Geoffrey
Bodine, Ernie Irvan and Darrell Waltrip _ were doing little more
than driving laps.
</P>
<P>
   The pretenders far outnumber the contenders at NASCAR's highest
level, and the results over the past three seasons prove the point:
</P>
<P>
   The drivers who finished in the top five Saturday have won 16 of
the 20 races this season and took 27 of 33 events last season and
25 of 32 races in 1997. That's 68 wins in the past 85 races, 80
percent of the total for only five drivers.
</P>
<P>
   No other driver has more than one victory per season in the past
two years, and only seven other drivers have won a race.
</P>
<P>
   At least 19 drivers at each Winston Cup event never have won a
race, and 30 of the 43 drivers have not won since 1996 or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows that Winston Cup racing is a very difficult
thing to do,'' said Michael Waltrip, who never has won a points
race in 414 career starts. ``But there's a very fine line between
being at the top and being in the middle of the pack.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott is a former Winston Cup champion who was one of the best
drivers in the sport in the late 1980s, but he has not won a race
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Waltrip's 84 career wins are third all-time behind
Richard Petty and David Pearson, but Waltrip hasn't won in seven
years. He will make 2000 his final season, which he is calling the
Victory Tour, but he has about as much chance of earning a victory
next year as the Los Angeles Clippers have of winning the NBA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin won back-to-back Daytona 500s in 1994 and '95, but he
hasn't won anywhere since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for going from a winner to an also-ran isn't just
diminished skills as a driver ages. Sometimes it has more to do
with a driver's mental outlook than his physical ability.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers can get content with their situation and reach a point
where it isn't worth the risks they would take when they were
younger.
</P>
<P>
   When a driver is building his career, he will make aggressive
moves on the track that can be dangerous. But once a driver becomes
financially secure, playing chicken with the wall and risking a
serious crash doesn't seem like such a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers are good enough to compete and make the field but
not good enough to win, yet they manage to keep their ride and
their sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cotter, who founded the Cotter Group marketing firm,
represents several Winston Cup teams and drivers. In the latest
issue of the Winston Cup Scene, he points out winning isn't
everything in the eyes of the sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any given year, five or six drivers are going to win, with
very few exceptions,'' Cotter said. ``Winning big-time is for a few
elite teams every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may luck into it or you might not. A strong performance on
the track is icing on the cake, but we are going to give you a
driver who won't embarrass the sponsor and a driver who will help
you sell your product.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott and Marlin are prime examples. Elliott, the epitome of a
Southern gentleman, has been voted NASCAR's most popular driver for
eight consecutive years and 13 of the past 15. And Marlin, who
drives the Coors Light Chevrolet, is known as one of the
friendliest drivers in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sterling hasn't won a race in a while, but he's your best
buddy in three minutes,'' said Norm Partin, a sponsor consultant
for race teams. ``Coors has had a terrible race program the last
few years, but they have a driver who is getting the job done with
the distributors.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Saunders, field marketing manager for Coors, said the
company is thrilled to have Marlin representing the car it
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sterling is terrific,'' Saunders said. ``He enjoys being
around our (beer) distributors, and they enjoy the heck out of
being around him. While it still is important to run well, it
really has become more of a function of, `Can we use this team to
move our beer business?' The priority isn't looking for a winner;
it's selling beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Robert Yates doesn't think that philosophy works over
the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all bull,'' Yates said. ``All (the sponsors) want
to win, and they don't care how pretty or how ugly the guy is if he
can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates used the recent changes for Elliott and Ricky Rudd as
examples. McDonald's is leaving Elliott after next season, and Rudd
is losing Tide as his sponsor after this year.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem for Elliott and Rudd is they missed out on
the trend toward multicar teams. Both of them are driver/owners who
have been unable to keep up with the research and development
advances of the multicar teams. No single-car owner has won a race
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Bodine, another driver/owner of a one-car team, hasn't won
since 1990 and hasn't finished in the top 10 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running a one-car team is very difficult today,'' he said.
``The exposure available for a single car is less and less. Without
being able to share expenses with other cars, Paychex (Bodine's
sponsor) is stretched.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will reach the point where they ask, `Are we getting enough
for the dollars?' and I will ask myself if I'm happy competing at
this level. The answer to both those questions probably is no.''
</P>
<P>
   It must get frustrating for some veteran drivers who once were
winners but for whatever reason no longer are contenders. Kyle
Petty, who hasn't won since 1994, said he enjoys his job even
though he rarely is near the front of the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, running 42nd in a race is better than not being in a
race car,'' Petty said. ``When the day comes that I feel it isn't
all it's cracked up to be, then I'll quit. But right now I'm still
having fun doing it.''

LOS ANGELES: Disney's kingpin status. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Universal's fifth weekend of ``American Pie'' took the 10th spot
with $4 million at 1,795 theaters to push its 31-day total past $85
million. The studio has high hopes for another comedy hit next
weekend with ``Bowfinger,'' starring Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's opening of Watergate comedy ``Dick'' was almost dead on
arrival, in 11th with $2.2 million at 1,522 theaters, as customers
ignored positive reviews. ``Dick'' faced the obstacle of being a
political film - probably Hollywood's worst-performing genre in
recent years - and appealing to a target audience of adults with
teen-age stars Michelle Williams and Kirsten Dunst.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend also saw the first disappearance of ``Star Wars -
Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' from the top 10, as the prequel
finished 12th with $2.1 million at 1,188 theaters to pull its
82-day total to $412.7 million, or $48 million short of ``Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Phantom Menace'' jump-started the summer box office,
it has not led since its third weekend. ``Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me'' beat it the following weekend and, in a reflection
of the diversity of the most popular movies, a different film has
led every weekend since - ``Tarzan,'' ``Big Daddy,'' ``Wild Wild
West,'' ``American Pie,'' ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' ``The Haunting,''
``Runaway Bride'' and ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said that trend will likely continue next weekend with
``Bowfinger,'' forecast to top $20 million. Also opening will be
Fox's prison drama ``Brokedown Palace'' and New Line's teen comedy
``Detroit Rock City.''

HORROR FLICKS HAVE OTHER FILMS RUNNING SCARED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Horror films proved potent at the nation's
multiplexes as ``The Sixth Sense'' edged ``The Blair Witch
Project'' with an impressive $25.8 million at 2,161 theaters to
lead the second-highest weekend overall at the nation's box office,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ``Sense,'' with Bruce Willis as a psychologist helping
an 8-year-old boy beset by unseen demons, beat forecasts with the
biggest August opening in history as it eclipsed by $2 million the
record set in 1993 by ``The Fugitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a huge mountain to climb with `Blair Witch' and the
rest of the marketplace being so competitive,'' said Disney
distribution chief Chuck Viane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair Witch,'' made for a miniscule $60,000, continued to
scare up remarkable business with $23.5 million at 2,142 theaters
as Artisan added 1,041 sites for the mock-documentary. Despite
losing 19 percent from last weekend's total, the expansion of
``Blair'' from the art-house circuit to mainstream locales has been
an unqualified success with total gross at $79 million.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Deep Blue Sea'' in fifth and ``The Haunting'' in eighth,
horror films combined for an astounding $67 million as the genre
helped keep moviegoing at a sizzling pace. Overall ticket sales hit
$151 million, falling $5.4 million short of last weekend's all-time
three-day record. Six films topped $10 million; the summer's
cumulative total has nearly matched last summer's $2.58 billion
with four weekends left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall business is just phenomenal,'' said Robert
Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting service. He
noted ``Sixth Sense'' and ``Blair Witch'' had grossed nearly $50
million combined, despite appealing to essentially the same
customer, with ``Sixth Sense'' getting the edge due to strong
performance in Middle American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted ``Sixth Sense'' will take in $88 million
overall while ``Blair'' could hit almost $120 million. Both have
received strong critical support.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing a close third was Paramount's second weekend of
``Runaway Bride'' with $21 million at 3,161 as the romantic comedy
fell 40 percent from its winning perch last weekend. ``Bride'' has
taken in $74 million in 10 days and should easily match the $112
million gross for Julia Roberts' other summer movie, ``Notting
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   MGM's opening of its updated version of ``The Thomas Crown
Affair'' performed in line with expectations in fourth with $14
million at 2,427 theaters as the Pierce Brosnan-Rene Russo teaming
took advantage of a lack of other adult-oriented fare other than
``Runaway Bride.'' ``It's a fair opening for a major star
vehicle,'' said industry tracker Arthur Rockwell, a former MGM
executive. ``The studio was probably hoping for more but that's
tough to do with all the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' second weekend of ``Deep Blue Sea'' followed in
fifth with $11 million at 2,901 sites as the shark-fest lost 42
percent from its previous weekend and pulled its 12-day take past
$45 million. Universal's opening of ``Mystery Men'' came in sixth
with a respectable $10 million at 2,136 theaters after the studio
switched its opening date several times in hopes the quirky comedy
would materialize as a sleeper hit.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's third weekend of ``Inspector Gadget'' finished seventh
with a still-solid $8.4 million at 2,864 locations, topping
DreamWorks' third weekend of ``The Haunting'' with $6.3 million at
2,881 screens as the latter plunged 58 percent from last weekend
and went past $77 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's major disappointment came from Warner's opening of
``The Iron Giant'' in ninth with $5.7 million at 2,179 theaters, as
the animated project failed to generate much box office excitement
despite strong reviews. ``Anyone who's seen this movie loves it,
but it was hard to market because kids feel that it's just for kids
and that's not what a lot of them want to see,'' Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' results underscore the difficulty Warner has
faced in trying to crack the animated market and represent its
third such underperformer following ``Quest for Camelot'' and ``The
King and I.'' ``Warner has had a very cold hand at doing feature
animation,'' Rockwell said, noting that DreamWorks and Paramount
have posted far more success at challenging Disney's kingpin
status.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CANTON, Ohio _ Because they are the Dallas Cowboys, the NFL's most
popular team when it comes to television ratings, they were
selected as the first opponent of the new Cleveland Browns.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The annual AFC-NFC Hall of Fame Game is usually played on
Saturday afternoon after the induction ceremonies for the newest
members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. But this year is unique
because the Browns are back, and ABC wanted to capitalize on their
return.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take a network programming genius to figure out that
if you want ratings beyond what is normal for a preseason game, you
bring in the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Please excuse the Cowboys while they yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's game on Monday Night Football features the rebirth of
the Browns. Fans in Northern Ohio are barking and foaming at the
mouth over the Browns' return, and even though it's merely a
preseason opener, there is a playoff-type atmosphere in this part
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't be concerned with the other team,'' says Cowboys coach
Chan Gailey in a tone that indicates he actually is concerned about
the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Not so much with the Browns, really, but with the collective
attitude of the team. Sure, Gailey wants to win every game, but he
will be happy just to get out of town without suffering more
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their injury list, the Cowboys are in midseason form.
It's difficult to imagine a team entering the preseason opener with
more players on the sideline, which isn't all bad considering the
coaches want to look at a lot of new additions, including several
key draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there will be a sellout crowd at Fawcett Stadium. Fans
will be happy to know that Gailey plans to play quarterback Troy
Aikman, running back Emmitt Smith and receiver Michael Irvin for a
series or two. After the Big Three break a sweat, they will retreat
to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey wants to protect his best players as much as possible.
The Cowboys are favored to win the NFC East again, but they want to
avoid another playoff debacle like last season's shocking loss at
home to Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys enter the game with debilitating injury problems at
defensive back and wide receiver and along both lines.
</P>
<P>
   Browns rookie quarterback Tim Couch, the No. 1 pick in this
year's draft, might develop a false sense of security after he
plays two quarters. Couch will go against a Dallas defense that is
missing its top three cornerbacks _ Deion Sanders, Kevin Mathis and
Kevin Smith _ all of whom are injured.
</P>
<P>
   Once Irvin goes to the bench, the Cleveland cornerbacks might
get overconfident. With James McKnight out for the season and
Rocket Ismail nursing a shoulder injury, the Browns will be
covering Jeff Ogden and Wane McGarity.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity, the rookie from the University of Texas, has been
impressive at camp, and the coaches want to see what he can do in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Cowboys tried to do in the offseason was improve
the team's speed, beginning at receiver. With Ismail and McKnight
out of the game, the Browns won't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to change the mindset of cornerbacks,'' says backup
quarterback Jason Garrett, who will replace Aikman. ``We don't want
them sitting on routes at 10, 12 and 16 yards because they think
they can catch our receivers even if they go by them.''
</P>
<P>
   As Gailey points out, ``We want to change little plays into big
plays on offense.''
</P>
<P>
   That was McGarity's specialty with the Longhorns. Because
McKnight is gone for the season, the door is open for McGarity to
step it up and solve the Cowboys' need for speed.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity isn't the only rookie the coaches can't wait to
evaluate in game conditions. Defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban, the No.
1 draft choice, has been running second team behind Greg Ellis,
last year's No. 1 pick. Depending on the situation and formation,
they might line up on either side. Because Ekuban is a speed rusher
who lacks experience at the position, he should be better on the
right side, but the Cowboys have him on the left side more often.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest surprises of camp is another rookie,
defensive end Peppi Zellner. With Kavika Pittman sidelined because
of an injury, Zellner and free agent Alonzo Spellman will rotate
opposite Ellis and Ekuban. Of the ends who will play tonight, only
Ellis played with the Cowboys last season.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has more depth at end than at tackle. The linemen will be
working against a veteran offensive line Cleveland coach Chris
Palmer put together to protect Couch and to make up for a running
game that could be woefully weak.
</P>
<P>
   Fans in Texas can't wait to see rookie linebacker Dat Nguyen
make his debut. Nguyen, the leading tackler in Texas A&AMP;M history,
has been a fan favorite ever since the Cowboys drafted him. Randall
Godfrey is the new starter in the middle after moving from the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Spellman is one of two veteran free agents the Cowboys are
hoping will play like they did with other teams. Spellman
experienced emotional problems with the Bears and was dumped by
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker Quentin Coryatt is trying to make a comeback
as well. If Coryatt is anywhere close to what he used to be with
Indianapolis before injuries took a toll on his athleticism, he
could be a steal. But he is nursing groin and hamstring injuries.
How much he plays against the Browns remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the Dallas coaches want to see rookie guard Solomon
Page, who is starting in place of the injured Everett McIver. Page
was a tackle in college, but he has moved inside out of necessity.
</P>
<P>
   Compare the Cowboys' problems to those of the Browns. In truth,
Cleveland doesn't have any problems other than trying to keep the
expectations of its fans realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer has a number of veterans who started for other teams last
season, including seven on defense and four in his offensive line.
Ty Detmer is the starting quarterback until Palmer feels Couch is
ready, but Couch will get more work tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' goal is to beat Carolina's 7-9 record in 1995, best
for an NFL expansion team.

CHIEF LAWYER FOR WHITE HOUSE HEADS BACK TO PRIVATE PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House counsel, Charles F.C. Ruff, who led
the successful defense of President Clinton during his impeachment
trial, has left the White House for private practice. He had
announced earlier this summer that he wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked Ruff's top deputy, Cheryl Mills, who appeared
before the Senate in Clinton's defense, to take Ruff's place, but
she has turned him down, James Kennedy, a White House spokesman,
said on Sunday night. She would have become the first black and the
first woman to hold the post in any administration.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Ms. Mills also wanted to leave but would serve as
acting counsel until the president could find a replacement for
Ruff, who is going back to the Washington firm of Covington &AMP;
Burling. Ruff's last day at the White House was Friday, the same
day that Ms. Mills declined the offer to become the president's top
lawyer. The office has a staff of about three dozen people,
including 19 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff, who was named White House counsel on Jan. 7, 1997, was the
fifth person to hold the job in the Clinton administration and the
longest-serving.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mills has represented Clinton and his wife, Hillary, from
the beginning of the administration. John D. Podesta, the White
House chief of staff, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying
Ms. Mills, who is 34, ``is tired and wants to get her life
centered.''
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's impeachment trial, Ms. Mills' summation was
noteworthy for her praise of Clinton's record on civil rights and
for her drawing attention to her own race and sex. From the well of
the Senate she told the nation: ``I stand here before you today
because President Bill Clinton believed I could stand here for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   She argued that Clinton's extramarital affair with Monica
Lewinsky, a former White House intern, was ``not attractive or
admirable'' but said his ``record on civil rights, on women's
rights, on all our rights, is unimpeachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was acquitted.
