<HEADLINE> EU Urges Japan to Reform Distribution System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, Friday urged Japan to
undertake fundamental reforms in its distribution system in order
to reduce the high cost of doing business in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive body made the appeal Friday in Brussels, with
the publication of the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling in
Kodak-Fuji case expected in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese distribution system needs to be reformed urgently
in order to reduce the high cost of doing business in the Japanese
market, to improve market access for foreign exporters and service
providers, and to provide more consumer choice," said Sir Leon
Brittan, the European trade commissioner.
</P>
<P>
In the Kodak-Fuji case, the U.S. government took Japan to the
WTO Disputes Settlement Body over restrictions in access for
foreign companies to the Japanese photographic film and paper
market. The commission joined the panel as third party due to its
economic interest in the market.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon said the EU executive body had presented many
proposals to Japan, expecting to see concrete improvements both
through deregulation and rigorous enforcement of competition rules.
</P>
<P>
During the course of the Kodak-Fuji case, Sir Leon said, Japan
said that it had a policy of ensuring non-discriminatory access to
the Japanese distribution system and improving market access in the
photographic film sectors and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to track closely the implementation of this policy
and we welcome the fact that the U.S. and other WTO members intend
to do likewise," he said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has recently sent a total of 200
deregulation proposals to the Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
The commission also noted that the implementation of Japan's
new three-year deregulation program from April 1998 provides an
opportunity for measures to be taken to facilitate access to the
Japanese distribution system for foreign companies.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Send More Fighter Planes to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- British Defense Secretary George
Robertson announced here today that Britain would send eight
Tornado aircraft to the Gulf region within the next few days to
beef up British military presence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Robertson said in a written answer to the British parliament
that the government made the decision following a review of
Britain's military presence in the Gulf "in view of the continuing
refusal of the Iraqi regime to comply fully with the requirements
of the United Nations Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"I have concluded that, as a further precautionary measure, we
should deploy eight Tornado GR1 aircraft, with support, to
Kuwait," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
A BBC television report said that the eight Tornados are
currently based at Brueggen airbase on the Dutch-German border.
</P>
<P>
"With the agreement of the government of Kuwait, appropriate
planning in hand, the Tornados will deploy in the next few days,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Since the latest eruption of the U.N.-Iraq crisis, Britain has
already sent one of its aircraft carriers and six "sea Harrier"
planes to the region.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Unemployment Rate Rises to 8.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's unemployment rate rose
0.3 percentage points to 8.9 percent in January, Statistics Canada
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics agency said that the country's employment was
unchanged in January, following strong growth of 366,000 over the
previous 10 months.
</P>
<P>
But unemployment grew by an estimated 54,000, due both to a
rise in temporary layoffs in areas affected by the ice storm and
an increase in the number of people entering the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The majority of job losses happened around the city of
Montreal, where the weather's wrath was most severe.
</P>
<P>
In Ontario province where the storm was limited to its eastern
part, employment grew strongly, rising by 39,000 jobs in the
month.
</P>
<P>
The province of Alberta gained 22,000 jobs and retained the
fastest pace of job growth in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nordingham's Houghton Takes over Chinese National Squad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Feburary 6 (Xinhua) -- Nordingham Forest's assistant
coach Bob Houghton has been picked up as the head coach of the
Chinese national team, the Chinese Football Association (CFA)
announced here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The position has been vacant after former coach Qi Wusheng
resigned following China's heart-broken defeat in the World Cup
qualifying round last November.
</P>
<P>
Houghton, 51, who arrived here from England on Thursday, will
meet the newly-built national squad in Shanghai on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Houghton, whose contract signed only to the end of the year,
said his goal was to bring together all the Chinese top players
and take a concrete step toward the 2002 World Cup
Finals. Although the news had leaked a few days before, CFA
only comfirmed it today.
</P>
<P>
CFA didn't reveal how much salary Houghton would get.
</P>
<P>
It was said that CFA had targeted a half dozen famous
foreign coachs but finally nailed Houghton.
</P>
<P>
Houghton is not the first foreign coach for the Chinese
national team. Klaus Schlappner, a well-known german coach, was
invited to take charge the squad in 1992, but he lost the position
after failing to steer the team to the World Cup Finals in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The team will fly to Haigeng camp in Yunnan province
for a 20-day training in preparation for the four-team Dynasity
Cup Tournament, starting early March in Japan with South Korea,
Japan and Hong Kong attending.
</P>
<P>
Houghton, whose Nordingham Forest now top the England's
Division A League, had stayed with the Chinese side for a
short period last year as an advisor and a lecturer.
</P>
<P>
The Briton watched China's several matches in the build-up
for the qualifier of World Cup finals. "As a foreign coach, He has
a better understanding about the Chinese team," said Zhang Jilong,
vice president of CFA.
</P>
<P>
"The final decision to choose Houghton as the head coach was
settled after CFA carefully denied several possible foreign
and local candidates," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Houghton believed that it would take a long way for the Chinese
team to qualify for the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The Briton also said that through the close cooperation and
hard efforts between him and CFA officials, the Chinese squad is
likely to achieve good results under his guide.
</P>
<P>
Houghton has been a coach in the first division clubs in the
United States, Sweden, Saudi Arabia, England and Greece from early
1970s. He guided the Malmo of Sweden to a four-time league
champion and final of European Champions Cup.
</P>
<P>
But Houghton is expected to face heavy pressure from nearly one
hundred million Chinese soccer fans. The world's most populous
country, who has built up the world largest soccer market after
introducing a professional league in 1994, has seen all its
previous five bids for the World Cup finals ending in disastrous
failures.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed, 3 Wounded in Explosions in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Three people were killed and
three others wounded Friday in a series of bomb explosions in
south Lebanon, local radio Voice of the People reported.
</P>
<P>
Two members of the pro-Israeli South Lebanese Army (SLA) were
killed and two others wounded by bombs planted by Lebanese
resistance fighters in Jezzine, north of the "security Zone" set
up by Israel in south Lebanon, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance movement has claimed responsibility for
the bomb explosions, and the SLA has admitted the casualties,
according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, a Lebanese civilian was killed in a bomb
explosion planted by Israeli troops in the village of Mjdel Zoun
bordering the "security zone," while another was wounded in the
nearby village of Yatril by Israeli artillery shelling.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the so-called "security zone" in 1985 to
allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas, who have been fighting to drive the Israelis
out of south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, representatives from the Jezzine area delivered a
letter to Lebanese President Elias Hrawi Friday.
</P>
<P>
The letter called for a halt of using bombs in the conflicts
between Lebanese resistance force and the Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
It said that bomb explosions always lead to the casualties of
innocent people.

MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reiterated that the security of Europe should be ensured by
Europeans themselves, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday.

Russia will pursue such a policy despite the dislike of some

Yeltsin was also optimistic about his coming visit to Italy,

</P>
<P>
The visit, which will mainly aim at improving relations with
Italy, its second largest trading partner in Europe, will not be
pointless, said the president.
</P>
<P>
The trade between the two countries has showed a very powerful
growth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin hoped that during the visit, Italy will recognize
Russia, which has seen positive industrial growth and zero
inflation in the past year, as a country with a market economy.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Sherritt to Build Power Plant in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Sherritt International
Corp. is building a 150-million US dollar power generation plant
in Cuba, despite the United States' bitter opposition to foreign
investment there.
</P>
<P>
The company has created Sherritt Power Corp. to oversea the
project, which would use national gas to fire up generators to
produce electricity, reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt International will take a 49-percent equity stake for
14 million dollars in the new company and buy 17 million dollars
of the notes. The total money to be raised in the market could be
up to 150 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government was reported to have approved the
electricity venture with Cuban partners to be built in four phases
and targeted for completion by April 2000.
</P>
<P>
Sherritt International has been active in Cuba's energy
industry since 1992 and wants to strengthen its investments in
mining and expand into real estate, sugar and communications,
according to the company's spokeswoman Patrice Merrin Best.
</P>
<P>
It is one of a handful of companies singled out under the
controversial U.S. Helms-Burton law, which prohibits trade with
and investment in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Four of the company's executives have already been blacklisted
by the U.S. under the law and can't enter the United States.

<HEADLINE> US Jobless Rate Near 24-Year Low in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Strong job growth,
particularly in construction and real estate, helped hold the U.S.
unemployment rate at 4.7 percent in January which is near a
24-year low, the Labor Department reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate, the same as
December, was just a bit over November's 4.6 percent rate, lowest
since 1973, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. employers added 358,000 jobs to their payrolls last
month. Construction accounted for 92,000 new jobs, the largest
monthly gain in the category in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
Today's report shows that Asia's financial problems haven't yet
dampened the strongest American labor market in a generation,
despite of the fact that factories report weaker orders in
December and January.
</P>
<P>
In January, only 9,000 of the new jobs came in government, the
rest in private industry.
</P>
<P>
Real estate services had an unusually strong month, adding
10,000 jobs. Computer and data processing services and engineering
and management services continued their rapid growth. However,
health services grew more slowly than usual.
</P>
<P>
Department stores added 31,000 jobs. But miscellaneous retail
establishments, such as book stores, toy stores and catalog sales
operations, had larger-than-usual layoffs following robust holiday
hiring.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing added 43,000 jobs in January, in line with the
growth of the previous three months, with strength in fabricated
metal products, industrial machinery, electronic components and
aircraft. There were job losses in apparel, textiles and leather
products.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, the department added statistics on
unemployment by educational level for workers 25 years and older.
Joblessness was 7.2 percent among those without a high school
diploma, 3.9 percent for high school graduates with no college,
3.2 percent for people with post-high school education but without
a bachelor's degree and 1.9 percent for college graduates.
</P>
<P>
In another sign of strength in January, average hourly wages
rose 4 cents to 12.51 dollars. Over the past year, they're up 46
cents, or 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The average workweek increased from 34.6 hours to 34.8 hours,
seasonally adjusted. But the manufacturing workweek edged from
42.2 hours to 42.1 hours. Factory overtime held at 4.9 hours.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Blames Media for Distorting Land Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday told the international community that his
government had no evil intentions in trying to resolve land
imbalances, but had become a victim of biased media coverage.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon he hosted for diplomatic corps and
representatives of international organizations based in Zimbabwe,
Mugabe said the donor community had been misled by distorted
press reports.
</P>
<P>
"We want to assure the donor community that our intentions are
not evil ones as some donors might have been led to believe by
the barrage of largely distorted, biased, negative, mischievous
and unconstructive press reports concerning the government's
intentions on the land question," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the fact was that his government was trying to resolve
the situation of imbalance in a peaceful and orderly manner.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe last year announced a list of over 1,400 farms which
have been targeted for designation, but the government has
promised that it will only compensate for improvements made and
not for the land itself.
</P>
<P>
The move was met with criticism from the major donor of the
resettlement program, Britain, which has said it would only offer
financial support if the program was meant to resolve the needs
of the poor.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe, who own
most of the targeted land, have disagreed with the way the
government is going about land acquisition and have offered its
own land plan, saying enough land could be obtained on a willing
seller-willing buyer basis.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe also sought to reassure the international community
that the violent demonstrations which rocked the country in
recent months were not a reflection of the wishes of the masses
of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"I want to assure you that those violent and riotous
demonstrations have been condemned by the majority of the
peace-loving people of Zimbabwe who do not wish to see their
recurrence," he said.

LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Office Minister
Derek Fatchett will visit Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt
next week to discuss with leaders of the three countries the
current U.N.-Iraq crisis and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office statement issued this afternoon said that the
target of the mission on 10-13 February was to brief Britain's
Gulf allies "on the UK's efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution
to the crisis."
</P>
<P>
Fatchett was quoted as saying, "Britain has strong historical
ties with the countries of the Gulf. We were resolute in standing
by our regional allies when Kuwait was invaded in 1991."
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein is threatening Gulf security again by refusing
to let the U.N.'s weapons inspectors do their job," Fathchett
said. "In the face of this renewed threat, our commitment to
enforcing the international community's will is unwavering."
</P>
<P>
Fatchett stressed that cooperation with Britain's Gulf partners
"will play an essential part in bringing about the diplomatic
solution we all want."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Iraqi situation, Fatchett will discuss with his
Egyptian hosts the Middle East peace process, other regional
issues and bilateral cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N.-Iraq standoff continued deteriorating as
the British government announced this afternoon that it would send
eight Tornado fighter planes to Kuwait in an effort to beef up
British military presence in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> IMF Board of Governors Approves Quota Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Governors of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Friday announced the
approval of an increase of 45 percent in the total IMF quotas to
approximately 221 billion Special Drawing Rights (SDR).
</P>
<P>
The amount is equivalent to about 288 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the resolution, which required an 85 percent
majority of the total voting power of the IMF's membership,
completes the 11th General Review of Quotas.
</P>
<P>
A member that does not have overdue obligations to the General
Resources Account of the IMF will be able to consent to the
increase in its quota at any time before January 29, 1999, an IMF
news release noted.
</P>
<P>
In order to meet that deadline, the member will have to have
completed before that date whatever action may be necessary under
its laws to enable it to give its consent. No increase in quotas
shall take effect before the date on which the IMF determines that
members having not less that 85 percent of the total of quotas on
December 23, 1997 have consented to the increases in their quotas.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- France Friday welcomed the
extension by the United Nations Security Council of the mandate
for the Inter-African Mission of Supervision of Bangui Accords
(MISAB) in the Central African Republic until March 16.
</P>
<P>
"This vote is the first step toward the definition of the next
peacekeeping operation (in the Central African Republic)," said
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
The MISAB, manned by soldiers from Senegal, Chad, Gabon, Mali,
Burkina Faso and Togo, has been deployed since January 1997 in the
Central African Republic with logistic and financial support from
France.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Alleged to Resume Attack on ECOMOG </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said Friday that the
military junta has resumed attack against the west African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG operating in that troubled
country.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the Nigerian Defense Headquarters
here Friday afternoon said the ECOMOG troops would fight against
"the aggression of the junta" to vigorously defend its positions.
</P>
<P>
The latest development was confirmed by a British Broadcasting
Corporation report monitored here.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the junta and its cohorts
"resumed the use of land mines, helicopter gunship and gunboats
to prosecute hostilities on ECOMOG and all law abiding citizens
of Sierra Leone at about 17:00 p.m. Thursday".
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the ECOMOG troops have remained steadfast in their
determination to maintain the Conakry Peace Accord but have
resolved to vigorously defend its positions from the aggression
of the junta."
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord signed last October in Conakry, Guinea,
the junta is to hand over power to ousted president Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah on April 22.
</P>
<P>
But the peace process has been deadlocked as the junta leader,
Johnny Paul Koroma, said it was unrealistic to keep the timetable
with the delay of scheduled disarmament exercise and the failure
to need other requirements of his military regime.
</P>
<P>
The press release, signed by Lt.-Col. Sa Tella, deputy defense
spokesman, also said, "recently more than 100 troops of the junta
defected to ECOMOG positions and pledged their readiness to
cooperate with the whole world and ECOMOG to flush out the junta
and reinstate President Kabbah."
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Kobi, a colonel and ECOMOG commander at Lungi near the
Sierra Leone capital Freetown, said earlier more than 800
soldiers and policemen of the junta had surrendered to ECOMOG.
Many of them with their weapons.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC, the fighting between the junta forces
and ECOMOG troops is still going on this morning with heavy
shelling across Freetown.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people in military fatigue were seen going up and
down in the town, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Kobi as saying that although the junta forces
resumed their attack this morning, ECOMOG still held its
positions.
</P>
<P>
"They are shelling and we are responding," the ECOMOG
commander said.
</P>
<P>
Refuting report that ECOMOG helicopters going back and forth
at its Lungi base Thursday, transporting the pro-Kabbah civil
defense group known as Kamajors and other things thus starting
the fighting, Kobi said the copters were carrying food stuffs for
ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, there are about 4,000 ECOMOG
soldiers stationed near Freetown.

<HEADLINE> UN Appeals for 10 Mln Dlrs for Repatriation of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
refugee agency today appealed for more than 10 million U.S.
dollars for the repatriation of refugees of Mali and Niger who are
in Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said
the sum would cover activities during 1998.
</P>
<P>
More than 120,000 have returned to Mali since 1995. Over 90,000
of them received assistance from UNHCR. At least 11,000 of the
remaining refugees are expected to be repatriated in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations refugee agency said it was supporting
reconciliation meetings between refugees and other communities in
Mali. UNHCR is also encouraging the country' authorities to visit
camps in order to build confidence among former exiles about the
possibility of returning home.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, the integration process in Mali is fragile
and depends heavily on the development of the arid north of the
country. the agency said it was digging and remarking 135 water
outlets of all types in that region.
</P>
<P>
In Niger, the refugee agency was planning to complete its
repatriation operation during 1998 if security concerns,
particularly criminality, did not multiply.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 4,000 refugee who fled political turmoil and
armed rebellion in the late 1980s and renewed insurgency in the
early 1990s are set to return from Algeria.

<HEADLINE> Book on Refugees Launched in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- "The State of the World's
Refugees 1997-98", published by the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), was formally launched here
Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference to launch the new book, David
Lambo, UNHCR regional liaison representative, said the African
continent may have the largest number of refugees in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and most of
member states have made resolutions and activities to the problem
of refugees in the continent.
</P>
<P>
Lambo said, the UNHCR's new book takes a detailed look at the
problem of forced displacement, focusing on those groups who are
of primary concern to the organization: refugees, asylum seekers,
the internally displaced, returnee and stateless people, adding
that the book also provides a detailed agenda for action,
suggesting ways in which the protection of people might be
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
Drawing upon case studies from every part of the world, the
book suggests that humanitarian action can play an important role
in defending the rights of people who have been uprooted or
threatened with displacement. Referring to this, he stressed that
such action can never act as a substitute for the protection
which states must provide for their own citizens.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of OAU commission of twenty on refugees, Ismail
Chergui, Algerian Ambassador to Ethiopia and First Vice-Chairman
of OAU Commission of Twenty on refugees, introduced OAU's
resolutions and activities on protection and resolution of
African refugees and displaced people during the last few years
at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the book launched here today, some 22.72 million
people around the world belong to people of concern to the UNHCR.
Among them, 13.2 million are refugees, 4.85 million internally
displaced people, 3.31 million returnee and 1.36 million people
are others of concern.
</P>
<P>
In sub-Saharan Africa, 7.84 million people are people of
concern to the UNHCR. Among them, 4.34 million are African
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Answering questions at the press conference, Lambo said,
Ethiopia, at the center of the Horn of Africa, provides asylum to
refugees from Somalia, Sudan, Djibouti, Kenya and various other
countries with the total refugees population of some 321,100 at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an estimated 24,000 Ethiopian refugees are waiting
to return home, including some 22,000 Ethiopians living in Sudan,
1,200 in Kenya and the rest in Yemen and other countries.

<HEADLINE> No Evident Link Between Breast Implant, Disease: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Silicone breast implants are
unlikely to damage the immune system and cause disease, according
to a new study published today.
</P>
<P>
Researchers wrote in the British Medical Journal that little
likelihood of association has been found between breast implants
and connective tissue disease.
</P>
<P>
Proportion of the hospitalized among women with implants was
not significantly higher than is found among those who have not
had implants, they said.
</P>
<P>
The research was carried out in Sweden among over 7,000 women
with breast implants and a control group of over 3,000 women who
had undergone reduction surgeries.
</P>
<P>
The authors, from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found
that of the women with implants, 29 were hospitalized for
connective tissue disease as compared to a national average of
25.5.
</P>
<P>
And of the women who had undergone reduction, 14 needed
hospital treatment as opposed to the expected 10.5.
</P>
<P>
After a direct comparison of the two groups, the researchers
found that those with implants had a slightly lower risk of
connective tissue disease than those who had undergone breast
reduction
</P>
<P>
"Our data add to the emerging consensus that there is no
important association between breast implants and connective
tissue disease." they concluded.

<HEADLINE> Somalia's Baidoa Still Under Control of H. Aidid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 6 (Xinhua) -- As the time set for the
withdrawal of Hussein Aidid's forces from the town of Baidoa has
expired Thursday, there are no visible signs yet for the pull
back of those forces from the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cairo peace declaration, Hussein Aidid's
forces should have pulled back from the Rahanwein dominated
regions of Bay and Bakol 10 days before the convening of the
National Reconciliation Conference scheduled to begin on February
15.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Hussein Aidid's top aids, there are
extensive meetings currently undergoing between Hussein Aidid and
high level politicians from the Rahanwein communities in charge
of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA) here in Mogadishu for the
mechanisms in which the force encampment would smoothly work out.
</P>
<P>
The top aids also said, according to the Cairo agreement,
combatant forces from both sides should be demobilized and
neutral forces should be deployed there to safeguard the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hussein Aidid is also meeting his force commanders
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
The official who declined to reveal his name said he is not
sure whether the Reconciliation Conference will start according
to the time table; "so the dead line for the withdrawal will
still remain 10 days before the conference is to begin in
Baidoa," he said, added: "we're ready to abide by the agreement."
</P>
<P>
According to confidential reports, the financial package for
convening the conference in Baidoa is yet to arrive.
</P>
<P>
Since their arrival late last month, Hussein Aidid and his
counterpart politicians have been busy working on pacifying the
capital where tangible progress has been made after successive
peace rallies have been held across the green lines and in
Mogadishu's main soccer stadium. They were followed by a tour by
the former rival factions with hundreds of battle wagons of the
main streets of the capital including Bermuda neighborhood where
the heaviest armed confrontation occurred in the last six years.
</P>
<P>
Streams of people can now be seen walking in the streets of
Bermuda and across the former green lines as some people are also
repairing their houses so as to revitalize the life back to
normal after six years.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Mogadishu citizens are still looking forward to
seeing the port and airport being opened in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
Late General Mohamed Aidid has invaded the regions of Bay and
Bakol in late 1995 to destroy a local autonomous authority
established by the U.N. Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in the
region, something he has seen as a threat to his dream
administration.
</P>
<P>
The town of Baidoa, 245 km Southwest of Mogadishu, has since
then experienced a series of armed confrontations. However, since
the Cairo meeting those regions have been calm as their political
leaders have themselves been among the signatories of the Cairo
peace deal.

NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The Rwanda army Friday mounted
a big military operation to dislodge Hutu militia out of Kinigi,
military sources in the area have indicated.

rebels from that area," Ndahiro explained.

No detail has so far filtered about the outcome of the
operation.

<TEXT>

SANAA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Justice Shabib
al-Maliki, envoy of President Saddam Hussein, arrived here Friday
on a short visit to Yemen during which he will deliver a message
to Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh from Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the Iraqi envoy told the Yemeni News Agency
that the message deals with the latest developments in the crisis
between Iraq and the United States over the U.N. arms inspections
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki accused the U.S. administration of waging an unjust
campaign and attempting to create the environment that can allow
an unjustifiable aggression on Iraq despite the promising
diplomatic efforts made by Russia, France and the Arab League.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of eliminating weapons of mass destruction in
Iraq from searching Iraqi presidential palaces suspected of hiding
banned weapons, triggering its current stand-off with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to take military actions to
force Iraq to grant free access to the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Al-Maliki said he deemed the U.S. threat unjustified since Iraq
had fulfilled all its obligations under the U.N. Security Council
resolutions.

LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain has called on the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to introduce a fiscal
transparency code to prevent sudden outbreak of financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that reform of the IMF, including the
allocation of new funds, will be the top agenda at the G-7 finance
ministers meeting here later this month.
</P>
<P>
The Times today quoted British Chancellor Gordon Brown as
saying, "Firms and markets need clear signals from governments
about policy if they are to make the right decisions and feel
confident about the future."
</P>
<P>
Brown, who spoke at a meeting of European and Asian finance
deputies (ASEM) Thursday, also gave a strong warning against
retreating into protectionism in an attempt to resolve the
problems.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM meeting concluded with a call for the IMF to improve
its surveillance techniques and for the establishment of a
regional surveillance organization for Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, Sir Nigel Wicks, who chaired the meeting, said he
believed the impact of the Asian financial crisis would be
manageable for the world economy and "relatively modest" in
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Supports PLO in Further Talks With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia backs the line of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in its further talks with
Israel, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Friday when
meeting with secretary of the PLO executive committee Makhmud
Abbas in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by the Russian Foreign Ministry,
Primakov exchanged views with Makhmud Abbas on the peace process
in the Middle East, which is facing difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that unswerving observance of the earlier
achieved agreements, observance of all obligations, particularly
those related to the redeployment of Israeli troops in the West
Bank of Jordan, impermissibility of unilateral actions to build
settlements, the effective Palestinian-Israeli interaction in
agreed upon areas are the earnest of the advance of the
Palestinian-Israeli talks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that Russia supported the PLO leadership's line
of consolidating and developing Palestine's self-government and
continuing the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, for his part, spoke highly of Russia's efforts toward
normalization of the Middle East situation and political

<HEADLINE> London, Paris Stocks Hit New Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
all surged and ended the week higher Friday, with London and Paris
storming to new record closing highs, propelled by US economic
data which raised hopes of no further interest rate rise anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market made the record books again
after a morning of sluggish falls, with the FTSE 100 index closing
23.3 points up at a new record high of 5,629.7.
</P>
<P>
The banking sector, which had been one of the main powerhouses
driving the stock market up, staged a dramatic comeback after this
morning's fall.
</P>
<P>
The market was also supported by news that the US economy is in
good growth and under weak inflationary pressures and by another
solid performance on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index in Paris also ended the week 27.06 points
firmer at 3,216.66, an all-time peak for the second session in a
row.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that shares prices edged into positive territory
following stronger-than-expected US jobs data.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, at floor trading, which closes before Wall Street
opens, the DAX-30 share index ended down 52.13 at 4,496.33 as the
market consolidated from Thursday's record gains ahead of the
release of US jobs data later.
</P>
<P>
However, in later electronic trading, the IBIS DAX index closed
42.19 points higher at 4,536.91.

<P>
ATHENS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece's armed forces would not
be involved in any military actions against Iraq, Greek Defense
Undersecretary Dimitris Apostolakis said in parliament Friday.
</P>
<P>
Apostolakis stressed that although Greece would be committed to
obey any decision made by the U.N. Security Council, it would not
be necessary for Athens to contribute its own armed forces to any
such military operations against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As for a recent visit to Athens by U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for European Affairs Mark Grossman, he said that Greece had
undertaken no commitment to Washington because the latter had not
requested Greece's assistance or facilities in any possible
military operations which might be carried out against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Grossman, Apostolakis said Athens also
expressed its opposition to the trade sanctions against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Strong Quake Jolts Afghanistan, 3,200 Killed:Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- A strong earthquake jolted
northern Afghanistan this week, leaving at least 3,200 people dead
and thousands of others homeless, the Taliban's ambassador to
Pakistan and embassy officials confirmed here late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Maulawi Dilawar told Xinhua by telephone that the quake, which
measured 6.1 on the Richter Scale, hit the country's northern
Takhor province Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Afghan sources here said news of the quake in the remote
northern province was sketchy and it did not reach the Afghan
capital of Kabul until Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dilawar said the epicenter of the quake was near Rustaq, about
20 km northwest of Talogan, provincial capital of Takhor, which is
controlled by anti-Taliban warlord and former Afghanistan's
military chief Ahmad Masood.
</P>
<P>
He said official figures put the latest death toll at 3,200 and
about 2,000 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Yusef, an official of the Taliban government's embassy
here, said earlier that as many as 4,000 people were killed in the
quake and 15,000 left homeless.
</P>
<P>
Dilawar said Taliban authorities had expressed its readiness to
provide unconditional assistance to the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Omar, the supreme leader of the hardline Taliban
militia, has also expressed deep grief over the disaster and
appealed to the international community for immediate aid.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Friday night said six villages in Chaiaab
district were completely demolished in the quake and about 3,000
bodies had already been recovered from the debris.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Killings in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
condemned Friday recent killings in the British province of
Northern Ireland and urged groups to focus on talks instead.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair at the White House, Clinton said the United
States would continue to do all it could to advance the cause of
peace, and asked Blair how best the U.S. could help.
</P>
<P>
"I unequivocally condemn recent sectarian killings and beatings
and threats" in Northern Ireland, Clinton said. "Nothing worth
having can be accomplished through violence."
</P>
<P>
Clinton also commended Blair for the "courageous steps" he is
taking "in cooperation with the Irish government to promote a
climate of confidence and hope in Northern Ireland."
</P>
<P>
He said multi-party peace negotiations, which resume Monday in
Belfast, "provide the best chance for a real solution to that
conflict. I urge all the parties to show the vision and
forbearance and the determination to succeed."
</P>
<P>
In response, Blair said he appreciated the willingness shown by
Clinton and members of Congress he met Thursday to advance the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It isn't going to be easy, these things never are," Blair
said. "But we do believe that we have the best chance that we have
had for many generations to secure peace. And I wanted to
emphasize to you our total and complete determination and
commitment to find a peaceful way through."
</P>
<P>
"What we must ensure is that those random, brutal, unjustified
actions of violence, perpetrated by a small majority, must not
frustrate the wish of the overwhelming majority of people in
Northern Ireland to secure a peaceful and stable future for
themselves," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The British prime minister arrived here Thursday for his first
official visit to the United States since he took office.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan-IMF Talks on Loans May Reopen Later This </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) may reopen negotiations with Kenya on aid loans in the
second half of this year, Reimer Carstens, the IMF resident
representative, told Xinhua Friday.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of talks over a three-year 205 million U.S.
Dollar aid loans halted mid last year, is widely believed to be
key for re-building up confidence of foreign investors to Kenya
now suffering from poor infrastructure, El Nino rains and tribal
violence.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very optimistic (about the talks being resumed)," said
Carstens in an exclusive interview with Xinhua ahead of Sunday's
arrival of a six-member IMF team led by Goodall Gondwe, deputy
director of the IMF's African Department.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi "is most likely to meet the
chief of the team," said Carstens.
</P>
<P>
The team will stay here for two weeks to review current
economic reforms and "determine measures that could be taken to
maintain macro-economic stability," especially in the budget
term, according to a governmental statement issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall in the budget of the 1997/98 fiscal year ending
on June 30 this year, partly caused by the government's
compromise to raise teachers's wages of up to 200 percent, will
be seriously discussed by the two sides, said Carstens.
</P>
<P>
He said the team will not fix the date for the negotiations
but will expectedly lay the basis for initiating talks once it is
satisfied with implementation of the actions which Kenya agreed
to take during the last IMF visit in August and September.
</P>
<P>
At that time, The Kenyan government pledged to "strengthen
management of the energy sector, safeguard the independence of
the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA), ensure that Anti-Corruption
Authority would be independent and establish accountability for
past financial infractions."
</P>
<P>
IMF is satisfied with the progress so far Kenya has made in
these fields, said Carstens, citing the improvement in energy
sector, the creation of an anti-graft authority and the
staffdowning of KRA.
</P>
<P>
However, such progresses are not enough to meet the IMF
demands, he stressed, adding that ensuring the accountability and
transparency in the management of public finances is "the most
outstanding issue."
</P>
<P>
He also complained that the Kenyan government moves "very
slow" in dealing with exposed corruption cases, especially in the
famous Goldenburg scandal.
</P>
<P>
The IMF signed with Kenya the three-year loan package under
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in April 1995
and stopped the disbursement of the first year's 37 million
Dollar slice on July 31, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Hopes now hinge on salvaging the remaining 148 million Dollars
and accompanying structural adjustment credits from the World
Bank.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Briefs Annan on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Ministers of ECOWAS Committee of
Five on Sierra Leone Friday briefed UN Secretary-general Kofi
Annan on the situation in the crisis-ridden west African country
before a briefing to the UN Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The committee, led by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi,
also sought the support of the UN to ensure that the peace plan
for Sierra Leone was implemented within the stipulated time, the
News Agency of Nigeria reported.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) set up
the committee in the wake of last May 25 coup that toppled the
legitimate government led by President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The committee, made of Nigeria, Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Guinea
and Liberia, signed a peace plan with the ruling military junta
last October in Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the junta is to quit office by April 22 this
year.
</P>
<P>
However, Ikimi told the secretary-general that the junta in
Sierra Leone had refused to implement the peace plan by setting
conditions which included re-composition of the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG and the release of their
deputy leader Foday Sankoh from Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the junta has indicated that the April 22
deadline will not be possible, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that ECOWAS was not ready to yield to the junta's
demand and would want the Security Council and the international
community to send a clear message that the deadline is still
valid.
</P>
<P>
According to Ikimi, ECOMOG has not been able to deploy its
troops because of the intransigence of the junta. The lack of UN
military observer mission to support the efforts of ECOWAS has
also placed the sub-region in a "dilemma".
</P>
<P>
The committee briefed the UN on the situation in Sierra Leone
last November.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Ikimi noted, the situation there has gotten worse
as the junta created conditions to impede the implementation of
the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Annan pledged the UN's assistance at
implementing the peace agreement and promised to make a
recommendation to the Security Council for a military observer
team for Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fighting has resumed between ECOMOG and junta
forces in the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The two sides exchanged heavy shellings. No casualty figures
have been available.

ADDIS ABABA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Addis Ababa Water and
Sewerage Services Authority announced Friday that emergency water
supply projects aimed at tackling shortage of water in the
capital city will be completed in July this year.

underground water supply development and the Dire Dam project, it
could provide 114,000 cubic meters of additional water daily to
the city.
</P>
<P>
Addis Ababa City needs 230,000 cubic meters of water a day and
the current supply stands at 150,000 cubic meters daily only.
However, about 30-40 percent of the 150,000 cubic meters of water
supply is wasted due to dilapidated and faulty pipelines,
according to the authority.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Blair Threaten Iraq With Tough Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and British Prime Minister both warned Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein Friday that they were prepared to take tough action if he
did not comply with U.N. resolutions over weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference, Clinton said the United States and
Britain "stand together" with a determination to "prevent him
(Saddam) from threatening his neighbors and the world with weapons
of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
"Let me be clear, if Saddam Hussein does not comply with the
unanimous will of the international community, we must be prepared
to act," he said.
</P>
<P>
And Blair echoed Clinton with the remarks that "we must
prepare."
</P>
<P>
Blair said he and Clinton discussed a range of different
topics. "At the top of the list, of course, was the situation in
respect of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"What we agreed was that we had to do three things in
particular," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blair outlined the three things as the first to "educate" the
public opinion to get known the importance of weapons inspections;
the second to solve the Iraqi crisis through diplomacy, which he
said should be "based on, and fully consistent with, the
principles that we have set out;" and the third to prepare for
military action "in case diplomacy cannot work."
</P>
<P>
Britain is the only country that stands firm with the United
States. Other European countries and Middle East states show no
enthusiasm for military action and the three other permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council, Russia, France and China,
are opposed to any military action.
</P>
<P>
While Clinton said there was more international support for the
tough U.S. and British line than it may appear, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen expressed disappointment with the response
of other U.N. Security Council members on the U.S. line as he
started his Europe and Gulf trip to rally support for possible
military action.
</P>
<P>
"I have been disappointed with the Security Council's action to
date that they have passed resolutions and yet seem unwilling to
condemn Saddam's action or say that he has been in either
significant or material breach," Cohen said.

WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
vowed on Friday that a fatal cablecar disaster in Italy caused by
a low-flying U.S. warplane, would be fully investigated.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint news conference with visiting British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Clinton said that he called Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi and told him that he felt "heartsick" about
the disaster.
</P>
<P>
"I would make absolutely sure there was a no holds barred, full
investigation on what happened; that the Italians would be kept
fully informed and be a part of it," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said military flights such as the one involved in the
disaster were "inherently dangerous" but pledged, "I will do
everything I can to find out what happened and take appropriate
action and to satisfy the people of Italy that we have done the
right thing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, the U.S. military acknowledged that the
EA-6B warplane that caused the disaster in which 20 people were
killed was flying far too low. It should have been no lower than
304 meters above the ground.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was based at Aviano, Italy, part of the
NATO-led effort to patrol Bosnia, slashed through the cables of a
ski lift car at the resort of Cavalese in northern Italy, sending
the victims hurtling to their deaths on Tuesday.
</P>

The victims included a 13-year-old boy and tourists from Italy,
Germany, Belgium, Poland, the Netherlands and Austria.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Government
categorically rejected the main parts of the new oil-for-food plan
proposed by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday, according to a
letter from the Iraqi Government which was released here today.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the Security Council of the United Nations,
Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-sahaf said Iraq opposed
the UN directives on how goods should be purchased and
distributed.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan Monday recommended to raise the
amount of oil Iraq could sell from 2 billion U.S. dollars to 5.2
billion for the next six months, a move aimed to alleviate
sufferings of the Iraqi people from the effects of UN sanctions
imposed on it since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"If no increase had been approved, no oil will be pumped before
Iraq has prepared a supplementary plan concerning the increase and
the Secretary-General has approved that plan," said the Iraqi
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi Government has sole responsibility for preparing the
purchase and distribution plan. We categorically reject this
formula and wish to state that any addition to the purchase and
distribution plan remains the sole responsibility of the Iraqi
Government," the foreign minister was responding to the the UN
directive that says how much money is to be spent for certain
categories of foods.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council is expected to meet to review the
recommendations by the UN chief next Monday.

League (AL) Esmat Abdel-Meguid said here Friday that international
efforts were still going on to help end peacefully the standoff
between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Russian envoy Victor Posuvalyuk still remained in Baghdad to
look for more progress in his mission, said Abdel-Meguid who just
arrived in Amman from Iraq where he exerted efforts to help end
the crisis of arms inspections between Iraq and the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
International efforts, spearheaded by Russia, was expected to
put an end to the standoff as Iraq had already changed its mind
and agreed to open most of the suspected sites for inspection,
he told reporters after a short meeting with Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief said that Jordan also joined international efforts
by promising maximum work for a peaceful solution. He said Majali
told him that Jordan would not allow any country to use its
territory and airspace to kick off any military actions against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordan hoped that the crisis would be solved through dialogue
and in the framework of respecting Iraq's sovereignty and
dignity, said Abdel-Meguid who will leave for Cairo soon.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that international efforts were going on, the
situation was still very dangerous, he said, adding that if peace
efforts failed and war prevailed, the region would be ravaged by
instability.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge
of eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential palaces suspected of hiding the banned weapons,
triggering its current standoff with the Untied States.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to take military actions to force Iraq
to grant free access to the UNSCOM if diplomacy fails to exact
Iraq's full compliance with U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Iraq, Abdel-Meguid also exchanged views with
France's presidential special envoy Bertrand Dufourcq on possible
solutions to the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
They both agreed on the necessity to attain a compromise
settlement to end the crisis through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Abdel-Meguid, who arrived in Baghdad Wednesday, is
the first ever by an Arab League chief since the end of the 1991
Gulf War which drove Iraq out of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Afghan Earthquake May Exceed 4,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from a
devastating earthquake that hit the remote northern Afghan
province of Takhor this week could exceed 4,000, Afghan sources in
Pakistan said late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press, some
3,600 bodies had been recovered from the debris in Takhor province
and the toll is expected to rise as the rescue work is going on.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Taliban's Ambassador to Pakistan, Maulawi Dilawar,
said that at least 3,200 people were killed and 2,000 others
injured. About 15,000 houses were razed by the quake which jolted
the province on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the exact casualties could not be known yet as relief
operations were extremely difficult in the mountainous and
snow-blanketed area, said the Afghan sources in Peshawar, a major
city in northwest Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake measuring 6.1 on the Richter Scale
was near the town of Rustaq, about 20 km northwest of Talogan,
capital of Takhor province. Takhor is now under the control of
anti-Taliban strongman and Afghanistan's former military chief
Ahmad Masood.
</P>
<P>
News of the quake in the remote and mountainous area did not
reach Islamabad until Friday and the details were scant and
difficult to confirm.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Friday night, the subsequent
landslides in the affected area caused much of the destruction.
Thousands of mud and brick homes perched on hillsides were buried
under rubble, and heavy winter snows were also hindering the
rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
United Nations and Red Cross officials here said they were
going to arrange for relief teams to travel to the affected area
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Tajikistan has already sent relief teams to Rustaq,
only 50 km away from the Tajik border. Iran and Pakistan are also
planning to send rescue teams.
</P>
<P>
Anti-Taliban's top leader Burhanuddin Rabbani has declared
Saturday a mourning day for the victims of the earthquake.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He Never Consider Resigning Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday said that he would "never" consider resigning over the
alleged sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, Clinton once again refused to give detailed explanation
about the issue. He has repeatedly denied having a sexual
relationship with former white house intern Monica Lewinsky and
encouraging her to lie under oath about it.
</P>
<P>
Asked at what point he might consider resigning, Clinton said
firmly, "Never... I would never walk away from the people of this
country and the trust they've placed in me."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times and the Washington Post reported Friday he
called his personal secretary, Betty Currie, last month to his
office to go over what she remembered about Lewinsky's visits to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers said Clinton led Currie through an account of
his relationship with Lewinsky, who had worked in the White House
in 1995 and 1996 and then returned 37 times after taking a job at
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers said Clinton's meeting with Currie occurred the
day after Clinton gave a deposition on January 17 in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment lawsuit in which he reportedly denied a
sexual affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Clinton denied trying to influence
Currie's recollection, saying: "I never told anybody to do
anything but tell the truth."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he would not discuss details of the case because
"I'm honoring the rules of the investigation. And if someone else
is leaking unlawfully out of the grand jury proceeding, that's a
different story."
</P>
<P>
"I have tried to bring an end to this sort of thing in our
public life, I've tried to bring the American people together,
I've tried to depersonalize politics and take the venom out of it.
And the harder I've tried to do it, the harder others have pulled
in the other direction," he said.

<HEADLINE> France Still Hopeful of Peaceful Solution to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- French envoy Betrand
Dufourq said here Saturday that his country is still hopeful
of diplomatic solution to the current Iraq-UN stand-off on
arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement to Kuwait News Agency at Kuwait
Airport before ending his short visit to the country that
his country will "employ every possible effort to reach a
diplomatic and peaceful end of the crisis."
</P>
<P>
"We should continue efforts for a diplomatic solution," he
said, but he added that "France was concerned about ensuring
Iraq's respect of the United Nations resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was the last leg of Dufourq's regional tour which
also took him to Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Dufourq said French President Chirac asked him to "inform
the countries in the region with which we maintain close
relations on the reality of the situation as I saw it in
Baghdad, and especially to inform his Highness the Emir of
Kuwait about the situation."
</P>
<P>
Dufourq went for immediate talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh
Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah upon his arrival earlier Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that "I noticed during my tour that our concern to
ensure Iraq's respect of the United Nations resolutions is shared
by all the four countries I visited."
</P>
<P>
On whether he was carrying some Iraqi proposals about the
crisis, he said he would refrain from elaborating on the
matter until he first briefs President Chirac on the outcome
of his mission.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said recently "France
will continue to hold talks with all the parties concerned to
avoid the use of force which could have severe consequences for
Iraq and all the countries of the region."
</P>
<P>
The current stand-off led to a U.S. and British military
buildup in the Gulf to prepare for a military strike against
Iraq in case the ongoing international diplomacy to end the
crisis fails.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France and China oppose the use of force against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France rejected the recent Iraqi proposal to allow limited
and conditional access to the presidential sites, but French
Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said last week that the Iraqis
has "made a step forward" and needed to "make additional
gestures,"

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Enterprises Benefit From Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- State enterprises in south
China's Guangdong Province are improving their performances
through mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Konka Electronic Group is one example. Early in 1993
the company merged with the Mudanjiang Television Plant in
northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. And in 1995 and 1997 it
bought into Ruyi Electric Appliance Corp. of northwest China's
Shaanxi Province, and a TV factory in east China's Anhui
Province. Konka holds 60 percent of the shares.
</P>
<P>
The Konka phenomenon aroused attention nationwide. Some other
businesses in the province followed suit, and have been doing just
as well.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the Guangdong Kelon Group merged an engine company in
southwestern Sichuan Province and a refrigerator plant in
northeastern Liaoning Province to develop a refrigerator
production base in the area with an annual capacity of one
million. Meanwhile, Shenzhen Bao'an Group bought into two
Shanghai companies.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen Sanjiu (Triple Nine) Group has purchased 45 otherwise
bankrupt enterprises in 20 provinces and cities, half of which now
are making a profit.
</P>
<P>
Other enterprise groups are also doing well, taking advantage
of their name brands, technology, and high quality to combine with
their partners' factory buildings, equipment and labor force.

<HEADLINE> Two UNSCOM Teams leave Iraq After Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 7 (Xinhua)-- Two teams of international
weapons experts of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM on
disarmament in Iraq) left Baghdad Saturday, concluding their
six-day missions in Iraq, the Iraqi news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A missile warheads team, led by a Russian expert Nikita
Simidovic, and a chemical team led by a German expert Horst Rib,
held technical evaluation meetings with Iraqi officials led by
Oil Minister Mohammed Resheed on material and scientific evidence
Iraq had presented to prove its cleanness of mass-destructive
weapons.
</P>
<P>
These meetings, started from February 1, aim at ironing out
differences between Iraq and UNSCOM and evaluate progress made
by Iraq in disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has declared many times that it has no prohibited weapons
and demanded therefore an end to the economic sanctions imposed
on it for more than seven years now since its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to those technical evaluation
meetings, UNSCOM will discuss in Bahrain on how to write a report
it will submit to UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
So far, the conclusion of those meetings is not known.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq can not be lifted unless
UNSCOM verifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
A standoff between Iraq and UNSCOM is not over as Iraq is
till opposing free access of the UNSCOM inspectors to some
suspected presidential palaces. Diplomatic efforts by Russia,
France, Turkey and the Arab League failed to ease the tension.
The United States and Britain have threatened to use force to
force Iraq to comply fully with the U.N. resolutions.

MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Saturday expressed pessimism about the prospect of a
political solution to the Iraqi crisis, saying it might be
difficult to achieve this goal through diplomatic efforts.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a TV program here, Primakov admitted that Russia's
insistence on a political solution to the Iraqi weapons inspection
crisis has met tremendous obstacles.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that Russia will do its utmost in any case to
prevent a possible military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that he has received a letter Saturday from
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russia will try to prevent a military confrontation through
contacts with all the permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, he added.
</P>
<P>
Primakov reiterated that Russia opposes the use of force
against Iraq and favors the elimination of all weapons of mass
destruction within Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that Iraq will continue through to the end all the
work that has started in accordance with relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> France Reacts to Corsican Assassination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- France on Saturday reacted with
consternation to the assassination of Claude Erignac, prefect of
the Mediterranean island of Corsica.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police are searching for two young men who were
seen spraying a rain of bullets on Erignac from a running-by car
in the center of Ajaccio, capital of Corsica, when Erignac was
going to a classical music concert with his wife.
</P>
<P>
Reacting with anger to the murder, President Jacques Chirac
said the rule of the state must be respected in Corsica, which is
known for the violence from nationalist movements claiming
independence from France for the island.
</P>
<P>
But all the French newspapers Saturday remain prudent in
guessing the identity of the murderer, which remains unclaimed up
to now, because this is the first case of assassination of a
senior French government representative within more than 20 years
on the island.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the investigation said the murder does not
look like the work of nationalist militants, such as the Front
National pour Liberation de Corse (FNLC), and could be simply an
act of crime.
</P>
<P>
However, the radical wing of FNLC, FNLC-Canal Historique,
announced the ending of a truce with the government two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Purely criminal motive in the assassination is not ruled out by
investigators, as Corsica remains one of the most economically
underprivileged parts of France.
</P>
<P>
France was hit by a wave of urban violence over the past few
months, in which discontent youths burnt cars and targeted public
properties in riots.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Commander of Iran's air force
Brigadier General Habib Baqai announced here Saturday that the
Iranian air force "is ready to powerfully respond to any probable
aggression."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Baqai as saying
that Iran does not favor tension in the region under any
conditions and Iran advocates peace and tranquility.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian commander stressed that stability and tranquility
of the Persian Gulf should be safeguarded through cooperation of
regional countries in order not to provide foreign powers with any
excuse, adding that Iran has held negotiations with regional
countries to "forge closer cooperation and coordination" in this
respect.
</P>
<P>
Baqai's remarks were regarded here as a warning to the United
States, which is preparing a military strike against Iraq
following the standoff between Iraq and the United Nations over
arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iran has announced its opposition to any possible military
operations against Iraq, believing that military actions would
pose a threat to the whole region and create new tensions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has urged the international community
and regional countries to avoid possible military confrontation
between Iraq and the U.S.. The Iranian armed forces were
reportedly ordered to be alert to any possible aggression
following the U.S. and British military deployment in the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the Iraqi government has agreed to open
45 presidential palaces to the U.N. arms inspectors following
diplomatic efforts by regional countries. However, the U.S. and
Britain still insisted on military strike to force Iraq to accept
"unconditional arms inspection" by the inspectors.

WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>

consider resigning over accusations involving a former White House
intern, and he insisted that he had not improperly sought to
influence the testimony of the personal secretary.
</P>
<P>
-- Standing side by side, President Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair issued a stern new warning Friday to President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq that he will face substantial military

Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen arrived in Germany to

discredit the Starr inquiry.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Emergency Circular Calls for Crackdown On Fake Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Industry and Commerce has issued an emergency circular demanding a
severe crackdown on the manufacture and sale of poisoned alcoholic
drinks and other fake products.
</P>
<P>
The document followed recent instructions by State President
Jiang Zemin when he heard about the deaths in north China's Shanxi
Province as a result of local people drinking poisonous alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
Jiang has asked the concerned departments to strengthen
controls over market activities and to reinforce efforts to police
those engaged in producing and trading phony commodities.
</P>
<P>
In the circular, the administration ordered its local
counterparts to launch an overall crackdown on the manufacture and
sales of alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
All those incapable of making quality alcoholic drinks must be
closed down, while those who have broken the law must be referred
to law-enforcement bodies, the document says.
</P>
<P>
The administration ordered a complete investigation of the
Shanxi case and severe punishment for the law violators.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, the Shanxi provincial government held
an emergency teleconference on the issue today. The province plans
to launch a special campaign to deal with the production and sale
of fake alcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 27 people have died and nearly
200 others hospitalized after drinking the lethal methyl alcohol
in the cities of Shuozhou and Taiyuan. Most of those hospitalized
have recovered and have been discharged from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Local administrations for technical supervision have recovered
a large amount of fake alcoholic products in the provinces of
Heilongjiang, Jilin and Hebei as well as Beijing Municipality and
the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Money Worship, Hedonism Contribute Most to Woman Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Money worship and hedonism are
the most important reasons listed for China's woman crime in a
recent survey conducted jointly by the Beijing Women's Federation
and the Beijing Woman Procurators Association.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 100 female prisoners currently serving sentences
at the Yanqing Prison in suburban Beijing showed that 35 percent
of the crimes committed by women were mostly property-related. The
motive for these crimes was listed as money worship and
pleasure-seeking.
</P>
<P>
Most of these female prisoners had good jobs and relatively
high wages before committing crimes, the survey said, but they
tended to view money as a "universal need" to fulfill their
desires.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, revenge relating to love and family
affairs ranked as the second major cause of crime for women.
</P>
<P>
"If women were abandoned by their lovers or husbands or hurt by
various family disputes, many of them tended to take revenge
without considering the consequences," the survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
The survey said the lack of legal awareness is another
important reason for crimes by women in China, as 60 percent of
the surveyed responded that they "know little about the law."
</P>
<P>
"The lack of legal consciousness prevents many women from using
correct legal methods to protect their interests," an expert
commented.
</P>
<P>
Among the 100 female prisoners surveyed, 42 were jobless before
being jailed, 36 were cadres, 59 were married, and 49 are between
26 and 35 years old.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of this survey was to know more about woman
prisoners' minds to better help them and to prevent other crimes
by women," said one survey organizer.

<HEADLINE> Kazakstan Wins First Hockey Game in Nagano Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kazakstan defeated Italy 5-3
to win the opening game of the men's ice hockey tournament at the 18th
Olympic Winter Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The loser, which finished 9th at the last winter Olympics in
Lillehammer, Norway four years ago, took the first period with 3-1 but
failed to score in the following two periods.
</P>
<P>
In another match of Group A, Austria played to a 2-2 draw against
Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
While in Group B, Germany beat Japan 3-1 in a brawl-affected game
and Belarus beat France 4-0.
</P>
<P>
Winners of each group will enter the second stage of the games,
meeting six ice hockey powerhouses the United States, Sweden, Russia,
Canada, Finland and Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
It opens a new era at the Nagano Olympics, allowing highly-paid
professional ice hockey players for the first time to participate.
</P>
<P>
It seems to be a satire to recall the 11th winter Olympics that
Japan hosted in 1972.
</P>
<P>
26 years ago in Sapporo, the issue of professionalism threatened
briefly to destroy the winter games.
</P>
<P>
The winner at the time was Avery Brundage, the then International
Olympic Committee president and defender of the amateur ethic.
</P>
<P>
Austrian skier Karl Schranz was the loser and he was kicked out of
the games three days after his name and picture was used in commercial
advertising.
</P>
<P>
Since the year 1972, the IOC has changed tack completely, first
deciding to ignore the issue and now encouraging the parcitipation of
professionals.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics, the United States sent a "Dream
Team" to the basketball tournament, and this time, the ice hockey
competitions would become a "Dream Tournament".
</P>
<P>
Canada, the United States, Sweden, Russia, Czech Republic and
Finland all feature NHL players in the games and they all stand good
chance to win the title.
</P>
<P>
For many of the professionals, Olympic gold is still something that
their money cannot buy.
</P>
<P>
"To this day, my Olympic experience was the biggest thrill of my
life," said Canada's Paul Kariya. "Since I was a kid, even more than
playing in the NHL, I wanted to achieve that."

<HEADLINE> French Envoy Arrives in Kuwait on Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- French special envoy
Bertrand Dufourcq arrived here Saturday for talks with Kuwaiti
leadership over the current Iraq-U.N. stand-off over arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq went for immediate talks with Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh
Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah upon arrival, according to Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency said he would brief the Kuwaiti leaders on the
outcome of his mission in Baghdad earlier this week aimed at
ending the stand-off that started following Iraq's refusal to
allow U.N. experts to enter presidential sites to carry out
inspections.
</P>
<P>
The stand-off led to a U.S. and British military buildup in the
Gulf to prepare for a military strike against Iraq in case the
ongoing international diplomacy to end the crisis fails.
</P>
<P>
Russia, France and China oppose the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
France has rejected a recent Iraqi proposal to allow limited
and conditional access to the presidential sites, but Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine said the Iraqis have "made a step forward"
and needed to "make additional gestures,"
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is the last leg of Dufourcq's regional tour which also
took him to Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> More People in Heilongjiang Become Self-sustaining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 580,000 people in northeast
China's Heilongjiang Province last year were able to become
self-sustaining and end their dependence on government relief.
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang's poverty-stricken population has been reduced to
1.12 million and marks a significant step in the province's effort
to eliminate absolute poverty by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
The people who began to have enough to eat and wear last year
were scattered in 160 poor villages in four counties, according to
a leading provincial official in charge of poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Heilongjiang obtained 320 million yuan in national
special funds for poverty reduction, the largest amount ever. The
province also directed 310 million yuan of local funds to poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
The funds were used to improve the infrastructure in
impoverished areas and to implement more than 1,000
poverty-reduction projects.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that in 1997 Heilongjiang's 16
poverty-plagued counties reported a combined gross domestic
product of 13.7 billion yuan, up 11 percent over 1996, and a
fiscal income of 800 million yuan, up 13 percent. The per capita
income in the impoverished areas reached 1,500 yuan.

<HEADLINE> Per-Capita Residential Space Growing in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The per-capita residential
space in Shanghai reached nine square meters by the end of 1997, a
remarkable increase compared to the early 1980s when it was six
square meters. The improvement was credited to local government
efforts to improve housing conditions for the residents.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai started building residential apartments on a large
scale in the mid-'80s. In the early '90s, the annual completion of
residential buildings surpassed 10 million square meters.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city invested 44.7 billion yuan to build 14.97
million square meters of residential housing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local government has focused on improving living
conditions and building more public facilities for the convenience
of those who have moved into the new residential blocks.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six middle and primary schools and kindergartens were
established in 38 newly built residential blocks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Shanghai has demolished 2.62 million
square meters of slum housing since 1990 and replaced them with
new buildings.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Conduct National Population Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will conduct a
nationwide census on population in late August, Nassor Malocho,
the Minister of State in the President's Office announced.
</P>
<P>
Malocho told reporters in Dar es Salaam Friday that the survey
will be carried out from door to door in nine million households
in five days beginning August 30.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative for Tanzania to conduct a national census
this year despite the effects of the current heavy rains caused
by the El Nino phenomenon," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the country does not plan the census, the exact number of
the newborns will not be known, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said those living or traveling outside the
country, and beggars or street children, will also be counted.
</P>
<P>
The national census may cost 5.3 billion Shillings (about 8.3
million U.S. Dollars). The United Nations Fund for Population
and the U.S. government have promised to lend financial or
personnel support to the exercise.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Tanzanian government has spent 500 million
Shillings (783,000 Dollars) on the preparations for the census,
and will spend another 172 million (about 269,000 U.S. Dollars)
this month and 163 million (255,000 Dollars) next month.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's population is estimated at 32 million. The last
census took place in 1988, which found the country had 23 million
people at that time.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Army Kills 6 Militiamen in Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan army killed six
Hutu militiamen in operations in Kinigi, north of Ruhengeri town
Friday, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
"There was an engagement with Hutu militias in Kagano sector
of Kinigi Friday," said Major Emmanuel Ndahiro, the army
spokesman, according to reports of Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The enemy lost six men, while the Rwandan army sustained two
casualties," Ndahiro said. The enemy withdrew to the Virunga
National Park forests, he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The Friday operation was mounted following tips from local
residents and military intelligence that the enemy had regrouped
in Kagano.
</P>
<P>
Major Ndahiro rejected some media reports that the Ruhengeri
Hospital is submerged by the influx of patients wounded in Kinigi
fighting.
</P>
<P>
"This is incorrect, it is speculative and diversionary," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
In a similar development, another combined operation involving
Rwandan troops deployed in northwestern Gisenyi prefecture took
place targeting Hutu militia hiding in the area on the border
with the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
This operation was also stepped up following tips by local
residents who are fed up with the enemy, said military sources.
</P>
<P>
"The militia had manipulated the Hutu population claiming they
were fighting for their liberation, now they have failed to
deliver what they promised," Ndahiro underscored.
</P>
<P>
The Friday operation in Gisenyi covered the communes of
Rwerere, Mutura, Rubavu, and Nkuli in neighboring Ruhengeri.
</P>
<P>
"We took the enemy by surprise, there was no casualty on our
side," Ndahiro told RNA, adding that the above area covered by
the Volcano forests was the enemy's harbor.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Back Home After Trip to ASEAN Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad returned home Saturday after a three-nation tour
of ASEAN to get support for the regional grouping's proposal to
trade in their respective currencies.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's visit to Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore
since last Thursday ended on a positive note with Bangkok and
Manila agreeing to implement the proposal mooted at the Second
ASEAN Informal Summit here last December.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir held talks with his Thai counterpart Chuan Leekpai in
Bangkok, and also discussed the proposal with Philippine President
Fidel Ramos and Singapore Premier Goh Chok Tong.
</P>
<P>
Their talks centered on the need for ASEAN countries to
increase intra-ASEAN trade and the use of regional currencies to
lessen ASEAN's dependence on foreign currencies in intra-group
trading.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir told a news conference at Kuala Lumpur International
Airport that Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore had agreed in
principle to trade using their respective currencies.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal would be implemented if it is found to be
feasible.
</P>
<P>
"In principle, they have no objections but they will study the
advantages and disadvantages of the Singapore currency being used
as a peg for trade and the use of each own's currencies for the
purpose of trade between ASEAN countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore,
ASEAN's members also include Indonesia, Brunei, Laos, Myanmar and
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Several ASEAN currencies have fallen sharply against the U.S.
dollar since Thailand floated the baht last July, triggering off
the regional currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Malaysia also offered to host the meeting of
ASEAN bank governors to discuss the proposal.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question as to whether Malaysia was prepared
to serve as the clearing house, Mahathir said the matter would be
decided at the meeting. He added that in this sophisticated age of
information technology, there is no need to have (a clearing
house) in one place because everything will be immediately linked
to any center that is set up.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Doctors Use "Environmental Treatment" for Cold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- After years of research, two
Chinese doctors have developed a way to treat the common cold.
</P>
<P>
The doctors place a thermoelectric field around the patient's
head with the temperature slightly higher then the body
temperature. Zhao Yong and Zhang Xiaowei believe that the
thermoelectric field helps speed up circulation in the capillaries
and expansion of the sweat glands, helping a person's "inner
environment for immunity" fight the virus.
</P>
<P>
The doctors call this method an "environmental treatment,"
explaining that just as a bad environment can lead to a cold, good
environments can help cure the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Actually this treatment can be traced to the traditional
Chinese medical theory which views the human body as one
interconnected system and holds that a cold always starts in one's
head," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The equipment they invented for curing colds is now in pilot
production after being approved by the Beijing Medicine Equipment
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, the common cold remains a major nemesis for
mankind. British scientists reportedly are researching a vaccine
for all cold viruses. A recent report by a Polish scientist
advised people not to take any medicine immediately after catching
a cold, saying it is better to "fight the cold yourself."

<HEADLINE> Chickens Shipped to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A batch of 38,000 live
chickens was shipped to Hong Kong from Shenzhen early this morning
after going through rigid quarantine procedures.
</P>
<P>
The chickens are the first since Hong Kong suspended importing
live chickens in the wake of an outbreak of bird flu on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday night technicians of Guangdong Provincial
Department of Animal and Plant Quarantine were sent to 25
export-oriented chicken farms in the cities of Guangzhou,
Dongguan, Zhuhai and Shenzhen to collect blood samples and
sterilize the chickens.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 blood samples were collected randomly from each
group of 3,000 live chickens, double the amount required by the
Agriculture and Fisheries Department of Hong Kong. All the samples
passed the examinations, said Jiang Zhijian, general manager of
Jiangcun Chicken Farm of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of bird flu, quarantine departments in
Guangdong have collected 10,000 blood samples from 200 poultry
farms to test for the H5N1 virus. All tests were negative.
</P>
<P>
Late last month the World Health Organization concluded, after
a week of investigation by 14 of its experts, that the bird flu
did not originate in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland used to export an average 100,000 live
chickens daily to Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Iraqi Rally Turns Violent in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 7 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were
injured Saturday when a pro-Iraqi demonstration held by
Palestinian protesters in the West Bank city of Bethlehem quickly
turned into clash with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
About 500 Palestinians, mainly teenagers, took part in the
demonstration to show support to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
and protest the United States' threat to use force against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Holding high Saddam's portraits and Iraqi flags, chanting
anti-American and anti-Israeli slogans, the protesters marched
toward Rachel's tomb, the Jewish holy site just at the entrance
to the city.
</P>
<P>
When they approached near the tomb, some began throwing stones
at Israeli soldiers guarding the site, who fired tear gas and
rubber bullets in response.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem-based Palestinian news service Jerusalem Media
and Communications Center reported that at least five people,
including a Palestinian policeman and a Palestinian reporter,
were wounded by rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, there have been several such clashes near
Rachel's tomb, signaling the rise of tension between Israelis and
Palestinians at a time when the peace process is deeply deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accuse U.S. President Bill Clinton of
adopting double standards in dealing with the Iraqi crisis over
weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that while Clinton threatens to use force to
demand Iraq's compliance with United Nations Security Council
resolutions, he did nothing to pressure Israel to honor the U.N.
resolutions that request Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab
territories.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain threatened to launched air strike on Iraq
if diplomacy failed to secure U.N. weapons inspectors' "full and
free" access to Iraqi presidential palaces where illegal arms are
suspected of being hidden.

ISLAMABAD, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Saturday
launched relief operations in the quake-stricken northern Afghan
province of Takhor where more than 4,000 people were reportedly
killed in the disaster.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Russell, an official with the United Nations Development
Program, told reporters here on Saturday that a special plane
carrying the U.N. staff had left for northern Afghanistan to
review relief activities.
</P>
<P>
"We have food items and blankets in Faizabad, the capital of
Badakhshan province, to be transported to Takhor," Russell said.
"The trip will not be easy due to inclement weather and poor road
condition."
</P>
<P>
She said that food items and other essential commodities were
also being airlifted to the affected areas from neighboring
Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif offered relief
supplies as the Afghan opposition appealed to the international
community to rush humanitarian assistance to the quake-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The devastating earthquake struck some districts in Takhor on
Wednesday. The Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) said
Saturday that some 4,400 bodies had been recovered in various
districts of Takhor province, which borders Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
The province is controlled by the Afghan anti-Taliban alliance,
which was forced out of Kabul in September 1996 by the Taliban
Islamic militia into the north of the country.

<HEADLINE> Production Means Circulation Undergoing Fundamental Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The production means
circulation sector in China has experienced fundamental changes
since reforms were carried out a few years ago, according to a
senior government official.
</P>
<P>
At a national working conference held today on goods and
materials, Vice-Minister of Internal Trade Lu Jiang said that,
because of the reforms, the production means circulation sector is
proceeding steadily in conjunction with the construction of a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Lu said one big change is that the circulation of production
means has gradually shifted from state planning to market
regulation, and market mechanisms have begun to play a fundamental
role in distributing resources.
</P>
<P>
With the emergence of a buyers' market, prices for production
means have been gradually declining, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the operation of production means is no
longer monopolized by state-owned circulation enterprises, and the
market is becoming increasingly competitive. The style, scope and
content of production means management have undergone intensive
changes as a result of reforms in the administrative departments
of this sector.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that reforms on the production means circulation system
and state-owned goods and materials enterprises will be further
accelerated this year to better support national economic
development.

<HEADLINE> Fish Stunted in C. Uganda Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nile tilapia, a common
fish existing in Ugandan lakes, has been stunted in the recent
years, an environment report said.
</P>
<P>
A matured Nile tilapia usually has a size of 50 cm in Uganda
waters. But in Lake Wamala in central Uganda, it was stunted to
32 cm in 1970s and 22 cm by 1990s and now 14 cm, according to The
New Vision paper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing and environment degradation are the main cause for
the stunt, said a bi-annual report launched by the National
Management Authority.
</P>
<P>
Fish catching increased from 1,000 tons in 1960 to 7,100 tons
in 1967 and decreased to about 1,000 tons since, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
The environment degradation in Lake Wamala is caused by the
decrease of water poured into the lake and serious siltation
which resulted in shrinkage of areas in the lake, an earlier
report noted. The lake now witnesses an overcrowding of fishes,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Lake Wamala originally had impoverished indigenous fishes such
as mamba and male.

<HEADLINE> China's Production Means Market Enjoys Sound Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Successful reforms have brought
a steady and healthy development of China's production means
market over the past few years, with a diversified production
means market system emerging throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources from a national working conference on goods and
materials held today said that by now China has established nearly
1,000 production means markets involving steel, coal, automobiles,
second-hand motor vehicles and construction materials.
</P>
<P>
These markets include 30 large wholesale markets and 90
regional markets.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country has also established more than 1,000
auction markets and is steadily proceeding with pilot leasing
markets.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Internal Trade said at
the conference that the sound development of production means
markets has played a significant role in rationally distributing
resources, guiding production and establishing price
mechanisms. It has also contributed to energizing the local
economy, creating job opportunities and promoting social stability.
</P>
<P>
This year China should continue to strengthen construction and
administration of the production means market, perfect market laws
and standardize market practices, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Legislative Council Building Open Day in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 2,000 Hong Kong
people from all walks of life visited the historical Legislative
Council Building in its open day here Saturday.

Rita Fan, president of the Provisional Legislative Council,
presided over the opening ceremony to mark the start of the event

people will have the chance to get a better understanding of how
the Provisional Legislative Council members serve the Hong Kong
citizens.

hope that those eligible people will take an active part in the
first Legislative Council election to be held on May 24 and select
Legislative Council members who will continue their commitment to
the implementation of the Hong Kong Basic Law and the principle of
"one country, two systems".
</P>

<HEADLINE> East China City Lights Up With 100,000 Lanterns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing, capital of east
China's Jiangsu Province, has been lighted with more than 100,000
colorful lanterns.
</P>
<P>
It is a tradition for Chinese to hang lanterns in front of
their houses or in the streets during the Chinese Lunar New Year's
Day "Spring Festival" and the Lantern Festival, which falls on
Feb. 11 this year.
</P>
<P>
The lanterns are made of paper, wire and bamboo and have many
patterns resembling animals, flowers or other things. Many Chinese
believe that to hang lanterns of different colors and patterns in
the festivals brings fortunes in the new year.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing is one of old capital cities in China, which was
capital for 10 dynasties. It is also one of the major lantern
producers and markets in the country.
</P>
<P>
Many local families are good at making lanterns, passing their
skills from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Li Guixian, 72, is one of the most famous lantern makers in the
city, who has been engaged in the traditional handicraft work for
50 years.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, there were a large number of patterns," Li
said. "It is a pity that many old patterns of lanterns have been
lost."

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on China's Religious Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The charges leveled by the
U.S. State Department's "1997 Human Rights Report" against China's
religious status are totally baseless and utterly unjustifiable, a
visiting Chinese official said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ye Xiaowen, director of the Religious Bureau of the Chinese
State Council, told a press conference that the U.S.
accusation that the Chinese government undertakes religious
control and persecution is wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religious belief, which
is enshrined as a basic right in China's Constitution, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978 when China began to implement the policies of reform
and opening, the country has devoted itself not only to developing
economy and raising people's living standards but also to
improving the democratic and legal systems and ensuring citizens'
rights including the freedom of religious belief, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Now there are more than 100 million religious believers in
China, Ye said. The number of Christian believers in the country,
has increased to 10 million from 700,000 in 1949 when the new
China was founded.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, about 20 million copies of the Bible
were published with tax exemption in China, Ye said. In the 1990s,
about 600 Christian churches were built annually in China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official pointed out that what has been cited in
the U.S. State Department human rights report is based, as it has
always been before, on rumors, distortion, fabrication and
imagination.
</P>
<P>
Giving an example, Ye quoted the report as saying that a
Chinese regulation requires all religious bodies to register at
the National Religious Bureau and subjects them to the supervision
of an official religious organization.
</P>
<P>
In fact, China does not have such a law or regulation, Ye noted.
</P>
<P>
As a social body, a Chinese religious organization is
registered in China's civil administration departments, Ye
said. And there is no official religious organization in China.
</P>
<P>
Ye rejected the allegation by the U.S. report that a major
church in Zhejiang Province was banned last year by a local
government, saying the allegation was completely groundless.
</P>
<P>
Ye said it is also a sheer fabrication in the report which said
religious sites can be registered in China on condition that
owners of the sites join the Three Self-Patriotic Movement
Committee of the Protestant Churches of China and the Christian
Council of China.
</P>
<P>
China's relevant laws and regulations have no such provision,
he added.

<HEADLINE> China Refutes U.S. Charges on China's Religious Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to the accusation that Xu Yongze was sentenced to
ten years' imprisonment in September, 1997 due to missionary work,
Ye said the fact is that Xu had urged his followers to shout and
cry unrestrainedly for several consecutive days. As a result, many
people abandoned their jobs, some went blind due to longish cry
and some even committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
Xu was convicted of doing harm to society in violation of
Chinese laws and sentenced to three years' imprisonment by a local
court.
</P>
<P>
Ye said the U.S. report provided some specific examples, trying
to prove the existence of religious persecution by the Chinese
government. This is unjustifiable. People like Xu Yongze were
prosecuted because of their violation of laws not because of their
involvement in religious activities.
</P>
<P>
The principles of China's judiciary are based on facts, Ye
said. Everyone is equal before the law. Any person, whether
religious or not, will be prosecuted if he breaks the law. And
there is nothing to blame about that, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is well-known that there are more prisoners in U.S. than in
China. And the American prisoners who are religious greatly
outnumber their Chinese counterparts. Based on the logic of the
report, does that mean that the U.S. government is exercising
religion persecution?
</P>
<P>
Ye went on to urge the U.S. government to stop interfering with
China's internal affairs by fabrications about China's religious
issues.
</P>
<P>
He said only the people have the best understanding of their
nation and are the most qualified to speak on its affairs; and the
human rights should be developed by efforts of the nation's own
people and government. The United States has no right whatever to
dictate other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
China is in favor of exchanges of visits and dialogue in order
to deepen understanding, build common ground and promote friendly
relations between the two countries, Ye said. At the same time, it
disapproves of any act of accusation and interference with other
countries' internal affairs through fabrication and distortion.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the press conference were Chairman of the
Christian Council of China Dr. Han Wenzao and Vice Chairman of
Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches
of China Deng Fucun.
</P>
<P>
The delegation came to the United States for a visit on January
29 at the invitation of American religious leaders.

practice here."
</P>
<P>
In the development area, young people can give full play to their
ability, said Pudong officials.
</P>
<P>
Zhuang Shaoqin, who has just graduated from the graduate school
at Tongji University, assumed the post of chief on building the
expressway to the international airport in Pudong.

LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's military government
will launch a small town water scheme to boost the standard of
living in rural areas before handing over in October, the Daily
Time reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot scheme has been designed by the government to serve
town and villages with a population of at least 2,000, the
national newspaper quoted Minister of Water Resources and Rural
Development Alhaji Abubakar Sakwa as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the scheme is expected to serve the
interests of some communities which could not benefit from the
federal and state governments' water projects over the years.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will involve the Petroleum Trust Fund, which is set
up by the government with money collected from the rise of fuel
prices to specifically fund infrastructure project throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
The investment in the water scheme has not been disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Lack of safe water in rural areas, where more than 70 percent
of Nigeria's 100 million-strong population live, has been a
source of various diseases for local dwellers.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Imports Gas Masks, Anticipating Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has imported about
50,000 gas masks from Egypt over the weekend in preparation for a
possible Iraqi chemical attack, local media reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait Times quoted defense sources as saying that Kuwait did
so in order to protect its population against any Iraqi chemical
attack.
</P>
<P>
The masks will be used for emergency teams, volunteers and
other government bodies instead of being given to the ordinary
people, according to sources from the Kuwaiti Interior
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti National Assembly decided to hold a closed-door
extraordinary meeting Saturday on the recent developments during
which parliamentary members are expected to call on the government
to import more gas masks for Kuwaiti population.
</P>
<P>
Many people in Kuwait fear that Baghdad might attack the small
neighbor if the U.S. and Britain launched a military strike to
force Iraqi compliance in the current Iraq-U.N. standoff over
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has put its small armed forces on a higher level of
alert and deployed "Patriot" missiles in strategic places in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the U.S. has asked Saudi Arabia to
allow Americans staying in Kuwait to cross the borders into the
kingdom without the need to obtain visas in case the current
Iraq-U.N. standoff develops into a military confrontation,
informed sources were quoted as saying.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Implement Bilateral Payment Arrangement to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim said Saturday that a bilateral payment
arrangement (BPA) will be implemented to further enhance
intra-ASEAN trade.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism would also promote the use of currencies of
member countries in the transactions, Anwar, who is also finance
minister, told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is currently on a
tour of Thailand, the Philippines and Singapore to hold talks with
leaders of these ASEAN members on regional economic developments
and on ways to promote intra-ASEAN trade using regional
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines have agreed to use their
respective currency to reduce the dependence on the U.S. dollar
for their mutual trade.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said a committee comprising the relevant ministries had
been formed to draw up a list of commodities Malaysia could export
to the other ASEAN countries and items it could import from them.
</P>
<P>
"I do not foresee too many complications as this should be
easily implemented based on our experience with Singapore," he
said. "We are using both ringgit and the Singapore dollar although
it is pegged to the U.S. dollar. We import in Singapore dollars,
and they import in ringgit."
</P>
<P>
"That is a good beginning for the other ASEAN countries to look
at...a good model although it can be improved," Anwar said.
</P>
<P>
The BPA is considered as only a small instrument, he said.
"But, in the context of creating more opportunities for
intra-ASEAN trade, we will proceed with the BPA."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said efforts to further enhance intra-ASEAN trade should
be taken as agreement on the matter had been reached.

<HEADLINE> UK Links with Nigeria's Coup Plot: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A leading Nigerian paper said
Saturday there might be a British connection behind nigeria's
alleged coup plot last December, noting that seven of the coup
suspects had got British visas days before they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
This Day reported that Nigerian security agents found out
during the search of the suspects' residences that seven of them
have their passports stamped with British visas.
</P>
<P>
Among the seven is Lieutenant-general Oldipo Diya,
Vice-chairman of the Provisional Ruling Council and Nigeria's
number two leader after head of state General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
It took place, said the report, despite the fact that Britain,
together with most western countries, is now maintaining a visa
sanctions on Nigerian government officials, especially on its
military officers.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed in 1993 after the then Babangida
military government of Nigeria annulled the June 12, 1993
presidential election. It was strengthened in 1995 after the
Abacha government hanged nine minority activists for murders.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the coup plot was discovered last December, the
Nigerian government alleged that some foreign governments were
involved in the coup plot.
</P>
<P>
Another evidence of British connection with the coup plot, the
report said, is that British High Commissioner Graham Burton was
not invited to Nigerian capital Abuja to watch the video and
audio tapes showing activities of the coup plotters.
</P>
<P>
The tapes, believed to be taken by secret agents, were widely
shown to the diplomatic corps, including U.S. Ambassador Willian
Twaddel.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commission in Lagos, however, has denied the
issue of visas to the coup suspects. In a fax to the newspaper
it said, "the United Kingdom implements these restrictions (visa
bans) rigorously."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government announced the discovery of the alleged
coup plot on December 21, 1997, claiming that Diya and 11 other
senior military officers had planned to violently overthrow the
government of General Abacha.
</P>
<P>
A special panel has reportedly completed its investigation
into the coup plot and the suspects are expected soon to appear
before a military court.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
announced here Saturday that his country and Malaysia have agreed
on a payment scheme that will allow them to use their currencies
in conducting bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Ramos said that the move was aimed
at easing the Southeast Asian region's demand for U.S. dollars and
enabling the two countries to speed up their full recovery from
the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that the agreement was reached during his talks with
visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The present financial and currency situation in the region was
the main focus of our discussion," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that he and Mahathir also reaffirmed their common
thrust to step up tourism and trade relations between their
countries to help shore up the region's economies and attain full
recovery from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"To promote the expansion of intra-ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) trade and tourism, Prime Minister
Mahathir and I agreed to facilitate the use of the Philippine peso
and the Malaysian ringgit in Philippine-Malaysian bilateral
trade," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We instructed our respective officials, in coordination with
the private sector, to develop the appropriate mechanism to
implement this payment arrangement," Ramos added.
</P>
<P>
He said that both countries are confident that East Asia will
recover from the financial turbulence sweeping the region.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived here Friday afternoon for an overnight working
visit and left Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Zambian MPs Call for Withdrawing Benefits from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Parliament members of Zambia's
ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) have called on the
government to withdraw retirement benefits from former President
Kenneth Kaunda because of his active political activities.
</P>
<P>
In parliament debate on Friday the MPs urged the government to
amend the Former President Act and review Kaunda's status because
he has continued enjoying the benefits when he is still active in
politics, Zambia Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted David Shimonde as saying that the
funding should be withheld because Kaunda is allegedly using the
same money to fight the government.
</P>
<P>
"It is like arming your enemy because this man is using the
same money we give him to fight us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another MP, Jeston Mulando, urged parliament leader,
Vice-president Christon Tembo to initiate the amendment of the
Former President Act before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
MP Francis Kamanga said a law should be passed to disqualify
former heads of state from receiving benefits under the act if
they committed a serious crime or resumed active politics.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said the government has no immediate plans
to either scrap the office of former president or stop funding it
because if wants to maintain the political tradition.
</P>
<P>
National Assembly Chairman of Committees Frederick Hapunda
cautioned parliament members against discussing Kaunda because he
is not in the house to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
The government said last September that Kaunda had received
about 183,000 U.S. Dollars in retirement benefits since 1991,
when he was defeated in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda was arrested on December 25, 1997 in alleged connection
with the October 28 abortive coup and transferred six days later
from prison to house arrest.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Reiterates No Change in Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Saturday Malaysia's policy of tight
credit control will remain.
</P>
<P>
The statement by Anwar, who is also finance minister, came
after the announcement Friday by the State Bank that it would
reduce Statutory Reserve Requirement (SRR) of financial
institutions to 10 percent from the current 13.5 percent effective
from February 16, 1998, and various reports on the public asking
the government to ease its monetary stance.
</P>
<P>
The reduction would release about 14 billion ringgit (3.636
billion U.S. dollars) in funds to banking institutions, but is not
aimed at providing additional liquidity to the system, the bank
said in a statement, adding the reduction was aimed at enhancing
the efficiency of the intermediation process.
</P>
<P>
"This measure by no means would alter our original credit
plan," Anwar told a news conference here.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The target credit growth of 15 percent at the end of
1998 still remains. There is no change in the credit plan target
announced earlier."
</P>
<P>
"We are suggesting a credit growth of 15 percent. We are not
suggesting a credit squeeze as perceived by some quarters, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar called on the public to appreciate the importance of
having to have tight credit controls.
</P>
<P>
He said the public would have to recognize that everybody in
the country including companies and the economy were having a
problem in the wake of the regional financial turmoil since last
July.
</P>
<P>
"If you do not learn and appreciate and recognize that we have
a problem, then we will have more problems. Better recognize that
we actually have a problem now, and we have to judiciously and
prudently manage our affairs. Of course, we, the government, will
do everything possible to assist the companies, we have to
appreciate that we have to deal with the present problem and do
not give a wrong message both to the investors or to the markets,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said financial institutions were "very cautious" in giving
out loans for all economic activities, "which is good and
reasonable, but we have told them to ease it."
</P>
<P>
Anwar said the government recognized the pressures on the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said that the strength of Malaysia's
financial system has been the ability of the banks to prudently
manage their own affairs with some guidelines given.
</P>
<P>
"I do not think I would like to jeopardize that now," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 7 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier and a
Hezbollah fighter were killed and eight others wounded in a fierce
clash in south Lebanon Saturday morning, local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Orient Radio said that the clashes between Israeli troops
and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas began at 4:00
a.m. local time in the western sector of the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that its reporters on the site saw an Israeli
helicopter arrive after the casualties and fail to rescue the four
injuried Israeli soldiers under heavy fire.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, the radio said, another fierce gun battle
erupted in the central sector of the zone between Israelis and the
Hezbollah, or Party of God. Some 150 shells have landed on nearby
villages. There were no immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis and resistance forces have been embroiled in a war
of attrition Since Israel carved out the 1,200-square-kilometer
security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the aim to protect its
north from cross-border attack.

SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A Shanghai doctor has won a
Guinness record for successfully inserting gastroscope into 42,195
stomachs in less than 18 years.
</P>
<P>
Gastroscope is an instrument inserted through the mouth for
visually inspecting the inside of the stomach.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zhang Shanshen, a doctor from Zhongshan Hospital of
Shanghai Medical University, has removed such unusual things as
rings, watches and even chopsticks from the stomachs.
</P>
<P>
The patients Dr. Zhang has examined ranged from 99-year-old
people to one-day-old babies.
</P>
<P>
The longest "foreign body" Dr. Zhang has removed from the
stomach was 20.5 centimeters, and the widest 2.5 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's unusual skill has freed the patients from the pains of
going through surgery.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Zhang has also diagnosed 1,920 cases of stomach cancer
through his examinations.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Laid-off Women Workers Choose Household Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Sheng Rong, a former assistant
engineer, had never thought of losing her job or becoming a
part-time household worker.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheng said she is so satisfied with her job that she
does it wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
There are 3,000 trained household workers in Shanghai, a
leading industrial and commercial city of China. Most of these
workers were laid off from enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Labor listed household services as an
official occupation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 laid-off female workers in Shanghai had
attended training courses on household services in 1997 run by the
local women's federation and the labor bureau.
</P>
<P>
These training courses include ethics and etiquette training,
skills for handling household chores, maintaining safety in
apartments, and traditions and customs.
</P>
<P>
To encourage more laid-off female workers to do this job, the
women's committee of local trade unions launched a program to
honor outstanding workers.
</P>
<P>
Experts here pointed out that Shanghai has 4.4 million families
which means 44,000 working posts if one out of 100 local
households needs just one household worker.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, over 10,000 families of foreigners are also eager to
employ high-quality household workers, the labor ministry said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Older at First Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Residents in China's capital of
Beijing were the oldest among all first married people across the
country as they first wedded at an average age of 26.16.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai couples followed Beijing couples with an average age
of 25.73.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics based on 1996 data showed that Chinese men
were 1.99 years older, women 0.69 years older when they married
for the first time compared with 1990 data.
</P>
<P>
The average age of first married people in China was 24.02 in
1996. The men's average age for the first marriage was 25.77, and
women's, 22.75.
</P>
<P>
Besides Beijing and Shanghai, the first marriage age surpassed
24 in south China's Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, east China's Zhejiang, Shandong and Fujian
provinces, Tianjin Municipality, and central China's Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The figure in Tibet, northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous
Region and Qinghai Province, and southwest China's Sichuan
Province was below 23.
</P>
<P>
According to a sampling of nationwide population changes, in
1990 about 8.55 million people married before they reached legal
ages -- 22 for men and 20 for women in China.
</P>
<P>
The number of early married people dropped by three fourths,
however, to 2.17 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the average age of first marriage changed
as a result of economic development, because economic and social
development has immediate impact on people's idea about marriage.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Gets Loan from African Export-Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The African Export-Import Bank
(AFREXIMBANK) Friday provided a 380-million-Zimbabwean Dollar (27
million U.S. Dollars) credit finance facility to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Companies operating in the country's Export Processing Zones
(EPZ) could soon start benefiting from the credit facility with
the aim of boosting export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony here in the capital, EPZ
General Manager Walter Chidhakwa said the development of an
export oriented economy was central to Zimbabwe's growth as it
will enhance export earnings and create thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
Increase in exports could also help the country improve its
reserves which sent importers into a panic leading to the
historical crash of the Zimbabwean Dollar against major
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The country's balance of payment which has also been operating
at a deficit could also stabilize in the long run.
</P>
<P>
AFREXIMBANK President Christopher Eduardo said his bank was
putting its weight on EPZ projects to enhance their
competitiveness in the world market and make more significant
their impact on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of Africa's exports are raw materials and out
of these, 80 percent are shipped to Europe and the United States
of America. Unfortunately, 70 percent of the continent's exports
are made in the fourth quarter of the year making the continent
vulnerable to the dangers of concentrated activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These concentrations have been largely blamed for the
economic difficulties the continent faces as it increases the
economic risk usually associated with highly concentrated
activities," said Eduardo.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the Zimbabwean EPZ, we are glad to note that
the projects already approved are the right kind... In our
opinion we will achieve the desired results and that is why we
are very pleased to be associated with it," he added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Minister Committed to Fighting Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Finance Minister Simeon
Nyachae has reaffirmed his government's commitment to eradicating
corruption, saying everybody must contribute to fighting the vice
in public and private sectors.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Kenya Times Saturday quoted him as saying that
corruption was an impediment to investment and growth and every
effort must not be spared to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
He told an economic seminar ended Friday that corruption was
the greatest disease interfering with the management of resources
in Kenya, adding, it was his wish that everybody involved be
dealt with regardless of social status.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy is drifting dangerously into the control
of corrupt operatives who are denying the government billions of
Shillings through tax evasion, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, Kenya loses 9 billion Kenyan Shillings
(about 150 million U.S. Dollars) in revenue earnings from the
Mombasa port to a corrupt cartel through tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that Kenya's economy was threatened and
could not achieve meaningful growth unless people involved in
economic crimes were prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar organized by the Institute of Certified
Public Accounts of Kenya was also attended by high ranking
officials from the European Union and other donors.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Hopes Iraq Problem to Be Settled Through </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia hopes that the
arms inspection crisis in Iraq will be settled through diplomacy
and not by military action, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said that although a diplomatic settlement would encounter
many problems, this did not mean that military action was a
better solution.
</P>
<P>
With the influence of the United States and its allies,
diplomatic action would succeed in easing the tension between Iraq
and the United Nations over the arms inspection issue, Abdullah
told a news conference in Kepala Batas, Pulau Pinang state in
northern Malaysia, according to an official media report here.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said military action would only bring
hardship to the people of Iraq who were already suffering from the
economic sanctions on that country.
</P>
<P>
He said the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) was
expected to discuss the matter at its meeting in Qatar next month.
</P>
<P>
"Several decisions on the arms inspection standoff will be
taken then," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to attack Iraq following the latter's
refusal to allow UN inspection teams to enter the presidential
palaces which were suspected to be storing weapons of mass
destruction.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia exported over 500
million U.S. Dollars during last fiscal year ending last July,
registering a 25 percent increase compared to the previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to an article carried on Saturday's Ethiopian
Herald, the increase was attributed to the prevailing favorable
condition in the country, the increment of export items in
quality and quantity and the rise in price of coffee in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's export goods include coffee, hides and skins,
livestock and meat, pulses and oilseeds, beeswax, horticulture,
textile products and others.
</P>
<P>
During the last fiscal year, coffee accounts for 67 percent of
the export, hides and skins for 12 percent, pulses and oilseeds
for seven percent, chat for five percent and other items for nine
percent.
</P>
<P>
To boost the export trade of the country, the Ethiopian
government is doing its best to help exporters to become
competitive in the international market by improving their
products both in quality and quantity.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia plans to launch a program aimed at boosting the
supply of meat, hides and skins to the world market in later part
of this year, according to the article.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin &AMP; Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber, resuming trading
Tuesday after a week-long festive holiday period, closed the week
lower due to stronger local currency versus the greenback.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market, February South ended the week at
2,265 ringgit (588.31 U.S. dollars) per ton, down 325 ringgit
(84.41 dollars) from the previous week's close of 2,590 ringgit
(672.72 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals price eased due to stronger ringgit versus
the greenback. The ringgit rallied to close the week, the first in
the Year of the Tiger at a high of 3.8300/8700 to the dollar
against 4.4350/4700 at the previous trading week's close.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals trading is likely to move in tandem with the
performance of the ringgit against the dollar next week, a dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
The currency factor also had impact on the Kuala Lumpur Tin
Market (KLTM) this week.
</P>
<P>
The tin price ended the week lower to 20.20 ringgit (5.24
dollars) per kg from 23.26 ringgit (6.04 dollars) at last week's
close.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover stood at 287 tons with the local, European
and Japanese buyers taking up the bulk of the transaction against
last week's turnover of 165 tons.
BAC074WSA003S07PAQL15:3515:350217
</P>
<P>
The currency factor is likely to determine the direction of the
tin price on the local market next week also, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The performance of the three-month tin on the London Metal
Exchange (LME) would also set the mood on the KLTM, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market this week, March RSS One ended
the week at 239.50 sen (62 U.S. cents) per kg from 336.00 sen (87
cents) last week while SMR 20 closed at 333.00 sen (86 cents) per
kg from last week's 337.00 sen (87.5 cents).
</P>
<P>
Price on the local rubber market is expected to rise next week
as a shortage in supply was predicted, a dealer said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippine Congress Passes New Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' Congress passed
a compromise version of the new oil deregulation bill late Friday
night, clearing the last hurdle for the country to exit from
decades of economic supervision by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
The new bill, concluded earlier by a bicameral congressional
committee after more than one month of bickering, will replace the
old oil deregulation law after being signed by President Fidel
Ramos within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The old oil deregulation law, which took effect in February
1997, was nullified by the Supreme Court last November on the
grounds that it violated the constitutional prohibition of
monopolies and unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
The old law provided for a seven percent tariff for refined
petroleum products, and a three percent tariff for crude oil, to
encourage firms to invest in the domestic refinery industry.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court ruled that forcing firms to choose
between investing huge amounts in refineries and paying higher
tariffs amounted to a restriction on free trade and violated the
intention of the law.
</P>
<P>
Under the new oil deregulation bill, a uniform tariff of three
percent will be imposed on both imported crude and refined oil
products.
</P>
<P>
The new bill also sets up a 2.9 billion pesos (72.5 million
U.S. dollars) buffer fund to subsidize oil companies during a
five-month transition period before the full deregulation of the
oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The final Congressional passage of the new oil bill was hailed
by both the government and the business community since it will
enable the country to graduate from the IMF's decades-long
tutelage and help the downstream oil industry attract more
investments.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of the House of Representatives Jose de Venecia said
the new bill would strengthen foreign investors' confidence in the
country's economy by allowing its graduation from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, which has been under the IMF economic
supervision since the late 1960s, was supposed to graduate from
the IMF before the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
But the graduation was delayed due to the annulment of the old
oil deregulation law, one of the vital economic structure reform
measures required by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Under the old oil deregulation law, the government would no
longer regulate the oil industry and the country's three major oil
firms can adjust oil prices without seeking government approval.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the oil industry's deregulation allowed the
government to withdraw its huge subsidy to the industry and helped
the government improve its fiscal position.
</P>
<P>
The abolishment of the old oil law gave rise to wide concern
among the business community, particularly foreign oil firms, over
the country's investment environment and the government's fiscal
position.
</P>
<P>
Many new players in the local oil industry reportedly
threatened earlier to close operations and put on hold new
investments in the country if the passage of the new oil bill was
further delayed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies also complained that they were losing money
because they could not hike oil prices even in face of a regional
financial turmoil in which the Philippine peso has depreciated by
54 percent against the U.S. dollar.

cadaver bags delivered to Cagayan de Oro city, Mindanao, for
forensic examination.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Cagayan de Oro, Jesus Dureza, head of
the Presidential Action Center (PAC), which supervises the search
and rescue operations, said that retrieval operations were
temporarily deferred Saturday morning due to cloud buildup in the
crash site of the Cebu Pacific aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The DC-9 plane carrying 104 people, including five crew
members, crashed Monday morning on its way from Manila to Cagayan
de Oro.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said elements of the Composite Air Support Force (CASF)
composed of helicopters are now on standby at Mat-i in Claveria,
Misamis Oriental province, waiting for further orders.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to resume operations anytime this afternoon if the
weather condition improves in the area," Dureza said, adding that
a bigger helicopter landing pad had been cleared 200 meters from
the crash site.
</P>
<P>
As the bodies were badly mutilated, it was impossible to tell
how many bodies have been found, rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
It will take longer time to recover the remains of the victims
because a landslide caused by the impact of the plane has buried
most of passengers. Around 20 bags of bodies have been found since
the search and rescue operations started Monday.
</P>
<P>
Retrieved cadaver bags composed of fragments of body parts of
crash victims are now also undergoing segregation in Cagayan de
Oro by foreign forensic experts backed by the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI).
</P>
<P>
Identities of the victims remain unavailable as search and
rescue operations continue on its sixth day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Undersecretary Carlos Tanega of the Air Transport Office (ATO)
said that aviation investigators have started to analyze the
probable cause of Cebu Pacific Airways flight 387 crash following
recovery of some aircraft parts in the area.
</P>
<P>
Tanega said they are looking into many angles such as
instrument error and pilot lapses as possible cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
He said a group of ATO investigators had been sent to the crash
site Saturday morning, hoping to locate the "black box" which
could possibly lead investigators to the cause of the tragedy.

<HEADLINE> New Ministers Appointed in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister
Victor Ciorbea named replacements on Friday for five ministers and
a secretary who quit the coalition government last week.
</P>
<P>
The rift between Ciorbea's National Peasants' Party (NPP) and
the Democratic Party (DP), the top two powers in the coalition,
became larger in recent weeks as the DP asked Ciorbea to step down.
</P>
<P>
The DP withdrew its ministers from Ciorbea's cabinet on January
29 saying it would only back the government in parliament provided
it agreed to a new program to speed up economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to fill the vacancy, the NPP met with other coalition
parties and decided to appoint NPP's Constantin Dudu Ionescu,
Romulus Tomescu and Ioan Muresan as ministers of defense,
environment and parliamentary relations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anton Ionescu and Mihai Sorin Stanescu from the
Liberal Party were named as transport minister and defense
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Horia Ene from the Romanian Alternative Party was made minister
for research and technology.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say that without the support of the DP, the
current ruling coalition, which is headed by the NPP, will lose
majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
So far, the DP said it would temporarily maintain its
cooperation with other coalition parties in the parliament, but it
would not support the government "unconditionally".

<HEADLINE> Japan's Lower House Passes Two Financial Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives
(lower house) passed two key bills Saturday which will pave the
way for the use of 30 trillion yen (about 241.9 billion
U.S. dollars) in public funds to help restore trust in the
country's troubled financial system.
</P>
<P>
The bills cleared the lower house's plenary session with the
support of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its two
non-cabinet allies, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New
Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The bills were immediately sent to the House of Councillors, or
upper house.
</P>
<P>
The government and the LDP are seeking enactment of the bills
by the end of next week to restore trust in the banking sector and
revitalize the country's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
One of the bills allocates 17 trillion yen (about 137.1 billion
dollars) in public money to strengthen the Deposit Insurance
Corp. (DIC) to enable the government-backed banking safety net to
cope swiftly with the collapse of financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The other bill channels 13 trillion yen (about 104.8 billion
dollars) in public funds to enable DIC to purchase preferred
stocks and bonds to be issued by banks.
</P>
<P>
The step is aimed at helping to strengthen banks' capital bases
and enabling them to extend loans to companies without threatening
their capital-adequacy ratios.
</P>
<P>
Japanese banks have been under fire in connection with the
country's recent credit crunch. They are perceived as being
reluctant to extend loans ahead of the Finance Ministry's
imposition in April of tougher capital adequacy requirements.

<HEADLINE> High Technology Used at Opening Ceremony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A new high technology called
Time Lag Adjuster (TLA) was used at the Opening Ceremony of the 18th
Olympic Winter Games here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, the choruses in five locations on five continents
around the world (in Berlin, Sydney, New York, Beijing and Cape Point
of South Africa) was linked under conductor Seiji Ozawa. The singers
followed the maestro's baton via broadcast satellite image, projected
from Nagano.
</P>
<P>
In conventional satellite broadcasting, the delay in transmission
time due to the huge distances between the five locations would
generate a two-way time lag of up to four seconds. This discrepancy
would make it impossible for the choirs to perform as one group.
</P>
<P>
In order to solve the problem, various technologies, including TLA,
were developed. Using the technique of delaying all the images
to match the image with the greatest time lag, the Time Lag Adjuster
reconciles the differences in timing between Nagano and five locations
around the globe and sends a reconstructed coherent transmission to
the performers in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
The Time Lag Adjuster utilizes technology first developed for the
Skip Back Recorder. This Skip Back Recorder equipment was located in
NHK's Kobe broadcasting station and transmitted to the world the
shocking images of the moment that the Great Hanshin Earthquake struck
in the early hours of January 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The principle used by the Skip Back Recorder is to continuously
record images from the cameras and to constantly play back the images
recorded several seconds previously, as if the images had been delayed
by a predetermined amount of time.

</P>
<P>
Surin said the ASEAN troika will try to find a solution

<HEADLINE> Germany Opposes Separatist Movements in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 6 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said that his country is opposed to separatist movements in
Kosovo province, but called on Yugoslavia to grant a high degree
of autonomy to ethnic Albanians in the province.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, who is on a brief visit to Albania, talked with
Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano and Foreign Minister Paskal
Milo on the Kosovo issue and German-Albanian relations.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority which is
attempting to seek independence from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said the situation in the province is drawing the
attention of the international community, especially from Germany
which is facing a consistent influx of Kosovo Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Between 500 and 2,000 Kosovo Albanian refugees have been
arriving in Germany every month, while 140,000 have already
requested political asylum, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
As to relations with Albania, Kinkel said Germany is concerned
about political and economic ties with Albania.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said Germany hopes the Balkan region and Albania will
become stable, adding that his country is hopeful that Albania
will play a stable role in the Balkan area.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel appealed to all the parties in Albania to adopt a
peaceful and cooperative attitude. He urged the opposition
Democratic Party to return to the parliament and participate in
constitutional drafting.
</P>
<P>
The German foreign minister said the international community is
willing to assist Albania, but warned that if Albania fails to
achieve national reconciliation, the country may receive only a
small amount of international aid.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Kinkel, Nano said the Albanian government regards
Germany as one of its most important European partners and asked
Germany to bring Albania into the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Paskal Milo, Albanian foreign minister, also said Albania will
increase cooperation with Germany and bring bilateral ties to "an
unprecedented level."

<HEADLINE> Nagano Olympic Winter Games Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 7 (Xinhua) -- With ringing of the Zenkoji
Temple bell and the entrance of 234kg sumo wrestler at the Opening
Ceremony, the curtain of the 18th Olympic Winter Games raised here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Emperor Akihito declared open of the games, which will last 16 days
till February 22.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and International Olympic
Committee president (IOC) Juan Antonio Samaranch attended the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,339 skiers, skaters and sledders from 72 countries and
regions have registered their participation in the games, which
features 68 events from 14 sports. All of those made the games the
biggest ever in Winter Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland and Britain deserved a special mention. The two have
been the only countries taking part in all summer and winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Five countries of Azerbaijan, Kenya, Macedonia, Uruguay and
Venezuela made their first appearance in winter Olympics and three new
sports of snowboarding, curling and women's ice hockey were added in
the official programme.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the job the organizers have done for the
games," said Samaranch on Friday.
</P>
<P>
China has sent 61 skiers and skaters for the games, taking part in
the sports of speed skating, short-track speed skating, figure
skating, women's ice hockey, women's biathlon, free style skiing and
cross country skiing.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time that Japan hosts the Winter Olympics. In the
year 1972, Sapporo hosted the 11th edition.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony tried to bring the East and West together,
from Kagaribi bonfires at the four corners of the center stage, to the
choirs of Beethoven from five continents.
</P>
<P>
After the bell ringing in the ancient Zenkoji Temple, Japan's sumo
hero Akebono took the stage with other contenders of the sport.
Akebono performed the ring-entering ceremony dohyo-iri, raised each
leg in turn and stamped on the ground to drive out evil spirits from
the stadium before the entry of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
Akebono, as a yokozuna, or Grand Champion, won much respect in
Japan for his outstanding achievement in the Japanese ancient sport.
</P>
<P>
After that, the Olympic flame entered into the spotlight and it was
passed to professional figure skater Midori Ito, who used it to ignite
the Olympic Cauldron.
</P>
<P>
The message of peace was emphasized when the torch was carried by
Chris Moon into the stadium. Moon, a former British military officer
who lost his right arm and part of his leg while deactivating a land
mine in Africa, now is campaigning for a ban on antipersonnel land
mines.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A five-year program has been
launched by the Forestry and Environment Ministry for the
conservation, management and development of forests in Sri Lanka,
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the program covers areas such as forest land
allocation, multiple use of natural forests, forests conservation
and management, agro forestry extension, commercial plantation
development and the development of forests-based industries.
</P>
<P>
It will also help the locals boost the development of home
gardens.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 1.88 billion rupees (30.3 million
U.S. dollars) for the program, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
During the past decades, Sri Lanka's forest cover has decreased
significantly. According to estimates by local forestry experts,
some 44,000 hectares of forest will diminish each year in the
country because of shifting cultivation, timber exploitation and
fuel wood collection.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide strike by Sri
Lanka's plantation workers entered its third day Saturday after
their talks with the employers' association over a wage hike
reached a deadlock Friday.
</P>
<P>
Major trade unions, including the Ceylon Workers Congress
(CWC), did not attend a meeting convened by Labor Minister John
Seneviratne Friday afternoon, and a separate meeting between
plantation companies and the CWC in the evening also failed to
bring about a settlement.
</P>
<P>
The unions did not go to the meeting on the ground that the
employers must hold direct talks with them.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the trade unions said Saturday that they
would continue the strike until their demands were met.
</P>
<P>
About 600,000 workers in tea and rubber estates staged a strike
Thursday after a breakdown in talks with their employers over the
wage hike.
</P>
<P>
The unions demanded having their daily salary raised from 83
rupees (1.34 U.S. dollars) at present to 105 rupees (1.69 dollars)
while their companies only agreed to pay 93 rupees (1.5 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, Seneviratne intervened and urged the companies to
offer 100 rupees (1.61 dollars) as a compromise.
</P>
<P>
The last strike by estate workers in April 1996, which lasted
for one week, was estimated to have cost the government 500
million rupees (8.1 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> China to Solve Environmental Problem by 2020: Top Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- China plans to solve its
environmental problems by the year 2020, said a top Chinese
scientist in an article carried on today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
Scientists of natural and social sciences will work hand in
hand to find solutions to problems related to energy, resources,
environment, ecology, and transportation around the year 2020,
said Lu Yongxiang, President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS), the country's top natural science research body.
</P>
<P>
The problems will surely hinder China's future development, and
Chinese scientists should serve the country's sustained growth by
devoting to study on energy, environmental and ecological issues,
Lu noted in a lengthy article published by the country's leading
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
China has to face the overall test of international competition
and cooperation under the circumstances of globalization of
science and economy.
</P>
<P>
Lu, also a CAS academician, said that in 2050 medium-developed
countries will enter a post-industrialization society featured
with the knowledge-oriented economy in 2050. China must follow a
growth orbit of intensive development due to the precondition of
shortage of energy, resources and relevantly fragile
eco-environment.
</P>
<P>
Another article carried on the newspaper said that even though
China has abundant resources, every Chinese only shares 28.1
percent of fresh water, 32.3 percent of arable land, 14.3 percent
of forest, and 32.3 percent of grassland of the average shared by
the people in the world.

BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- At least 198 local residents
were wounded by firecrackers during the Chinese lunar New Year
celebrations, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Eight people including an 8-year-old kid have their eyeballs

The municipal government has banned the shooting-off of
firecrackers in the city since 1993 as an effort to protect the

But the beginning of the Year of the Tiger has seen more
violations of the ban than the beginning of the Year of Ox (last

<P>
MOSCOW, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Strategic Rocket Forces
(RSRF) are capable of striking back hard immediately following any
invasion, said Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of the RSRF, here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev made the remark in reply to inquiries at the State
Duma, the lower house of the Russian Parliament. The lawmakers
raised questions about the reported possibility of a nuclear
attack launched by the United States against Iraq. They also asked
about Russia's defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in Moscow issued a denial on Wednesday that
Washington planned a nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
Yakovlev said the RSRF is always combat ready and is capable of
striking a powerful counterblow should an invasion occur.
</P>
<P>
Another report quoted a Russian Defense Ministry spokesman as
saying Friday that Russia's strategic arms are not in a state of
high-level combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the possible use of tactical nuclear weapons by
the U.S. against Iraq, the spokesman said Russia's strategic
missile, air and submarine forces are still on regular duty.
</P>
<P>
Russia's intercontinental ballistic missiles, however, are not
in launch status, he added.
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes the use of force in the Iraqi
crisis. Russian President Boris Yeltsin has warned that launching
a military attack on Iraq could ignite another international
confrontation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Travelling during the 1998
Spring Festival was safe and timely despite the bad weather
affection, thanks to concerted efforts in the transportation
sectors.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of menacing weather, transportation authorities
have made every effort to resolve any traffic bottleneck, and are
stressing safety," Yan Hui, an official from the State Economic
and Trade Commission, was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
This year's Spring Festival fell on January 28. The Jan. 8-Feb.
28 period was announced as the travel period for many people who
travel during this period for festive gatherings or family reunion.
</P>
<P>
"Nationwide, the railway sector handled 77.3 million passengers
during the Jan 8-29 period, up 3.6 percent over the same period of
1997," Wang Yaru, a Ministry of Railways official, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
About 710 million travelers journeyed by bus during Jan 8-27,
three percent more compared with the same period of last year,
according to the Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
A total of 41,653 flights in 45 cities across the country
transported nearly 4.35 million passengers. No air accidents
occurred.
</P>
<P>
A heavy snowfall hitting central China's Hunan province on
January 22 cut power supply for a major section of the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway line, an arterial line linking the north
with the south. Tens of millions of passengers were held up in
Guangzhou City.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Railways sent 20 additional trains to help
these stranded passengers. About 220,000 passengers left Guangzhou
by train in the daytime, 140,000 by bus, and 30,000 by air.
</P>
<P>
Officials from transportation sectors promised to strengthen
safety inspection and prevention work. They hoped to closely
cooperate with meteorological bureaux to ensure Spring Festival
travel goes well in the rest period of time.

<HEADLINE> Mexico, US Agree On War Against Drugs Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and the United
States have agreed on a bilateral strategy against drug
trafficking based on mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial jurisdiction, the Mexican government announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mexican Foreign Minister Rosario Green said the strategy was
agreed on after nine months of talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
She said the strategy establishes respect for existing national
programs, sovereignty, territorial jurisdiction and the principles
of reciprocity.
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, the two countries will seek more
cooperation in the war against money laundering and trafficking of
arms, reduce the cultivation and demand for drugs and allow air,
sea and land interception.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two countries signed a 41-page memorandum of
cooperation in Washington on the war against drugs, said the
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Green met U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
U.S. government Anti-Drug Director Barry McCaffrey and Attorney
General Janet Reno to discuss anti-drug cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two nations started negotiations in May 1997, when U.S.
President Bill Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo
signed a document to establish an anti-drug bi-national alliance.
</P>
<P>
Green said that cooperation on the war against drugs does not
mean subordination.
</P>
<P>
"It is very important for us to understand that cooperation
does not imply subordination in any way. We are cooperating with
the United States on an equal basis that is mutually beneficial,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation will be increased to combat and eliminate the
potential of official corruption in drug trafficking on the
borders between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two governments will strengthen their cooperation on the
exchange of information and training. They will also apply, in the
most effective manner, the existing laws and regulations to detect
and punish money laundering in both countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will set up 5,000
biogas plants across the country in a bid to speed up the
implementation of the biogas pilot project, local press reports
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under a 68.9-million-taka (1.49 million U.S. dollars) project
which has been taken by the government, 5,000 biogas plants based
on cow dung are expected to be set up at the union level by the
end of the current fiscal year (from July 1, 1997 to June 30,
1998).
</P>
<P>
The plants, costing 15,000-18,000 taka (326-391 dollars), are
being installed in the rural areas with the technical assistance
of the Institute of Fuel Research and Development.
</P>
<P>
The government will provide 5,000 taka (108.6 dollars) for each
plant as subsidy, and the rest could be obtained as soft loans
from the nationalized commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,128 personnel having science background will be
imparted training in biogas technology, and three such training
courses have already been completed.
</P>
<P>
With the implementation of the project, the country's fuel
crisis is likely to ease to a great extent and adequate
production of bio-manure and preservation of bio-cycle will be
ensured, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Makes Debut in Winter Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan runners have always
been medal favourites on tracks, could they run over their rivals on
snow and ice?
</P>
<P>
They hardly have any chance this time, but who knows in the future.
The African country has started to try winter sports when Philip Boit
became the only Kenyan athlete at the 18th Olympic Winter Games which
opens here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Blinking in the glare of photographers' flashes and television
lights, Kenya's first-ever Olympic skier is jostled for comment at
every appearance. Once a policeman and middle-distance runners,
26-year-old Philip is Kenya's first, and only, Winter Games qualifier.
</P>
<P>
With him is Henry Bitok, 29, previously a navy guard and
world-class steeplechaser who failed to qualify, but is in Nagano as a
reserve.
</P>
<P>
The pair, who had never seen snow in their lives before, abandoned
their former lives two years ago when they went to Finland to train as
cross-country skiers.
</P>
<P>
Now they spend at least seven months of the year training and
competing in Finland.
</P>
<P>
"They are both very good athletes in Kenya, although they're
perhaps not good enough for the Olympics. But they are open minded and
they wanted to see if a good athlete in one sport can be trained to
perform really well in another," said Mats Olsson of the Kenyan
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Boit will compete in the 10km classic race on Feburuary 12 and in
the 15km free style pursuit on St. Valentine's Day -- February 14.
</P>
<P>
So how does his coach fancy his protege's chances?
</P>
<P>
"We have to be realistic. If philip has a good race he will come in
nine or ten minutes after the winner. I'm hoping he will do the best
he can do. That's enough for me," Jussi Lehtinen said.
</P>
<P>
Philip was more proud to compete in winter Olympics. "I am proud to
be here and I hope that next time we'll be in bigger group," he added.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Sees Violation of Law in Cable Car Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said Friday that he sees violation of law in a fatal cable
car accident involving a U.S. military jet on Tuesday, in which 20
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister said that his government is not
questioning Italy's membership of NATO or friendship with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Twenty people were killed when a U.S. Marine EA-6B electronic
warfare plane sliced a cable line with its tail fin in northern
Italy Tuesday, sending a cable car and the 20 people aboard
plunging to their death.
</P>
<P>
The accident has sparked anti-Americanism and anti-military
sentiment in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"We are in complete agreement that the plane was flying below
the approved altitude," Prodi said in remarks released by the ANSA
news agency.
</P>
<P>
"What has to be discussed is why," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi also said his government wants necessary training
activities in Italy by military forces of whatever nationality to
be such as to avoid "placing the population's safety at risk in
any way."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the government requires laws
governing military activities on Italian territory to be respected
and applied "in the firmest and most rigorous way."
</P>
<P>
"This disaster was provoked by an indisputable violation of the
law," he said, "no regulation or training need can permit flying
low enought to cut the cables of a cableway."
</P>
<P>
Prodi also called for investigations into the disaster to be
completed "with a maximum of speed and with full transparency."
</P>
<P>
Citing a statement from the U.S. ambassador to Italy Thamas
Foglietta, Prodi said that this was what President Bill Clinton
promised in a telephone conversation shortly after the disaster,
"and this is what will be done."
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the cable car accident, Italy's leftist party
members have demanded the closing of U.S. bases in Italy and an
Italian exit from NATO.

<HEADLINE> Late Surge Improves Italy's Industrial Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Italy's industrial production
increased by 2.2 percent last year, reversing the decline of 1996,
largely due to a surge in December, Italy's statistics bureau
Istat reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Production in the last month of 1997 was 8.1 percent higher
than the same month a year earlier, Istat said. In 1996,
production fell by 1.7 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Italian industry outdid itself in almost all fields in 1997,
despite holidays which cut down the number of hours worked.
</P>
<P>
As compared with the same month in 1996, transportation
manufacturing was up 31.5 percent in December 1997, non-metallic
minerals manufacturing was up 18.6 percent, rubber and plastic
materials manufacturing up 16.4 percent, and the production of
metal and wood products up 14.9 percent, while chemicals and
synthetic fibers production increased 10.2 percent, and textiles
and clothing rose 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Rescue Operations Continue in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Rescue operations resumed
Saturday after a dozen bags of human bodies were found in the
previous days at the crash site of an ill-fate Cebu Pacific
aircraft at Mt. Sumagaya in Mindanao, southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The bodies were so badly mutilated it was impossible to tell
how many of the 99 passengers and five crew members aboard the
doomed plane have been found since search and rescue operations
started Monday, rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the bodies are in a deep ravine inaccessible to
helicopters, the rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said around 20 bags of human bodies, or at
least 46 dismembered bodies, had been retrieved by rescuers as by
Friday noon time at the crash site on Mt. Sumagaya on the southern
island of Mindanao. But so far there has been no official report
on the number of recovered bodies.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams Friday called for "more muscular men and shovels"
to help dig up an area of the crash site that they believe could
hold a big part of the fuselage of the plane that crashed into the
mountain on its way from Manila to Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao,
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds, fog and rain have grounded helicopters and
hampered rescue efforts for much of the last five days. About 100
volunteer rescuers, weak from lack of food, began leaving the
crash site Friday after helicopters were unable to deliver them
water and provisions for more than a day.
</P>
<P>
At the foot of the mountain, anxious relatives of victims
shouted at officials, asking why food was not being taken to the
rescuers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five British forensic experts arrived in Cagayan de
Oro Friday to help identify the bodies retrieved from the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
There is still no word from rescuers combing the crash site on
any survivors of the 104 people aboard the ill-fated Cebu Pacific
Flight 387.
</P>
<P>
Rescue officials said earlier that it was a "remote
possibility" that anyone could survive the air disaster, the worst
ever in Philippine history.
</P>
<P>
Government doctors who were sent to villages near the crash
site echoed the sentiment, saying that if there were any
survivors, they would have already died.
</P>
<P>
Rescue teams reached the impact point of the plane Friday
afternoon and found the wings, tail and two engines of the doomed
jetliner. But the "black box," the flight data recorder that will
pinpoint the cause of the accident, has not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Rescue officials said it would take at least two months to
clear the crash site, an area of one square kilometer, and another
six months to undergo the painful procedure of identifying the
remains of crash victims.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Rejects Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican Foreign Minister
Fernando Naranjo Friday expressed his country's objections to a
U.S. ordered military attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica hopes the Iraq-U.S. crisis can be resolved
through diplomacy and supports diplomatic actions by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Naranjo told the press.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo met U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill
Richardson Friday, who arrived here on a tour of nine African and
Latin American nations.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said the United States would endorse an attack
against Iraq if Baghdad prevents U.N. experts from inspecting
places, including presidential palaces, suspected of warehousing
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"Our country does not believe in military solutions. The last
thing we would want is an action of that kind," stressed Naranjo.
"The U.N. secretary general must go to Baghdad," he added.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security
Council, representing Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Annan's visit to Baghdad may be made this weekend, but it has
not been decided, said Naranjo.
</P>
<P>
Several nations, including Russia, France and China, opposed
the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat said that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must
cease his hostility and aggression toward neighboring countries
and must comply with the U.N. resolutions agreed upon at the end
of the Gulf War.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Chilean Economic Growth Stunned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Chile will redude this year
its rate of growth because of the Asian financial crisis that
upset the world economy, said Economy Minister Alvaro Garcia.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth projections in 1998 of 6.5 percent and
seven percent must be revised downward to between 0.7 percent and
one percent, said Garcia.
</P>
<P>
"All the (international) diagnoses agree that the world economy
will reduce its rate of growth to between 0.7 and one percent,"
said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"I think that for an economy as open as the Chilean one, we
should expect effects of that magnitude," he added.
</P>
<P>
The minister also predicted that the rhythm of creation of jobs
will be down as a result of exports income drop.
</P>
<P>
Garcila said that the recent rise in the interbank interest
rates in Chile was aimed at preventing financial uncertainty in
the country and to contain the expansion of spending, particularly
from the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Greece Fails to Meet EMU Inflation Criteria in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- All European Union (EU) member
states but Greece met the inflation criteria for economic and
monetary union in 1997, it was learned here today.
</P>
<P>
Greece, with a 5.4 percent inflation rate, is the only EU
member which had an average annual inflation rate exceeding the
top permissible rate, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical
office based in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The top permissable rate is determined by calculating the
average rate of the three best performing countries plus 1.5
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy early
this week defined the inflation rate to be used in the European
Commission's convergence report on March 25.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU executive would take an arithmetic average of
the three lowest rates in the EU, based on 12 months' figures, to
determine the top permissible rate -- the average plus a 1.5
percentage point margin allowed in the Maastricht treaty.
</P>
<P>
The three lowest rates, according to Eurostat data, were
Ireland #,Austria and Finland all with 1.2 percent, thus making
the top permissible rate 2.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Mexico Release Joint Strategy Against Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Mexico
announced Friday a joint strategy to fight drug smuggling across
the long U.S.-Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Mexico Binational Drug Strategy seeks to strengthen
police cooperation, increase the exchange of intelligence
information on the activities of traffickers and facilitate their
extradition for trial in the United States.
</P>
<P>
It also aims to step up the detection of money laundering and
the seizure of drug cartel assets in either country, with the
proceeds to be used to fund anti-drug operations.
</P>
<P>
"This strategy is guided by the principle that drug trafficking
and drug abuse are shared international threats and that we can
only defeat them by acting in common," President Bill Clinton said
in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the aim was to dismantle the drug cartels, reduce
demand for drugs in the United States and remove the obstacles to
law enforcement cooperation with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
"This strategy is guided by the principle that drug trafficking
and drug abuse are shared international threats and that we can
only defeat them by acting in common, with our other international
partners," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our common efforts will uphold the sovereignty and rule of law
which drug trafficking organizations seek to erode," Clinton
added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. drug officials estimate Americans every year consume 30
billion U.S. dollars worth of cocaine, most of which comes from
Colombia and enters the United States from Mexico, along with
Mexican-made heroin and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Mexican drug cartels that took over the cocaine
traffic from Colombians have sown violence throughout northern
Mexico and over the U.S. border in recent years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. law enforcement officials say they cannot win the drug war
without the collaboration of the Mexican police, a force that has
been dogged by scandals over payoffs from the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year 1999 budget, Clinton proposed an increase of
nearly 500 million U.S. dollars to over 5.8 billion for drug
demand reduction, the largest total ever.
</P>
<P>
"Working with Mexico and our other partners in the hemisphere,
we are developing new ways to strengthen multilateral efforts
against drugs, to promote the synergies that can bolster our
success," Clinton said.

UNITED NATIONS, February 6 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia-Herzegovina's new
national flag was seen today flying in front of the UN Secretariat
Building.
</P>

The new flag consists of a large golden triangle against a blue

country is a part.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the ceremony of raising the new flag, UN
secretary-General Kofi Annan said no conflict or cause had
presented a greater challenge to the United Nations, which sent
personnel from all parts of the world to the region to promote the
peace and unity achieved today.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said they did so for the sake of the people of
Bosnia and in the hope that coexistence. once flourishing among
the communities of that country, could once again become reality.
</P>
<P>
Muhamad Sacirbey, Bosnian UN Ambassador, noted that the new
flag was already flying in front of the Presidency building in

<HEADLINE> Celebration of Chinese Films Opens in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 6 (Xinhua) -- The week-long "Celebration of
Chinese Cinema" opened Friday in this largest American city with the
attendance of many American viewers.
</P>
<P>
The celebration is a rare opportunity that affords a glimpse into
the lives of an ancient world moving into the 21st Century. It is
believed to be a unprecedented showcase of Chinese films in late
1950's to 1997.
</P>
<P>
A total of 17 Chinese films, most of which have never been seen in
the United States, will be screened, including The Lin Family Shop and
New Year Sacrifice from 1950's, Two Stage Sisters from the 1960's,
Woman Humanemon and The Sacrifice of Youth from the 1980's, and Opium
War, Spring Festival and Red River Valley from the 1990's.

<HEADLINE> British Astronomers Find Gamma-ray Bursts Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 6 (Xinhua) -- British astronomers have found
evidence that gamma-ray bursts detected in space are coming from
the most distant known objects in the universe.
</P>
<P>
The dimmest burst now observed may have been given off when the
universe was only one twentieth of its present age, the Royal
Astronomical Society(RAS) said Friday in a press notice.
</P>
<P>
According to a team headed by Dr Ralph Wijers at the University
of Cambridge's Institute of Astronomy, it has taken about 15
billion years, almost the whole time the universe has existed, for
these bursts to reach the Earth.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers reached their conclusions by comparing the observed
strengths of large numbers of gamma-ray bursts with predictions
based on the theory that the bursts are linked to the death-throes
of massive stars, the RAS said.
</P>
<P>
Gamma-ray bursts are flashes of gamma rays lasting on average
10 seconds. They were first noticed in the 1960s but until
recently astronomers did not know exactly where they are coming
from.
</P>
<P>
The energy released by a gamma-ray burst is phenomenal, usually
greater than all the energy produced by the Sun in its
10-billion-year life.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers suggest that it is something similar to the
collapse of a massive star that causes the stupendous bursts.
