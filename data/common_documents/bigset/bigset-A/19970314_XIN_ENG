<P>
JAKARTA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The first ASEAN business summit
ended here this evening with calls for political stability and
reduced red tape in the interest of economic development in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the meeting, which was described as
successful, Chairman of the ASEAN Chamber of Commerce and Industry
Aburizal Bakrie said that participants were optimistic about
ASEAN's future economic development and believe that economic
development needs political stability in their respective
countries.
</P>
<P>
They urged the governments and the business community to make
common efforts to reduce the gap between rich and poor, especially
the gaps between cities and villages.
</P>
<P>
In an era of free trade and global market, the representatives
said, the governments should raise their working efficiency by
reducing bureaucracy and introducing more deregulation policies.
</P>
<P>
They said the human resources development and education should
be intensified to maintain ASEAN's remarkable economic growth it
has achieved over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The summit also called on the governments in ASEAN countries to
promote private participation in their economic construction.
</P>
<P>
The two-day summit, organized by the ASEAN Chamber of Commerce
and Industry, was attended by some 600 businessmen, including
those from non-ASEAN countries.
</P>

During the meeting, ASEAN senior officials delivered speeches
on different subjects on the grouping's future development,

business and agriculture, automotive industry, finance, franchise
and infrastructure.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan will visit South Africa next week at
the invitation of President Nelson Mandela, a source said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela extended his invitation to Annan when he met the U.N.
Chief during the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos,
Switzerland earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to hold talks with Annan in Cape Town
about African mediation efforts in seeking a lasting solution to
the conflict in Zaire, said the source.
</P>
<P>
However, Presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said in Cape Town
that Annan's scheduled visit to the country was "very broad" and
would not center solely on African and United Nations mediation
efforts in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
During his state visit to Singapore last week, Mandela called
for the world body to be restructured to reflect the changing
nature of society and to prevent smaller nations from being
swallowed up by the economically powerful.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the dominance of post World War II powers on the
U.N. Security Council, Mandela said the world body was still
structured on the basis of outdated security concerns.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Department
of Trade and Industry today dismissed spreading rumors of the
finalization of an agreement with the European Union (EU)
granting the country access to the Lome Convention.
</P>
<P>
"No deal has officially been secured between the European
Union and South Africa on qualified access in terms of the Lome
Convention to the EU by the republic," the Department said in a
statement here.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations were continuing and the discussions would revolve
around the EU and South African regulatory trade environment, but
would not deal specifically with the trade and development, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
South African and EU officials have been negotiating in
Brussels on the former's access to the Lome Convention, a trade
and aid treaty between the EU and 70 African, Caribbean and
Pacific states that ensures preferential access to the European
market.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Buy More Gas from Myanmar Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The PTT Exploration and Production
(PTTEP) of Thailand today signed another contract with Myanmar's
state oil company to purchase natural gas from the country's
Yedagun Field in addition to the Yadana Field in the gulf of
Mottama.
</P>
<P>
Official Radio Myanmar said tonight that the contract was
reached among the PTTEP, a subsidiary of the Petroleum Authority
of Thailand, Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE), Texaco of the
United States, Premier of Britain and Nippon of Japan, which have
been jointly developing the field on a production sharing basis
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Yedagun Field has gas reserves of 1.2 trillion cubic-feet
and crude oil of 2 billion barrels, and the gas will be sold to
Thailand beginning 1999 at a rate of 200 million cubic-feet per
day, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Under the first 30-year contract, which the PTTEP signed with
the MOGE in January 1995, natural gas from Myanmar's Yadana Field
being developed by TOTAL of France and UNOCAL of the United States
since 1992 in the gulf of Mottama will be sold to the PTTEP at a
rate of 525 million cubic-feet per day starting July 1998.
</P>
<P>
A 430-km long pipeline is being laid across Myanmar-Thai border
areas for transportation of gas to Thailand. The Yadana Field has
an estimated gas reserves of 6.7 trillion cubic-feet.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Myanmar has signed over 20
production-sharing contracts with oil companies from nearly 10
countries including Australia, Britain, France, Indonesia, Japan,
Malaysia, Thailand and the United States, exploring oil and gas in
different offshore and onshore areas in the country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the oil and gas sector had reached 1.5
billion U.S. dollars in 32 permitted projects by the end of
January 1997.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Take Up Responsibility for Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is ready
to take up its responsibility in an international operation for
saving tens of thousands of refugees stranded in eastern Zaire
where fighting is going on between Zairean government forces and
Tutsi rebels.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
faced with "the catastrophic situation of refugees and displaced
people," France is ready to "assume its responsibility" within "an
international device of humanitarian security provision."
</P>
<P>
"In the case that -- contrary to what we have not ceased to ask
for since the adoption by the (U.N.) Security Council of the
Sahnoun plan -- a cease-fire is not rapidly concluded in Zaire,
the international community should envisage the establishment of
an international device of humanitarian security provision," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Sahnoun, the special envoy of the United Nations and
the Organization of African Unity for the Great Lakes region, has
drafted a five-point peace plan calling for the immediate ending
of hostilities in eastern Zaire and the withdrawal of all foreign
troops, including mercenaries, from Zaire.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to assume our responsibilities and we ask our
partners about their own availability and about their intentions
of participation, because faced with such a disaster, the action
of the international community should be a concrete action," said
Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said that France continues to provide total and entire
support to the peace mission of Sahnoun, and expects all those
"who have an influence on the rebels and those who support them"
to "exert this influence with conviction and firmness to lead with
the shortest delay to the cessation of fightings, the withdrawal
of foreign forces and political dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry said earlier that there is no
problem for France to open an air bridge to the Zairean city of
Kisangani to provide humanitarian aid to the refugees.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted a source of the ministry
as saying that for months, planes carrying humanitarian cargos
have been able to land in Kisangani and that "they were always
doing that."
</P>
<P>
A French Iliouchine-76 cargo plane carrying 30 tons of
humanitarian aid landed at an old military airbase of Kisangani
Tuesday, AFP quoted a spokesman of the United Nations World Food
Program as saying in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry also said that the United States
has also agreed that "the present situation in Zaire is
unacceptable and that the fighting should stop as quickly as
possible."

<HEADLINE> Negotiation Team Stranded, Troops Building Up in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian government troops
are building up around Anlong Veng in northwestern Cambodia while
a government negotiating team with the Khmer Rouge failed to come
back from there.
</P>
<P>
"I refuse now to talk with the people in Anlong Veng any more
unless all my people return safe and sound," First Prime Minister
Norodom Ranariddh told reporters at a ceremony to launch an
Olympic Stadium renovation project today.
</P>
<P>
"Neak Bun Chhay (first deputy chief of general staff) and Tom
Som Bol (Ranariddh's military advisor) checked with (people) in
Anlong Veng and they told us through telephone that all the people
are right, not only alive but also in good health," Ranariddh said.
</P>
<P>
The government says it was able to maintain periodic contact
with the team by radio and telephone.
</P>
<P>
"Neak Bun Chhay will be flying to Thailand in two days to ask
for Thai assistance and to have direct talks with people in Anlong
Veng," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member government negotiating team was helicoptered into
Anlong Veng in February for negotiations with the Khmer Rouge and
has since been stranded there for nearly a month.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it is necessary to launch any dry season
offensive. I don't want to talk about fighting anymore," although
"it is true that the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces have moved
troops close to Anlong Veng," Ranariddh said.
</P>
<P>
The first prime minister, who was watching an air show at the
Pochentong Military Airbase in the capital, said the government
"has no plan to use force against Anlong Veng."
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that the government has advanced its
troops to the Khmer Rouge-controlled areas and government military
leaders threatened to break off negotiations with the Khmer Rouge.
</P>
<P>
Military officials were quoted as saying that more than
1,000-strong government troops Monday marched into the far
northern province of Preah Vihear, and artillery and ammunition
were flown to a remote government military base near the Thai
border.
</P>
<P>
Ek Sereywath, secretary of state of the Defense Ministry
Wednesday said that the government planned to move some
9,000-strong troops to Preah Vihear to put military pressure on
the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng
</P>
<P>
"We have asked them to release our team, but they refused," Ek
Sereywath said.
</P>
<P>
He said military leaders are discussing the possibility of an
attack to encourage more defections from the Khmer Rouge.

<HEADLINE> US Retail Sales Up by 0.8 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose by 0.8
percent in February, about half of the advance in January, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that retail sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted 213.2 billion dollars last month, up from 211.5 billion
in January.
</P>
<P>
The latest report was in line with the results of a U.S.
Federal Reserve survey released Wednesday. It said that regional
"economies continue to expand at a relatively moderate pace" with
few signs of mounting inflation.
</P>
<P>
The department also sharply revised January's increase of sales
up to 1.5 percent from the initial estimated 0.6 percent. The
advance was the steepest since February of 1996 when the U.S.
retail sales rose by 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales represent about one-third of the U.S. economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department said sales of durable goods --
items expected to last more than three years -- rose by 1.6
percent in February, steepest since a 3.1 percent gain in February
1996.
</P>
<P>
Auto dealers posted a 1.7 percent gain, slightly below the 1.9
percent advance in January. Sales of building materials, hardware
and garden supplies shot up by 2.2 percent, even higher than the
strong 1.6 percent jump in January.
</P>
<P>
Demand for nondurable goods such as food and fuel edged up 0.2
percent, much slower than the 1.5 percent advance in January.

<HEADLINE> EU Unemployment Rate Stays At 10.8 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 10.8 percent in January,
the same as in the last three months of 1996, the EU's statistics
office Eurostat reported today.
</P>
<P>
In January, Luxembourg had the lowest unemployment rate of 3.4
percent, followed by Austria with 4.1 percent. The highest
unemployment was in Spain at 21.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat estimates that 18.1 million people were unemployed in
the EU in January.
</P>
<P>
It says the apparent lack of change in unemployment situation
over the last two years is due to compensating trends.
</P>
<P>
First, a small fall for women from 12.6 percent in January 1995
to 12.4 in January this year was cancelled out by a slight rise
for men from 9.5 percent to 9.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, there were contrasting developments in the EU's 15
member states. Big rises in Germany, Sweden and France were
balanced by regular falls elsewhere, particularly in Britain,
Finland and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Data from Eurostat also showed that the number of employed
people in the EU continued to rise moderately in the third quarter
of last year -- up 0.4 percent over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rise was particularly marked in Austria (2.5 percent),
Luxembourg (2.5 percent) and Spain (3.2 percent). Germany and
Sweden were the only member states to record a fall in
employment.

GENEVA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of the
Red Cross (ICRC) is setting up an office in Tirana this week while
the unrest in Albania is continuing to spread, according to a
press release issued here today by the ICRC.
</P>
<P>
Since returning to Albania on March 4, eight ICRC delegates,
who are staying in a hotel in central Tirana before their office
is established, have been conducting surveys in the south and
meeting the highest Albanian authorities in the capital to seek
permission to meet detainees held by the government, the ICRC
said.
</P>
<P>
On the current situation in Albania, the ICRC said, "Insurgents
have seized control of a quarter of the national territory. In the
south of the country, law and order are no longer enforced and
military bases have been abandoned to the population. As a result,
large numbers of people are armed."
</P>
<P>
Quoting unofficial sources, the ICRC said, "At least 40 have
died since the beginning of the insurrection."
</P>
<P>
The ICRC said that the Albanian Red Cross is delivering medical
aid and food to hospitals throughout the country, including the
areas of unrest. To date, the ICRC has provided it with essential
surgical supplies for the treatment of 400 wounded.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Wants to Join in Malaysia' MSC Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 13 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand today expressed
its desire to be among the major players in the development of
Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).
</P>
<P>
Its Science and Technology and Research Minister Maurice
Williamson said here that his country would encourage more New
Zealand companies to be set up within the MSC.
</P>
<P>
"I think the MSC has got very significant future applications
to a number of nations including New Zealand in particular and we
are going to be a major participant in it," he told reporters
after meeting his Malaysian counterpart Law Hieng Ding.
</P>
<P>
Many New Zealand companies are involved in developing world
class products and services in telecommunications, he said,
adding that working within the MSC will be a very logical
extension of the business that they are involved in.
</P>
<P>
Williamson, who arrived here earlier in the day heading a
15-member delegation for a three-day visit, was briefed by
Multimedia Development Corporation (MDC) officials on the
development of the MSC here.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's Televox International Ltd is scheduled to sign a
joint- venture agreement during the visit with Malaysia's
newly-formed company Quantum Frontier (M) Private Ltd. to become
the first company from New Zealand to hold an MSC status.
</P>
<P>
"Televox, a leading edge company in information technology,
will only be the first of many other New Zealand companies which
will take part in the MSC," Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
An inaugural Joint Commission Meeting on Scientific and
Technological Cooperation is expected to be held during the visit
between the Malaysian and New Zealand delegations to take stock of
progress of the cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Law said Malaysia would enhance cooperation with New Zealand in
the fields of information technology, biotechnology, advanced
material technology and environment technology.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia could also benefit from New Zealand in the
fields of forestry research, landscaping and the use of satellites
for marine resources management.

inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product (GDP) posted the 3
percent level growth rate from the year before.
</P>
<P>
The annual GDP growth was 1.4 percent in 1995, 0.6 percent in
1994 and 0.3 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The 3.6 percent growth for 1996 is the highest growth rate
since 1991 when the GDP attained 3.8 percent growth, the Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) said in a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
It was also the highest among developed countries around the
world in 1996, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
EPA Vice Minister Shimpei Nukaya expressed confidence in the
future course of the economy, saying the nation will certainly
attain the government's target growth of 2.5 percent for fiscal
1996 ending March 31 even if GDP growth for the first quarter of
1997 posts a quarter-to-quarter fall of 0.63 percent.
</P>
<P>
Private-sector economists, however, remain cautious, saying the
data seen to be "too good" considering Japan's current economic
situation.
</P>
<P>
Japan's real GDP grew preliminary 1.0 percent in the
October-December quarter from the previous quarter for
an annualized rate of 3.9 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The growth followed a revised annual growth rate of 1.3 percent
in the July-September period, it said.

<HEADLINE> German Chancellor Agrees to Slower Cuts in Coal Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed
in compromise today to phase out federal subsidy cuts for the
unprofitable coal mining industry in western Germany at a slower
pace following talks with trade union leader Hans Berger.
</P>
<P>
"We have achieved the most important (goals)," said Berger,
head of the trade union IG Bergbau.
</P>
<P>
Friedrish Bohl, Kohl's chief staff, said the step-by-step coal
subsidy cuts will not be as deep as originally planned. However,
he stressed that Bonn will still cut its annual coal subsidies to
5.5 billion marks (about 3.2 billion U.S. dollars) by 2005 from
the current 10 billion marks (about 5.88 billion dollars) as
previously planned.
</P>
<P>
The deal was hammered out after coal miners staged three-day
protests at the government district in Bonn over the subsidy cuts
plan, which was believed to result in the loss of at least 55,000
of 85,000 jobs at mines.
</P>
<P>
The miners demanded 6.5 billion marks (about 3.82 billion
dollars) in annual subsidies by 2005, and said they were willing
to reduce the workforce to 45,000.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Bonn will pay an extra 1.65 billion marks
(about 0.97 billion dollars) through 2005, raising planned annual
subsidies by about 300 million marks (about 176.5 million dollars)
through 2000. The improved medium-term offer is believed to have
helped ease unemployment in the major coal producing areas of the
Ruhr Valley and Saarland.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Clement, economic minister of coal-mining state of
North Rhine-Westphalia, said this settlement will lead to four
mines' closure instead of seven by 2000.
</P>
<P>
German Economic Minister Guenter Rexrodt estimated that the
agreement will save half of the 85,000 jobs at mines.
</P>
<P>
In the accord, North Rhine-Westphalia, along with coal-producer
Ruhrkohle AG, pledged to offer 1.75 billion marks (about 1 billion
dollars) in additional subsidies through 2005.
</P>
<P>
Of the continuing annual subsidies from 2005, 4.15 billion
marks (about 2.44 billion dollars) will be paid by Bonn, 1.15
billion (about 680 million dollars) by North Rhine-Westphalia and
200 million (about 117.6 million dollars) by corporates.
</P>
<P>
Some 8,000 protesting miners, who Wednesday lifted the
three-day blockade of the main road at Bonn's government district
and withdrew to nearby Cologne, cautiously accepted today's
agreement. They had threatened to come back if the government
failed to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
However, some miners in the Ruhr Valley were disappointed at
the results and vowed to march to Bonn.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the bituminous coal mines in the west of Germany
received a record handout of 11.2 billion marks (about 6.59
billion dollars) from the state, with 10 billion (about 5.88
billion dollars) from Bonn and the rest from North
Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
German bituminous coal costs 280 marks (about 165 dollars) per
ton, compared with 80 marks (about 47 dollars) per ton for the
same kind purchased on world markets.

STOCKHOLM, March 13 (Xinhua)-- The Swedish economy grew 1.1
percent in 1996, the weakest year since 1993, according to
Statistics of Sweden today.
</P>
<P>
Consumption rose by 1.5 percent last year, largely due to a

percent, but the saving quota fell 5.4 percent.

Although last year's economy downed against the 3.2 percent

<HEADLINE> Credit Card Delinquencies in US Hit All-Time High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The credit card delinquencies
in the U.S. jumped at the end of 1996 to the highest level on
record despite a healthy U.S. economy and low unemployment, the
American Bankers Association (ABA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The delinquency rate -- the percentage of accounts 30 or more
days overdue -- climbed to a seasonally adjusted 3.72 percent of
accounts in the fourth quarter, up from 3.48 percent in the third
quarter, the ABA said in a report.
</P>
<P>
That beat the old record of 3.66 percent set in the second
quarter of last year and was the highest since the ABA began
tracking the figure in 1973.
</P>
<P>
The latest report returns the U.S. credit card delinquencies to
the steady upward trend that they've been on for two years. The
delinquencies posed a decline in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
The increasing credit card delinquencies have coincided with a
mushrooming number of personal bankruptcies in the U.S. which
topped 1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists view the rising consumer debt as one of the chief
risks to U.S. economic growth.

WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Congress bent to pressure not to rebuke Mexico over the drug
trade and struggled to find a gentler way to complain without
harming Mexico's economy.
</P>
<P>
A bill under consideration in the House would revoke President
Clinton's certification of Mexico as fully cooperating in fighting
drug trafficking. But the White House threatened a veto, even
though the bill would allow Clinton to waive the legal effects of
the declaration.
</P>
<P>
-- The Republican majority in the House endorsed a nonbinding
resolution to require the White House to submit a second budget
for the coming year. Congressional analysts have described the
first one as flawed by overly optimistic assumptions about the
economy. The White House said it had no intention of offering a
new budget and called on the Republicans to propose their own
alternative.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Nearly one in seven children in the United States lacked
health insurance in 1995, the Children's Defense Fund reported
Wednesday, warning that the nation needs to make expanding health
coverage for children a top priority.
</P>
<P>
-- Forcing the pace on the expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, the Clinton administration is planning an
all-out selling effort to convince Congress and the American
people of the wisdom of extending formal security guarantees to
former Soviet bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Embassies in Albania ordered their citizens to leave as
instability spread and mobs angered by pyramid-scheme losses armed
themselves with looted army weapons. The United States told 160
employees and dependents, as well as 2,000 other Americans, to
book flights.

The new government was sworn in this morning, but there was a

Banks and most shops were closed today in fear of lootings and

JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai today called for exercising restraint following
the shooting incident near the Israeli-Jordanian border which

relatively calm Israeli-Jordanian border, shocked and griped
Israel in deep grief. Televisions and radios quickly interrupted
normal broadcasts to break the news.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government swiftly and strongly condemned the
shooting, saying it was an unacceptable act of violence. Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said nothing could legitimatize
violence, because "there is no greater danger (than violence) to
the peace process." He urged the Jordanian government to bring
those guilty to trial and to fully investigate this incident.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Mordechai and other senior army officers
immediately toured the site. Speaking to reporters, Mordechai
called on all parties to exercise restraint following the
incident.
</P>
<P>
"What's needed to everybody is to be careful ... every
thinking and doing may be threat to the future. It needs now
everybody to be careful, and to look forward, and not to damage
the situation... and to continue the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government acted quickly to condemn this incident,
while promising to bring the guilty to justice.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein immediately decided to delay his visit to the
United States and return home from Spain to deal with the
situation. He also telephoned Israeli President Ezer Weizman to
express shock and sorrow over the killing and offer his
condolences to families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan also flew to the site of
shooting this afternoon. Calling today as a "black day" for
Jordan, he condemned the incident as an act of "crime and
murder" and a "shame" for Jordanian people. He promised there
would be a full investigation with full knowledge of the Israeli
police and "justice will be deserved."
</P>
<P>
Naharayim, the scenic enclave in the Jordan Valley which was
returned to Jordan by Israel under the 1994 peace treaty, has
been leased to Israel and is a favorite site for Israeli
tourists. Ironically, the area has been called "Island of
Peace."
</P>
<P>
Today's incident also occurred during a time of rising
tension between the two countries and is expected to have
negative implications on bilateral ties. Referring to the recent
accusations by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Jordan
and other Arab countries, Netanyahu warned that "we cannot
pursue peace unless we pursue peacefully."
</P>
<P>
In stronger terms, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy blamed
today's shooting on the recent harsh statements made by King
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Days ago, Hussein wrote a letter to Netanyahu, criticizing
the latter's policies for creating the current
Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock and warning this would lead to
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio, Levy said today's shooting was the
result of the recent warning of violence over the deadlock in
peace process. He requested the Jordanian government to ensure
that harsh comments would not be translated into tragic incident
such as today's.
</P>
<P>
Levy also warned the Palestinian side to be careful in their
accusations of Israel, saying today's incident showed that
threat of violence would take the form of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister Office said that senior Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat had phoned Netanyahu to express sorrow
and condolences over the shooting, though there had been no word
from PNA President Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Reaffirm Commitment to Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany have shrugged
off rumors and doubts over their capability to keep the timetable
for the launching of the future European single currency, euro,
and reaffirmed their determination to create the monetary union on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
French Minister of Economy and Finance Jean Arthuis and his
German counterpart, Theo Waigel, gave the message at the meeting
of the Franco-German Economic and Financial Council held Wednesday
in Lyon, which was also attended by Governor of the Bank of France
Claude Trichet and President of the Bundesbank Hans Tietmeyer.
</P>
<P>
The economic and financial leaders of France and Germany
expressed optimism over their governments' capability to observe
the criteria of the Maastricht treaty for participating in the
monetary union and to maintain the calendar made by the European
Council.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any doubt on that point," said Waigel, who
described all other speculations as "pointless."
</P>
<P>
French and German officials based their optimism on the sign of
resumption of growth of their economies, which is predicted at 2.5
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will decide in the first six months of 1998
which countries can join the monetary union on the basis of their
economic performance and financial situation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Arthuis said that France, as Germany, is attached "in an
intangible way to the principle of independence of the (future)
European Central Bank," while the role of the future Council of
Monetary Stability of the monetary union is limited to
coordinating monetary policies of countries within the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The idea of setting up a stability council for the euro was
initiated by France but met with a lukewarm reception from
Germany, which fears that it will jeopardize the independence of
the future European Central Bank to be responsible for the issuing
of the euro bills.
</P>
<P>
Arthuis said that such a council will bring no harm to either
the independence of the future central bank or the principle of
subsidiariness for the role of the council itself.
</P>
<P>
He said that such a council will only work for the assurance of
convergence of economic policies of countries of the euro zone and
their observation of the engagements made in the Pact of Stability
and Growth of the monetary union.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Gets US Word of Objection to Jewish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said today Washington has
assured that there has been no change in the U.S. position
opposing any preemptive attempt on East Jerusalem before the
Israeli-Palestinian talks start to determine the final status of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to "Good Morning Egypt" T.V. program from Washington
today, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's Political Adviser Ossama
el-Baz said that the U.S. remained committed to its pledges to the
parties concerned, as a sponsor of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has assured Mubarak that he opposes
Israeli settlement activity and the imposition of a fait accompli
in Jerusalem as his predecessors always did.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak launched a five-day visit to the U.S. last Friday to
sound out the U.S. leadership on the peace process amid mounting
Arab rage over the recent Israeli decision to build 6,500 Jewish
homes and close four Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs are also dissatisfied with Israel's projected withdraw
from only 9 percent of the rural West Bank as the first step of
the three-stage pullbacks.
</P>
<P>
"He was keen to know whether Washington had changed its
position in regard to the land for peace principle and he was told
by Clinton that U.S. did not change its stand in opposing the
Israeli settlement policy," said the Egyptian official.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a strong advocate of the Arab cause, was the first Arab
country to make peace with Israel in 1979, but bilateral ties
remain cool. Both countries are major beneficiaries of the
U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
Baz, reiterating Egypt's stand, accused Israel of trying to
impose a fait accompli on the Holy City regardless of the signed
agreements with the Palestinians, "as if it was acting alone in a
remote island and was politically and diplomatically isolated from
the world."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, on the eve of his meeting with Clinton on Monday,
deplored the U.S. veto of a U.N. Security Council draft resolution
calling on Israel to halt the settlement activities, which he said
had prompted a "feeling of injustice" and cast doubt about the
"credibility of U.S. as a fair mediator" in the Middle East peace
march.
</P>
<P>
It was "unfortunate the resolution was not adopted, because it
could have given a signal to the Israelis to stop any settlement
activity, especially in the area of Jerusalem," he lamented.
</P>
<P>
At a joint conference with Mubarak held after the talks,
Clinton said that, despite the veto, U.S. does not agree with
Israel's decision but it was deterred by the wording of the
resolution which smells of precluding the Jerusalem issue from
final talks set to start this month.
</P>
<P>
What the United States is trying to do, he said, is to reach a
point "where the parties themselves can honestly make a fair, just
and lasting peace."
</P>
<P>
The U.S., co-sponsor of the peace process and Israel's biggest
ally, had joined the international chorus to criticize the Israeli
housing plan before it vetoed the draft U.N. resolution, supported
by other 14 members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
According to Egyptian officials, Mubarak has urged the Clinton
administration to play the role of a fair mediator and create an
atmosphere of Arab-Israeli confidence towards the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Information Minister Safwat al-Sherif said today that
during meetings with Clinton and other U.S. decision-makers,
Mubarak has played up the dangers posed by the Israeli settlements
in East Jerusalem to regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. have decided to attend Saturday's
international conference in Gaza City, along with diplomats from
Russia, the EU, Japan, Norway and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Infuriated and humiliated by the several Israeli decisions this
month, Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
called the meeting "to save the peace process" which he said is
"in a real crisis."

LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The British government has

British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said in a statement
this afternoon, "I am deeply shocked and saddened by this tragic
loss of innocent Israeli children's lives. Such acts of violence
are sickening and universally deplored."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that this incident "should not spark further
violence and violence must not be allowed to jeopardize the

</P>
<P>
"I am glad that the Jordanian and Israeli authorities are
working closely on the ground to bring the situation under
control," he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Form Specialised Police Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Republic Police
(ZRP) is forming a specialised tourism section to effectively
deal with criminal activities affecting the industry.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Zimbabwe
Congress, ZRP Deputy Commissioner Enoch Ngwenya today said the
section, which will operate in all resort areas, will solely deal
with problems relating to tourists.
</P>
<P>
He said the ZRP has identified tourist muggings and
way-layings as areas which needed urgent attention.
</P>
<P>
''Criminal gangs may also use a ploy whereby they pose as
sculpture salesmen with one or two items. As soon as a tourist shows
interest the others mob the person ending in loss of purse and other
valuables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said gangs targeting tourists were also operating at airports,
major hotels and bureaux de change, while the motorised criminals
were becoming more violent and ruthless relying on mobility to avoid
detection.
</P>
<P>
Despite the manpower shortage, patrols have been increased to
achieve the objectives of the police service charter, a move which
has resulted in a marked reduction in tourist attacks, he said.

<HEADLINE> British Soldier Injured in Northern Irish Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A British soldier was injured in
an explosion in north Belfast of Northern Ireland today.
</P>
<P>
When suspected IRA guerrillas ambushed a patrol vehicle, "we
have one soldier slightly injured," Reuter quoted a police source
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said they thought a home-made mortar or
grenade of a type used by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) had been
fired at a military patrol in the Ardoyne district, according to
Reuter.
</P>
<P>
A week ago troops narrowly escaped serious injury when a bomb
exploded behind a wall in nationalist Ballymurphy, a sprawling
housing estate in the west of the city.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, which shattered a fragile peace process by abandoning
a 17-month truce a year ago, said recently that it was unlikely to
consider another cease-fire until after a British election due by
May 22.

<HEADLINE> Biotech Companies in UK Grow Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain's biotechnology industry
is growing rapidly as the number of companies in the sector
looking for new drugs has more than doubled in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Employment in the sector has also doubled, but the numbers are
still too low to have a significant impact on unemployment,
according to a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the report by Arthur Andersen, the accountant and
management consultant, warned that the sector's continued growth
depends on finding at least 1 billion pounds (1.6 billion US
dollars) of funding in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
Britain's biotechnology industry also faces uncertainty over
European Union patent laws for biotechnology, which are now under
review.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, there were 221 UK biotech companies
employing 10,590 people in 1996. Their total revenue was 700
million pounds (1.12 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The figures are up by a third on 1994, and are expected to grow
by a further third by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Drug researchers are the biggest group, with 78 companies
employing 4,870 people. In terms of performance, these "can match
those in the US biotech sector," the report said. By market value,
the five biggest UK companies match some of those in the US top
20, it added.
</P>
<P>
The biggest UK companies are British Biotech, Celltech and
Chiroscience. The three raised 1.1 billion pounds (1.76 billion US
dollars) from investors in the 18 months to December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The sector's growth is the result of several factors:
</P>
<P>
-- Easier access to capital through venture capital funds,
changes in stock exchange listing rules, the creation of the
Alternative Investment Market;
</P>
<P>
-- Greater government commitment to biotech through grants and
awareness-raising programs;
</P>
<P>
-- Better links between academic and commercial science;
</P>
<P>
-- Greater outsourcing of research by pharmaceuticals
companies;
</P>
<P>
-- The creation of the London-based European Medicines
Evaluation Agency, through which drugs can be approved for the
whole of the EU.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Blasts Israeli Government's Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat today blasted a recent Israeli government
decision on building Jewish settlements in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The (Israel's) decision (on Har Homa) is intended to blow up
the peace process, but we don't accept that," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in East Jerusalem, Arafat made the statement when he was
addressing an emergency session of the 88-member Palestinian
Council held in the West Bank city of Bethlehem at a time when
tensions are running high between the Israelis and the
Palestinians as a result of Israel's decision to build the new
settlement at Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"This Israeli settlement plan was submitted to (the late
Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin, he refused to deal with it.
It was also submitted to (former Prime Minister Shimon) Peres
and he refused to deal with it," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
"Yet, the new government comes to deal with the plan with all
of its insolence and in a blatant challenge to Arabs, Christians,
 Moslems and Palestinians," he added.
</P>
<P>
"With their decisions, they (the Netanyahu government) say no
to peace, no to peace not only with the Palestinians, but
also with Arabs and the entire Middle East," said Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said: "I am sorry that the U.S.
veto was against 14 countries (in the Security Council) and
against an international unanimity. Yet, President (Bill) Clinton
made it clear to (Egyptian President Hosni) Mubarak while
speaking to journalists that this doesn't mean that the U.S.
agrees on the settlement policy."
</P>
<P>
"Thank God, all invited countries responded positively to our
call for a Saturday meeting (in Gaza). Some friends suggested
inviting Israel to the meeting, but I didn't," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said: "Settlement beasts will not only swallow the
Palestinian lands, but the entire peace process."
</P>
<P>
"If he (Netanyahu) wants to devour the peace process the issue
is left for the international community to decide on whether to
choose peace or to surrender," Arafat noted. "When we went to
Madrid, we were relying on the land-for-peace formula and not on
land-for-surrender, or land-for-settlements."
</P>
<P>
Arafat appealed to the Israeli peace forces, who in the
Knesset approved the Hebron Protocol with a majority of 87
votes, to save the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Conservative MPs Demand Report Leak Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- British Conservative MPs are
calling for an inquiry into the leaking of a Commons report
criticizing the government's proposed nursery voucher scheme,
which should be published next week.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, parents of all four-year-old children in
England and Wales will be given vouchers worth 1,100 pounds (1,760
US dollars) to use for nursery school education.
</P>
<P>
But the report from the Conservative-dominated Commons
education and employment select committee said it is unlikely to
increase parental choice, raise standards or even provide extra
places for children.
</P>
<P>
The report leaked Wednesday said the main problem with the
scheme is that it has led to more four-year-olds being recruited
into reception classes by schools anxious to safeguard pupil
numbers and funding. Parental choice would not be enhanced if
schools took more pupils to the detriment of nurseries and play
groups.
</P>
<P>
British Schools Minister Robin Squire has refected the
criticism and told BBC Radio today that the scheme has led to an
increase in parental choice and higher standards.

<HEADLINE> UK New Car Sales Rise 2.4 Pct in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- New car sales growth in Britain
slowed down considerably last month compared with January, with
lack of interest from private buyers rekindling concern in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers
and Traders (SMMT), new car sales in February were at 162,887, 2.4
percent higher than the 159,013 units in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
This was sharply lower compared with the more than 9 percent
year-on-year growth recorded in January, the SMMT said.
</P>
<P>
However, as a result, sales for the first two months of this
year as a whole rose 5.4 percent to 369.671, compared with 350,774
in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The share taken by private buyers fell to 42 percent last month
from 43 percent in the same month a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was also a further significant rise in the
market share taken by imports, which accounted for 65.4 percent of
last month's market, up from 62.4 percent in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the industry was not much concerned over the increased
import share as this was being substantially offset by rising UK
car production for export.

<HEADLINE> Death Rate Doubles for UK Young Drinkers: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The death rate from
alcohol-related diseases in Britain's young people aged 15 to 44
has doubled in 10 years time, according to an official health
report to be published next month.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Office for National Statistics will show that
although the numbers are still relatively small, deaths in young
men from alcoholic diseases went up from one in 100,000 to two
between 1984 to 1994, and in young women from 0.5 per 100,000 to
one.
</P>
<P>
The total of alcohol-related deaths in England and Wales went
up from 4,124 in 1985 to 5,617 in 1994, a rise of more than 36
percent, the report, The Health of Adult Britain, will point out.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey found that children in Britain are starting to
drink alcohol younger and that some are drinking large quantities,
which have made doctors become increasingly concerned.
</P>

ADDIS ABABA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Disaster

emergency food aid in a bid to mitigate food and water scarcity
in the Somali, Oromia and Southern People's regions.

Africa, while Morocco and Polisario have started discussing
peace measures for the west Saharan conflicting countries.

proposing a 700-man team while the rebels are for about 50 to 70
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
On Burundi conflict, Kikwete said the meeting maintained that

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Receives Armenian Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
received here this evening the visiting Foreign Minister of
Armenia Aleksandr Arzumanyan who conveyed a letter from the
Armenian head of state Ter Petrosyan on bilateral relations
and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The letter says that Armenia will maintain a political and
moral support to Lebanon in seeking a settlement of the Middle
East problem, particularly the implementation of Security Council
resolution 425 on the unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian President expressed his satisfaction with the
outcome of joint official cooperation among the ministries and
departments of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Armenian Minister of Foreign Affairs arrived in Beirut
earlier today on a one-day visit to Lebanon, coming from
Damascus. He had a meeting right after arrival with his Lebanese
counterpart Faris Bouez, dealing with bilateral relations,
Lebanon's stance on a Middle East settlement and the situation in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Following the 45-minute talks, the two sides signed a customs
agreement on the investments guarantees and non dual taxation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to newsmen after the talks, the Armenian Minister
expressed his pleasure with the Lebanese government decision to
open a Lebanese embassy in the Armenian capital city of
Yerevan. He said he was confident that the opening of the
Lebanese embassy would strengthen the ties of cooperation in all
fields between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Delegate to Attend Gaza Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Assistant Foreign Minister
for Arab Affairs Badr Hamam will leave here tomorrow for Gaza to
attend an emergency conference to be held Saturday aimed to save
the peace process from collapse, the Egyptian MENA news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Humiliated and frustrated by Israeli decision to build Jewish
settlement in Har Homa in East Jerusalem, Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Tuesday invited diplomats from the U.S., Russia, the
European Union, Egypt, Japan, Norway and Jordan to the Gaza
conference in a bid to set the peace march moving.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, refused to attend the meeting on grounds that
such a gathering violated the autonomy agreements which stipulate
that disputes between Israel and Palestine must be resolved in a
way agreed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Palestine's delegate to the Arab League Mohamed Sobeih said
today the Gaza meeting aims at getting all countries involved in
the Oslo agreements acquainted with the "perils of Israel's
violations."
</P>
<P>
Sobeih declined to comment on whether the Gaza meeting would
issue a statement to urge Israel to halt the building of the
settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But he said the Israeli government had to backtrack on such a
wrong step because the letters of guarantees affiliated in the
Oslo stipulate that religious and cultural institutions in
Jerusalem be kept intact.
</P>
<P>
"Israeli leaders should realize that changing the holy city's
status is absolutely unacceptable to the Palestinians," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai have made clear that Israel would not
back down from its recent decisions that fueled the Arab rage.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the peace process, has been a strong
advocate of the Palestinian cause.

<HEADLINE> Killer of 7 Israeli Students Arrested in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The man who killed seven Israeli
students and wounded several others earlier today on the
Jordanian-Israeli border has been arrested.
</P>
<P>
The killer was identified as Ahammad Musa, a 26-year-old driver
serving in the Jordanian army, officials close to the case said.
He reportedly took a gun from one of his friends to carry out the
shooting, but the motive behind the killing was not known for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
After the killing took place, King Hussein telephoned Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and condemned the shooting
incident near the Israel-Jordan border.
</P>
<P>
The king, who is on an official visit to London, also offered
his condolences to families of the victims, Jordan's Petra news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Musa opened fire at a van carrying Israeli school girls in the
northwestern town of Bahulha town in the Naharayim area near the
Israeli-Jordanian border, which has been relatively calm since the
two sides signed a peace treaty in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Naharayim is an scenic enclave in the Jordan Valley which was
returned to Jordan by Israel under the 1994 peace treaty, but
Israelis still have full access to the area for sightseeings.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, after calling Netanyahu, decided to delay his visit to
the United States scheduled on March 18 and come back from London
to settle the issue.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan and Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti also went to the hospital where the injured are treated
and expressed sympathy to them.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian-Israeli relations are in a delicate situation as
Hussein has just sent Netanyahu a tough-worded letter, saying that
the Israeli prime minister's "actions have made peace appear like
mirage."

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Minister of Foreign
Affairs Ali Osman Mohamed Taha today called upon Uganda to cease
its aggression against Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to newsmen here, the Sudanese minister
reiterated his country's policy of good neighborliness and
endeavors to resolve differences with Uganda through peaceful
dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He added that the aggression committed by Ugandan troops
against the towns of Kaya and Yei along the Sudanese-Ugandan
borders last Sunday represented a flagrant violation of the
agreement reached between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese Minister added that despite the Sudan's keen
interest in the success of the Iranian mediation between the two
countries, the acts perpetrated by Uganda have rendered the talks
between the Sudan and Uganda, due to start in Kampala Saturday,
impossible.
</P>
<P>
He said Sudan has left the matter in the hands of Iran to have
the talks later in Nairobi or Kampala under better circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Government Agrees to Curb Fundamentalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's coalition government
today agreed to implement the recommendations by the National
Security Council (NSC) aimed at curbing the increasing
fundamentalist activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The decision made at a cabinet meeting, which lasted for nearly
four hours, claimed that the government would make every effort
to fight the threat of "religious extremism " .
</P>
<P>
Public opinion held that the Thursday meeting was crucial since
it could show whether the coalition government has settled their
dispute on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the meeting, Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan unexpectedly told the press that in line with the
constitution, the NSC recommendations would be given the first
place on the agenda, widely seen as a sharp contrast with his
previous attitude.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said
at the end of the meeting that the cabinet ministers had
reached a consensus on the strict implementation of the NSC
recommendations designed to defend the secularist system in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Ciller, also chairwoman of the junior coalition partner True
Path Party (DYP), said: "These measures will be treated with
strictness. No one should doubt that. Let no one speculate
anyone."
</P>
<P>
The military-dominated NSC meeting was called in February to
discuss ways for pressing the Islamist government to take strong
measures against the increasingly rampant fundamentalist
activities.
</P>
<P>
A 22-Point communique put forward by the NSC meeting
triggered a confrontation between the RP and military in the
past weeks, which had been feared to lead to a nationwide
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure by both the military and DYP, Erbakan
finally signed the recommendations on March 5 so as to avoid the
collapse of the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that all the ministers concerned would
start working soon and take practical measures to implement the
NSC decisions.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Erbakan attributed the recent political
turmoil at home to what he called "secularist reactionaries",
saying these people only wanted to impose their own will on
others but did not know religion.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the NSC recommendations, he also
vowed that the government was constitutionally responsible for the
Parliament, implying the military was using force to put
pressure on him.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The University of Zambia, the
largest in the country, was closed down this afternoon following
a disturbance caused by a boycott of classes.
</P>
<P>
University Registrar Michael Tandeo said here today that all
the students have been ordered to vacate their rooms
immediately and to leave the campus by 17:00 (local time).
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the closure of the university does not
affect its post-graduate programs or the school of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Tandeo said the senate met today and concluded that the
situation can not be allowed to continue as it has serious
implications on the normal activities of the university.
</P>
<P>
Some students said before leaving the university that the
closure is too sudden.
</P>
<P>
The students started a class boycott on Monday, demanding
immediate payment of 280,000 Kwacha (about 215 U.S. Dollars) to
each student as book allowance.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen students have been expelled since then for alleged
rioting causing damage to the institution.
</P>
<P>
The students demand an immediate and unconditional
reinstatement of the expelled students. enditem

<HEADLINE> Clinton Condemns Shooting of School Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Thursday that shooting of seven Israeli school children by
a Jordanian soldier was "an inexcusable and tragic act of
violence,"
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks before his departure for North Carolina. He
said: "There is no justification or excuse for these acts", at a
time of high-tension between the Arabs and Israelis over Israel's
violation of peace agreements by construction of Jewish homes in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said there was no evidence that "this terrible
incident is related to the tensions in the area over the issues."
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe that this was politically
motivated by any larger group or anything," he said.
</P>
<P>
Appealing for calm in the region, Clinton said: "There needs to
be a certain mutuality of action in the Middle East to get this
peace process well under way. That is what I had hoped would
happen after the Hebron agreement."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Madrid said King Hussein of Jordan would cut short
his visit in Spain and put off a planned trip to Washington to
discuss with Clinton over over the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian embassy to Spain said on Thursday that King Hussein
had condemned the killing of the school children and would release
a statement later.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also urged Arab and
Israeli leaders to keep calm over the shooting incident.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon all leaders in the region to calm the
situation, to do their utmost to prevent future violence in any
form and to redouble their efforts to forge a just and lasting
peace," she said in a written statement.

WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. current account
deficit soared to 165.1 billion dollars last year, the second
worst performance in history, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The gain of 11.4 percent in the current account deficit
reflected an increase in the imbalance in goods to an all-time
high and a third straight shortfall in investment earnings.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit is considered the broadest gauge of
the trade performance in the U.S. because it measures not only
trade in goods and services but also investment flows between
countries and foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in 1996 marked the worst performance since a record
high deficit of 167.4 billion dollars in 1987. It was also much
larger than the 148.2 billion imbalance of 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the deficit in the fourth quarter shrank to 41.4
billion dollars from 47.9 billion in the third.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the merchandise deficit was up by 8.2
percent to a record 187.7 billion dollars last year. Offsetting
those deficit increases, America's surplus in service trade rose
7.5 percent to 73.5 billion, also an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
The investment deficit rose 5 percent to 8.4 billion dollars.
In the final category, which includes U.S. foreign aid payments,
the deficit rose by 21.1 percent to 42.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
The United States was transformed from the world's largest
creditor nation to the largest debtor in 1980s.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists believe that the U.S. current account deficit
will deteriorate again this year.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho PM to Step Down Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Prime Minister
Ntsu Mokhehle is to retire from active politics at the end of his
term of office early next year due to ill-health and old age.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle, 79, said in Maseru, the capital of the kingdom
earlier this week that he would not run for party elections or
general elections, reported the South African Press Association
here today.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle, the leader of the ruling Basotholand Congress Party
(BCP), said that ill-health and old age put him at a
disadvantage, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that I am old and ill. For these and other
personal reasons I agree that I must go," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
When asked who should succeed him, Mokhehle said there were
many capable people in the BCP who could replace him.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Mokhehle's deputy Molapo Qhobela, believed
to be the leader of a faction within the BCP, called for the
resignation of an ailing Mokhehle, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is a small land-locked kingdom surrounded by South
Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Marks South Lebanon's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon inaugurated this evening
activities commemorating the first Israeli aggression into this
country on March 14, 1978, the day when Israel took some one tenth
of Lebanon's territories.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his people, Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
accused Israel of treating Lebanon as merely a "field for
settling accounts, crises and solutions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that until now, Israel has not shown its intentions
to implement the U.N. Resolution 425 issued by the Security
Council 19 years ago, which calls for an Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Compared to a relatively low profile in the past, Lebanon is
determined to hold grand ceremonies this year to mark the Day of
Unity with South Lebanon for it is the first following a 17-day
Israeli blitz against Lebanon in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Besides the March 14, 1978 aggression, a bombardment by
Israeli forces at a U.N. peacekeeping force camp at Qana on
April 18, 1996, in which more than 100 civilians were killed, is
also marked on the day.
</P>
<P>
According to an agenda issued by the Parliamentarian
Committee for Commemorating March 14 and April 18, candle
marches will be organized in Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, and
other major cities tonight, mosques will shout Allah's name and
churches will sound their bells.
</P>
<P>
Among the foreign guests participating in the occasion is
Esmat Abdul-Maguid, Secretary General of the Arab League, who
arrived here this morning particularly for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi underlined that the Lebanese people are believed in
peace and do not believe in violence as a way to respond
aggression.
</P>
<P>
He urged the United States to refrain from using its veto in
the U.N. Security Council on issues pertaining to the
construction of Jewish settlements by Israel in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Representative of the U.S. cast a veto last Friday when the
Security Council was voting on a resolution condemning the
Jewish state for its housing plans in East Jerusalem, prompting
an anger of the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are upholding a just and comprehensive peace, this is our
decision and we will never deviate from it," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated his country's position adhering to an interlock
of the Syrian and Lebanese tracks. "This is our choice," he
said, "and Israel can do nothing to separate the two tracks."
</P>
<P>
Calling for the Israeli withdrawal from the south, the
Lebanese president reasserted that after the withdrawal, the
Lebanese authorities will "guarantee a security" in the
area.

<P>
SARAJEVO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman will visit neighboring Bosnia and Hercegovina over the
weekend, according to a spokesman to European Union High Representative In
Bosnia Carl Bildt.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Colum Murphy, said today that Tudjman is invited
by the collective Bosnian presidency but will probably not meet
Alija Izetbegovic, the Muslim chairman of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic is in Saudi Arabia and the presidency has
designated the Croat member of the presidency, Kresmir Zubak, to
handle the Tudjman visit.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the visit could help arrest some members of
the Croat police in Mostar who were blamed for the February 10
attack on Muslims and ease tension in that divided city.

<HEADLINE> European Countries Speed Up Evacuation Work in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- European countries and the United
States have asked their nationals to leave Albania as tension
heightened there.
</P>
<P>
France has sent four military transport helicopters to Albania
to evacuate 50 to 70 French nationals from the Balkan state to the
Italian city of Brindisi, said the office of chief of staff of the
French army. But the French government is not going to close its
embassy in Tirana.
</P>
<P>
A frigate of the French navy, Germinal, is sailing to the
Albanian coast to provide logistic support to the evacuation
operation, the same source added.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that a total of 700 foreign nationals have left
Albania by Italian military aircrafts and arrived in Italy over
the past 24 hours. Five Italian military aircrafts continued their
evacuation this morning.
</P>
<P>
European countries such as French and Italy have urged the
Albanian government and all political forces to work for a
solution to the crisis through dialogue and to take action to
prevent the loss of many weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the Albania government and other political groups
have asked the international community to take action to control
the chaotic situation in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry officials of 15 EU countries held an emergency
meeting last night and issued a statement asking for effective
measures to curb violence and restore order.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the EU had no plan for any military
intervention in the Balkan state.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today expressed his worry about the forthcoming talks with
U.S. President Bill Clinton, saying it would be the most difficult
one in the history of Russian-American relations.
</P>
<P>
According to Itar-Tass news agency, at a meeting with the heads
of the Russian mass media, Yeltsin noted that the questions on
NATO's enlargement, reduction of strategic offensive weapons and
economic relations between the two countries will be the main
topics on the summit agenda.
</P>
<P>
Yelstin said: "I want to put forth several difficult questions
to President Clinton."
</P>
<P>
He is interested, among other things, why Germany, Japan and
other Western countries actively operate on the Russian market,
while the United States is trailing behind.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of NATO enlargement, Yeltsin said that Russia
may disagree with the United States over the NATO issue at the
forthcoming talks in Helsinki. But it should not be dramatized, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he heard a "call for a compromise" in his recent
telephone conversation with U.S. President Clinton and will agree
to the compromise which would not damage Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-U.S. summit talks is scheduled for 19-21 March in

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The new generation of China's
collective leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core has the support
of the people of the whole country, Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark during a meeting with Chinese and overseas
journalists shortly after the closing of the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress, at the invitation of Zhou Jue,
deputy secretary general and spokesman for the session.
</P>
<P>
"The current session of the National People's Congress, which
had come to a successful conclusion, just approved the report on
the work of the government last year I delivered on behalf of the
State Council. The fifth session of the Eighth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
also voiced its endorsement to the government work report and its
support to the future work," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"The future tasks for the State Council and governments at all
levels are to implement the objectives, goals and measures set
forth in this report and, with the support of the people across
the country, to do still better the work for this year.
</P>
<P>
Our beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping passed away shortly before
the convocation of the sessions of the NPC and the National
Committee of the CPPCC, and the entire mourning activities,
proceeding in an air of solemnity, were immersed in deepest grief
and held in an orderly way, giving an expression to the people's
profound respects for Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the proceedings of the two sessions of NPC and
CPPCC respectively, we can see that the current collective
leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the support of
the entire Chinese people and China's political situation is
stable.
</P>
<P>
We are convinced that the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is sure
to be carried forward and continue to be developed, and China's
situation will become better and better."

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The growth of sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) has reached a new record among Ukrainian teenagers
over recent years with a nine-fold rise in AIDS-related patients
aged from 15 to 17.
</P>
<P>
Only 37 cases of HIV infection -- the virus that causes AIDS --
were registered among children aged from 15 to 17 in 1995. But by
August 1996, the number has shot up to 180, said Yuri Kruglov of
the country's Center for AIDS Prevention.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and Ukraine
called for improving the quality of the courses on value studies
and sexual knowledge in schools.
</P>
<P>
One expert, however, pointed out that the spread of STDs would
not ebb unless the country's social and economic circumstances
improved.

In reply to a question on China's entry into WTO, Li said that
as a major trading nation in the world, China is eager to join the
WTO, and has made great efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"We have reduced the average import tariff rate to 23 percent
from 35 percent and made the commitment to further cut the rate to
15 percent by the end of the century, about the average level for
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China welcomes recent progress in talks on Chinese
accession to the WTO, the premier said, it is abnormal that China
has been unable to join the WTO for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
"Granted that economic interests have played a part in this,
there is no denying that this has also been due to political
factors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I can reiterate on behalf of the Chinese government that,
after joining the WTO, China will fulfil its obligations while
enjoying rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it is known to all that China is still a
developing country and that it is unacceptable to apply to China
the criteria for developed countries concerning its accession to
the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"China needs the WTO, and the WTO also needs China," he said,
adding that relevant countries should take a sensible attitude so
that the issue will be resolved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you, however, that China has enough patience to
wait," he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question whether provinces and ministries will
interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) after July 1, Li said that HKSAR will be a special
administrative region with a high degree of autonomy by then,
toward which China will adopt the policy of "One country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
Thus, "no provinces and ministries will be allowed to interfere
in HKSAR's affairs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to note that some people from the British side
claimed recently that they would supervise over the implementation
of the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong issue after
July 1.
</P>
<P>
"This is not realistic, as the issue of Hong Kong will be
purely China's internal affair after the country resumes the
exercise of its sovereignty over the region on July 1 this year.

Concerning the question how China will handling the incident of
Hwang Jang-yop, Li said the incident occurred in China, and that
in accordance with the universally-recognized conventions of the
international law, China, as a sovereign state, has the full right
of jurisdiction over the incident.
</P>
<P>
"For the same reason, China does not recognize the right of
diplomatic asylum by foreign embassies and consulates in its
territory," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is very prudent in handling this incident,
mainly proceeding from the question of maintaining peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsular, according to the premier.
</P>
<P>
In the entire course of handling this case, Li said, "We
should, of course, take into account the stances of all the
parties concerned, and resolve the issue properly as soon as
possible in accordance with the relevant international laws.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the conditions are almost ripe for resolving
this incident," Li said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the question on how China will solve the
remaining problems of state-owned enterprises, Li put forward a
total of seven measures for the reform of state firms in his
Government Work Report. "Those measures are all to the point and
feasible, and are in line with the experiences of state enterprise
reform in the past years," he said.
</P>
<P>
An important measure taken by the government this year is to
support major large and medium-sized state-owned firms and enliven
small ones by giving them greater freedom and flexibility of
operation, by which the government expects to achieve positive
results, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The task in the future is to step up the reform and improve
management of some loss-making firms, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier also noted that problems some state firms now face
have existed for a long time and will not be solved overnight. "It
will take a long time to address the problems," he said.

Answering a question on Sino-U.S. relations, Li said, "At my
invitation, Vice-President Al Gore will soon visit China. This
visit will be an important event in relations between China and
the United States."
</P>
<P>
"One of the important tasks for Vice-President Al Gore during
his visit is to prepare for a meeting between the top leaders of
China and US, which will take place later this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While Vice-President Al Gore is in China, we will also
co-chair a forum to discuss environmental protection and
development issues. And we will also have an exchange of views on
other issues of mutual interest," the Chinese Premier said.
</P>
<P>
"Vice-President Al Gore will be accorded a friendly reception
in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is the biggest developing country and the United States
is the most developed country in the world. So our two countries
exercise strong influences in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to differences in ideology resulting from our different
social systems, we have some disagreements. But we have to reduce
confrontation and develop cooperation in order to develop our
relations on a normal track," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a healthy and stable development of Sino-US
relations will be in the interest of world peace and stability,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In handling international relations, the Chinese government
always maintains that all countries regardless of their size
should be all treated as equals. And what China opposes most is
interference in other countries' internal affairs. And in this
matter China has been a victim," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since China itself is strongly opposed to interference in
internal affairs from other countries, naturally, China will be
the last country to interfere in or influence the internal affairs
of other countries in any form, he said.
</P>
<P>
Answering the question on Sino-Russian relations, the Premier
said that China will sign a border disarmament agreement with
Russia and three central Asian countries during President Jiang
Zemin's state visit to Russia in coming April.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the reduction of military forces in the border
area will be signed by the heads of states of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan and Tajikistan, said Li.
</P>
<P>
"With the signing of this agreement," the premier pointed out,
"the border that we share with the four countries will be a border
for cooperation and good neighborliness."
</P>
<P>
He added the leaders of China and Russia will exchange views on
the international situation and issue an important political
document during Jiang's visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He also made a brief explanation on the strategic partnership
for cooperation, established between China and Russia last April,
that is geared toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the fact that China and Russia share a border of
over 4,000 km, he noted China hopes that the two countries will
have a friendly relationship.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chongqing People Happy, Sober-Minded about NPC Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Government officials and people
of the just-approved Chongqing municipality appear happy but
sober-minded at the news of the establishment of Chongqing as a
centrally-administered municipality in accordance with a decision
made by the Eighth National People's Congress at its
just-concluded fifth session.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing city and three largely rural areas that have just
been incorporated into the municipality used to be part of Sichuan
province.
</P>
<P>
When news of the NPC decision reached Chongqing today, local
officials and people expressed agreement that Chongqing should
play the role of serving as an economic center in southwest china,
of doing a good job in relocating the one million people around
the Three Gorges Project area, and of developing economy in the
area.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhizhong, deputy secretary of the municipal Party
committee, said establishment of the municipality is a major step
taken by the central authorities to accelerate economic
development in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
He said Chongqing shoulders heavy responsibilities and will
strive for quicker development.
</P>
<P>
Said Xu Zhongming, vice mayor of Chongqing in charge of
opening-up, said: "We are fully aware of the pressure after
Chongqing becomes a centrally-administered municipality."
</P>
<P>
He said that Chongqing will open wider to the outside world,
effectively improve its environmental investment, and attract more
domestic and overseas businesses to start operations in Chongqing
and the area around the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has established a Relocation Bureau to handle the
resettlement of people affected by the Project.
</P>
<P>
Liu Fuyin, director of the bureau, said establishment of
Chongqing municipality will facilitate centralized planning and
management of the resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
Ren Dajun, secretary of the newly-established Rural Work
Committee of Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, said that, since
the new municipality has a vast rural area, the municipality's
urban areas will do a good job of galvanizing economic development
in the rural area.
</P>
<P>
People in the two cities of Wanxian and Fuling and the
prefecture of Qianjiang, which have been incorporated into
Chongqing municipality, also voiced their approval for the NPC
decision.
</P>
<P>
Shui Zhengkuan, secretary of the Qianjiang Prefectural Party
Committee, said Qianjiang is a poor area with 1.06 million people
living under the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the local authorities are determined to lift
these people out of poverty within the three years before the
start of the next century.

Chongqing, a major industrial city in southwest China, to be the
country's fourth municipality, a motion which merits worldwide
attention, was approved at the Fifth Session of the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature, today.
</P>
<P>
When Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee announced

auditorium in the Great Hall of the People resounded with
thunderous applauses.
</P>
<P>
Photographers and cameramen from both China and overseas

"The motion has been approved! The motion has been approved!"
claimed Jiang Weining, a TV reporter from Chongqing Television
Station excitedly through his mobile phone to his fellow residents
in Chongqing. And an enthusiastic response with prolonged cheers
was heard on the phone instantly.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Chongqing, China's largest city in the upper Yangtze
River Valley and a leading industrial city in southwest China is
endowed with a mission as a "bellwether" of enlivening the economy
in the central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
"Though we 'break up' our family, we'll still have deep
affections for each other and will be good neighbors for ever,"

million people to Chongqing with the approval to establish the
latter as the fourth centrally-administered municipality today.
</P>
<P>
He Zhiqiang, governor of southwestern Yunnan province sat
nearby when the motion was approved. He congratulated Yu and said
with joy, "We'd march hand in hand in the future."
</P>
<P>
The promoted Chongqing has now been entrusted with three major
responsibilities, namely, to give scope to the role of the center
on the Yangtze's upper reaches, explore a new road for cities to
help adjacent rural areas, and to fulfil the relocation of farmers
from the Three George Project area.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zongli, president of the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, pitched in and said with excitement,"Such upgrading is
necessitated by the economic take-off in the Yangtze River
valley."
</P>
<P>
When NPC deputies walked out of the Great Hall of the People,
the venue of NPC's annual session, after the session is over,
Zhang Deling, party secretary of the newly-established Chongqing
Municipality, was soon surrounded by crowds of long-waiting
reporters, who bombarded him with a chain of questions. Smiling
Zhang said repeatedly,"My responsibility overweighs my joy."
</P>
<P>
Huang Ji, a NPC deputy and famous writer from Chongqing, who
has just completed his new reportoire "the Birth of Chongqing
Municipality from Diaries of a NPC Deputy" ended his works with a
real happy ending: "Wish you Good luck, my Chongqing!"

<HEADLINE> China, Britain Narrow Differences on Hong Kong Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China and Britain have narrowed
their differences on the entry of a limited number of advance
staff of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) into Hong Kong before
July 1, 1997, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news briefing, Chen Zuo'er, Chinese representative
on the JLG, said that the two sides narrowed the differences and
made progress on the matter at the 23rd experts meeting on defense
of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG).
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and British experts completed the scheduled agenda
through pragmatic and serious talks over the past two days. "I
hope that news on further progress will be reported at the 39th
JLG meeting to be held in London next week," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations lasted 11 months on the entry of a limited number
of advance PLA staff, who will just make necessary preparations to
help the PLA Hong Kong garrison to fulfill the defense mission
after July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Experts on both sides have discussed the matter for 11 months,
and only three months are left before the handover of the
political power, so time is limited. At this meeting, the two
sides came to realize that time is pressing," said the Chinese
representative.
</P>
<P>
Chen continued, "The transfer of defense is the common
responsibility of both Chinese and British sides, and we should
eliminate obstacles and quicken steps."
</P>
<P>
Alan Paul, who headed the British experts team, said that the
two-day discussions were pragmatic, thorough and seriously minded.
"Both sides have a much better understanding of each other's
concerns. We examined all the issues, including the highly
technical ones. This will certainly be helpful in taking forward
these discussions in the course of the JLG meeting next week in
London," he said.

<P>
HANOI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of people infected with
HIV virus in Vietnam is growing by about 1,000 a year, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
As many as 4,811 people have been tested HIV positive and
another 618 have developed full-blown AIDS since 1991 when the
first case of the disease was found in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said 373 people had died of AIDS or AIDS-related
complications in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Roughly half of Vietnam's HIV cases were found in Ho Chi Minh
City in the south.
</P>
<P>
Men account for over 82 percent of the victims while 90 percent
are listed as being of employment age.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total, 26 were foreigners from Thailand and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Most of the country's HIV cases are related to drug addiction
and prostitution.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to raise awareness about AIDS, more than 33,000
officials from national AIDS prevention centers took part in
various AIDS prevention programs in 1996, the report said.

JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Part-time forces of South
African army will be redesigned by April 1 due to budget cuts in
recent years, the South African National Defense Force (SANDF)
said in an internal communication bulletin today.
</P>
<P>
Superfluous personnel must be transferred to South African
army headquarters and defense headquarters, where a need for
personnel exists, the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
Part-time staff serving in affected headquarters, regiments
and battalions should be transferred in terms of a personnel plan
to be compiled by officers commanding and the staff concerned,
it added.
</P>
<P>
Civilians currently serving in the headquarters, regiments
and battalions affected by this redesign must be re-allocated to
appropriate posts.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin said staff who were area-bound and could
therefore not be transferred, could apply for voluntary severance
packages.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils last month said up to
20 percent of all SANDF members could receive retrenchment
packages, most of them from the support services.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Typhoid fever has killed at least
46 people and infected 5,000 others since its outbreak in
Tajikistan in January, according to a press release issued here
today by the World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
The document warned that the epidemic might spread if urgent
measures were not taken to stop it. The total number of cases
could reach 50,000 to 60,000 and the mortality rate might rise to
10 percent without appropriate antibiotic treatment, it said.
</P>
<P>
But with timely and proper treatment, the rate might be reduced
to less than one percent, the document said.
</P>
<P>
A study carried out by WHO attributed the cause of the disease
to contaminated water in the country, saying that the water in the
capital city of Dushanbe had not been treated for at least three
months.
</P>
<P>
Poor sanitary facilities and hygiene in the country helped
transmit the disease and resulted in its rampant spread, the study
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Tajikistan government has asked for immediate support from
WHO, which has purchased laboratory facilities and received funds
from Denmark and Sweden to purchase medicine.
</P>
<P>
Japan has announced that it would donate one million
U.S. dollars to help control the serious epidemic in Tajikistan.

<P>
LONDON, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion the United
States will have to beat Japan in a playoff this summer to remain
its winning hope alive in the Fed Cup women's team event.
</P>
<P>
A weak U.S. team was beaten by the Netherlands in the opening
round early this month and will be relegated to Group II unless it
defeats Japan in the home-advantaged playoff round July 12-13.
</P>
<P>
The first-round losers Spain and Germany will also face a fight
to stay in Group 1. Spain will travel to Australia, while Germany
will host Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The results of the draw, held in Luxembourg, were announced
Friday by the International Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
Against the Netherlands, the U.S. team was weakened by the
absence of Monica Seles and Lindsay Davenport. Seles had a broken
finger and Davenport was left off the team after a dispute with
captain Martina Navratilova.
</P>
<P>
With Mary Joe Fernandez, Chanda Rubin and Gigi Fernandez making
the team, the Americans were eliminated 3-2 by the Netherlands in
Haarlem.
</P>
<P>
Spain, four-time Fed Cup champion and last year's runner-up,
was humiliated 5-0 by Belgium in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Germany was without injured Steffi Graf and Anke Huber when it
lost 3-2 in Manheim to the Czech Republic. The Germans must now
overcome a Crotian team led by Iva Majoli.
</P>
<P>
The other play-off tie sees Switzerland, led by 16-year-old
sensation Martina Hingis, hosting Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Hingis returned to Kosice, the city of her birth, to lead the
Swiss to victory over Slovakia in a Group II match and now can
take her team into Group 1 with a win over Argentina.
</P>
<P>
In the Group I semifinals the same weekend, the Czech Republic
will host the Netherlands while France will play Belgium in
France.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denounces Shoot-out at Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon denounced today the
killing of seven Israeli schoolgirls by a Jordanian soldier
Thursday, but linked it with the April 1996 massacre of its
civilians by the Israeli forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in the capital of Beirut, President Elias
Hrawi said, "We are with the humanitarianism and I condemn what
occurred with the Israeli schoolgirls...but we have the right to
ask whether the world had condemned what Israel did at Qana and
the bloodshed of children and women."
</P>
<P>
More than 100 civilians were killed when Israeli artillery
bombarded a U.N. peacekeeping force camp at Qana on April 18,
1996, making it the bloodiest day in a 17-day Israeli blitz in
the country.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian soldier opened fire on Thursday morning at an
Israeli bus carrying Israeli schoolgirls who were on a field trip
along the Jordan river, leaving seven of them killed and six
others wounded in the border shooting spree.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering marking the 50th anniversary of the
founding of the Doctor's Syndicate in Lebanon, the Lebanese
president reiterated his country's adherence to a just and
comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi noted that his country sent delegates to the Madrid
peace conference in October, 1991, for "solidarity with our Arab
brothers in their causes, not (only) for seeking an
implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
The resolution calls for an unconditional withdrawal of Israeli
forces from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the occupation of other's lands and violation of
other's sovereignty are "moves against the humanitarianism."
</P>
<P>
Israel has set up the so-called 10,000-square kilometer
"security zone" in south Lebanon in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Cotton Price Hike Curbs Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A major hike in local cotton prices
has seriously diminished the appeal of Egypt's textile export in
the fiscal year 1995-96, said the Egyptian Shura (Consultative)
Council in a report wired out today.
</P>
<P>
The textile export, which amounts to about a quarter
of the country's total sales abroad, slumped to 2.245 billion
Egyptian pounds (660 million U.S. dollars) last year from 3
billion pounds (882 million dollars) in 1994-95, said the report
quoted by the Egyptian news agency MENA.
</P>
<P>
The report said industry can do a lot better when given the
availability of high-quality Egyptian cotton, the low-cost and
skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
However, the cotton price hike of 75 percent in the recent
couple of years has eroded the competitiveness of local textile
products on foreign markets, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the drop in the overall export volume was
curtailed by the increase in exports of knitwears and
ready-to-wear clothes.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, which is among Egypt's largest foreign
currency earners and one of the huge job-providers, is vital
for the country's industrial and economic structure, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
But high cotton prices have greatly cramped the operations of
the public and private spinning factories alike in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Some of the factories are on the verge of bankruptcy while the
total losses sustained by those ailing ones reach 500 million
pounds (about 147 million dollars).

<P>
NANNING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the many years spent
cultivating, farmers in an old revolutionary base in south China's
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region chopped down their fruit trees
without a minute's hesitation when they learned that the
government intends to build a railway across their orchards.
</P>
<P>
Building roadways to increase wealth has become a common goal
of the people of Guangxi, which has abundant natural resources and
a number of ports on its coastline.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the people of Guangxi donated more than 20 million
yuan (about 2.4 million US dollars) for construction of Qinzhou
Port. One of those affected by the construction was Liang Jinhua,
who lost his farm and had to go look for work at a petroleum
wharf.
</P>
<P>
"Although the port has destroyed our farmland," Liang said, "we
feel certain that we will benefit from the port after it is
completed."
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995, Guangxi's state-owned enterprises spent 73.3
billion yuan on infrastructure and basic industries, including the
Nanning-Wuzhou and Pingguo-Baise highways, the Qinzhou-Beihai
railway, and five ports for 10,000 dwt ships.
</P>
<P>
The massive highway construction project has brought Guangxi
closer to its neighbors. In 1996, the region signed as many as
1,800 economic and technological cooperation agreements that
attracted 1.25 billion yuan from other parts of China.

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Network Equipment Technology
Inc. (NET), one of the leading US suppliers of data telecom
network facilities, has found a profitable market in China, a
country in the midst of sweeping telecom reforms.
</P>
<P>
So far, the company has developed into the biggest provider for
Chinanet, one of three national-level public telecom networks here.
</P>
<P>
The NET data transmission products are used in the public and
private networks in Sichuan, Inner Mongolia, Zhejiang and Fujian,
however, the company is looking forward to a bigger market share
here.
</P>
<P>
NET introduced its ATM (asynchronous transport mode) products
to China in order to facilitate the online services and
multi-media transmission, according to representatives with the NET
China office.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they said, the company will provide stronger
technical support for its Chinese sales agents, and expand the
cooperation with local partners in the fields of engineering and
personnel training.
</P>
<P>
NET will establish its second representative office in China in
Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, later this year.
</P>
<P>
The company's global turnover came to 3.4 billion US dollars in
1996.

When the Nanning-Kunming railway is completed, ports on the
region's southern coast will be the most convenient access for
southwest China's provinces or regions to the sea.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, we seldom cared about other provinces and
regions," said Yang Yexing, an official at Fangcheng Port, but
"Now we are greatly concerned about any news from other provinces
or regions in the Southwest because our port provides services for
them."
</P>
<P>
Government policy makers have considered transportation as part
of a strategy of speeding up the local economy. This year, the
region's investment in fixed assets will reach 56.8 billion yuan,
primarily for transportation, energy and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Kejie, chairman of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Regional
Government, is giving priority to developing transportation, and
has come up with an ambitious plan where the combined capacities
of Fangcheng, Qinzhou and Beihai ports will have risen to 25
million tons annually by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Construction of highways has helped the economy of Beihai,
Fangcheng, and Qinzhou ports to take off. Their GNP has maintained
a growth rate of 20 percent or more for several years. Not
surprisingly, the travel time between the regional capital of
Nanning and Qinzhou has gone down from an entire day spent on a
bumpy road to three hours by highway.

<P>
LUANDA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- New tuberculosis contractors in
Angola last year reached 10,867, according to the statistics
published by the Ministry of Health here today.
</P>
<P>
Although the figure was quite high compared to 6,623
contractors in 1995, people here consider it too low as Jorge
Dupret, director of the National TB Prevention Authority,
estimated that new TB contractors last year should be 20,000.
</P>
<P>
He said 3,400 TB contractors appeared alone in Luanda
province, one of the 18 provinces in the country.
</P>
<P>
Dupret attributed the fast increase of the disease to the
chaos brought about by large numbers of refugees during the civil
war, and malnutrition resulting in the decline of people's
immunity from illness.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Instability enables people to move from rural to
urban areas, and there is lack of both doctors and medicines in
hospitals of the country. Only four specialists throughout Angola
look after 400 in-patients and there are 100 out-patients every
day.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization said out of 3.354 million
tuberculosis patients at present in the world, 541,360 are
Africans.

<P>
LHASA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Lhasa, capital city of Tibet
Autonomous Region, today launched an experimental program to
optimize the structure of local state-owned firms' assets.
</P>
<P>
This was announced at a local meeting in Lhasa today. Xu
Mingyang, vice-chairman of the regional government told the
meeting that the program represents a turning point for Tibet's
enterprise restructuring, as it will change from the practice of
restructuring a single company to invigorating the entire
state-owned sector of the city.
</P>
<P>
As the regional political, economic and cultural center, the
Tibetan capital represents 60 percent of the autonomous region's
total number of state firms and 70 percent of their assets,
according to the vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the enterprise reform in Tibet relies on the
pilot reform in Lhasa, which will be of great importance for
attaining the goal of the autonomous region's Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) and its long-term objective for the year 2010.

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Two players of Beijing have been
fined and banned for the rest of the season on Friday following
their assaults on the referee at a Chinese first-division
volleyball league match last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Ou Nan and Xu Zhihe was each fined 2,000 yuan (241
U.S. dollars), the Chinese Volleyball Association (CVA) said in a
statement.

Ou, apparently angry at the referee's decision on the last
point, abused verbally and kicked the referee after Beijing lost
its away game 3-2 against Hubei on Saturday.

Xu followed by picking up a courtside stool and trying to hurl
toward the referee, but he was stopped by other officials at the
site.
</P>
<P>
The club was also warned and fined 3,000 yuan (361 dollars) as
its captain Li Mu refused to sign on the results sheet and head
coach Yu Huanzan failed to take prompt action to stop his players
in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The organising committee of Hubei was also penalized by a 5,000
yuan (602 dollars) fine because the local fans threw projectiles
into the court after the players' attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A majority of Chinese workers say
that the quality of life has improved over the past decade and
that they hope the country's stability and fast economic growth
will continue.
</P>
<P>
These attitudes were revealed by a survey done jointly by the
State Statistics Bureau, the People's Bank of China, the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions, and the ministries of civil affairs,
public health, and labor from December of last year to January.
</P>
<P>
The survey covered 30,000 urban households across China, 80.6
percent of the respondents said that the quality of life was
better than ten years ago and 15.5 percent of them said that they
had seen "great improvement" in their lives.

life was clearly better than five years ago.

<P>
In answer to questions about major concerns, workers said that
social stability and national economic growth were the major ones,
followed by social security and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chinese workers are also concerned about medical care reforms,
inflation, housing reforms, welfare reforms, pensions, and wage
adjustments. Then come children's education and the growing
disparity between incomes.

and celebrities. Only one out of 200 questioned showed a great
deal of interest in the lives or careers of stars and celebs.

<P>
HONG KONG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Guangnan (KK) Supermarket, a
subsidiary of Chinese-funded food distributor Guangnan (Holdings),
 is planning an expansion campaign to challenge Hong Kong's two
dominant supermarket chains.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to invest some 20 million HK dollars (2.6
million US dollars) to open as many as 10 new KK supermarkets this
year, while boosting business at its existing 35 stores by
carrying a wider variety than its competitors.
</P>
<P>
KK General Manager Yeung Wing-tung said the investment will be
financed primarily from internal resources with the balance coming
from bank loans.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the new supermarkets will be built around new
towns and will offer customers larger fresh-food counters.
</P>
<P>
"We will offer more choices, more fresh food," he promised,
saying his company will have advanced knowledge about new types of
fresh food being developed in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
For years Hong Kong's supermarket business has been dominated
by Park N' Shop and Wellcome, each having around 200 stores across
the territory.
</P>
<P>
Since KK's sister company in the Chinese mainland is also
expanding very fast, "our combined strength in the next five years
hopefully may surpass our competitors in Hong Kong," said Yeung.

<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today ordered Interior Secretary Robert Barbers to mount a
nationwide war against organized crimes, including kidnapping,
bank robbery, drug trafficking and other illegal activities in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the presidential palace said that Ramos,
in his hand-written instruction, ordered Barbers to intensify
anti-kidnap and anti-crime drive by utilizing the community,
law-enforcement agencies, prosecutors, courts and correctional
institutions.
</P>
<P>
It said that the president also ordered the country's police
chief, defense secretary, justice secretary and other senior
officials to provide Barbers all the assistance and support he
needs in waging a war against crimes.
</P>
<P>
According to the presidential palace, Ramos' order is the
government's reaction to a report by the U.S. Fortune magazine
which labeled the Philippines as "the kidnapping capital of Asia."
</P>
<P>
The magazine said in a recent issue that 241 people were
kidnapped for ransom in the Philippines in 1996, nearly double the
official figure for the previous year.
</P>
<P>
It said that kidnapping statistics are "greatly under-stated"
in the country because many victims are too frightened to complain
to the police.

government's resolution, again extending presidential rule in
Uttar Pradesh for another six months beyond April 17.
</P>
<P>
The resolution placed before the house by Union Home Minister
Indrajit Gupta on Thursday was put to vote by Speaker P.A. Sangma
without discussion and was carried by a voice of vote.
</P>
<P>
This is the third extension of presidential rule in Uttar
Pradesh due to its uncertainties and law and order situation in
that state.
</P>
<P>
Since last year there has been two successive extensions of
presidential rule in the state.
</P>
<P>
Last November, assembly elections were held in the state but no
single political party secured required seats to form a
government. As a result, the union government was forced to extend
presidential rule in that state.
</P>
<P>
Since then various political forces have maneuvered again to
muster enough support to form a government, but they failed.
</P>
<P>
The law and order situation has been deteriorating day by day
in the state.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the biggest opposition in
parliament, walked out of the house protesting against the
government's resolution. Before walking out, BJP deputy leader
Jaswant Singh said that his party had reservations on the
extension of presidential rule and had to register its protest.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official: Gaza Conference Turning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official said
today President Yasser Arafat's call for an international
conference to examine the recent Israeli moves is a turning point
in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Finance Minister Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashibi told
the Cairo-based Voice of Arab radio that Saturday's gathering in
Gaza would "lead to a fresh development in the peace-making
process, though it raises the concern of the Israelis."
</P>
<P>
Humiliated and frustrated by the recent Israeli plans for new
settlement and limited Israeli redeployment, Arafat called for
international intervention Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Arab rage has flared since Israel decided to build 6,500
Jewish homes and close four Palestinian offices in East Jerusalem,
as well as to withdraw its troops from 9 percent of the West Bank
instead of 30 percent as demanded by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Nashashibi expected that the Gaza gathering would help make
Israel reconsider its positions and respect the basis upon which
the peace process was started.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Israeli government to drop the settlement scheme
in Jabal Abu Ghneim, also known as Har Homa, as it might blast
the whole Mideast peace march.
</P>
<P>
"This could be the straw that breaks the camel's back," he
said, adding that it could be a sheer disaster if the Israelis
ignore the will of the Palestinian people, other Arabs and the
peace-loving forces.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the United States to restore its basic role as
the honest sponsor of the peace process. The U.S., also Israel's
closest ally, vetoed last week a U.N. Security Council resolution
condemning Israel's settlement policy, but later announced to send
an envoy to the Gaza conference apparently in a bid to ease the
Arab anger.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, refused to attend the meeting on grounds that
such a gathering violated the autonomy agreements stipulating that
disputes between Israel and Palestine must be resolved in a way
agreed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
It has ruled out the possibility of retracting from its early
decisions simply out of pressure or "the threat of violence.'
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian Council, in a statement released
Thursday, called for suspending negotiations with Israel which it
accused of leading the peace march to "a real crisis."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have reportedly so far refused to coordinate
with Israel on the transfer of authority slated for a pullback,
putting the redeployment on hold. Seven Palestinian cabinet
ministers have even threatened to resign to show their outrage
over "Israel's real intention for peace."
</P>
<P>
But Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai have made it clear that Israel would
not back down from its recent decisions that fueled the Arab
rage.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Egypt's Assistant Foreign Minister
for Arab Affairs Badr Hamam will leave here today for Gaza to join
envoys from the U.S., Russia, the European Union, Japan, Norway
and Jordan at the international conference aimed to save the peace
process from collapse.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the peace process, has been the
strongest advocate of the Palestinian cause.

<HEADLINE> China to Sign Border Disarmament Agreement with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China will sign a border
disarmament agreement with Russia and three central Asian
countries during President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Russia in
coming April.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li Peng revealed the news here today when he met
reporters covering the annual session of the National People's
Congress, which closed today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the reduction of military forces in the border
area will be signed by the heads of states of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrghyzstan and Tajikistan, said Li.
</P>
<P>
"With the signing of this agreement," the premier pointed out,
"the border that we share with the four countries will be a border
for cooperation and good neighborliness."
</P>
<P>
He added the leaders of China and Russia will exchange views on
the international situation and issue an important political
document during Jiang's visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
He also made a brief explanation on the strategic partnership
for cooperation, established between China and Russia last April,
that is geared toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the fact that China and Russia share a border of
over 7000 km, he noted China hopes that the two countries will
have a friendly relationship.
</P>
<P>
The premier added that the two economies are "highly
complementary," and that China wishes to develop Sino-Russian
cooperation in economic, trade and other fields.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Russia are important countries, Li noted, and
both countries hope to play their roles in facilitating regional
and world peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"So, such a strategic partnership for cooperation is not
directed at any third country," the premier said.

(Eds: This is the full text of Li's opening remarks in
meeting with reporters)
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The new generation of China's
collective leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core has the support
of the people of the whole country, Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark during a meeting with Chinese and overseas
journalists shortly after the closing of the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress. The full text of Li's opening
remarks at the meeting are as follows:
</P>
<P>
The current session of the National People's Congress, which
had come to a successful conclusion, just approved the report on
the work of the government last year I delivered on behalf of the
State Council. The fifth session of the Eighth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
also voiced its endorsement to the government work report and its
support to the future work.
</P>
<P>
"The future tasks for the State Council and governments at all
levels are to implement the objectives, goals and measures set
forth in this report and, with the support of the people across
the country, to do still better the work for this year.
</P>
<P>
Our beloved Comrade Deng Xiaoping passed away shortly before
the convocation of the sessions of the NPC and the National
Committee of the CPPCC, and the entire mourning activities,
proceeding in an air of solemnity, were immersed in deepest grief
and held in an orderly way, giving an expression to the people's
profound respects for Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Judging from the proceedings of the two sessions of NPC and
CPPCC respectively, we can see that the current collective
leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has the support of
the entire Chinese people and China's political situation is
stable.
</P>
<P>
We are convinced that the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping is
sure to be carried forward and continue to be developed, and
China's situation will become better and better.

<HEADLINE> 56 Million Nigerians Registered for Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Some 55.7 million Nigerians among
its total population of nearly 100 million have been registered
as voters for Saturday's local government election on party
basis, the National Electoral Commission announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commission chairman Sumner Dagogo-Jack said in Nigeria's
capital of Abuja the voters' registration took place from
February 10 to 19.
</P>
<P>
The figure is five million less than the 60.6 million
suggested by the commission in its preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
It is also five million more than the number of eligible
voters (18 years and above) as estimated by the National
Population Commission, the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's election is a major step in the transition to civil
rule program of the Nigerian military government headed by
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Other major events under the transition program set for 1997
include the election of state assembly and governors. But as the
local election had been delayed for three months, they are likely
to be postponed too.

<HEADLINE> Li Expresses Confidence in Reform of State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that the Chinese Government has confidence in the
ongoing reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li put forward a total of seven measures for the reform of
state firms in his Government Work Report. "Those measures are all
to the point and feasible, and are in line with the experiences of
state enterprise reform in the past years," he told reporters
after the conclusion of the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
An important measure taken by the government this year is to
support major large and medium-sized state firms and enliven small
ones by giving them greater freedom and flexibility of operation,
by which the government expects to achieve positive results, Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The task in the future is to step up the reform and improve
management of some loss-making firms, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier also noted that problems some state firms now
face have existed for a long time and will not be solved overnight.
"It will take a long time to address the problems," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said at a
press meeting here this afternoon that the conditions are almost
ripe for resolving the Hwang Jang-yop incident.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the incident occurred in China, and in accordance
with the universally-recognized conventions of the international
law, China, as a sovereign state, has the full right of
jurisdiction over the incident.
</P>
<P>
"For the same reason, China does not recognize the right of
diplomatic asylum by foreign embassies and consulates in its
territory," Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is very prudent in handling this incident,
mainly proceeding from the question of maintaining peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsular, according to the premier.
</P>
<P>
In the entire course of handling this case, Li said, "We
should, of course, take into account the stances of all the
parties concerned, and resolve the issue properly as soon as
possible in accordance with the relevant international laws.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the conditions are almost ripe for resolving
this incident," Premier Li told reporters.

<HEADLINE> At Least 13 Killed in Southern Egypt Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen shot dead at
least 13 civilians and wounded seven others in two separate
shooting attacks Thursday night in southern Egypt, the Egyptian
news agency MENA reported today.
</P>
<P>
An Interior Ministry source was quoted as saying that in the
first shooting, which took place at 8 p.m.(18:00 GMT), masked
gunmen gun down 12 Egyptian men walking on a dirt road near Naga
Hamadi, a mostly Coptic Christian village 460 kilometers south of
the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed source said eight of the victims were Coptic
Christians. The assailants, who were suspected Muslim militants,
fled the scene after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The second attack occurred in the same area before midnight
when unidentified attackers fired at a Cairo-bound train from the
tourist city of Luxor, killing a 40-year-old housewife and
injuring six others.
</P>
<P>
The train came under fire when it was passing by the Abu Tesht
railway station near Naga Hamadi.
</P>
<P>
Local security forces quickly rushed to the scene and launched
an intensive manhunt in the nearby villages for the assailants.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's attacks were among the worst ones on Christians
since 1992 when Muslim militants killed 12 Christian villagers in
Assiut of southern Egypt.
</P>
<P>
It came exactly a month after the Egyptian government vowed to
strike hard at extremist activities in the event of the February
13 church attack. Nine Copts were killed and six others injured
when gunmen opened fire at a Coptic church in Minya, 240
kilometers south of Cairo in the attack.
</P>
<P>
The militants have waged a violent campaign attempting to
establish a strict Islamic state in Egypt since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,070 people have been killed in the clashes, mostly
civilians and police. Extremist attacks have also targeted Copts,
whom they view as apostates.
</P>
<P>
In the predominantly Muslim country, Copts make up about 10
percent of Egypt's 60 million population.

<P>
PARIS, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- All the big cities of Albania, including Tirana, are being
tormented by chaos. In a state where no one can control the
situation, President Berisha and the new government of "national
reconciliation" have launched an appeal for military intervention
by Europe -- without success up to now.
</P>
<P>
-- Burundi Thursday claimed that it foiled a coup attempt by
"Tutsi extremists." Burundian security forces arrested six
people, including two former army officers, who were close to
former President Jean-Baptiste Bagaza, after seven people were
killed on Wednesday in an explosion of landmines in the capital
Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
-- The International Federation of Red Cross announced on
Thursday that it is dispatching 10 million U.S. dollars worth of
food and medicines to Iraq. It said that 50,000 Iraqi children
are facing severe mal-nutrition and blamed the United Nations for
being too slow in applying its "Oil for Food" program with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Albania has been plunged into full chaos after 600 prisoners
escaped from prison in Tirana and Shkodra, the biggest city in
northern Albania. Having failed to stop the turmoil from turning
into a civil war, the Albanian government and the opposition have
called for an armed intervention by Europe.
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Alain Juppe Thursday launched a
campaign baptized "Act for Protection of Maltreated Children" to
mobilize public opinion on a national level against abuse of
children. France registered 65,000 cases of abuse or maltreatment
of children in 1995.
</P>
<P>
-- Violent fightings went on Thursday near the eastern Zairean
city of Kisangani, during which the Zairean army tried to loosen
the stranglehold by the rebel troops of Laurent-Desire Kabila. In
three days of fighting, the government troops could not repel the
rebels but by five kilometers. The rebels are only 40 to 60
kilometers from Kisangani.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Aircraft Industry to Get U.S. Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is working on a proposal
to transfer the U.S. shares in the F-16 producer Turkish
Aerospace Industries (TAI) to Koc Holding, the largest industrial
company in the country.
</P>
<P>
The plan drawn by the Office of the General Staff and the
Undersecretariat for the Defense Industry will be discussed at
the upcoming TAI executive board meeting, the local newspaper Daily
News quoted today senior defense sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier agreement, 40 percent of the
U.S. shares in the TAI should be transferred to Turkey when
the F-16 production program ends.
</P>
<P>
The Koc Holding will be given priority in obtaining the
U.S. shares, due to its background with the defense
industry, the sources said, adding the Sabanci Holding, the
second largest company in Turkey, would be the next on the list.
</P>
<P>
The TAI has been producing F-16 fighters and other types of
aircraft since 1987 under a foreign license. To date, the company
has produced nearly 160 F-16 jets for Turkey and 46 other aircraft
for the Egyptian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
The same sources said that due to technical insufficiency,
U.S. firms, Lockheed and General Electrics, still hold nearly
half of the total TAI shares. The TAI was originally set up to
develop Turkey's own aircraft industry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. firms' reaction to the proposal remains unknown so
far, the defense sources added.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Sides with Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has stressed that the military was not interested in
running the country but forced to put pressure on the Islamist
coalition government to battle fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the local newspaper Daily News,
Demirel said the military led by Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi was not concerned with the strength of
Islam in Turkey but would not like to see attempts to use Islam for
political purpose.
</P>
<P>
The interview came off the press today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks, tension was felt between the pro-Islam
government and the military, which has a tradition of defending
secularism in light of increasing fundamentalist activities in the
secular republic.
</P>
<P>
Military commanders put forward a 22-point communique at the
February 28 military-dominated National Security Council (NSC)
recommending the coalition government take quick and effective
measures against the growth of fundamentalist influence.
</P>
<P>
Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, also leader of the
Welfare Party, has reluctantly signed the communique in order to
avoid collapse of his coalition with Tansu Ciller's True Path
Party.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing Turkey was a modern republic, Demirel said:"Its
People are Muslims but the state has no religion. If some people
object to this they have to know there is no alternative and the
country will move ahead on this course."
</P>
<P>
He said the problems in the past weeks showed that the
military was disturbed because these limitations had been
violated.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the only remedy to break the
bottlenecks in the country's political life was elections, adding
the country should wait until it gets a parliament determined to
defend democracy.
</P>
<P>
After Erbakan came to power last summer as the republic's first
ever pro-Islam prime minister, the fundamentalist activities made a
remarkable growth in the country, alarming the military loyal to
the secular system established by the founder of modern Turkey,
Kemel Ataturk.
</P>
<P>
The Welfare Party recently proposed that women civil servants
should wear Islamic-style scarf in government offices and a
mosque be built in one of the main commercial squares in
Istanbul, the country's largest city, triggering strong criticism
from the secular forces backed by the military.
</P>
<P>
In the confrontation, President Demirel sided with the
military, calling for pressure on Erbakan to compromise.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the coalition cabinet formally agreed to implement
the NSC recommendations for curbing the growth of fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Thursday's cabinet meeting, Erbakan unexpectedly told
the press that in line with the Constitution, the NSC
recommendations would be given the first place on the agenda. His
statement was widely seen here as a sharp contrast with his
previous attitude.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the NSC document, he vowed that his
government was constitutionally responsible for the parliament,
implying that he would not be subject to pressure.

concerning the coming visit to China by US Vice-President Al Gore,
Premier Li Peng said, "At my invitation, Vice-President Al Gore
will soon visit China. This visit will be an important event in
relations between China and the United States."
</P>
<P>
"One of the important tasks for Vice-President Al Gore during
his visit is to prepare for a meeting between the top leaders of
China and US, which will take place later this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While Vice-President Al Gore is in China, we will also
co-chair a forum to discuss environmental protection and
development issues. And we will also have an exchange of views on
other issues of mutual interest," the Chinese Premier said.
</P>
<P>
"Vice-President Al Gore will be accorded a friendly reception
in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China is the biggest developing country and the United States
is the most developed country in the world. So our two countries
exercise major influences in the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Owing to differences in ideology because of our different
social systems, we have some disagreements. But we have to reduce
confrontation and develop cooperation in order to develop our
relations on a normal track," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Maintaining a healthy and stable development of Sino-US
relations will be in the interest of world peace and stability,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In handling international relations, the Chinese government
always maintains that all countries regardless of their size
should be all treated as equals. And what China opposes most is
interference in other countries' internal affairs. And in this
matter China has been a victim," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since China itself is strongly opposed to interference in
internal affairs from other countries, naturally, China will be
the last country to interfere in or influence the internal affairs
of other countries in any form, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Makes No Deal With Imelda on Marcos' Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Press Secretary Hector
Villanueva reiterated here today that President Fidel Ramos had
made no written commitment to former first lady Imelda Marcos on
the burial of the remains of her late husband at the Manila
Heroes' Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
Villanueva made the remarks after the Presidential Palace
released a copy of the joint statement issued by the then
president-elect and Mrs. Marcos following their meeting at the
residence of House Speaker Jose de Venecia in June in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Imelda said Ramos gave her a handwritten promise during the
meeting to allow the body of the late president Ferdinand Marcos
to be buried at the heroes' cemetery. The Marcoses threatened to
show the promise to the public after Ramos denied issuing such an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"President-elect Fidel Ramos met tonight with former First Lady
Imelda Romualdez-Marcos and both agreed to contribute efforts to
achieve political stability and economic prosperity for the
country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement co-signed by Ramos and Imelda did not say that
Ramos had made any handwritten promise to bury Marcos as a hero.
</P>
<P>
The Marcoses had stepped up pressure on the government to allow
the burial of Marcos' remains after the power supply to his crypt
was cut off March 3 due to the family's failure to pay power
bills.
</P>
<P>
The remains of Marcos were returned to his hometown in the
northern Philippines from Hawaii, the United States in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Provinces, Ministries Not to Interfere in HKSAR Affairs: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that the relevant Chinese provinces and ministries should
not interfere in the affairs of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) after Hong Kong's return to the
embrace of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Li told a group of domestic and overseas reporters, who are
here reporting on the current session of the Chinese legislative
body, that after July 1 this year, HKSAR will be a special
administrative region with a high degree of autonomy, toward which
China will adopt the policy of "One country, two systems" and
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
Thus, he added, "no provinces and ministries will be allowed to
interfere in HKSAR's affairs."
</P>
<P>
Li noted that some people from the British side claimed recently
that they would supervise over the implementation of the
Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong issue after July 1.
</P>
<P>
"This is not realistic, as the issue of Hong Kong will be
purely China's internal affair after the country resumes the
exercise of its sovereignty over the region on July 1 this year.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Sides with Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel has stressed that the military was not interested in
running the country but forced to put pressure on the Islamist
coalition government to battle fundamentalists.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the local newspaper Daily News,
Demirel said the military led by Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi was not concerned with the strength of
Islam in Turkey but would not like to see attempts to use Islam for
political purpose.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks, tension was felt between the pro-Islam
government and the military, which has a tradition of defending
secularism in light of increasing fundamentalist activities in the
secular republic.
</P>
<P>
Military commanders put forward a 22-point communique at the
February 28 military-dominated National Security Council (NSC)
recommending the coalition government take quick and effective
measures against the growth of fundamentalist influence.
</P>
<P>
Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, also leader of the
Welfare Party, has reluctantly signed the communique in order to
avoid collapse of his coalition with Tansu Ciller's True Path
Party.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing Turkey was a modern republic, Demirel said:"Its
People are Muslims but the state has no religion. If some people
object to this they have to know there is no alternative and the
country will move ahead on this course."
</P>
<P>
He said the problems in the past weeks showed that the
military was disturbed because these limitations had been
violated.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the only remedy to break the
bottlenecks in the country's political life was elections, adding
the country should wait until it gets a parliament determined to
defend democracy.
</P>
<P>
After Erbakan came to power last summer as the republic's first
ever pro-Islam prime minister, the fundamentalist activities made a
remarkable growth in the country, alarming the military loyal to
the secular system established by the founder of modern Turkey,
Kemel Ataturk.
</P>
<P>
The Welfare Party recently proposed that women civil servants
should wear Islamic-style scarf in government offices and a
mosque be built in one of the main commercial squares in
Istanbul, the country's largest city, triggering strong criticism
from the secular forces backed by the military.
</P>
<P>
In the confrontation, President Demirel sided with the
military, calling for pressure on Erbakan to compromise.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the coalition cabinet formally agreed to implement
the NSC recommendations for curbing the growth of fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Thursday's cabinet meeting, Erbakan unexpectedly told
the press that in line with the Constitution, the NSC
recommendations would be given the first place on the agenda. His
statement was widely seen here as a sharp contrast with his
previous attitude.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing of the NSC document, he vowed that his
government was constitutionally responsible for the parliament,
implying that he would not be subject to pressure.

<HEADLINE> Remains of Earliest Chinese Observatory Found in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The remains of an observatory
dating back 4,000 years have been found in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that the Huoxing Tai (Mars Observatory),
located some 1.5 km to the southwest of Shangqiu county, is the
earliest ever found in China.
</P>
<P>
The observatory has a temple on top. A main hall, side
chambers, and bell and drum towers can still be discerned in the
temple. An observatory tower was built at the back of the main
hall, according to records, which was destroyed during wartime.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, archaeological finds, and
astronomical records, Huoxing Tai was used during the reign of
Emperor Yao, who appointed Que Bo as the official in charge of the
observatory. The Que Bo Temple bore the official's name.
</P>
<P>
The village at the foot of the observatory is named "Huoxing", a
name that has not changed for thousands of years.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on China's Entry into WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China has enough patience to wait for its entry into
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Answering questions during a meeting with Chinese and foreign
reporters covering the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress, which closed here today, Li said that as a
major trading nation in the world, China is eager to join the WTO,
and has made great efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"We have reduced the average import tariff rate to 23 percent
from 35 percent and made the commitment to further cut the rate to
15 percent by the end of the century, about the average level for
developing countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China welcomes recent progress in talks on Chinese
accession to the WTO, the premier said it is abnormal that China
has been unable to join the WTO for a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
"Granted that economic interests have played a part in this,
there is no denying that this has also been due to political
factors," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I can reiterate on behalf of the Chinese government that,
after joining the WTO, China will fulfill its obligations while
enjoying rights," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that it is known to all that China is still a
developing country and that it is unacceptable to apply to China
criteria for developed countries concerning its accession to the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
"China needs the WTO, and the WTO also needs China," he said,
adding that relevant countries should take a sensible attitude
so that the issue will be resolved as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell you, however, that China has enough patience to
wait," he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Reveal Secrets of Lost Ancient Kingdom in Southwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese idiom "Yelang zi da"
(referring to the conceit of the king of Yelang) is widely used by
Chinese to comment on someone's ridiculous arrogance, but its
origin may not be so well known.
</P>
<P>
About the only thing really known about Yelang is that it was a
kingdom in southwestern China in modern-day Sichuan, Yunnan, and
Guizhou provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom prospered during the early Western Han Dynasty (206
BC-24 AD), but vanished mysteriously in the middle of the dynasty,
leaving few records.
</P>
<P>
To uncover the kingdom's secrets, a meeting, attended by more
than 50 scholars from the three provinces and the autonomous
region, was recently held in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou,
which is believed to be the original place of the ancient kingdom
of Yelang.
</P>
<P>
The research on Yelang is one of major archaeological projects
in the 1996-2000 period in Guizhou. To date, scholars have made a
detailed study of the limited number of historical records and are
now turning to site work.
</P>
<P>
A great number of sites and tomb groups from the Warring States
Period (475-221 BC), the Qin (221-206 BC) and the Han (206 BC-220
AD) dynasties have been found in Guizhou since the 1970s, and the
way has been opened for excavation.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing, a New Municipality with Regional Specialties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The special features of
Chongqing reflect the central authorities' intention to accelerate
economic development in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
As the largest industrial city in southwestern Sichuan
Province, Chongqing was designated to be a provincial-level
municipality here today, according to a resolution adopted at the
closing meeting of the fifth session of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC), the legislature. And it is the first
municipality in China's central and western region.
</P>
<P>
When compared with China's three other municipalities --
Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin -- Chongqing now has many unique
characteristics, which experts say reflect the central
authorities' intention to speed up development in the central and
western China.
</P>
<P>
In terms of economic regions, Chongqing belongs both to the
southwestern region and to the Yangtze River valley. It is also
located within the jurisdictive area of Three Gorges Dam project.
</P>
<P>
As a new municipality with an area of 82,400 sq km, Chongqing
has about the same size of a medium-sized province, or 2.39 times
the combined area of Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin. With 43
districts and counties under its jurisdiction, it has a population
of 30.2 million, or 83.2 percent of the combined population of the
other three municipalities. These features make Chongqing China's
biggest city and a rare, super-large city in the world.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that 24.40 million of the Chongqing
residents, or 81.37 percent of the total, live in the outskirtan
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other three municipalities, Chongqing boasts
abundant natural resources. It has 41 rivers each with a drained
area of more than 500 sq km. It has some 40 mineral resources,
such as natural gas, bauxite, salt, strontium and limestone. In
addition, new Chongqing is also rich in tourist resources, such as
the Three Gorges area and other world-famous landscapes.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in terms of economic strength, Chongqing is
apparently behind the three other municipalities, an indication of
the disparity in economic development between the eastern and
western regions.

<TEXT>
<P>
New Chongqing leads Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin only in term
of agricultural output, whereas it lags behind the other three
cities in term of total industrial output value, fiscal revenue,
retail sales of consumer goods, foreign trade and investment in
fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The industrial output value of Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin is
4.89 times, 1.84 times and 1.73 times respectively that of
Chongqing. And in term of trade export volume, Shanghai, Beijing
and Tianjin lead Chongqing by 14.88, 6.75 and 5.2 times,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The living standards of Chongqing's urban and rural residents
is below the average national level and the per-capita income of
its farmers ranks the 23rd place in the country.
</P>
<P>
Resettlement in the Three Gorges Dam area, which involves new
Chongqing's 18 districts and counties, will inundate 36,700
hectares of land and 1,300 enterprises and mines. Five county
seats will be submerged completely and three new cities partly
under the water. A total of 1.07 million people will be relocated
eventually.
</P>
<P>
New Chongqing has 12 state-level and nine province-level
poverty-stricken counties, with a total of three million locals in
need. Moreover, it also has five autonomous counties of national
minorities with more than 1.7 million people of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Chongqing became one of the first group of selected
cities to experiment with comprehensive economic reforms and was
granted the status of a Chinese province in the administration of
the economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, it was again designated an open city along the Yangtze
River and was granted the preferential policies that had been set
especially for coastal open cities.
</P>
<P>
As it is upgraded to be a municipality directly under the
central authorities, Chongqing has a legislative power and other
powers of jurisdiction that are not entitled to some special
cities with the status of a province. Chongqing has entered into a
new historical period with both huge opportunities and challenges
and it is expected to exert a far-reaching impact on the economic
development of central and western China.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing: Its Past and Present </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese historians claim that the
history of Chongqing, the largest city in southwest China that was
upgraded to be a provincial-level municipality today, epitomizes
the history of Chinese cities in the central and western region.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing rises from an ancient regional military and political
center to a regional economic hub, from a seclusive site of
castles to an open strategic hub linking the east and west, and
from a medium-sized city in eastern Sichuan to a super-large
metropolis with its impact expected to amplify to southwest China
and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Historian Yu Weichao, director of the Museum of Chinese
History, described the 600 km section of the Yangtze River under
Chongqing's jurisdiction as one of the important places where the
Chinese civilization originates.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, as the birthplace of Bayu Culture, has a recorded
history of more than 3,000 years. It was made the capital of State
Ba in the 11th century B.C., renamed Yuzhou in the year 581 and
changed into Chongqing in the year 1189.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Yong, an expert on the history of Chongqing,
the municipality became a commercial hub and the largest commodity
distribution center in southwest China during the Ming (1368-1644)
and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. It was forced into a trading port
in 1891.
</P>
<P>
In 1929, Chongqing was turned into a city. The government of
the Kuomintang government moved to Chongqing after the War of
Resistance against Japanese Aggression broke out in 1937, followed
by the relocation of coastal industries to the interior, and this
was the first large-scale immigration in the city's history. The
migration laid the foundation of Chongqing as an industrial base.
The Kuomintang government officially upgraded it to be a "special
city" in 1939 and, a year later, renamed it the "wartime capital".
</P>
<P>
After the founding of new China in 1949, Chongqing became a
political, economic and cultural center in southwestern China and
a municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the central
government. Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, Liu Bocheng and
He Long, Chongqing played a unique role in the complete fulfilment
of the tasks for China's New-Democratic Revolution and the
consolidation and development of its socialist political power.
</P>
<P>
Afterwards, the central government in 1954 redesignated
Chongqing a city under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan provincial
government and granted it the power to make economic decisions on
its own.
</P>
<P>
A concentration of investment in military-related industries
between 1964 and 1968 led to the second large-scale migration in
Chongqing's history, with more than 200 projects relocated or
launched at a total investment of 4.2 billion yuan. As a result,
Chongqing's industrial sectors became more complete and its
overall economic strength ascended to a new height.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1980s, Chongqing's industrial output was about 20
percent of the total of the three provinces in southwest China and
one third of Sichuan's.
</P>
<P>
In 1984, Chongqing was again granted the power of making
economic plans on its own and the power of a province in economic
administration. It also became the first large city to experiment
with comprehensive economic structural reforms.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten or more years, Chongqing scored great
achievements in reform, opening up and development and, it
attained the goal of quadrupling its 1980 gross domestic product
by the end of 1995, five years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading it to be a municipality at the provincial-level
provides Chongqing with an opportunity to make itself a central
city on the upper reaches of the Yangze river, which is expected
to lead economic development in the country's southwestern region.

BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Two years after lung transplant
surgery, Ji Shuchun takes care of himself and does house work in
his hometown of Anyang City, central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
Ji is longest-lived recipient of a lung-transplant in
Asia. Beijing Anzhen Hospital, which performed the operation, held
a special birthday party for him earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Ji told Xinhua that he eats well and has much strength, adding

often rides a tricycle.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Ji Shuchun, a farmer, barely able to breathe,
was completely unable to do any physical labor. Doctors at Beijing
Anzhen Hospital after several exams decided that transplant
surgery offered Ji his best hope.
</P>
<P>
After the successful operation, the hospital rescued Ji from

<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, described the
session as successful, democratic, practical, united and
encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The session is of particularly important significance for
mobilizing people of all ethnic groups to unswervingly march
forward on the road of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping and to score new
victories in the drive of reform, opening up and modernization,
Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to this year's session showed great concern about
reform of state-owned enterprises, economic restructuring and a
steady development of agriculture, and put forward a lot of
valuable opinions and proposals, he said.
</P>
<P>
These problems are a reflection of deep-layer contradictions in
reform and development, are problems on the path of progress and
are imperative problems that call for immediate solutions, Qiao
said.
</P>
<P>
The key to fundmentally solving these problems lies in
deepening reforms and accomplishing a successful shift in the
economic structure and economic growth mode, he noted.
</P>
<P>
With objectives set forth during the session in mind, a good
job should be done in all aspects of work, in order to
continuously promote a sustained, rapid and healthy development of
the national economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao also called for efforts to promote ethical and cultural
progress and to promote the progress of all social undertakings.
</P>
<P>
He urged deputies to sincerely study and grasp Deng Xiaoping's
thinking on developing democracy and a legal system and to push
such development to a new stage in the spirit of reform.
</P>
<P>
The key to strengthening the building of socialist democracy
and a socialist legal system lies in doing everything in strict
accordance with the Constitution and other laws, or in other
words, governing the country by law, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
People's congresses at all levels should continue to speed up
the pace of legislation and improve the quality of legislation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to continuously strengthen
supervision, in order to ensure law enforcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao called on deputies to work hard to greet the return of
Hong Kong to the motherland and the convening of the 15th National
Congress of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
"We will carry work forward at the behest of Comrade Deng
Xiaoping and rally more closely round the CPC Central Committee
with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core under the guidance of the
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the
basic line of the Party," Qiao said, calling for further efforts
to deepen reforms, open wider to the outside world and push ahead
with socialist modernization.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was presided over by Qiao Shi.
</P>
<P>
Party and government leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan,

<P>
TIRANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- An emergency talk between Albanian
officials and European mediators would begin today on an Italian
warship off Albania's coast, it was reported here.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Franz Vranitzky, who had arrived at the
Italian port of Brindisi, would fly to the warship by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
New Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim Fino and other senior
Albanian officials had already got on board the warship, it added.
</P>
<P>
Leading a 10-member delegation of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, Vranitzky, former Austrian chancellor,
is also going to talk with other political leaders and rebel
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The protest turned violent two weeks ago as rebels looted
weapons from army depots. Several cities in southern Albania are
now controlled by rebels who are threatening to move onto the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Tirana itself has also witnessed growing unrest as mobs looted
a warehouse of 650 tons of flour on Thursday and raided security
force depots in search of guns.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha on Thursday decided to deploy
tanks in front of the main institutions in the country and called
for foreign military intervention to halt the disorder.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Stresses Importance of Socialist Democracy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of China's
legislative body, hailed the Fifth Session of the Eighth National
People's Congress (NPC), which closed here today, as a great
success.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at the closing meeting today, Qiao said the
current session is of great significance for mobilizing people of
all ethnic groups to unswervingly march forward along the road of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng
Xiaoping to strive for new victories in reform, opening up and the
modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said deputies have showed great concern over, and put forward lots
of good suggestions for, reform of state-owned enterprises and for
a sustained development of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The key to solving these problems, he said, is to deepen reform
and achieve fundamental shifts in economic structure and economic
growth mode. Reform of the state sector is the focus of this
year's economic restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee chairman urged the nation to
steadfastly strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the
national economy, protect farmers' enthusiasm for production and
adopt more effective measures to ease their financial burden.
</P>
<P>
He told the deputies to work hard to promote a sustained, rapid
and healthy national economic development in line with goals set
at the current NPC session and promote cultural, ethical and
social progresses in an all-round way.
</P>
<P>
"The historical moment for China to resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong is close at hand," said Qiao, calling
for great efforts to ensure a smooth transfer of power in Hong
Kong and its smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
He said China will strictly abide by the Basic Law of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and live up to policies
of "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy for the HKSAR under the principle of "one country, two
systems."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that Hong Kong will maintain
long-term prosperity and stability with an increasingly prosperous
motherland providing powerful backing and the joint efforts of the
six million intelligent and diligent Hong Kong compatriots.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Stresses Importance of Socialist Democracy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao pointed out that Deng Xiaoping's thinking on developing a
democratic legal system is a very important part of his theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping had considered it a long-term goal and basic
principle of the Party to persist in developing democracy and a
legal system, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
"Without democracy, there would neither be socialism nor
socialist modernization. Like modernization, democratization must
be developed step by step. The more developed socialism is, the
greater democracy, " Qiao quoted Deng Xiaoping as saying.
</P>
<P>
Deng also stressed the importance of strengthening the legal
system to protect people's democracy and called for a
systemization of democracy and the enshrining of democratic
principles in law, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Deng also held that issues relating to systems are
more important and more essential. Deng had urged to enact a
series of laws, decrees and regulations to fundamentally ensure
the democratization of the political life of the Party and the
state, of economic administration and of entire social life, so as
to guarantee an orderly progression of the entire society.
</P>
<P>
"These theories of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's are profound and
very important, and we must study them conscientiously, gain a
better understanding of them and implement them unequivocally in
order to turn them into action to promote the development of
socialist democracy and a socialist legal system to a new stage
under the spirit of reform," said Qiao.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Stresses Importance of Socialist Democracy (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Qiao pointed out that they key to strengthening socialist
democracy and building a legal system lies in governing the
country in accordance with the Constitution and laws.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution stipulates that all power belongs to the
people, he said. Therefore, high attention should be paid to
respecting and guaranteeing people's political rights, mobilizing
people's initiative, and creating conditions for people to take
part in democratic elections, administration, supervision and
decision making.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution stipulates that the organ through which people
exercise state power is the National People's Congress and local
people's congresses at different levels, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
He called for persistence in and improvement of this
fundamental political system under the leadership of the Party, by
firmly protecting the rights of people's congress deputies
according to law, and giving full play to the functions of
people's congresses and their standing committees.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the Party always emphasizes that no organization or
individual has the prerogative to override the Constitution and
the law, adding that all government departments should exercise
their power strictly in accordance with law, while leading cadres,
in particular, should familiarize themselves with the Constitution
and gain legal knowledge necessary for the performance of their
duties, and conscientiously do their work according to legal
provisions and proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that this year's legislative task remains heavy,
the chairman urged legislators to accelerate the pace of law
enactment and improve legislative quality, to establish the
framework of a legal system catering for a socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
With progress in reform, opening-up and modernization, he said,
more laws concerning a socialist market economy and promoting a
socialist democratic political system, and others, will be
enacted, for the establishment of a socialist legal system with
Chinese characteristics, he said.
</P>
<P>
In conformity with a principle set forth by Deng Xiaoping in
the early 1980s, he said, laws must be loyally and strictly
enforced, and any infringement upon laws by law enforcers, the
overriding of laws with administrative authorities, and perversion
of justice for personal gains, must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
He called for increased supervision over the work of
governments, courts and procuratorates, and over all personnel in
government departments elected or appointed by people's congresses
and their standing committees.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said the NPC Standing Committee is drafting a supervision
law according to the Constitution, to systemize and legalize
supervision work.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the chairman pointed out that the year of 1997 is a
very important one in the history of China's development.
</P>
<P>
He called on the legislators to carry work forward at the
behest of Deng Xiaoping, and guided by the theory of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the
Party, more closely unite around the Party Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at the core, to advance the great cause of socialist
modernization.

directly under the authority of the central government, and a
number of other important documents, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The fifth session of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee made
important contributions to the formulation of the above documents
by actively engaging in political consultation, democratic
supervision, and participation in and deliberation of state and
government affairs, and by making proposals through drawing on
collective wisdom and absorbing all useful ideas, it says.
</P>
<P>
The great achievements scored during the two sessions will play
an important role in facilitating socialist economic construction,
in developing democracy and a legal system, in national defense
construction, in the overall progress of all social undertakings,
as well as in ensuring a smooth return of Hong Kong, the editorial
notes.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the two sessions indicates that people of all
ethnic groups are determined to rally more closely round the CPC
Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and are
confident of victoriously pushing forward the great cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by
Comrade Deng Xiaoping," it says.
</P>
<P>
This year is the second year when China implements its Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and its outline of long-term objectives
for the year 2010. It is also a year when China will resume the
exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and the CPC will convene
its 15th national congress, it says.
</P>
<P>
"These are two big events in the development history of our
Party and our country," the editorial says, adding that a good job
must be done to ensure the success of the two events and calling
for a greater effort to score new successes in reform, opening up
and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The tasks set forth in the government work report must be
earnestly carried out to ensure a sustained, rapid and healthy
development of the national economy, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It also says that the continuity, stability and necessary
flexibility of the macroeconomic policy should be maintained and
moderately tight fiscal and monetary policies should be continued,
so as to curb price rises.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should also be made to consolidate the status of
agriculture as the foundation of the national economy and to
accelerate reform, especially reform in state-owned enterprises,
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
 It adds that equal importance should be attached to
material progress and to ethical and cultural progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial calls for the advancement of building a socialist
country with a sound legal system under the leadership of the
Party, by strengthening legislation and supervision of law
enforcement and by establishing a legal system that meets the
demands of a socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
With the adoption of the amended Criminal Law, it says, crimes
will be cracked down upon, people protected, and national unity
and security, social order and the socialist system safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
And the Defense Law, also adopted at the current NPC session,
will be implemented to accelerate the pace of defense
modernization to guarantee a smooth progression of reform,
opening-up and socialist modernization, and long-term stability of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to China is the common aspiration of the
whole nation, it points out, and preparations should be well made
in the last days of the transitional period to ensure Hong Kong's
return on time and its long-term stability and prosperity.
</P>

system, it says, and the multi-party cooperation and political
consultation system under the leadership of the CPC is its basic
political system.

This year is the last for the current terms of NPC and CPPCC
National Committee, the editorial says, calling on people's
congresses and CPPCC committees at all levels to better exercise
their power and perform their duties to prepare for Hong Kong's
return and the convocation of the 15th National Congress of the
CPC, and create good conditions for the next terms of NPC and
CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core, the editorial says, Party members, especially

<HEADLINE> Find Proves Existence of Mesolithic Age in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A great number of tiny blade
tools dating back more than 10,000 years have been found in
northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, suggesting the
existence of Middle Stone Age with microlithic products.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, the Stone Age is divided into the Palaeolithic,
or Early Stone Age (some two million to 10,000 years ago), which
features chipped stone tools, and the Neolithic, or Late Stone Age
(10,000 to 4,000 years ago), which features polished stone tools.
</P>
<P>
A number of archaeologists have previously suggested that a
Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age, which features tiny blade tools,
might have existed for a short period of time at the end of the
traditional Early Stone Age, a view that was not widely accepted
because of a lack of relics.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, 1995, and 1996, a Sino-US archaeology team excavated a
Paleolithic site at Gezi Shan (Dove Mountain) in Jiangding
township, Qingtongxia city, in Ningxia and found a great number of
stone tools in a five-sq-km area.
</P>
<P>
Most of the tools were microlithic tools such as cores, small
blades, scrapers, and pointed implements made from different
colors of chert, a flintlike stone. They were made with a method
referred to as "indirect chipping", where something was placed in
between the object striking and the object doing the chipping,
which is regarded as a step up in the evolution of the use of
stone tools.
</P>
<P>
The tiny stone tools were found in a deposit dating back at
least 10,000 years, beneath which there was a deposit of large
chipped tools with the earliest dating back 12,700 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Constitutional Assembly
(CA) of South Africa is planning to launch a nationwide massive
distribution campaign of the country's new constitution in a bid
to make people aware of its significance.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's first post-apartheid constitution, drafted by
the CA after more than two-year's painstaking writing process,
was signed into law by President Nelson Mandela on December 10
last year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Johannesburg on Thursday, CA
Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa said millions of copies of the
constitution would be sent to delivery points around the country
in the largest distribution campaign ever undertaken by the Post
Office in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ramaphosa said the new constitution would mobilize and capture
the imaginations of millions and would determine significant
features of the country's political landscape.
</P>
<P>
He also said the now defunct CA had always recognized the need
to draw up a constitution which would be accessible to all South
Africans, citing the adoption of a series of measures such as
printing the constitution in all the 11 official languages and
publishing it in Braille and in a comic strip format.
</P>
<P>
About six million copies of the constitution will be
distributed to more than 11,000 distribution points throughout
the country, including schools, the defense force, the police and
correctional services.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Chinese Province Receives More Overseas Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province has become a popular tourist destination, especially for
overseas tourists.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the province received 455,000
overseas tourists in 1996 who brought in 162 million U.S. dollars,
increases of more than 20 percent respectively over the previous
year.
</P>

Sichuan abounds in tourism resources. Out of China's 120
state-level scenic sites, 13 are here. It also has eight
historical and cultural cities, 33 key cultural sites under state
top protection, and more than 30 nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
To take advantage of these, Sichuan invested heavily in
infrastructure during the Eighth Five-Year-Plan (1991-95). In the
past five years, the province had spent 350 million yuan and used
210 million U.S. dollars in overseas funds on four
provincial-level tourism and holiday zones.

<HEADLINE> Founding of Chongqing Municipality Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The city of Chongqing has become
China's fourth municipality after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin,
with approval today by the on-going annual session of the National
People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established Chongqing Municipality will include the
original Chongqing City as well as Wanxian and Fuling cities and
Qianjiang Prefecture, according to a decision adopted by the Fifth
Session of the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the State Council, China's cabinet,
will make corresponding readjustments to the organizational system
and divisions of the administrative areas under its jurisdiction
in line with the Chinese Constitution and relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision gave birth to China's largest city with an
area of 82,000 sq km area and a combined population of 30.02
million in the original Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
With a history of more than 3,000 years, Chongqing was opened
up as a trade port in 1891 and officially became a city in 1929.
The city was a political and cultural center in soutwest China in
the early years following the founding of new China and, In 1954,
it was made a city directly under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan

<HEADLINE> A Strategic Decision for China's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- For some, it is conjecture
confirmed; for others, it is expectation fulfilled. For Chongqing,
it is another glorious page in its 3,000-year history.
</P>
<P>
With the adoption of a major resolution today by the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) at the final plenary meeting of
its current session, Chongqing has become a centrally-administered
municipality, signaling, in the eyes of many people, an important
step forward in China's trans-century development strategy.
</P>
<P>
As the largest city and an economic center in the upper reaches
of the Yangtze River, Chongqing is expected to spearhead economic
development in China's central and western regions as well as in
the Yangtze River valley, a major component of the country's
development strategy for years before the end of this century and
the first two or three decades of the next.
</P>
<P>
Medium- and long-range plans adopted by the Fourth Session of
the Eighth NPC last year made it clear that the central government
will grant preferential policies for the underdeveloped central
and western regions to spur their economic development.
</P>
<P>
At the juncture of economically developed eastern China and the
resources-rich west, and as the leading industrial and commercial
city in southwest China, Chongqing is the key link between China's
east and west.
</P>
<P>
With its industrial, economic and scientific strength,
Chongqing has become the center of an economic cooperation area
covering 19 cities and prefectures in the three provinces of
Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan, with an area of 287,000 sq km, an
industrial and agricultural output value of 170 billion yuan, and
a population close to 200 million.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government initiated the strategy of developing the
Yangtze River valley at the beginning of the 1990s, aiming to
develop the valley into the largest inland industrial belt in the
world.
</P>
<P>
At what is called the "dragon head" of the valley is the
booming Pudong New Area of Shanghai. Chongqing, as the "dragon
tail" of the valley and with its new status, is expected to match
Pudong in development speed. Both, in turn, will contribute to
economic development of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
A special mission for the new municipality is to explore a new
development path for a metropolis galvanizing its surrounding
rural areas economically in the process of its own development.
</P>
<P>
With 24 million out of its 30 million people being rural
residents, and with three million of them living below the poverty
line, Chongqing will meet an unprecedent challenge. And its
success is crucial to the overall development of China with vast
rural regions and a big rural population.
</P>
<P>
For Chongqing, the most important task at the moment is to
relocate 1.07 million out of a total of 1.2 million people living
around the area where the Three Gorges project, China's biggest
ever water conservancy and hydropower project, is being
constructed.
</P>
<P>
And successful relocation will be Chongqing's greatest
contribution to this trans-century project, which is scheduled to
be completed by 2009.

aspect of the implementation of resolution 986," council president
Zbigniew Wlosowicz of Poland told the press.
</P>
<P>
Under Security Council Resolution 986, Iraq was allowed to sell
up to two billion U.S. dollars worth of oil. It was to be in
exchange for food and medicine to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi
people caused by the U.N. sanctions imposed since 1990.

The city will develop auto, metallurgical and chemical
industries as the three pillars of its economy, and build a number
of industrial zones in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,
with an emphasis on industries supported by high and new
technologies, and on the service industry consisting of commerce
and trade, finance, tourism, real estate and information, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental way for Chongqing to accomplish its historical
mission is to add momentum to rural economic development by giving
full play to the central role of the cities," he said, adding that
Chongqing aims to develop itself into a center of commerce and
trade, finance, science, education and information, a hub of
transportation and telecom services, and a modern industrial base
in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"We will also build Chongqing into a metropolis surrounded by a
number of booming towns and cities of medium or small sizes," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Chongqing's regional advantages and superiorities,
he said that the city is located where two regional economies --
the Yangtze River economy and the southwest China economy -- meet,
and that the construction of the Three Gorges Project has provided
a huge potential market and a capital market of more than 100
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
"In history, Chongqing was an industrial and commercial center
of the Yangtze River upper reaches and southwest China. If
Chongqing develops well, the economy of entire southwest China
will be invigorated," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The new status of Chongqing has already attracted much
attention from foreign investors, and Japan is actively seeking
participation in the city's telecom infrastructure construction
and the upgrading of old industries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Describing Chongqing as the sole metropolis in the world that
has an excessively large rural population, he said that the
elevation of the city to the status of a municipality is China's
one more experiment on economic and administrative restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"We will establish a small but efficient government staffed by
competent people and do our work well so as to live up to the
expectations of the central authorities and the people," he
pledged.

<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing will cherish the rare
opportunity of development that has resulted from its new status
as a centrally-administered municipality, and serve as the
"bellwether" for economic takeoff in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Party Secretary Zhang Deling made this remark here
today, shortly after the National People's Congress decided to
establish Chongqing as a municipality directly under the central
government.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing municipality, the country's fourth after Beijing,
Tianjin and Shanghai, is now the most populous city across the
world, with 30 million people and an area of 82,000 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
"Chongqing will play a significant role in the construction of
the Three Gorges Project, and in economic development of the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River and central and western China," said
Zhang Deling, 57, a graduate of Qinghua University and a former
vice minister of machine building.
</P>
<P>
Among the one million people to be resettled to give way to the
Three Gorges Project, the world's largest water conservancy and
hydropower project, more than 80 percent are under the
jurisdiction of Chongqing municipality.
</P>
<P>
"The primary task for Chongqing is to relocate these people for
the Three Gorges Project," Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, with an expansion in area, Chongqing now
has a bigger poor population, which now stands at close to three
million, or one tenth of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
"It is a new and arduous task for Chongqing to help these
people shake off poverty, along with revitalizing local
industries, maintaining an ecological balance and controlling
pollution," he said, adding that the city has set new strategic
goals for its economic growth in view of the new situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chongqing would try to build in several years a
new group of industries in areas around the vast lake behind the
Three Gorges Dam to echo those in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai,
and bring about an integration and mutual prosperity of its urban
and rural economies by means of developing a network of modern
cities and towns of all sizes.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chongqing's chemical and metal processing industries based on
local natural resources are well developed.
</P>
<P>
Vice mayor Li said, however, that the city's use of mineral
resources is still far from enough, citing the fact that the local
chemical industry only uses about 400 million cubic meters of
natural gas each year.
</P>
<P>
According to Chongqing's new development scheme, he said, a
chemical industry using local natural gas and salt reserves would
become one of the municipality's pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
"In the next several years, Chongqing will set up or expand a
dozen factories producing chemical materials and products, which
each year will consume an additional one billion cubic meters of
natural gas, and make profits of more than three billion yuan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from underground mineral resources, Chongqing will also
attach importance to a comprehensive use of its water,
agricultural, and forest resources.
</P>
<P>
The municipality has hydropower reserves of nearly eight
million kilowatts, half of which can be exploited, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Three Gorges Reservoir with a length of 600 km,
which is to result from the Three Gorges Dam, will provide good
conditions to develop eco-agriculture, tourism, water
transportation, and aquaculture. A number of cities and towns are
expected to emerge around the huge man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
The vast countryside of Chongqing, especially the mountains and
hills of Fuling, Wanxian and Qianjiang, which have been put under
Chongqing's jurisdiction, produce a huge variety of agricultural
produce. The area, for example, leads the country in the output of
tung oil, raw lacquer and citrus fruit.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Wanxing, agricultural advisor to the Chongqing municipal
government, said: "At the initial stage of economic takeoff,
Chongqing should develop a processing industry for agricultural
products and by-products, and help farmers turn natural resources
into wealth. This might be the most realistic and quickest way for
Chongqing's urban and rural areas to achieve common prosperity."

<P>
CHONGQING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The southwestern metropolis of
Chongqing has a wide range of representative industrial products,
from a tiny piece of white porcelain to a huge aluminum ingot
weighing several hundred kilograms.
</P>
<P>
These products have at least one thing in common: they are all
results of the exploitation of rich local natural resources.
Technicians in the Zhaofeng Porcelain Co., a Chongqing-Hong Kong
joint venture, claimed that one important reason for the
popularity the company's products on domestic and global markets
is the use of local pure natural gas in the firing process.
</P>
<P>
The China Southwestern Aluminum Fabricating Plant in Chongqing,
one of the country's largest manufacturers of aluminum products
with an annual production capacity of 260,000 tons, has owed its
development to local bauxite reserves of 29 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, the largest city in southwest China, has just become
the country's fourth centrally-administered municipality following
Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
With an expanded territory of 82,000 sq km that covers the
whole eastern part of Sichuan Province, Chongqing is now the
world's largest city, and boasts abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
"Initial prospecting showed that Chongqing has more than 40
kinds of mineral resources, including large quantities of natural
gas, bauxite, salt, strontium and limestone," said Li Deshui, vice
mayor of Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
The natural gas field in east Sichuan is China's largest at
present, with long-term deposits of more than 300 billion cubic
meters. Chongqing also has deposits of more than 300 billion tons
of salt, close to two million tons of strontium, and two billion
tons of limestone.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, mountains and hills of Chongqing also contain more
than three billion tons of coal, and a great deal of other mineral
resources, such as manganese, mercury and marble.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou To Register Migrant Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- In order to reduce
unemployment, the Guangzhou municipal government will restrict
migrant workers from working, the city's vice mayor said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities will register all migrant workers and issue a work
permit. The computerized network would prevent outsiders from
working in the prosperous city, south China's Guangdong Province
near Hong Kong, Wu Liang, the vice mayor, said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said his city should not exile migrant workers to solve
unemployment. The lack of workers, especially capable ones,
requires the economic hub be open to as many workers as possible.
</P>
<P>
A long-held view is that the too many migrant workers are
responsible for the city's increasing unemployment, so many city
residents suggest the city should remove migrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Wu has foreclosed this possibility to limit the migrant labor
force, citing his city will handle it in line with the law of the
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
An authoritative statistic shows that the city had more than
50,000 laid-off workers at the end of last year, with the
unemployment rate at 2.28 percent. From 1997 on, Guangzhou
endeavors to put the unemployment ceiling at 60,000.
</P>
<P>
Ten vocation training centers, under the guidance of the
municipal government, will provide an opportunity for workers,
both in-service and out-of-work.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Envisions Greater Development after Chongqing's Departure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Establishment of the
centrally-administered Chongqing municipality, which used to be
part of Sichuan province, will benefit the development of both
Chongqing and Sichuan, a top Sichuan official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Xie Shijie, secretary of the provincial Party committee of
Sichuan, made the remark folowing a decision of the Eighth
National People's Congress to establish Chongqing as a
centrally-administered municipality.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of Chongqing municipality will promote social and
economic development in both Sichuan and Chongqing, and will be
conducive to a balanced economic development of both southwest
China and the entire country, Xie said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed support for the NPC decision on behalf of the
Sichuan provincial Party committee and the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Before Chongqing's departure, Sichuan was China's biggest
province with a population of 111 million, equal to those of
Britain and France combined, said Xie, adding it has been a
demanding job to run such a big province.
</P>
<P>
"In a long-term view and for the benefit of all," the Party
secretary noted, "the establishment of Chongqing municipality,
which includes the city proper and the two (prefectural level)
cities of Wanxian and Fuling and the prefecture of Qianjiang is a
welcome strategy."
</P>
<P>
After Chongqing has left its fold, Sichuan now has a population
of 83.57 million, ranking third in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of Chongqing municipality will enable Sichuan
to concentrate on development of the central area of the Sichuan
Basin, where the provincial capital of Chengdu is located, and to
play a better role in leading the economic growth of the entire
western China, said Xie.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he added, it will benefit the development of
Wanxian, Fuling and Qianjiang. With their close proximity to
Chongqing, it is more convenient for Chongqing to administrate
these largely rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Finally, it will contribute to the Three Gorges Project, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The key to achieving the success of the project is the
relocation of residents around the Three Gorges area, he
explained, and 85 percent of people to be relocated live near
Chongqing and in Wanxian, Fuling and Qianjiang. And Chongqing can,
according to local conditions, adjust its industrial structure to
promote economic growth, thus better accomplishing the relocation
task.
</P>
<P>
He said that Sichuan will provide good conditions for
Chongqing, adding "we used to be one family, and we will be good
neighbors in future."
</P>
<P>
He said the separation of administrative powers does not mean a
severing of economic ties, and commodities exchanges between the
two will be even closer.
</P>
<P>
After the adjustment of administrative jurisdiction, Xie said,
Sichuan will also readjust its development strategy, by
consolidating its agriculture, transport, energy, education and
scientific research sectors, and strengthening its electronic and
information, machinery, building and building materials, beverage
and food, and travel industries as its industrial pillars.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Chongqing as a centrally-administered
municipality will enjoy more policy support from the central
government, and expressed the belief that, combined with the
creativity of its people, Chongqing will fully display its
strength in three years.

<HEADLINE> Mass Evacuation of Foreigners from Albania Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Governments of many countries have
begun evacuating their nationals in Albania since Thursday when
unrest and anarchy were engulfing Albania.
</P>
<P>
The United States has sent four military helicopters into
Tirana and evacuated 50 Americans, most of them children, to
U.S. ships standing offshore.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
said that 170 Americans, mostly dependents of U.S. Embassy workers
and non-essential staff, were being evacuated under the escort of
U.S. Marines.
</P>
<P>
Up to 2,000 American citizens are in Albania, Burns said,
adding that the evacuation will continue for days.
</P>
<P>
Italy also used helicopters to rescue 330 Italians and 70 other
foreigners to its warships in the Adriatic. As estimated, there
are 1,300 Italians in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many other countries used land routes for
evacuations Thursday as Tirana's main airport closed after
Albanians who had looted guns began firing into the air.
</P>
<P>
Britain organized a pullout of more than 120 foreigners in a
convoy of vehicles from Tirana to the port of Durres, 40
kilometers west of Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Issuing a final warning to British nationals to leave Albania,
the British Foreign Office ordered the British embassy in Tirana
to organize another convoy for the evacuation on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Moscow said that it had a specific plan to withdraw Russian
nationals from Albania.
</P>
<P>
Now, the United States and other NATO countries were meeting in
Brussels, to coordinate the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The protest turned violent two weeks ago as rebels looted
weapons from army depots. Several cities in southern Albania are
now controlled by rebels who are threatening to move onto the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Tirana itself has also witnessed growing unrest as mobs looted
a warehouse of 650 tons of flour on Thursday and raided security
force depots in search of guns.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha on Thursday decided to deploy
tanks in front of the main institutions in the country and called
on the Western European Union to provide military assistance to
Tirana to restore order in the country which is verging on civil
war.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Offers Condolences Over Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
to offer his condolences over the death of seven Israeli
schoolgirls in Thursday's shooting near Israeli-Jordanian
border, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who had reportedly refused to talk to Netanyahu in the
past week, made the phone call Thursday night to offer his
condolences to the families of the victims, who were killed by a
Jordanian soldier in Naharayim on the Jordanian side of northern
Jordan Valley.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his appreciation of the condolence call,
Netanyahu said that leaders shared heavy responsibility not to
stir up violence and refrain from declarations that could lead to
violence.
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders indirectly blamed the Thursday tragedy on the
recent strong criticism of Israeli policies from Jordanian King
Hussein, who wrote a harsh-worded letter to Netanyahu warning that
his policies could lead to bloodshed and destroy the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Arafat, Netanyahu repeated that there could be
differences of opinion, but there should be no room for talks
of violence. "If there is agreement on that, the results could be
productive," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before the shooting incident, the Palestinian side had been
warning against violence as a result of Israel's recent decisions
to build a settlement in Har Homa and to close four Palestinian
offices in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who met with Israeli opposition Labor Party's lawmaker
Uzi Baram late Thursday, said he was willing to meet Netanyahu to
discuss ways of defusing current tension if such a meeting could
produce practical results.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein, who cut short his visit to Spain after the
shooting and returned home Thursday night, also called Netanyahu
on the plane to offer his condolences to the victims. In a news
conference held at Amman Airport, Hussein condemned the shooting
as "a slur on all of us" and "a vile crime."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that he was willing to pay a visit to the
families of the victims and would meet Netanyahu shortly.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti had
telephoned Netanyahu, President Ezer Weizman and Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai to express condolences. Jordanian Crown Prince
Hassan held talks with Mordechai at the site of shooting to
coordinate efforts to investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the latest incident could set back the
already soured ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Despite the signing of the 1994 peace treaty, widespread
anti-Israeli sentiment still can be felt in the Hashemite kingdom
because of the lack of benefits from the peace-making. Moreover,
the sentiment has been repeatedly fueled by the crises in the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.

<P>
LUSAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Kalanga Gemstones of Zambia and
Indigo Exploration of South Africa have entered into a
multi-million-Kwacha (about 1,300 Kwacha equal one U.S. Dollar)
joint project to tap precious stones potential in Lundazi and
Mufunbwe in Northwestern Province of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The two mining comapnies's exploration of gemstones will begin
as soon as the rainy season is over.
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted Indigo Exploration's managing
director, Paul Wellings, as saying on Thursday in Ndola,
Copperbelt, that feasibility studies have been undertaken and
equipment will be moved to earmarked sides before the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
Gemstones such as emeralds, amethyst, black and red tourmaline
will be explored and processed for export to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Lundazi gems are of high grade and will likely fetch enough
foreign exchange on the international market," Wellings said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is rich for its resources of precious stones in
addition to copper mines. The country is giving incentives to
attract investment to boost products of gemstones as
non-traditional exports.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Scholar Says Dalai Lama Violates Human Rights (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Puncog's family used to live near the Johkang Monastery in the
center of Lhasa. At that time, the street in front of the
monastery was full of beggars, who often died of hunger or from
the cold. Sometimes, their bodies were bitten by dogs, or the
head, hands and hearts were used in religious ceremonies for
nobles or officials, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Serfs were regarded by their masters as talking animals," he
said. "Homeless serfs would become beggars, and what they could
look forward to was death. That was the human rights situation in
Tibet under the Dalai Lama's rule."
</P>
<P>
Like other Tibetan commoners, Puncog's father and mother served
different masters, and were badly bullied and exploited.
</P>
<P>
At that time, there were two courts in Lhasa, which were
located alongside a prison. Prisoners had to eat leftover qingke
(a kind of highland barley), and were bound by iron chains and saw
little sunlight.
</P>
<P>
"The history of old Tibet was one written in the blood and
tears of serfs," Puncog Cering said. "Those days are gone
forever. Now Tibetans have equal rights in politics and the
economy, in production, and in daily life. Everyone is equal under
the law."
</P>
<P>
In Tibet's prime, there were 10 million people. But when Tibet
was liberated in the 1950s, there were only about a million,
because many young people had been forced into monasteries by the
government. Moreover, medical conditions for ordinary people were
extremely poor.
</P>
<P>
In old Lhasa, only a few people could afford medical care, and
there were only half a dozen private schools for children from
rich families. Now over 70 percent of Tibetan kids are able to
attend school in bright and spacious classrooms.
</P>
<P>
When Tibet was liberated in 1951, the average life expectancy
of Tibetans was only 35 years, now it has gone up to 65, and the
survival rate of babies has risen from 30 percent to 95 percent,
according to Puncog Cering.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Scholar Says Dalai Lama Violates Human Rights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dalai Lama had an extremely
poor human rights record himself when he was in Tibet and is
hardly qualified to talk about human rights, a noted Tibetan
professor told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The laws which the Dalai Lama used in ruling Tibet before
fleeing the plateau region showed that the ruling class willfully
trampled on the rights of the vast majority of serfs, said Puncog
Cering, president of the Tibet branch of the China Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Puncog Cering has just compiled "A Collection of Laws in Tibet
in the Past," and is now busy translating the Tibetan into
Chinese, at the request of Soochow University of Taiwan, where it
will be translated into English.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan version was published by Tibetan Classical Books
Publishing House and the Chinese and English versions will be
published by Soochow University by the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The law as practiced under the Dalai Lama made it clear that
humans were divided into nine ranks, and serfs and common women
were at the lowest levels.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of a blacksmith or butcher who was murdered could
only get a piece of flax rope as compensation. In the case of a
common woman, the compensation was 10 liang (about 11 ounces) of
silver. But, compensation in the case of a slain noble was 120
liang of silver, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
Serfs had no freedom of speech. If several serfs were found
complaining about the government, they would be punished. If one
argued with someone superior in rank, he would be arrested.
</P>
<P>
Those caught stealing the property of a living Buddha or of
officials, or caught fighting with their master could have their
eyes or tongue cut out or hands cut off, or could be hurled down a
cliff or into a river, according to the law.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the prerequisite for formulating these laws
was protection of the interests of the class of owners of serfs,"
Puncog Cering said.
</P>
<P>
"In the process of compiling the book, I have become to deeply
understand that the laws in old Tibet were the cruelest in the
world, and did not respect human rights at all," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Denies Blocking Burundi Relief Cargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has refuted
reports that it was holding humanitarian supplies destined for
Burundi at the Dar es Salaam port, saying the sanctions imposed
on Bujumbura did not cover humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Co-operation, Jakaya Kikwete, said here on Thursday that
thousands of tonnes of various supplies for Burundi have passed
through Tanzania between last July and February this year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister added over 10,000 tonnes of fertilizer,
1,200 litres of fuel, 1,000 tonnes of medical supplies and over
5,000 tonnes of maize, beans, vegetable oil, rice, biscuits and
other food items passed through Tanzania during the period.
</P>
<P>
He noted other items such as vehicles, clothing, plastic sheet
and jerry cans also passed through Tanzania from various sources
including the United Nations High Commission for Refugees
(UNHCR), UN system and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
Kikwete further said apart from the petroleum products which
passes through Tanzania, other quantities pass through Kigali. He
said the government was not responsible for any delay, but the
individual suppliers and carriers.

<HEADLINE> China Building New North-South Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China has been working on a new
415-km north-south canal parallel to the historic Grand Canal, in
east China's Jiangsu Province, starting at Tongzhou in Nantong
City and ending at Ganyu County in Lianyungang City.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiao Yehong, an official in charge of the project,
fifty km of the canal have been completed since work started in
1993, and dredge work has started on 24.5 km.
</P>
<P>
Xiao called the new canal a "little brother" of the
Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal, which is 1,794 km long and more than
a thousand years old.
</P>
<P>
The official said that new canal would have the same width
(60m) and same depth (4m) as the old one, but will have certain
advantages. It can not only handle 1,000 dwt craft, but can also
divert water from the Yangtze River for irrigating northern areas
of Jiangsu at a rate of 100 cu m per second.
</P>
<P>
In addition to improving northern Jiangsu's flood water and
irrigation water handling capacity, the canal will play an
important role in dredging of port areas along the east coast, and
in supplying water for power stations, including the planned
nuclear power station in Lianyungang City.
</P>
<P>
The new canal will be built in three stages. Work has started
on the 245-km middle section. The project is one of China's major
water control projects, and is expected to cost 1.8 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Central China's Province Makes Progress in Reemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 240,000 unemployed
people in central China's Hunan Province have found new jobs
thanks to a provincial reemployment project.
</P>
<P>
There are 600,000 surplus workers in state-owned enterprises,
accounting for 18 percent of all workers and staff. The problem is
that they have not adapted easily to the new competitive situation
in looking for jobs because of a lack of skills.
</P>
<P>
So, the city of Zhuzhou took the lead in starting a
reemployment project by setting up training centers in the early
1990s, where laid-off workers are asked to go for technical
training while seeking jobs by themselves. In average, they can
get a monthly income of about 400 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Provincial labor departments are spreading the practice and
want to create a competitive environment, in which unemployed
people can learn practical techniques to prepare themselves.
</P>
<P>
Several thousand workers lost their jobs when the Xiangtan
Textile, Printing and Dyeing Plant, a large stated-owned
enterprise, saw production orders fall. So, the people were given
training in dressmaking, marketing, accounting, printing, and
electrical appliance repairs.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 80 percent of them have found new jobs,
and many have learned a new versatility. "We have two hands to
rely on and it is not so difficult to find new jobs as long as we
master new skills," said one.
</P>
<P>
Now, about 160 of these centers are open to the jobless, and
welfare departments provided over 70 million yuan in loans last
year to finance the reemployment projects.
</P>
<P>
The project has also been extended to rural areas. Labor
management offices were opened in half the province's 2,410
villages by the end of 1996 to help with the orderly movement of
the rural surplus labor force and to help ease the pressure on
urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Major Step to Maturity in China's Legal System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Fifth Session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) passed the new, amended Criminal
Law at its closing meeting in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Legal experts said the new Criminal Law, which will come into
effect on October 1 this year, has made a significant reform on
China's criminal legal framework and judicial system, and is
another indication that China's legal system has increasingly been
improved and the development of its legality is heading towards
maturity following the enactment of the new Criminal Procedure Law
in March, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The most distinct characteristic of the new Criminal Law is
that it has made as detailed, comprehensive and concrete
stipulations as possible on all kinds of criminal offences, so as
to protect the citizens' rights and interests in an all-round way,
ensure judicial fairness, and safeguard the smooth growth of a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Availability of laws on all occasions and judicial fairness
are basic symptoms of a country's matured legal system," one
legal expert noted.
</P>
<P>
Having gone through solicitation of views on an extensive scale
and, deliberations, additions and revisions at two NPC Standing
Committee sessions and the current NPC session, which was attended
by approximately 3,000 legislators, the new Criminal Law now has
452 articles, 260 more than the previous one.
</P>
<P>
"This law can ensure that no criminal escape punishment," said
Tao Xiping, vice-chairman of the Beijing Municipal People's
Congress Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new Criminal Law has improved the criminal
judicial proceeding, and laid a solid basis for handling criminal
cases in strict accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Binsheng, vice-chairman of the All-China Lawyers
Association, said that from the perspective of legal
professionals, the most impressive aspect of the new Criminal Law
is the further affirmation of the principles of "conviction and
penalty according to law," "equality for all before the law," and
"penalties commensurate with crimes."
</P>
<P>
"Just like the principle that 'a person should be deemed
innocent until proved guilty by courts' endorsed in the new
Criminal Procedure Law, the three principles constitute the
cornerstone in administering the country according to law, and has
great significance to preventing abuse of power by judicial
departments and safeguarding citizens' legitimate rights and
interests," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Rigid and specific stipulations on penalty reduction,
release-on-parole, and legitimate defence in the new Criminal Law
are also intended to guarantee judicial fairness, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gao Mingxuan, vice-president of the China Law Society and a
renowned expert on criminal laws, said that the new Criminal Law
is attributed to the prolonged and assiduous efforts of China and
the Chinese people in the building of a legal system.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of reform and opening up in late 1978, the
NPC, China's top legislature, has enacted more than 300 laws,
which almost cover all aspects of the country's political,
economic and social life.
</P>
<P>
The principle of judicial fairness has also been embodied in
administrative, economic, civil and other kinds of laws.
</P>
<P>
In this country with a long history of feudalism, civilians had
unprecedentedly been granted the right to sue the government with
the help of an Administrative Procedure Law, while the Law on
State Compensation had for the first time enabled citizens to
claim damages from the state.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, continuous efforts are being made to further improve
the existing legal system and judicial justice.
</P>
<P>
"After the amendments are made to the Criminal Law, the NPC and
its Standing Committee will undertake to amend the Marriage Law
and enact a Civil Code, and work to formulate a series of new
laws," said an official with the NPC Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province Starts Large-scale River Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan province
has launched a large scale project to fight pollution in the
Xiangjiang river, and plans to improve the qualities of water
flows considerably in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The river is the province's main water way, with the river
valley covering 92,500 square kilometers, or 40 percent of the
province's entire landspace. The river affects 60 percent of the
province's population and 70 percent of its economic operations.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, however, as the local economy developed,
pollution became an increasingly serious problem.
</P>
<P>
Starting in the 1970s, the province began a series of studies
of the valley's environment, said Liu Jiucheng, vice-director of
the provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, and it has spent
over three billion yuan (375 million US dollars) on pollution
control there since the '80s.
</P>
<P>
"We have a special fund of 60 million yuan annually for
pollution control," Liu noted.
</P>
<P>
A number of factories with serious pollution problems, such as
the Zhuzhou Smeltery and the Xiangtan Steel Plant have spent a
great deal on pollution control projects. As a result, the heavy
metal and arsenic content of the river have dropped by 30 percent
and 60 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The province is determined to enhance efforts at combatting
pollution, and plans to spent 2.7 billion yuan on pollution
control during the 1996-2000 period, with some 794 million yuan to
be spent this year.
</P>
<P>
The province is planning on reducing the heavy metal content by
80 percent and the solid matter by 60 percent in the river by the
end of the century.

</P>
<P>
The letter is said to be from the Tino Rangatiratanga
Liberation Front campaigning for Maori sovereignty and threatens
action against the government.
</P>
<P>
It said the first act of defiance will be the destruction of
the national monument of great significance and its objective is
the establishment of an independent Maori state.

<HEADLINE> U.S.-Owned Retailer Forced to Resume Cuban Pyjamas Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-owned retail giant
Wal-Mart Canada Ltd. said today it will resume selling Cuban-made
pyjamas this weekend, two-weeks after pulling them off its shelves
across Canada.
</P>
<P>
The about-face came after a comprehensive review and discussion
with customers, legal advisers and the Canadian government, the
retailer said.
</P>
<P>
The move "reflects our commitment to meet the expectations of
the Canadian marketplace," it was quoted as saying by reports here.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the retailer decided to remove the Cuban-made
pyjamas from all its 136 Canadian stores after a customer
complaint in the city of Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
The removal conforms with the U.S. Helms-Burton law that
penalizes countries and companies that do business with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, it comes into direct conflict with Canada's Foreign
Extraterritorial Measures Act, which forbids companies here from
complying in any way with the U.S. anti-Cuba law.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian legislation threatens companies with fines
equivalent to those in the Helms-Burton law, which has penalties
up to one million U.S. dollars for companies doing business with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government said last week that it was looking at
whether Wal-Mart violated any Canadian laws by pulling the pyjamas
from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
"It's something we are monitoring," a spokesman for the Justice
Department said at that time.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Paul Martin also warned businesses not to bow
to the U.S. anti-Cuban law and "act according to Canadian ethics."
</P>
<P>
In addition, a group of Winnipeggers staged a protest last
weekend at a Wal-Mart store, strongly condemning the retailer's
decision to stop selling Cuban-made pyjamas.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- World downhill champion Hilary
Lindh announced her retirement on Thursday, ending a 13-year
sparkling career and leaving behind her in the U.S. ski team a
great vacuum.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old from Juneau, Alaska, has just experienced a
remarkable final season in her career, rallying from a 32nd-place
finish in the season opener to a world championship a month ago at
Sestriere, Italy.
</P>
<P>
Yet Lindh failed to fulfill her dream of ending her career with
a triumph at Vail, Colorado, site of a World Cup victory in 1995.
On Wednesday's World Cup finals downhill event she only ended up
in ninth place.
</P>
<P>
Frequently at her best in important races, she won a silver
medal at the 1992 Olympics, bronze at the 1996 world championships
and, finally, gold at the 1997 worlds -- stamping herself the most
successful American downhill skier in major events.
</P>
<P>
Along the way, she won three World Cup races, a world junior
championship and universal respect as a tough competitor
reflecting her Alaskan heritage.
</P>
<P>
Her departure leaves a gaping void on a U.S. downhill squad
decimated this season by injuries to three of its stars, Picabo
Street, Tommy Moe and Kyle Rasmussen, and the lingering effects of
a 1995 injury to AJ Kitt.
</P>
<P>
She will compete next week in the U.S. national championships
at Sugarloaf, Maine, then enroll for the spring term at the
University of Utah, where she will study biology.

Jiangsu is one of the eastern coast areas that have had fast
economic expansion and a higher degree of opening-up to the
outside world in the past several years. By 1995, the province
had 459,000 industrial and manufacturing enterprises, with assets
reaching 804.1 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Living standards have improved for residents thanks to fast
economic growth and a lower population growth rate of 5.53 per

</P>
<P>
The average income for urban residents was 4,689 yuan and for
those in rural areas 3,029 yuan last year, both exceeding the

<HEADLINE> Coal Gasification Project Starts in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Construction work on a major
coal gasification project which will benefit some 1.6 million
residents of three cities in Henan Province began in Yima Coal
Mine recently.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge, the gasification will be
done in a large pit yard and gasified coal will be sent to the
cities of Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Sanmenxia in central China.
</P>
<P>
The project will require the building of a factory at the
source, and of long-distance pipelines, and will have a daily
production capacity of 1.2 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost 2.89 billion yuan (about 348 million
U.S. dollars), 62.98 million dollars of which will be covered by
loans provided by the Australian government. The loans will be
used to buy key technology and equipment from Germany and the
United States. The project will be finished by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Henan is China's second largest coal producer. The gasification
facilities are considered to be a project in the public interest,
especially for reducing the use of coal in urban areas and
improving the environment. These cities will decrease the volume
of pollutants discharged each year when residents and industrial
manufacturers change from coal to gas. It is especially
significant for protecting many cultural relics in Luoyang, which
used to be the capital for nine dynasties.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The China No.1 Tractor
Engineering and Machinery Corporation has maintained a high-speed
increase in its economic returns for the past two years, an
encouraging sign for financially-troubled state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The company, with more than 40,000 workers, realized a total
sales volume worth 4.31 billion yuan in 1996, up 30.6 percent from
the year before.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest of its kind in China and a major contributor
to the country's agricultural mechanization.
</P>
<P>
The Luoyang No.1 Tractor Plant, a state-owned backbone
enterprise affiliated with the corporation, experienced ups and
downs in its reforms and suffered a record deficit in 1994,
despite its dominant 60 percent share of the domestic tractor
market in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Seeking solutions, the company designated four of its branch
plants to set up foreign-funded joint ventures, in a bid to form a
new management mechanism compatible with the modern enterprise
system.
</P>
<P>
The corporation authorized its subordinates to act as legal
persons in competition on the market.
</P>
<P>
It reduced the staff of more than 4,000 and implemented the
contract system in an effort to bring workers' initiative into
full play.
</P>
<P>
The measures paid off: the company earned 260 million yuan of
profit and tax in 1996, an increase of 72.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The formerly clumsy caterpillar tractors have been transformed
by new designs, forming a series of new products widely praised in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The corporation is now able to manufacture road rollers,
excavators and trucks for both civilian and military purposes.
</P>
<P>
It now has product orders valued at more than four billion
yuan.  enditem

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The number of overseas-funded
projects and contractual investment they entailed both decreased
slightly in the first two months of this year, as compared with
the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that by the end of February, Shanghai,
the largest metropolitan business center in China, had more than
16,000 overseas-funded projects, involving pledged foreign
investment of 45.9 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
In January and February, the number of industrial projects
accounted for 63 percent of the total funded by overseas
businessmen. Real estate and public undertakings take up 13
percent, followed by the sectors of transportation, posts,
telecommunications, building, and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was the biggest investor, with the number of Hong
kong-funded projects reaching 31 percent of the total. In line
behind Hong Kong were Japan, Taiwan, the United States, and
Singapore.

NANNING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, one of the country's less developed areas, had
nearly 11 percent growth in its GDP last year, even after being
hit by the biggest flood of the century.
</P>
<P>
The growth is the result of greater efforts to develop more
profitable projects, bringing regional industrial output last year
to 16 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The region had record grain output last year, with an increase
of 580,000 tons over 1995. Investment from overseas also rose by
nearly four percent to one billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The region had more than 14.4 billion yuan in revenues last
year, up eight percent from 1995, and average per capita income in
urban areas reached 4,400 yuan, and 1,680 yuan in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Growth of the retail and consumer price indexes was held to
around 4.5 percent and 6.5 percent in 1996, respectively, much
lower than the previous year's figures of 16.4 percent and 18.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Local economic reforms, centered on state-owned enterprises,
dealt with taxes, finances, investment, foreign trade, and social
security and helped boost the region's economic growth in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Book on General History of Hui Ethnic People Published </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first history book of
the Hui ethnic group was recently published by the People's
Publishing House of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
There are nearly nine million Hui people in the country who
live in more than 95 percent of the Chinese counties, with large
communities in the Ningxia and Xinjiang autonomous regions, and
Gansu, Henan and Hebei provinces.
</P>
<P>
The "History of China's Hui People" was compiled by historian
Qiu Shusen and contains more than 800,000 Chinese characters. It
details the political, economic, cultural and religious progress
as well as the folklore of the Hui people from ancient periods up
to the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Ancestors of the Hui people during the Tang and Song dynasties,
from the seventh to 13th centuries, were mainly Arabs and
Persians, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
In the 14th century, the number of Moslem Tujue (Turk) people
exceeded that of Arabs and Persians, and more Moslems came from
south China, southeast China and even Africa.
</P>
<P>
In later generations, Moslem ancestors helped many people of
the Han, Uygur and Mongolian ethnic groups convert to Islam, and
residence rights of Moslems were recognized by feudal governments
in ancient China, the book says.

<HEADLINE> Women's General Qualities in Inner Mongolia Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Eradicating illiteracy and
improving production skills, women in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region have their general qualities greatly upgraded.
</P>
<P>
Women in the region, which has the country's largest acreage of
grassland, produce great wealth from farm crops, animal husbandry,
processing industries and a "courtyard economy".
</P>
<P>
With women playing a major role in developing the courtyard
economy, which includes animal-breeding, cash crop cultivation,
and workshops in or near courtyards, it produced 1.3 billion yuan
last year, accounting for 30 percent of local family incomes.
</P>
<P>
For the past 11 years, the region has had a campaign to get
women to learn more and acquire skills.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the region's women received training during
the period and 100,000 of them were awarded the title of
technician.
</P>
<P>
The move was also responsible for the rising of a large number
of women officials. According to statistics, 643 women in the
region have been promoted to posts at or above the county level.
</P>
<P>
As people in the region grew more aware of the importance of
education, relations between neighbors and between family members
have become more harmonious.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer on Rise in Indian Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Breast cancer is on the rise in
Indian cities, Ministry for Health and Family Welfare sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the leading causes of death from cancer in women
between 35-54 years of age. In New Delhi, capital of India, it is
the most common form of cancer among women.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Tata Memorial Hospital in Bombay recorded an
upward trend in breast cancer which now equals the high rate of
uterine cancer in the city.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the World Health Organization (WHO),
worldwide deaths from breast cancer will rise to 500,000 by the
year 2000 and almost a fifth of these will be in the Indian
subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
Though the incidence of breast cancer continues to swell,
awareness and information about tumors is low. Besides, the social
stigma attached to the dreaded disease also deters even educated
people from seeking timely medical help.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Natural gas from northwest China
will be channeled through a pipeline to Beijing beginning
September 30.
</P>
<P>
The entire project has been under construction for nearly seven
years, costing six billion yuan (722.9 million US dollars),
according to officials of Beijing's municipal government.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, a total of 1.08 million Beijing
households will be using natural gas, up from the current 400,000.
</P>
<P>
In the city's eight districts, 54,000 stoves still burn coal,
and the sulphur dioxide and dust they discharge are the main cause
of Beijing's air pollution.
</P>
<P>
According to arrangements set by the State Planning Commission,
from 1998 to 2000, gas fields in Shaanxi and Gansu provinces and
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region will provide Beijing with 1.5
billion cubic meters of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing municipal government has scheduled that all
coal-burning stoves inside the third ring-road of Beijing will be
burning natural gas in four years.
</P>
<P>
Medium and small coal-burning furnaces and heat-supplying
plants scattered in the urban areas will be using gas
gradually. Meanwhile, the amount of coal used in industrial
production will be cut down.

<HEADLINE> Tanks Deployed in Tirana to Stem Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- At least two tanks appeared on the
streets of the Albanian capital Tirana tonight, apparently in an
attempt to stem the unrest gripping the country.
</P>
<P>
One tank was seen in front of President Sali Berisha's office,
and the other was patrolling the Boulevard of the Martyrs of the
Nation, where several key government institutions are located.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with political parties earlier today, Berisha
proposed that tanks be posted in front of the main government
institutions after unrest spread to the capital. Citizens today
looted a warehouse of 650 tons of flour and raided an ammunition
magazine of the security force.
</P>
<P>
The unrest spread out earlier in the day when some 300 people
looted the barracks in Bajram Curri, a town about 200 kilometers
northeast of Tirana, and took away hundreds of assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, anti-government rebels seized weapons from a
military base near Elbasan, only 55 kilometers from Tirana.
</P>
<P>
The country is thrown into anarchy after two weeks of
clashes. The authorities have appealed for foreign military
intervention to help end the crisis but so far no affirmative
response has been made.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks on CHT in Bangladesh End Inconclusively </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The tribal delegation left here
this morning with empty hands as the two-day peace talks on the
Chittagong hill tracts (CHT) in southern Bangladesh ended
inconclusively Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Both sides, however, agreed to meet again on April 30. And it
was also agreed in the meeting that the existing ceasefire would
be extended unto June 30.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was thought that the two sides would reach an
agreement this time to resolve the decades-old insurgency problem
in the CHT, but this fourth round of talks ended without any
agreement.
</P>
<P>
"We had cordial talks and agreed to meet for another round of
dialogue on April 30," said head of the government delegation Abu
Hasnat Abdullah, who declined to reveal details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
According to meeting sources, the talks were progressing on the
desired direction on Wednesday but on Thursday, the talks mainly
concentrated on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's address in
Chittagong where she said that the Muslim settlers would not be
withdrawn from the hill tracts.
</P>
<P>
The tribal leaders told the meeting that it would be useless to
continue a dialogue when the government was not even considering
doing anything regarding the Muslim settlers from the plains.
</P>
<P>
They said that the withdrawal of settlers was a major issue
towards a peace agreement. The hill people will not accept any
peace agreement without resolving the issue in any form.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached earlier this month, the
tribal refugees in the Indian state of Tripura would be returning
home from March 28.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Industrial Production Index Up In January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's industrial
production index, which measures the rate of change in the
production of industrial commodities over time, rose 11.9 percent
for January 1997 in comparison with that of the same period a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
The January 1997 index was 253.0 against 226.1 in January 1996
and the first month's industrial production index was also 1.4
percent higher from 249.5 in December last year, according to data
released by the Department of Statistics here today.
</P>
<P>
All the three divisions under the industrial sector reflected
an upward movement with the mining division rising 6.1 percent to
163.2 from 153.8, the manufacturing division gaining 12.9 percent
to 297.5 from 263.5 and the electricity division increasing 20.0
percent to 295.2 from 246.0 during the period under review.
</P>
<P>
According to the Department, the main contributors to the rise
in the index of the mining division between January last year to
the first month of 1997 was the increase in crude oil index to
147.2 from 141.6 and natural gas to 285.9 from 250.5. However, the
index for tin fell 39.2 percent to 16.6 from 27.3.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing division, 18 of the 19 major groups
recorded higher indexes for January 1997 against the same month of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Transport equipment recorded the biggest leap to 399.3 from
301.3 in the first month of 1996, followed by iron and steel
basic industries to 352.0 from 279.7, non-metallic mineral
products to 357.0 from 287.0, industrial chemicals to 246.0 from
200.9 and wood, wood and cork products except furniture to 260.0
from 214.0.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco manufactures increased to 122.5 from 103.1,
non-ferrous metal basic industries to 186.6 from 161.3, food
manufacturing to 168.7 from 145.8, crude oil refineries to 227.3

<P>
ATHENS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Greek parliament today
approved in principle a bill protecting individual liberty and
privacy, which will facilitate Greece's participation in a
European Union (EU) agreement on border control.
</P>
<P>
The parliament voted 132 to 89 for the bill, paving the way for
Greece's entrance into the agreement, which lifts passport
controls among EU members and shares police data.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Costas Simitis, responding to opposition
criticism, said the bill would protect citizens, strengthen
democracy and allow better transparency in the flow of information.
</P>
<P>
Greece is one of the few members of the 15-nation EU which has
not yet ratified the Schengen Agreement, aimed at creating a
border-free EU. Britain and Ireland have not signed up to the pact.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, the current holder of the EU presidency,

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Suspends Salaries in Government Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Pavel
Lazarenko authorized the Financial Ministry at a cabinet meeting
today to suspend salaries in all ministries and provincial
governments.
</P>
<P>
Salaries of cabinet members and organizations were also
suspended.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was made because all the ministries and
provincial governments had failed to submit the first quarter's
budget plan to the Financial Ministry before the deadline of March
10, Lazarenko said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government's 1997 budget plan is still waiting
for approval by parliament. So President Leonid Kuchma ordered, on
February 28, that all ministries and provincial governments,
including the cities of Kiev and Sevastopal, should work out the
first quarter's budget before March 10.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian economy has remained stagnant since the beginning
of the year. About 40 percent of industrial enterprises were
running in the red in January and February. Financial income was
2.64 billion hryvnas (about 1.4 billion dollars) in the first two
months, only 80 percent of the estimated earnings.
</P>
<P>
A survey issued by the World Bank shows that one-third of
Ukrainians, or 17 million residents, are living under the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian government is at its wits' end on how to tackle
continuous strikes over wage arrears, and how to increase budget
income.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges End of Tension in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council this evening called on all political forces in
Albania to work together to lower tension and restore stability in
the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
Council President Zbigniew Wlosowicz, of Poland, said the
Security Council expressed its deep concern about the
deteriorating situation in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"It urges all concerned to refrain from hostilities and acts of
violence, and to cooperate with diplomatic efforts to reach a
peaceful solution to the crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon the parties involved to
continue the political dialogue and to live up to the commitments
they made on Sunday, said the statement read by Wlosowicz.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached Sunday between President Berisha and
10 opposition parties, an interim coalition government was formed
to stem the unrest and oversee early general elections in June.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council discussed over the past two days two
letters presented by the permanent representatives of Albania and
Italy, which asked for international assistance to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Council called upon the parties not to impede the provision
of humanitarian assistance to the civilian population, and
emphasized the importance of keeping open all means of
communication in the country, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. body also stressed the importance of regional
stability and fully supported the diplomatic efforts of the
international community, in particular efforts by the European
continent, to find a peaceful solution to the crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Unrest began to sweep Albania after the collapse of pyramid
investment schemes in which hundreds of thousands of Albanians
lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
Despite the formation of the interim government, looting still
plagues the country and a growing number of cities were thrown
into anarchy.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's Garment Makers Want Timely Export Permits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Garment industry of Nepal
is running into huge losses due to the central bank's failure to
issue export permission in time, local industrialists said today.
</P>
<P>
Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank, is not ready to provide
permits for ready-made garment exports to the United States even
when American buyers are trying to exact price concessions for the
delivery delays, the official news agency RSS quoted exporters as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The exporters said that they are now willing to sell at the
reduced prices and suffer a loss.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest buyer of Nepalese garments,
which bought nearly 90 million US dollars worth of garments from
Nepal last year.
</P>
<P>
Nepal's garment industry employs some 100,000 workers across
the country and ranks second among the country's exporting
industries after the carpet manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Satyendra Pyara Shrestha told a meeting
of local garment industrialists here Thursday that there will be
no more delays in providing export permissions.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that his bank will extend cooperation in the
development and expansion of the garment industry, which serves as
a major foreign exchange earner of the country.

ALMA-ATA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Military maneuvers carried out
under NATO's Partnership for Peace program should be aimed at
improving the effectiveness of peacekeeping missions in areas of
conflict, delegates at a meeting on military exercises in Central
Asia said today.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh news agency reported that the meeting, organized by the
Kazakh defense ministry, was attended by representatives from
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, the United States, Russia,
Ukraine, Turkey, Denmark, Lithuania and Georgia.

September, which will be carried out in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Turkey and Denmark have said they are
willing to send troops to take part in the exercises.

<HEADLINE> Indian Foreign Minister Wants to Have Exclusive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Indian External Affairs
Minister I.K. Gujral is seeking to have exclusive talks with his
Pakistani counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan early next month, an
informed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the event of a positive response from Islamabad to Gujral's
proposal, conveyed Thursday in a letter to Gohar Ayub Khan, the
foreign ministers of the two countries would be setting up a
negotiating table in a little over a week after the March 28-31
foreign secretary-level talks scheduled in New Delhi, capital of
India.
</P>
<P>
There is no fixed agenda for the dialogue between the foreign
secretaries. But as suggested by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif in a letter last month to the Indian prime minister, the
foreign secretary-level talks could prepare the ground for a
dialogue between the political leadership of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Originally, the two foreign ministers were to meet on the
fringes of the non-aligned movement (NAM) ministerial conference
scheduled here in the first week of April. In his letter to Gohar
Ayub, however, Gujral has invited him to stay on after the
conclusion of the NAM meeting for a regular bilateral talks. The
dates suggested by Gujral for the talks are April 8-9.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperative and friendly relations with our neighbors are in
the interest of South Asia. That's the essence of our policy which
applies equally to Pakistan," Gujral said here Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Declares Combat Readiness on Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian President and Head of
the armed forces, Kiro Gligorov, tonight ordered his troops to
raise the degree of combat readiness along the Macedonian-Albanian
border because of Albania's serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
The order, to prevent Albanian refugees flooding into
Macedonia, was issued when the chaos in Albania extended to the
border with Macedonia, and armed conflict had already occurred
there.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The protests turned violent two weeks ago as rebels looted
weapons from army depots and started fighting the
military. Several cities in southern Albania are in the hands of
rebels who are now threatening to move onto the capital.
</P>
<P>
Albanian President Sali Berisha and all political parties have
allegedly called on the Western European Union to provide military
assistance to Tirana to restore order in the country which is
verging on civil war.

<HEADLINE> Italy Calls For NATO Role in Albanian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy said today there could be a
role for NATO in the Albania crisis and suggested the alliance
monitor and analyze the situation in the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Foreign Ministry proposed that North Atlantic
Treaty Organization consider such a monitoring role, and sketch
out contingency plans and examine the probable consequences.
</P>
<P>
The ministry pointed out that today's Albanian calls for
intervention by NATO or the West European Union did not come from
President Sali Berisha, as widely reported, but from the newly
formed government.
</P>
<P>
The point is important, the ministry said, because the interim
government is headed by an opposition leader, Bashkim Fino.
</P>
<P>
It said Rome had mounted pressure in recent days to broaden the
government to include all political forces.
</P>
<P>
In the present situation, with much of the population armed,
not all the forces are capable of dialogue, said Rome.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Italy and the international community urged
forces to return to the path of dialogue, lay down arms and
prepare for elections at the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
Rome stressed that even faced with an extremely difficult
situation, diplomatic efforts were being made.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini discussed with his European
Union colleague, Hans van Mierlo, the way to facilitate the
immediate delivery of humanitarian and financial aid to help
restore order in the country.
</P>
<P>
Dini consulted former Austrian chancellor Franz Vranitzsky, who
is heading for Tirana on an Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe mission. He also spoke by phone to the new
Albanian prime minister and discussed national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Albania was plunged into unrest two weeks ago in the wake of
the collapse of dozens of pyramid savings schemes in which
hundreds of thousands of Albanians were left penniless.
</P>
<P>
President Berisha was blamed for allowing the schemes, and
the people demanded he resign.
</P>
<P>
He was forced on Sunday to change his hardline position and
agree to form an all-party interim government to stem the unrest
and oversee early elections in June.
</P>
<P>
Despite the formation of the interim government, unrest still
plagues the country. Hundreds of thousands of automatic weapons
are believed in the hands of the civilians and the government
has lost control in most of the south.
</P>
<P>
About 40 people have been killed in clashes.

<HEADLINE> Italian Trade Surplus Hits Six-year High in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Italy's trade surplus rose 48
percent last year to a six-year record of 67,483 billion liras
(42.17 billion U.S. dollars), according to the national statistics
agency, ISTAT.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released today by ISTAT show that the trade
surplus in 1996 was 21,969 billion liras (about 13.72 billion
dollars) up compared with the 45,514 billion liras (28.45 billion
dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the rise in the surplus to a 4.9 percent
fall in imports and 1.8 percent growth in exports in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Italy had an overall trade surplus of 19,429 billion liras
(12.14 billion dollars) last year with the European Union,
despite having a deficit with a few member countries. Its trade
surplus with non EU countries was 48,054 billion liras (30 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
ISTAT said that sectors showing a trade surplus were
machinery, processed products, textile, feather goods, clothing,
transportation tools, metal and non-metal commodities.
</P>
<P>
But there were deficits in ferrous and non-ferrous metals,
energy, chemical products, food, beverages, tobacco, agricultural
and fishery goods.

<HEADLINE>   Usury Goes Wild in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Three years ago, the owner of a
dress shop in Italy borrowed five million Italian liras (2,950
U.S. dollars) from a priest.
</P>
<P>
But now she faces a repayment bill which has swollen to 80
million liras(47,200 dollars). If she doesn't pay up, her store
is likely to be destroyed by Mafia.
</P>
<P>
The shopowner is one of more than 500,000 people who are in
debts to usurers, or loan sharks, in Italy in a parallel credit
market estimated at 46,000 billion liras (27.14 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Grim statistics were released today in a report by the Italian
traders' association Confesercenti about the rising tide of usury
affecting more than 120,000 businessmen and 340,000 private
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Each year scores of Italians commit suicide to escape the
clutches of loan sharks and thousands of small businesses are
adversely affected.
</P>
<P>
Italy has now started to face the problem and try and curb
it. Last March parliament passed a draft law considering any
interest rate 50 percent higher than the national average lending
rate to be usurious.
</P>
<P>
And loan sharks face between one and six years in prison and
fines of up to 30 million liras (18,750 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
But mob-controlled usury is still a headache for Rome and some
bank officials have joined the outlawed trade, compounding an
already serious problem. Over the past three years, police have
found that about 65,650 billion liras (38.73 billion dollars) of
usurious loans were made by bankers.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been a steep drop in complaints to police
despite the growing number of victims of loan sharks, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1996, an average of less than 2,000 people a
year have gone on trial for usury. Last year, there were only 370
arrests in connection with usury.

Eyewitnesses reported two successive blasts inside the godown,
first a minor one which possibly triggered the second major blast.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations have ruled out the possibility of a
sabotage. A mistake in handling the gelatin sticks might have
caused the blast, Satara district collector Vandana Khuller said.
</P>
<P>
A bomb disposal squad as well as fire tenders and ambulances
were rushed to the spot. The police have summoned explosive
experts and the debris would be cleared after consulting them,
police said.

SANTIAGO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Chilean acting Minister of
Foreign Affairs Mariano Fernandez held talks today on bilateral
relations with Qian Zhengying, the vice chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers exchanged views on political relations and
economic, commercial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez said Chile and China enjoy good political relations,
and hoped both sides would continue this trend.
</P>
<P>
"Chile is a small country. Trade exchanges with China are very
important for us. Chile wants to increase trade exchanges and
export more products to China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want China to declare Chile a country free of the fruit
fly, because we need, at this time, that kind of measure to expand
the exchange," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Qian said Chile was now China's second trade
partner in Latin America, and China would be the biggest Chilean
copper importer.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Acting Public Works Minister Guillermo Pickering also
held talks with Qian. They analyzed the best ways to use hydraulic
resources.

Qian Zhengying, who is also president of the Chinese Red Cross,

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's state-owned domestic
telecommunications firm Pt. Telkom has chosen US company Lockheed
Marin Corp. to build its 36-transponder satellite which will be
launched by late 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations between Telkom's elite and Lockheed executives
are still in progress," local press today quoted Telkom executive
Harso as saying here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Telkom, the contract is worth 140 million US
dollars.

<P>
The new satellite, Telkom 1, will replace the 24-transponder
Palapa b-2r satellite.

Telkom 1 will have a 15-year lifespan and be lighter than
Indonesia's current Palapa b satellites, which have a eight year
lifespan.

<HEADLINE> West Should Consider Russia's Interests on NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the West can find a way
to solve their dispute over NATO's eastward expansion if the West
puts Russia's interests on an equal footing with its own, the
Russian Defence Council said here today.
</P>
<P>
The council, made up of the heads of Russian "power
ministries", such as Defense and the Interior were meeting to
prepare for next week's Russian-U.S. summit in Helsinki between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Top of the agenda were issues relating to NATO's proposal to
let members of the former Warsaw Pact join its military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who chaired the meeting,
said Russia still held the opinion that there would be no real
security in Europe without Russia.
</P>
<P>
If NATO carries out its eastward expansion without considering
Russia's interests, "the whole Europe will have a difficult time
ahead," said Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Several former Warsaw Pact nations have been bidding to join
NATO for security reasons since the beginning of 1990s. The United
States and its NATO allies will meet in Madrid in July to decide
which countries will be first to be invited to join the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Defense Council Secretary Yuri Batruin echoed the prime
minister's view.
</P>
<P>
He told Interfax news agency that relations between Russia and
the West, security in Europe and the future of Russia's reform
will mainly depend on the easing of tensions which have arisen
from NATO enlargement and the guarantee of a partnership role for
Russia in the new international order.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Council, which is headed by President Boris Yeltsin
and Chernomyrdin, is a permanent consultative institution for the
country's military matters.

<HEADLINE> New Thai Satellite to Be Launched in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The European satellite launcher
Arianespace will launch a new satellite for Thailand on April 12,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The launch of Thaicom 3 scheduled for 6 a.m. (Thailand time)
from Arianespace's facility at Kourou in French Guyana has been
confirmed by the launcher.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, the third one of Thailand, will be delivered
into orbit at 78.5 degrees east to replace Thaicom 1, which will
be shifted to a position at 120 degrees east.
</P>
<P>
Thaicom 3 will be mainly used for broadcasting, while Thaicom 1
will be used for telecommunication signaling.
</P>
<P>
The transfer will not affect clients because they need not to
change their satellite dishes, according to Shinawatra Satellite
PLC (SSA), a Thai satellite operator.
</P>
<P>
The company's next satellite, Thaicom 4 which was built
simultaneously with Thaicom 3 to serve as a backup, is scheduled
to be launched early next year.
</P>
<P>
If a problem occurs with Thaicom 3, Thaicom 4 could be launched
within six months, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Dumrong Kasemset, chairman of the SSA, said that Thaicom 3 will
help change the company's status from a domestic satellite
operator to a regional operator.
</P>
<P>
Only 10 percent of the customers for the previous two Thai
satellites are foreigners, while about half of Thaicom 3 's
customers are from outside Thailand.

<P>
NEW YORK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surged Thursday
with new indications of a healthy United States economy -- which
might result in interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve later
this month.
</P>
<P>
However, the message, seen as a signal of inflation, evoked a
plunge in the U.S. stock and bond markets, with the Dow Jones
industrial average falling 160.48 points, its fifth worst point
decline.
</P>
<P>
The dollar against German marks settled in New York at 1.7056
marks, up from 1.6932 Wednesday. Against the yen, the dollar
closed at its highest level since February 19, at 123.41 yen, up
from 122.34 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The pound traded 1.5974 U.S. dollars, down from 1.5992 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rise of the dollar followed a decline Wednesday, triggered
by the latest report of the Fed' revealing a moderate growth of
the economy, which suggested the Fed' would not raise interest
rates soon.
</P>
<P>
However, the Commerce Department today reported a sharp rise in
February retail sales and a higher revised figure for January. The
Labor Department also reported reducing jobless claims instead of
an expected mild increase in unemployment.
</P>

Other late dollar rates in New York compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4657 Swiss francs, up from 1.4552; 5.7520 French

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Names New Chief for Military Space Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today named Valeri Grin as the new commander for Russia's Military
Space Forces.
</P>
<P>
Grin, 60, has been an acting commander for the space forces
ever since October 1996, when Gen. Vladimir Ivanov was dismissed
from the position at the start of Yeltsin's military reforms to
restore combat effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
Grin, who has been working for Russia space industry for over
21 years, said that his major task as commander would be to
protect Russia's space potential, and develop new carrier rockets
and spacecrafts in line with the country's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin ordered Chernomyrdin to reorganise his government after
his annual state-of-the-nation speech on Thursday in which he
attacked its failure to tackle Russia's economic and social
problems, including chronic delays in the payment of wages and
pensions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Chernomyrdin, a trusted Yeltsin ally who epitomises
Russian reforms to the outside world, the only man guaranteed to
keep his job is the newly appointed First Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais.
</P>
<P>
Interfax news agency, quoting "well-informed sources", said the
heads of most "power ministries" -- defense and interior
ministries and security organs that answer directly to Yeltsin --
were unlikely to be changed, probably with the exception of
defense Minister Igor Rodionov.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said on Wednesday his new cabinet, which he has
promised to present by the end of the week, would be younger and
more professional and include market-minded reformers.

in acts of thuggery and intimidation.

TIRANA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Sali Berisha
and all political parties have called on the Western European
Union to provide military assistance to Tirana to restore order in
the Balkan country which is on the verge of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The appeal issued here yesterday said outside military
assistance was needed "to restore constitutional order and
maintain the country's integrity."
</P>
<P>
The appeal to the European Union's fledgling defence arm came
only hours after a new Albanian government was sworn in to take
charge of the country until early elections are held in June.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
The protests turned violent two weeks ago as rebels looted
weapons from army depots and startged fighting the
military. Several cities in southern Albania are in the hands of
rebels who are now threatening to move onto the capital.
</P>
<P>
The international airport just outside Tirana was closed today
after a nearby military base was looted.
</P>
<P>
In Brussels, the Western European Union said it had received no
request from Albania to provide military assistance.

<HEADLINE> New Season of China's Soccer League Begins on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 season of China's
professional soccer league will finally kickoff in six cities
around the country on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It has been a long and anxiou waiting for the Chinese soccer
fans to get into the holiday atmosphere the league brings to their
daily life since the ending of the previous season which saw
Dalian Wanda taking the title for the second time in three years.
</P>
<P>
Now, after a hard and strict winter training session in
Kunming, Yunnan Province, each of the 12 teams participating in
this year's league will try the best to prove to the fans that it
deserves their support.
</P>
<P>
Among the 12 teams, Vanguard Huandao and Qingdao Hainiu were
promoted from the second division after taking the top two places
last season.
</P>
<P>
Others includes reigning champions Dalian Wanda, runners-up
Shanghai Shenhua, Football Association Cup titlists Beijing
Guo'an, the August First (Army's team), Jinan Taishan, Yanbian
Aodong, Tianjin Lifei, Guangzhou Apollo, Guangdong Hongyuan and
Sichuan Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
After a series of signings and transfers, the new season will
be hard to predict from the very start.
</P>
<P>
Vanguard Huandao, titlists of the second division last season,
will play at home their first ever professional league match
against Dalian Wanda, two-time titlists of China's top soccer
league.
</P>
<P>
Due to suspensions, injuries and modest signings compared with
last season, Dalian Wanda can hardly field in the match against
the Vanguards a line-up as strong as last season.
</P>
<P>
Though the defending champions have seven Chinese
internationals in the team, their rivals are not at all modest
with eight former Chinese internationals plus German coach Klaus
Schlappner, former head coach of Chinese national squad.
</P>
<P>
Unlike most of the Chinese coaches, the out-spoken Schlappner
earned a name of aggressiveness during his coaching of the Chinese
national team.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fans are anxious to know if Schlappner can lead his
team to stop Dalian Wanda's 34-match unbeaten record in the
league. If the German coach succeeds, then the new season will be
more interesting and exciting to the fans.
</P>
<P>
In the other matches on Sunday, last year's runners-up Shanghai
Shenhua will take on Yanbian Aodong.
</P>
<P>
The two teams both signed a new head coach from abroad with
Shanghai Shenhua now has a Bulgarian while the Yanbian team gets a
South Korean coach.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to predict what kind of match the two teams will
play in the first round. But it is clear that with the
line-up almost unchanged, the host team Shanghai Shenhua boost a
great chance of winning the season-opening match.
</P>
<P>
The other actings on Sunday will see Beijing play Sichuan
Quanxing at home, Tianjin Lifei take on the August First, Jinan
Taishan play Qingdao Hainiu, the other team from Shandong Province
and Guangzhou Apollo play Guangdong Hongyuan.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Decides Not to Sign Turtle-Protection Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 14 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations has decided not to sign an agreement with the United
States to protect sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Thursday at a two-day meeting on ASEAN
fisheries at northern Thailand's Chiang Rai province, a report
said today.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN representatives agreed that ASEAN nations should
continue to conserve the turtles without signing the treaty,
Plodprasop Suraswadi, director-general of the Fisheries Department
of the Thai government was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said entering into an agreement with the United States made
no difference as ASEAN countries had long run programs to save the
sea turtles and were soon to sign their own pact on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also asked Thailand to work on helping
develop ASEAN's shrimp farming industry and to counter the
criticism of foreign non-government organizations which accused
the industry of threatening turtle habitats.
</P>
<P>
Last May, the US Court of International Trade imposed a ban on
shrimp imports from Thailand and 51 other countries. It said they
caught shrimps without taking steps to protect endangered turtles.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand was later removed from the US list after
proving its shrimp vessels were equipped with turtle excluding
devices.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin: NATO Expansion Hard for Whole Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Thursday repeated Moscow's opposition to NATO's
planned eastward enlargement, warning it could bring difficult
times for the whole of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Chairing a meeting of the Russian Defense Council held on the
orders of President Boris Yeltsin, the premier said, "today we
must detail the tactics of negotiating with NATO and weigh up the
proposals which have emerged recently."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said Russia's negative stance over such plans was
clearly outlined in the president's message to the Federal
Assembly earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, its future policy depends on the outcome of
the Helsinki summit between the presidents of Russia and the
United States on March 20.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin will make an official visit to Washington on March
15 and is expected to meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton and US
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The two sides intend to focus on problems of European security
and a package of agreements on strategic arms limitation and
anti-missile defense, according to Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady Tarasov.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov told a briefing here Thursday the same themes will be
discussed at the forthcoming summit between Boris Yeltsin and Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
NATO's eastward expansion was described Wednesday by Yeltsin's
press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky as "the most serious
strategic mistake the West has ever made in the detente period".
</P>
<P>
Sergei said in an interview with a Moscow radio station that
Russian President Boris Yeltsin will point out this mistake when
he meets Bill Clinton in Helsinki.

<P>
SANTIAGO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Exports of Chilean fruit are
expected to remain static this year at about 1.4 billion
U.S. dollars, the Fruit Producers Federation (Fedefruta) said
today.
</P>
<P>
Fedefruta forecasts a 4 percent reduction in volume, but a 15
to 25 percent increase in prices. Weather related factors, such as
lack of rain and high temperatures, forced producers to

XINING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A series of books on Tibetan
Buddhism are being published by the Qinghai People's Publishing
House.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Tibet Autonomous Region, Qinghai Province in
northwest China is one of the country's territories which are home

They expound on a number of topics concerning Tibetan Buddhism,
such as its formation and development, philosophical significance,
Tantric Sect, or doctrine, arts, funeral customs, mythology, and
the life of monks.
</P>

Many scholars of Tibetology regard the books as an encyclopedia
of Tibetan Buddhism which, after more than 1,300 years of
development, has become one of the most popular and
long-established religions in the world.

<HEADLINE> Chang Stays On Course For Indian Wells Repeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Michael
Chang stayed on course for a tournament title repeat on Thursday
with a straight-set victory over Marc Rosset in the third round
of the ATP Tour Tournament played at Indian Wells, California.
</P>
<P>
Chang, seeded third, got rid of the big-serving Swiss 6-2, 7-5
and advanced to a quarter-final battle with France's Cedric
Pioline.
</P>
<P>
Pioline, trying to turn around a year that has so far proved
unfortunate, downed Swedish wild card Magnus Larsson 6-7 (6-8),
6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Thomas Muster, the highest seed left in the draw,
won his way 6-4, 6-4 into the quarter-finals at the Czech Slava
Dosedel's expense.
</P>
<P>
With world number-one Pete Sampras, fourth seed Goran
Ivanisevic, number five Marcelo Rios and number six Thomas
Enqvist already out, talk was turning on Thursday to a possible
semi-final showdown between Muster and Chang.
</P>
<P>
But Muster has to get there by passing the 20-year-old
Australian Mark Philippoussis in the first place, who upset
eighth-seeded Spaniard Carlos Moya 6-4, 6-3 to reach the last
eight.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, who won his first ATP Tour title in Scottsdale,
Arizona, last Sunday, stretched his winning run to eight matches
with the victory over the Australian Open finalist.
</P>
<P>
The top half of the draw was looking considerably more open,
with Spain's Alberto Berasategui the only seeded player left.
</P>
<P>
The number 14 defeated American wild card Jonathan Stark 7-6
(8-6), 6-3 to set up a quarter-final clash with Sweden's Jonas
Bjorkman. Bjorkman beat American Chris Woodruff 2-6, 7-5, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Czech Bohdan Ulihrach, who bumped out Pete Sampras in the
second round on Wednesday, qualified with a 7-5, 7-6 (7-5)
victory over Spain's Francisco Clavet.
</P>
<P>
Ulihrach will face Zimbabwe's Byron Black in the round of
eight. Black ousted Brazilian qualifier Gustavo Kuerten 6-3,
6-3.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Renews Warning to Election Boycotters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
warned again that people who incited others to boycott the
elections would be punished.
</P>
<P>
Every citizen is free to vote or not vote but no one may
prevent others from exercising their right, Soeharto said Thursday
during a visit to Sigli in eastern Indonesia, reports reaching
here today said.
</P>
<P>
The president's comments came amid reports of anonymous
campaigns encouraging people to boycott the upcoming general
elections scheduled on May 29 this year.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP) and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) will contest 425 of the 500
seats in the house of representatives in the elections. The
remaining 75 seats will be allocated to the armed forces, whose
members do not vote.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said he had learned some people were not going to the
polls and were trying to persuade others to do the same.
</P>
<P>
Security authorities in various provinces have reported seizing
anonymous leaflets that urged people to boycott the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Democratic Union party has openly called for a
boycott. Its chairman Sri Bintang Pamungkas and another two
activities have been detained and charged with subversion.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up alert centers across the country to
deal with security disturbances.
</P>
<P>
About 125 million people have been registered as voters in the
general elections.
</P>
<P>
The general elections will be followed by the presidential
elections in March, 1998, in the people's consultative assembly.
Many observers believe Soeharto will be re-elected.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Economic Growth Slows in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's economic growth rate
slowed to 1.5 percent in 1996, less than half the 3.2 percent rate
registered in 1995, according to the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector, which represented 15.2 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), showed a sluggish growth of 0.8
percent in 1996, down from 3.1 percent the previous year.
Agriculture also diminished from 3.1 percent to 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The slower pace was attributed to the contraction and poor
performance of the oil sector last year, which accounted for 13.7
percent of the GDP, the Central Bank said.
</P>
<P>
Best sector performer in 1996 was electricity, which reversed a
1.6 percent contraction in 1995 and grew 4.2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Construction was also reactivated, moving from a 0.3 percent
drop in 1995, to a 0.7 percent growth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Commerce improved, going from a 3.5 percent expansion to 4.6
percent. Transport grew from 2.5 percent to 2.6 percent between
the same periods of 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
Other services, such as hotels, restaurants, communications,
housing, services to enterprises and homes, grew 4.2 percent in
1996, compared to 2.5 percent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Susanti Bows Out Of All England Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Susi Susanti, most probably, bid
farewell for good to the All England Championships, a tournament
she virtually made her own during the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The four times All England winner and ex-World and Olympic
champion went down to second seed Chinese Gong Zhichao 11-4, 11-7
in their quater-final clash on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the 26-year-old Susanti, only jointly seeded fifth in
this year's tournament and having her days at top international
level maybe numbered, said after Thursday's defeat that she still
wanted to go on for a couple of years given fitness permission.
</P>
<P>
Susanti, getting married last month with her long time
sweetheart Allan Budi Kusuma, first won the All England title in
1990 and followed up with further success in 1991, 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
But on Thursday she only found no match for the 19-year-old
Gong, who has advanced into Friday's semifinal match against
unseeded Ra Kyung-min. The South Korean upset joint third seed
Camilla Martin of Denmark in a 62-minute tussle 11-7, 11-12, 11-6.
</P>
<P>
The other semifinal will be between China's world champion Ye
Zhaoying and unseeded compatriot Dai Yun, the woman who on
Wednesday eliminated top seed Mia Audina of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
In the men's singles, world champion and former All England
title holder Heryanto Arbi reached the semifinals with a three-set
victory over unseeded Chinese Luo Yigang.
</P>
<P>
A final against Olympic champion Poul-Erik Hoyer Larsen on
Saturday was looking on the cards.
</P>
<P>
There was something for the locals to cheer when English
couple Chris Hunt and Donna Kellogg reached the semifinals of the
mixed doubles, beating the joint fifth seeds from Russia Nickoial
Zuev and Marina Yakusheva in straight games.

<HEADLINE> Manila Extends Ban on Sugar Imports to July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Sugar Regulatory Administration
chief Wilson Gamboa has ordered an extension of the Philippines'
ban on sugar imports to July this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's local press reported that the order was issued to
ensure the large stocks of sugar in the country's warehouses were
exhausted. The stocks were estimated at 100,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to extend the sugar importation ban to July,
at which time we expect the glut to have eased," Gamboa said.
</P>
<P>
The domestic sugar glut was due to the importation of 1.02
million tons of sugar from neighboring countries in crop year
1995-1996 against production shortfalls of 500,000 tons. The large
imports volume led to a sharp fall in the sugar prices.
</P>
<P>
To ease the glut, Gamboa asked traders and millers in the
country last October to stop sugar imports up to March this year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Have Negative Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the country's largest
municipal in East China, is expected to maintain a negative
population growth for many years, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongliang, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal
Family Planning Commission said family planning in Shanghai has
advanced to a new level that emphasizes reproductive health
education at a grass-roots level and services for the large number
of laid-off workers and the more than 3.5 million floating
population.
</P>
<P>
With a birth rate of 5.6 thousand last year which is 11 per
thousand lower than the national average, Shanghai has experienced
a negative population growth for the past six years, starting
first in six of its 14 urban districts in 1991, and then,
beginning in 1993, in the whole municipality.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the natural population growth in the
municipality stablized at an annual rate of about minus one per
thousand. Shanghai has a registered permanent population of 13.09
million.
</P>
<P>
Liu attributed the low birth rate to the implementation of
various family planning educational activities and services.
Rapid economic development and expanded international exchanges
also helped reform the public's idea about reproduction, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai adopted a policy of "one couple, one child" in 1979.
In the years following, increasing numbers of residents began to
think less about wanting more children and more about having a
healthy child.
</P>
<P>
A survey among some 2,000 Shanghai residents who are in their
reproductive years suggested 94 percent were eager to learn about
pre-natal care, safe child-birth procedures and good child-rearing
practices.
</P>
<P>
Prevention of hereditary diseases, scientific measures for
bringing up children, marriage and healthy birth were identified
as the main concerns for most people. Some 88 percent of those
surveyed asked for sex and health education.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the municipal government is revising the city's
regulations on family planning work this year to further clarify
activities regarding reproductive health education and services.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Department Stores Join Hands to Improve Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 50 department stores
in some 40 major Chinese cities have promised to provide joint
services, allowing buyers to have commodities repaired or replace
them at any participating store.
</P>
<P>
The new services, aiming to improve service quality of
state-owned retail sellers, have been available at the stores on a
voluntary basis Thursday, according to a report in today's "China
Daily."
</P>
<P>
The services allow customers who buy commodities at any one of
the participating stores to go for repairs or replacements to any
store either in the same city or in a different one, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
All that is necessary is that the customer should go to a store
within 30 days of the purchase with the sales receipt, the report
quoted Xia Gengxue, an official with the Ministry of Internal
Trade, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Items that may not be replaced include food, underwear,
personal sanitary items, photo-sensitive materials, gold and
silver ornaments, discounted items and other goods that can not be
replaced according to law, she said.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of the national drive to curb the flow of sham
products into the markets, especially state-owned markets, improve
business and management and make it easier for consumers to return
or replace unsatisfactory buys," she said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has set up a special office in charge of the joint
services. "Any fake products found in any of the stores must be
reported to the office, and the office will inform other
joint-service stores to be on the watch for similar fake goods,"
the official said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- A collection of "farmer's art"
painted by local artists in Jinshan County, Shanghai, has been
logged onto the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Jinshan farmers' paintings, which are unique for their

exhibited in over a dozen countries including the United States,
Japan, France, Germany, Singapore and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
There are over 300 farmers-turned painters in Jinshan. Many

<P>
The county has been named the "Home of Modern Chinese
Paintings" by the Ministry of Culture.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Concerned Over Food Delay in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) --The Security Council today
expressed concern over the slow pace of food and medical
deliveries to Iraq under the United Nation's "oil-for-food" plan.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council, while welcoming the smooth operation
concerning Iraqi oil, expresses concern regarding the humanitarian
aspect of the implementation of resolution 986," council president
Zbigniew Wlosowicz of Poland told the press.
</P>
<P>
Under Security Council Resolution 986, Iraq was allowed to sell
up to two billion U.S. dollars worth of oil. It was to be in
exchange for food and medicine to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi
people caused by the U.N. sanctions imposed since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The plan was started on December 10, but after more than three
months no food and medicine have yet arrived in Iraq. Iraq has
blamed the United States and United Nations for the delay.
</P>
<P>
Wlosowicz said the Security Council wished for prompt delivery.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council has expressed the hope that, with further
efforts, humanitarian goods will be delivered to Iraq and
distributed on an equitable basis to all segments of Iraqi people
as soon as possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Security Council recognized that the implementation
of Resolution 986 was a complex and complicated operation, but
member states were committed to the purpose of the resolution.

BELGRADE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav federal government
today expressed deep concern over the serious situation in
Albania, saying that the chaos there would "make the regional
situation complicated".
</P>
<P>
A government communique said Yugoslavia would adopt the policy
of non-interference towards Albania's tense situation, which was
the country's internal affair.
</P>
<P>
It said the Yugoslav government hoped that the crisis in
Albania would be solved by peaceful and political means.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Defense Council of Yugoslavia decided today to
heighten the level of military alert and continue completely
sealing its borders with Albania.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia is the second of Albania's neigbors to close its
border, following Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The council said the Yugoslav army and the interior ministry
troops have so far controlled the situation on the borders and
have taken measures to ensure the security of the republic.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav federal government is particularly concerned about
the situation in Albania because 90 percent of the population in
the southern Serbian province of Kosovo are Albanians.

<HEADLINE> 284 AIDS Cases Registered in Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 13 (Xinhua) -- A total of 284 AIDS cases have
been registered in Nicaragua since the disease was first reported
in 1987, the Health Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Nicaragua continues to have the lowest rate
of AIDS cases among Central American countries, but the country
cannot rest on its laurels and needs to take measures to prevent
the disease spreading.
</P>
<P>
Honduras is the Central American country worst affected, with
6,000-8,000 terminal phase patients, the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
El Salvador is second with 1,600 AIDS cases, followed by
Guatemala with 1,300, Panama 1,186, and Costa Rica 1,012.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS problem will be discussed by Central American
parliamentarians at a meeting here on March 17-18.

WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Andreas Schifferer
won the World Cup Finals Super-G of the Alpine skiing and France's
Luc Alphand captured the season title at Vail, Colorado today.
</P>
<P>
Schifferer, who took world championship bronze in the giant

</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Schifferer squeezed ahead of another Austrian,
Josef Strobl, by finishing in one minute, 33.76 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Kristian Ghedina of Italy finished third in 1:33.88, .041 of a
second ahead of compatriot Luca Cattaneo.
</P>
<P>
Alphand won the tittle with 351 points, while Strobl settled

<P>
Andre Kjetil Aamodt of Norway, the 1994 overall winner,
finished fifth to draw closer in his challenge to Alphand. He
made up 16 points to trail Alphand by 106.

WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Katja Seizinger won
the last Super-G of the season while her compatriot Hilde Gerg
captured the women's season title at the World Cup Alpine skiing
Finals at Vail, Colorado on Thursday.

The 24-year-old Seizinger, who finished second in Wednesday's

15.73 seconds, slicing through a tricky, 34-gate course.

six-hundredths of a second ahead of Ingeborg Helen Marken of

<HEADLINE> Northwest China To Speed Up Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 14 (Xinhua) -- China's Northwest has turned vast
tracts of barren land into agricultural production bases, becoming
a major contributor to the country's grain production in the
process.
</P>
<P>
The Northwest includes the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Gansu, Qinghai, and Shaanxi
provinces. Grain output there was a record 32 billion kilograms in
1996, and it had the fastest increase in grain production in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Water is the major factor in agricultural development in
northwest China because of the dry climate. Obviously, water
conservation is always given top priority.
</P>
<P>
The area has spent about 10 billion yuan on irrigation works
over the past five years. Xinjiang and Shaanxi will put another
26.5 billion yuan into improving water facilities by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
Key water diversion or storage projects in the Northwest are
changing the imbalance in water resources, and will ensure
sustained agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
Water-saving irrigation methods such as drip irrigation are
being widely used in the Northwest. Xinjiang has put 300 million
yuan into building better canals, and Gansu, Shaanxi and Ningxia
initiated a rainfall irrigation method and built storage
facilities to catch rainwater.
</P>
<P>
Land improvement projects are tied to water conservation. More
than 330,000 ha of medium- to low-yield farmland are being
upgraded annually in the Northwest. The five regions and provinces
began to open up 13.3 million ha of arable wasteland in a regional
cooperative venture.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has become the pillar industry in the Northwest and
is playing an increasingly important part in promoting sound
economic development in China. Xinjiang is now the country's
largest cotton production base and Shaanxi ranks second in apple
output.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 14 (Xinhua) -- Ericsson, the leading Swedish
mobile telecom supplier, has launched an assembly line here to
manufacture cellular phones on a large scale, the latest issue of
People's Posts and Telecommunications has reported.
</P>
<P>
Installed in Beijing Ericsson Mobile Telecom Co. (BMC), an
Ericsson joint venture here, the CKD production line involves an
investment of more than 40 billion US dollars, and boasts a yearly
producing capacity of 300,000 handsets.
</P>
<P>
The principle product of the line will be the new GH398 mobile
phone.
</P>
<P>
So far, the annual sales of BMC have reached 1.4 billion
yuan-worth, including 260,000 mobile phones sold on the domestic
market. The mobile phone sales are expected to exceed one million
handsets this year.
</P>
<P>
Ericsson will also establish a research and development
institute here this year, in a move to speed up the joint
venture's effort to localize, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Stocks on Wall Street Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Stocks tumbled on Wall Street
today, dragging the Dow Jones industrial average toward its fourth
biggest point drop ever, as inflation fears sent interest rates
higher.
</P>
<P>
At the closing, Dow lost 160.48 points, or 2.28 percent, to
6,878.89, led by a steep selloff in Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
Most stocks were pressured at the beginning by the bond market,
where interest rates shot up amid news of surprisingly robust
retail sales during January and February.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-1 margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaled 503.74 million
shares, more than 483.22 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 14.70, or 1.8
percent, to 789.56; the NYSE composite index fell 7.67 to 415.87,
and the American Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.02 to
598.02.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell just 10.86 to 1,293.27,
cushioned by a partial rebound in some technology issues beaten
down by recent profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The active retail sales report compounded growing fears that
the Federal Reserve will soon raise interest rates to slow
economic activities as measures to control inflation.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond jumped as high as 6.98 percent, up from late Wednesday's 6.88
percent. The long-bond yield hasn't been above 7 percent since
September.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department reported this morning that retail sales
rose 0.8 percent in February, slightly higher than expected. Last
month's initial estimate of January's increase, meanwhile, was
revised sharply from 0.6 percent to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the Labor Department said new claims for
jobless benefits fell by 5,000 last week to the lowest level in
more than two years, reflecting a tightening labor market that
could force wages and consumer prices higher.
</P>
<P>
Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei stock average fell 1.6 percent,
Frankfurt's DAX index fell 1.9 percent, and London's FT-SE 100 fell
0.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Women's Speedy Access to Economic Affairs Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- There should be a
concerted, systematic, and multi-pronged approach to speed up
women's access to economic decision-making, the Commission on the
Status of Women of the U.N. was told here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The commission heard a panel discussion on the theme of "women
and the economy", during which, representatives of different
countries aired their views about the advancement of women in
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
Mihye Roh, Vice-President of the Korean Women's Development
Institute of the Republic of Korea, said anti-discrimination laws,
changes in corporate practices and introduction of teaching aids
for gender equality would go a long way in promoting such access.
</P>
<P>
Today's panel was part of a series of discussions that the
Commission is holding on four critical areas of concern of the
Platform for Action adopted by the 1995 Fourth World Conference on
Women held in Beijing. Those areas include: education and training
of women; women and the economy; women in power and
decision-making; and women and the environment.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the panel agreed that women should be present at
the starting line and should have equal access to education.
</P>
<P>
"There was no objective reason for women not to rise to the
very top as men did," said Lin Lean , of the Labor Market
Policies Branch of the International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
Gender biases led to biased recruiting, training and
promotions. Enforcement mechanisms had been weak in many
countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some representatives also said that in many countries,
legislative tools to mandate equality had already been exhausted.
Concern was also expressed at the existence of a "glass ceiling"
which prevented women's rise to the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
Some panelists spoke of the need to offer visible assignments
to women and of the need to hold managers accountable for women's
advancement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Requests Mexico to Cooperate to Avoid  Decertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives
of the United States today voted to give Mexico 90 days to
demonstrate its cooperation in the anti-drug war and avoid
decertification branded by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The 251-175 vote came on a bill that originally called for
immediate decertification -- a proposition that is losing ground
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Even if the resolution wins Senate approval, the House margin
was far short of the two-thirds required to override an expected
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
The bill retains U.S. President Bill Clinton's right to waive
sanctions against Mexico if he determines that is in the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
Clinton decided on February 28 to certify Mexico as an ally of
the United States in the battle against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The House International Relations Committee voted 27-5 to
decertify Mexico a week ago.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. Congressional members also hold that Mexico should
not be to blame on the U.S. drug problem. Senator Christopher Dodd
said that the United States accounts for only 5 percent of the
world's population, it consumes 50 percent of illegal drugs. "We
have to do a better job at home," Dodd said.
</P>
<P>
The House's intention angered Mexico. Mexican Foreign Minister
Jose Angel Gurria was reportedly saying before the House vote that
Mexico will never accept conditions for it to win approval.
</P>
<P>
He said that Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo had said
that if an internal U.S. law that affects the dignity and
sovereignty of Mexico, "the Mexican government will react at the
right moment and with the energy that the case merits."

in southern California to be visited by Chinese naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
Made up of two missile guided destroyers and an oiler, the

<P>
Rear Admiral William G. Sutton, commander of the Pearl Harbor
Naval Base, highlighted sailor-to-sailor exchange on the ships,
which he said crossed the lines of culture and languages. He

<HEADLINE> US Starts Evacuation from Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States today began
evacuating Americans from Albania with U.S. military aircraft,
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns announced.
</P>
<P>
Four Chinook 46 helicopters landed earlier today at Tirana from
the U.S. fleet in the Ionian Sea and evacuated the first 50
Americans. At least 170 were due to follow, Burns told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
"Because the situation in Albania has taken such a dramatic
turn for the worse over the last 24 hours... the United States has
decided to bring out all of our citizens and non-essential
government employees by United States military aircraft," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. military will continue the evacuation in the
next few days, bringing out all those who wish to be brought out.
There are about 2,000 American civilians living in Albania.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. will still keep some 17 State Department
officials, including Ambassador Marisa Lino, in the Embassy in
Tirana.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Burns said that a North Atlantic Council meeting is
under way in Brussels to discuss the evacuation by military means
from Albania. Italy has reportedly begun evacuating its citizens.
</P>
<P>
"So we'd like to make this a coordinated evacuation of
foreigners, civilians from Albania, over the course of the next
couple of hours," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had hoped to evacuate its citizens by commercial
flights, but the airport in Tirana was shut down Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. would help to keep the conflict in Albania
from spilling over to its neighboring countries, Burns said, "We
have to take first things first."
</P>
<P>
"The first obligation of the United States government is to
protect American government employees and American civilians and
to bring them out," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
"As of today, we see no indications that the conflict in
Albania is going to spill over into Macedonia or into other
countries, Greece or Italy, other countries that neighbor
Albania," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stressed that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) do not plan to intervene in the conflict. "I
don't believe any formal planning is under way for that."

<HEADLINE> European Shares Down on US Economic Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- All the three major stock markets
in Europe had a poor day and ended lower Thursday, with Frankfurt
suffering the heaviest losses, undermined by new US economic data
which raised fresh fears of higher US interest rates.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London closed near its day's lows after a
weak Wall Street opening added to the gloom on the market, with
the FTSE 100 index 24.8 points lower at 4,397.7, breaching the
important 4,400-point level.
</P>
<P>
Renewed caution on medium-term inflation prospects from Bank of
England governor Eddie George had made the index in negative
territory all day.
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt market, the German DAX-30 index ended the
session sharply weaker, down 65.59 points at 3,349.81, but off its
low of 3,338.53.
</P>
<P>
A wave of profit-taking, the weaker dollar and lower German
debt prices hit share prices, but experts said consolidation was
healthy for the market after about a 20 percent gain in the last
10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse also finished lower as profit takers continued
to move in after the market's earlier record performances, with
the CAC-40 index down 9.6 points at 2,632.1.

<P>
PARIS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Militants against the extreme-right
National Front (FN) party have intensified protests against the
party of Jean-Marie Le Pen, with two protests launched today in

Three people were arrested by police in the clash, during which
one policeman was slightly injured by a stone thrown by the
protesters, who also broke some shop windows, according to local
media reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The world's two leading
computer companies, Microsoft and Intel, released the NetPC
reference standards Wednesday in Germany, the Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
Intel, the biggest maker of microprocessor chips, and
Microsoft, the No. 1 PC software maker, said they developed a set
of technical standards to help more than 100 of the world's top
computer manufacturers including Compaq, Dell and Hewlett-Packard,
build NetPCs.
</P>
<P>
"NetPC product announcements from many leading PC manufacturers
are expected over the next 90 days." Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
Net PCs, including no floppy or CD-Rom drivers, will require
users to rely on remote computers for softwares. These features
may lower ownership and management costs while keeping the
performance and flexibility of traditional PCs.
</P>
<P>
The Microsoft-Intel NetPC features will include that all
hardware devices can be recognized and managed by software,
systems can be automatically configured and installed over the
network, and a sealed case prevents modifications by end users to
the hardware configuration.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the NetPC is a great business computer because it
delivers compatibility with today's standard PC and network
infrastructure with dramatically reduced management and support
costs, " said Jim Allchin, senior vice president of the personal
and business systems group at Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Also, Microsoft "expects many of the innovative NetPC features
to find their way into other PC product lines," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe
(CCZ) today said there was great need to intensify consumer education
and awareness on sustainable consumption.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to be released ahead of the commemoration of
the World Consumer Rights Day to be held on March 15, the CCZ said
sustainable consumption should result in the ability to fulfill
basic human needs without destroying the environment.
</P>
<P>
It said the rate at which the world population was growing was a
serious cause for concern because the environment was at risk with
statistics showing that one percent of the world's tropical forest
was lost every year.
</P>
<P>
More than two million deaths a year could be traced to water
scarcity and pollution and heaps of waste were getting bigger
everyday, it said.
</P>
<P>
The CCZ said huge amounts of fish had been killed in Lake Chivero
due to the uncontrolled introduction of sewage into Harare's river
system that feeds into water reservoirs, resulting in the high court
orderering the City Council to stop further discharge of sludge into
rivers. enditem

UNITED NATIONS, March 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. General Assembly
voted on Thursday to urge Israel to call of its plan to build
6,500 houses in the occupied East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution, which was approved by 130-3, the General
Assembly expressed deep concern at the decision of the government
of Israel to initiate new settlement activities in the Jebel Abu
Ghneim area in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that such settlements are "illegal and a major
obstacle to peace. Israel and the United States voted against the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which was sponsored by 42 countries, called
upon the Israeli authorities to refrain from all actions or
measures, including settlement activities, which alter the facts
on the ground, pre-empting the final status negotiations, and
have negative implication for the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
It called upon Israel, the occupying power, to abide
scrupulously by its legal obligations and responsibilities under
the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian
Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949, which is applicable to
all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967.

<HEADLINE> New Yorkers More Upbeat About their City: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 13 (Xinhua) -- New Yorkers are more upbeat
about their city than they have been in nearly a decade ago, with
their views of crime, the economy ad the future suggesting that
many have discarded the grim self-image that gripped them just
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
This scenario was given by the New York Times which conducted a
poll on March 1 through 6 in all parts of New York City. The poll
is based on telephone interviews with 1,397 adults. The margin of
the sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In one measure of how sharply attitudes have changed, half the
people surveyed said that even if they had the option to move
away, they would not leave New York. That was the highest
percentage that response to that question received in more than a
decade.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four percent of respondents said life in New York was
generally better, with 33 percent saying worse and 29 percent
saying the same. By contrast, four years ago, only 10 percent said
the state of the city was better than it had been. In this poll,
43 percent called the city safer than it was four years ago. In
1993, only 13 percent said they thought the city was safe. The
poll indicates that 59 percent described the city economy as good,
compared with 32 percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Still, New Yorkers have reservations about the city. They are
increasingly worried about the state of school, with one in five
voters saying that education should be the top priority of the
next government. One in four voters said that crime should be the
next Mayor's top priority.
</P>
<P>
The poll presented two areas that most accounted for New
Yorkers' improved feelings about the city are crime and the
economy. In terms of economy, 59 percent of New Yorkers now rate
it as good. And in another sign of a favorable mood about New
York, the percentage of New Yorkers who reported that they or a
member of their family had been a victim of a crime over the last
year fell from 27 percent in 1993 to 17 percent now.
