<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Southwest Sports Group on Wednesday announced
a 10-year deal giving Fox Sports Net the non-cable broadcast rights
to the Texas Rangers and Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Southwest Sports Group, which owns both teams,
and Fox would not disclose the value of the deal. Southwest Sports
Group president and chief operating officer Mike Cramer called the
deal ``substantial'' and said it was of ``slightly less value''
than the 15-year deal for the cable rights to Southwest's sports
holdings, which also include the Mesquite Championship Rodeo.
Southwest Sports chairman Tom Hicks sold the cable rights to Fox
Sports Net for $300 million in September, a source familiar with
the agreement said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The non-cable deal is worth $200 million, Dallas station KDFW
reported last night.
</P>
<P>
   The deal goes into effect immediately for the 2000 Rangers
season. KDFI will broadcast 61 Rangers games starting with the
March 31 exhibition game against the St. Louis Cardinals. KDFW will
broadcast six games and Fort Worth station KXAS will broadcast five
games as part of an existing contract that expires this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' broadcasts will start next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very pleased to match cable games with the
over-the-air games,'' Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal took nearly four months to hammer out and was delayed
by Major League Baseball's attempts to develop rules for
broadcasting over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball came out with a draft set of rules,''
Cramer said. ``But we're not done yet in terms of dealing with
Major League Baseball. But we're starting down the path, waiting
for MLB's final set of rules.'' nn

NETS' DEFENSE CAN'T KEEP UP WITH HORNETS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ If the New Jersey Nets were not engaged in a
daily battle for the eighth and final playoff spot in the NBA's
Eastern Conference, it might be easy to write off Wednesday night's
lackluster defensive effort against the Charlotte Hornets as
typical of a team impatient for the season to wind down.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, however, with just 15 games remaining, the 119-103
loss inflicted on New Jersey by Charlotte cannot be easily excused
or forgotten. It dropped the Nets three games behind Orlando, which
holds the last playoff spot and has 13 games to go.
</P>
<P>
   There was frustration all around over allowing the Hornets to
shoot 56 percent from the field and score a season-high 119 points.
Worse than blowing an opportunity to keep pace with the Magic, the
Nets also might have lost some momentum, for the Hornets entered
the game on a three-game losing streak, while the Nets were fresh
off of an energizing win over the Toronto Raptors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the heroes of that victory was Kendall Gill, whose
offense _ a game-high 24 points _ and defense on the Raptors'
superstar Vince Carter were a major part of the Net's fifth victory
in six attempts. But against the Hornets, Gill was one of the
primary reasons the Hornets gained early control of the game and
never handed it back.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gill's inability to match up with Anthony Mason became apparent
from the outset, particularly to the Hornets' coach Paul Silas.
Although he scored New Jersey's first eight points, Gill, who gave
up more than 50 pounds to Mason, could not stop the former Knicks
forward, who hit on four of his five first half shots.
</P>
<P>
   All the Nets could do was double-team Mason to prevent easy
layups, which allowed him to set up David Wesley and Eddie Jones
for wide-open shots from the perimeter. Wesley and Jones hit eight
of their nine first-half shots and Mason had five assists in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Mason finished with 17 points, but that only tells part of the
story. His seven assists _ incredibly, the Hornets' 46 field goals
came on 37 assists _ and game-high seven rebounds were enough to
send the Nets searching again, if not for excuses, then for the
momentum that will propel them past the Orlando Magic, whose
victory on this night puts the Nets three behind with 15 to play. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Hornets had failed to score 100 points in 11 of their last
14 games, but they reached it Wednesday night less than two minutes
into the fourth quarter. Jones led the way with 26 points, and
Derrick Coleman and Wesley added 22 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury paced New Jersey with 23 points, while Gill and
Keith Van Horn had 17 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really did a good job handling our double teams,'' said
Nets coach Don Casey. ``They spaced out well and located their
people. We seemed exasperated after we made runs. Charlotte was
very sharp. Coleman and Mason did a good job of posting up our guys
and that opened up their outside game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gill sought help from his teammates, but it was largely
ineffective. ``It was hard, at first, to figure out what they were
doing,'' he said. ``When I'm guarding someone 6-8, 280 pounds, I'm
going to need help.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only Van Horn kept the Nets within striking distance. He
connected on 6 of 7 from the floor and 2 of 2 from the free throw
line for 15 first-half points, one of only two Nets to reach double
figures at the break. The Hornets had Wesley, Jones, Mason and
Coleman in double figures by halftime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nets cut the lead to four points on several occasions in the
second quarter. A last gasp attempt to stay close came with 1:53
remaining before intermission on a Van Horn driving dunk. But a
Coleman layup off of yet another Mason assist pushed the Hornets to
a nine-point halftime lead, buoyed by 24 of 38 shooting from the
field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marbury came alive in the third quarter, scoring nine points in
the first 4 1-2 minutes, including a tip-in off his missed shot
that cut the Hornets' lead to 73-65 at the 7:29 mark. But poor
defensive rotation on a Coleman drive into the lane ended in a
dunk, and a steal and basket by Wesley quickly countered the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   An inside basket by Jones and an uncontested Mason dunk in quick
succession put the Hornets in command, 81-65, at the 5:44 mark of
the third quarter and forced Casey to call a timeout, searching for
answers that did not come.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nets did not say back-to-back road games or a 3:00 a.m.
arrival in Charlotte were factors in the final score. ``That kind
of thing happens to every team,'' said Marbury. ``Offensively, we
really couldn't get into anything because our defense wouldn't
allow us. We didn't take advantage of our opportunities. We lost
because we didn't execute on defense.'' &QL;

THIS IS EQUAL OPPORTUNITY, NASCAR-STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having failed to qualify for three of four NASCAR Busch Grand
National Series races this season, Tony Roper has more things on
his plate than the profile of his team owners.
</P>
<P>
   They include two athletes _ Joe Washington and Julius Erving _
who are retired superstars in professional football and basketball,
respectively, and successful post-jock businessmen. Together with
partners Fields Jackson Jr. and Asa Murray, Washington Erving
Motorsports is the first full-time, minority-owned team competing
in NASCAR since the late Wendell Scott ran as an independent more
than 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's fastest-growing spectator sport, NASCAR racing
takes a public relations hit every now and then over the fact that
despite its ``open garage door'' policy, it has failed to attract
comparative numbers of minority fans, owners and crewmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know why there isn't an influx of minorities
into NASCAR racing,'' said Roper, a second-generation driver who is
in his first year with Washington Erving. But you know that ``level
playing field'' NASCAR officials always are striving to maintain on
the racetrack? The principle extends into the garage area and the
front office, meaning each team joining the series has an equal
opportunity to succeed _ or fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we've missed the last three races,'' said Roper, who
tested at Texas Motor Speedway on Monday in anticipation of the
Albertson's 300 in Fort Worth on April 1. ``Our intention was to
build some brand new race cars for the start of the season, go
testing and add some personnel. To be honest, it never happened,
and we've found ourselves flat in a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   That rates as status quo for this team, which along with primary
sponsor Dr Pepper of Plano, was introduced during the NASCAR
weekend at TMS in the spring of 1998. That start-up group went
through a revolving door lineup of 10 drivers. In fact, Washington
Erving's highlight to date has been a modest 10th-place finish by
Mark Green at Atlanta Motor Speedway in March, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I see is there's been not much continuity
here,'' said Roper, who put the No. 50 Chevrolet Monte Carlo on the
starting grid at North Carolina Speedway last month, but wasn't
fast enough at Daytona, Atlanta or Darlington. ``Our crew chief,
Darrell Bryant, told Joe after the Darlington race that this was
his third year with the team, and he'd never started with the same
engine program, the same body style, the same driver or with the
same crew members in any year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their goal is to have two Busch teams, and eventually a
Winston Cup team. But I think they realize now just how hard it is
to compete on this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Roper, who notched three top-10 finishes and a career-best
eighth in 16 starts as a rookie last year, said the race of his
owners was not a factor when he approached Washington about
replacing Green. A 35-year-old native of Missouri, Roper said he
and Washington have become fast friends during all that forced
down-time at the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe will tell you he started not at zero, but well below zero,
in racing,'' said Roper, speaking of the Port Arthur native and NFL
Pro Bowl running back. ``Every time he comes to the racetrack, I'm
amazed at some of the questions he asks _ simple questions, Racing
101 _ that he doesn't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   And Erving, signature player of the American Basketball
Association, and otherwise immortalized as ``Dr. J?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met him,'' Roper said of the Hall of Famer who
fashioned the dunk into an art form during the mid-1970s. ``But
when I was younger, he was one of my basketball heroes. Julius is
an owner, but he's awful busy with his job (executive vice
president) with the Orlando Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Roper said his crew includes two minority members, Kenneth
``Lighting'' Scott, the truck driver and gas man, and David Cropps,
the catch-can man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see black drivers, more black crewmen
and more black owners in this sport,'' Roper said. ``And I don't
think that NASCAR or any of the owners that are involved now or
have been involved forever ... are going to act any different
toward them than they would anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's garage doors are wide open. And that means Washington
Erving will have an equal opportunity to succeed _ or fail.
SPOTLIGHT ON: ANDRETTI IS SURVEY'S CHOICE TO WIN CART CROWN
</P>
<P>
   CART's team managers secretly might admire multiple-car owner
Chip Ganassi's bravado in switching from the Honda/Reynard to the
Toyota/Lola package in a bid for a fifth consecutive FedEx Series
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But practically speaking, the men who run the race-day
operations of the Championship Auto Racing Teams like Michael
Andretti as the driver to beat in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   CART's winningest active driver with 38 victories, Andretti
emerged as the favorite among 15 team managers who participated in
a survey for the official ``Champ Car FedEx Series Guide.'' The
20-race season is scheduled to begin Sunday at Homestead-Miami
Speedway, where Andretti is a proven commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti won the season-opening Marlboro Grand Prix of Miami in
1997 and 1998, and finished second on the 1.5-mile oval last year.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, 37, finished fourth in points in 1999 for Newman-Haas
Racing, and is locked in on his 17th CART season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience is a wonderful thing, for sure,'' said Andretti,
whose team has switched from the Swift to Lola chassis with power
supplied by the new Ford-Cosworth XF V-8. ``I feel that if I lack
anything of speed ... from the youth side, I can make it up in
experience. I'm hoping I can be a little more patient and wait for
things to come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Each team manager was asked to nominate, in order from one
through 10, the drivers he believed will fill the top 10 points
positions at season's end. Ten drivers received nominations. But
only Andretti and CART newcomer Kenny Brack, the former Indy Racing
League and reigning Indianapolis 500 champion, were selected as
eventual series champion on more than one ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti, the 1991 series champion, finished ahead of Max Papis
(Team Rahal) and Dario Franchitti (Team Kool Green), with reigning
series champion Juan Montoya (Target/Chip Ganassi Racing) sliding
to fourth. The remainder of the top 10 included Christian
Fittipaldi (Newman-Haas), Paul Tracy (Team Kool Green), Brack (Team
Rahal), Adrian Fernandez (Patrick Racing), Gil de Ferran (Marlboro
Team Penske) and Jimmy Vasser (Target/Chip Ganassi).
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the elements have come together for the start of a
great season,'' said Andretti, who has 32 poles and became the
first series driver to lead 6,000 laps in his career last season.
``We always set our goals high during the off-season, but our
testing has given us a good level of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like there is more pressure to do well since we
won two of the last three races (at Homestead), and have had some
good luck at Homestead. I love racing on the track. It suits my
style. It would be nice to finish in second place or above ...
preferably above second place. I'm ready to go racing.''
PIT STOPS SRO TICKETS READIED
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Texas Motor Speedway are anticipating that all
seats will be sold for the NASCAR Winston Cup DirecTV 500 on April
2.
</P>
<P>
   Cup tickets are available at $60, $65 and $70. But no fan
wishing to attend the race will be turned away. Fans showing up on
race day without a secured seat can purchase a standing-room-only
infield ticket for $60, said Sarona Winfrey, TMS' director of
public relations. Those tickets will be available at either of the
two tunnel entrances, Gate 8 or Gate 12, allowing fans immediate
walk-in access to the infield. BUSCH TICKETS AVAILABLE
</P>
<P>
   A number of Cup regulars are scheduled to double-up at TMS,
beginning their racing weekends in the NASCAR Busch Grand National
Albertson's 300 on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative list of drivers running in both events is topped
by Mark Martin, two-time winner of the BGN race here and 1998
winner of the Cup event around the 1.5-mile quadoval. Martin, the
BGN series' all-time winner with 43, has won three of four Busch
events he has entered in his final season on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Others planning double duty at TMS are BGN points-leader Matt
Kenseth, former TMS Cup race winners Jeff Burton and Terry Labonte,
Jeff Gordon, Ward Burton, Michael Waltrip, Kenny Wallace, Steve
Park, Joe Nemechek, Kevin Lepage, Mike Skinner and Kenny Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway officials are planning to confine seating for the BGN
race to the 120,000-seat frontstretch grandstands, unless demand
dictates otherwise. Frontstretch tickets are on sale from $31 to
$62. BODINE RECUPERATING
</P>
<P>
   Former Daytona 500 champion Geoffrey Bodine is recuperating in
North Carolina from the injuries he suffered in a fiery crash
during the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series season-opener at the
Daytona International Speedway on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's home and now it's just time,'' said Todd Bodine,
Geoffery's youngest brother. ``He still gets tired real easy. His
back and his wrist have to heal, and it's just time. Hopefully, it
won't be a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine, who turns 51 on April 18, suffered a concussion,
fractured back and fractured right wrist in a violent wreck down
the frontstretch that involved 13 trucks. Todd Bodine said his
brother's back specialist told him a return to the Winston Cup
Series as driver of the No. 60 Power Team Chevrolet Monte Carlo is
possible in mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be back some time this year,'' Todd Bodine said, ``for
sure.'' JOHNSON REACHES 80
</P>
<P>
   Warren Johnson scored his 80th career Pro Stock victory during
the Mac Tools Gatornationals on Sunday, placing him within striking
distance of the National Hot Rod Association's hallowed all-time
victory record.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Pro Stock champion Bob Glidden holds the record with 85
victories. Johnson, driver of the GM Goodwrench Service Plus
Pontiac Firebird, has won at least five national events during
seven of the past nine seasons. The five-time and reigning class
champion ``slipped'' to four victories in 1994 and 1997. THE LAST
WORD
</P>
<P>
   ``This hasn't been the way we wanted to start the season. We've
run like junk. But we've got nobody to blame but ourselves.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A nightmare season for ``The Dream'' only got worse Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, who has missed 23 games this
season, was informed by team doctors that he will be out for two to
three weeks because of recurring respiratory problems. With the
Rockets' last game in just 27 days, Olajuwon may be finished for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon skipped Wednesday's practice to visit team doctors for
a follow-up on his respiratory status after struggling through 16
minutes of action in Monday's 98-85 loss in Cleveland. He had
missed a Feb. 28 game against the Los Angeles Clippers _ tonight's
opponent _ because of a reactive airway disease that restricts the
flow of air through his bronchial passages during strenuous
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can tell, he still has some problems when he's playing,
so we've asked him to take some time off,'' said Dr. James Muntz, a
team physician for the Rockets. ``This is just a continuation of
the same symptoms. He's still having trouble with exertion and
exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 games remain in the season, with the finale against
Vancouver at Compaq Center on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization, (owner) Mr. (Les) Alexander, (coach) Rudy
(Tomjanovich), (trainer) Keith Jones everybody's interested in
Hakeem in the long run and not so much this season or the next
couple of weeks,'' Muntz said. ``The important thing is his health
and how he is off the court, and everybody's just going to make
sure that he's going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Muntz made clear was that the disease is not
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people participate in sports with asthma or exercise
(induced) asthma and do fairly well in general, so I don't think
it's dangerous,'' Muntz said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, who expressed concern for Olajuwon after practice,
was pleased that doctors ruled out anything serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relieved that he's in a safe situation because I don't
want to see anything happen to him,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, who earlier this season missed 22 games after having
hernia surgery, played 26 minutes Sunday in Toronto before his
setback Monday. In his last seven games, Olajuwon made just 17 of
48 shots and averaged 6.1 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The diagnosis) definitely isn't a surprise, because he's been
struggling with this,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He's had moments where
he looked like he was recovering and making strides, and then in
that last game at the first timeout he just couldn't catch his
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point I started thinking, `Just for his welfare are we
doing the right thing by having this guy out there?' Because he's
been through so many different ailments. Hakeem has been such a
trouper and warrior, but it just hit me as concern for him as a
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a situation where we're not going for a championship,
but if we were, I don't think I could with a clear conscience say,
`Boy, this is the right thing to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Olajuwon has already announced that the 2000-01
season would be his last, but Muntz wouldn't speculate on whether
that would be jeopardized by this ailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really hard to answer right now,'' Muntz said. ``What
we'd like to do is have him just take off and see if we can get him
feeling better. He had some side effects from his previous
medicine, so we want to try some things out and see how he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, who has suffered from anemia and in 1997 was diagnosed
with atrial fibrillation, stopped taking his prescribed medication
because it caused nausea. Muntz will now consult with Dr. Scott
Lloyd, a pulmonary specialist, before determining what steps to
take next.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Olajuwon) is interested in seeing what else we can do to try
to get him feeling better,'' Muntz said. ``I think it will be
better for us to have some time with him over the next few weeks to
see how he responds (to any new medicine) without the stress of
playing.''

   The one thing doctors still can't pinpoint is what specifically
is causing Olajuwon's breathing problems.

<P>
   ``It could be from any number of things,'' Muntz said. ``People
can get an upper-respiratory infection and develop a reactive
airway disease from that, or from environment, pollution and
aspirin-type medications. It's not because he's at a certain age or
point in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't playing ball right now, he wouldn't even know he
has this. If he was walking around and working for the bank or a
news station, he wouldn't be short of breath, but if he's doing
elite-level basketball, he becomes uncomfortable after running up
and down the court two or three times.''

   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ If Tom Izzo and his players are right,
their run to the Final Four last year carries little relevance now.
It's all about what Michigan State accomplishes the rest of this
NCAA Tournament, starting tonight with Syracuse in the Midwest
Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten Conference champions, 28-7 and the No. 1 seed in the
region, meet fourth-seeded Syracuse (26-5) at 6:55 p.m., followed
by second-seeded Iowa State (31-4) and sixth-seeded UCLA (21-11).
The winners are matched Saturday for a berth in the Final Four next
week at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo, in his fifth year as the Spartans' head coach after first
pleading for a job as a part-time Michigan State assistant for
three years, always runs scared. Perhaps his is the nature of most
coaches at a high-profile program, one that has surpassed Michigan
as the state's best.
</P>
<P>
   After a conference-opening loss to Wisconsin a year ago, the
Spartans won 15 straight Big Ten games and four consecutive NCAA
Tournament games before losing to Duke in the national semifinals
to end a 33-5 season. The experience and adversity of that season
do mean a lot, the Spartans agree, but it doesn't make reaching
heightened expectations any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of feel lucky to survive,'' Izzo said.
</P>
<P>
   Izzo's goal, of course, is to prevent a possible Palace uprising
by the Orangemen, who exceeded preseason expectations, then dipped
below more current ones after a 19-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to the Final Four (last year) is one more step,'' Izzo
said. ``It's a major advantage, knowing you lose and you go home.
No more games after that. Have your bad day and you're not
advancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzo repeats his own feeling, one shared by many in his
profession, that the battle to reach the top is actually only half
the battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to deal with the pressure of success than the
pressure of failure,'' he said. ``I've been on both sides, and
that's what I have learned through the years. It's been such a
whirlwind, so many things to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Jud Heathcote, the Spartans' former head coach and Izzo's former
boss, had much the same demeanor that he now watches from afar in
Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Tom loses a game,'' Heathcote said, ``he doesn't think he
will ever win another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State point guard Mateen Cleaves delivers much of the
same message in a somewhat different form. His advice to younger
teammates? ``Turn off the TV and don't read the papers and don't
watch your face on TV and stay humble.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves believes figuring out that Tournament learning curve can
only happen through experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, it's an advantage,'' he said, ``We've been here
before and it's not overwhelming. We're used to the media, the
police escorts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' preseason fractured foot should have cured the Spartans
of any inflated notions, even though they were 8-4 in those 12
games. There were losses to nationally ranked Texas in Puerto Rico
and at Arizona and Kentucky before a stunning 53-49 defeat at
Wright State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was begging coach to put me in the game so I could take some
shots,'' Cleaves said.
</P>
<P>
   After that stretch, even though Cleaves struggled with his
shooting (43 percent from the field), the Spartans went on to win
their third straight Big Ten regular-season championship and second
straight conference tournament title.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question who played the biggest role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mateen never takes days off,'' said Izzo. ``When that guy
leaves I'm going to find out if I can really coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, the Big Ten's all-time assists leader, and Jason Hart,
his counterpart at Syracuse, will be one of the game's most
interesting sidelights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't come down to a one-on-one,'' said Hart, who averages
6.4 assists to Cleaves' 7.5. ``The battle will be respected by
whichever can lead his team to a win. Nobody is going to back
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves, who has 165 assists to 81 turnovers, said of Hart, ``We
both run our team. He does a great job of getting guys open,
getting them easier shots, and he's great in transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Spartans could play in the Sweet 16 about 75 miles
from their campus, they had to overcome a six-point, second-half
deficit against Utah last week. Cleaves made three 3-pointers
during a 27-7 rally that gave Michigan State control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to stay calm and keep plugging away,'' said
Cleaves. ``That's the kind of team we are.''

WOODS' DOMINATION HAS FOES WAVING WHITE FLAG, MONTGOMERIE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Gentlemen, start your white flags.
</P>
<P>
   A surrender mentality is gripping the PGA Tour whenever Tiger
Woods' name surfaces on the leader board, say competitors who will
tee off in today's opening round of The Players Championship. Colin
Montgomerie, the European Tour's leading money winner the past
seven seasons, said he sensed it last week after the opening round
of the Bay Hill Classic, when Woods shot a 69 to emerge one stroke
off the pace with 54 holes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 24, went on to win by four strokes, capturing his seventh
title in his past 10 tour events. Woods has placed second twice and
has not finished below 18th during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   If Woods starts quickly today at the TPC at Sawgrass,
Montgomerie said peers likely will retreat into their shells once
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first round last week, when Tiger shot 69 on a windy
day, I think the view in the locker room, without saying it aloud,
was the tournament was finished. It was a matter of, `Who is going
to finish second?,' '' said Montgomerie, 36. ``It shall be very
interesting \Rtoday\S to find out what he is doing. ... The first
round is very important, especially when everyone is watching one
particular score. This is all very new, this complete dominance by
one player. We have never had someone as dominant as Tiger. Not in
my career, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt defeated one round into the Bay Hill event,
Montgomerie said: ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods joined other players yesterday in expressing surprise
about Montgomerie's candid comments. Hal Sutton said Montgomerie
must have been ``going in a different locker room than I was going
in'' last week in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either that, or he wasn't close to my locker,'' said Sutton,
the No. 14 player on the season money list.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested Montgomerie might be closer to the truth in his
assessment of Woods than most peers would prefer to admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty evident right now that if he is playing well
starting the week, that he is going to be ... the guy to beat,''
Jim Furyk said. ``No one has dominated the way he has in a long
time. Maybe \RJack\S Nicklaus.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis Love III, the player Woods defeated in Sunday's final
round, conceded that frustrations are mounting as Woods' hot streak
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody starts beating you, you start to think, `Can I beat
him?,' '' Love said. ``And he's beating the whole tour, so I'm not
the only one. He thrives on that. ... He's driving this tour right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie said players who deny feelings of inadequacy when
compared to Woods, at this stage, ``are kidding you ... and they
are kidding themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie said Woods ``seems to'' have an ability to reach a
higher gear in crunch time that peers can't touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to have everything. There is no weakness,''
Montgomerie said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he appreciated Montgomerie's kudos, but did not
understand the sentiment about feeling out of a tournament after 18
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That surprises me, because there's three rounds left,'' Woods
said. ``I guess others can get intimidated. I don't know if I'd
ever feel that way.'' \Nsubheds:Sutton eyes Colonial return Hal
Sutton, a member of the 1999 U.S. Ryder Cup team who last competed
at the MasterCard Colonial in 1994, said yesterday there is ``a
darn good chance'' he'll return to Fort Worth this season. The past
two years, Sutton has used that week to go on a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get back to Fort Worth. Nothing is definite, but
I'm leaning that way,'' said Sutton, who has yet to make an
official commitment to the event. \Nsubheds:Finchem to review
policy PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem said yesterday he would
review the tour's policy on granting releases for players to
compete in European Tour events ``within the next two or three
weeks, to see if there's a problem'' in relation to Colonial week
(May 18-21).
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, tour players Tiger Woods, Nick Price, Jesper Parnevik
and Sergio Garcia have committed to compete in the Deutsche
Bank-SAP Open, a European event in Hamburg, Germany, with the same
playing dates as Colonial. Of that group, Parnevik and Garcia are
Europeans who compete on both tours. Woods is the defending
champion. In 1999, five high-profile players accepted six-figure
appearance fees to compete in the German event in lieu of Colonial,
causing Finchem to say he would consider limiting releases in
future years.
</P>
<P>
   As of yesterday, Finchem said: ``I haven't specifically looked
at \RColonial\S week at this point.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly Tim Finchem
said no decision will be made until summer, at the earliest, on
whether the PGA Tour will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme
Court in the right-to-ride lawsuit involving disabled golfer Casey
Martin. Martin, 27, is permitted to use a golf cart during
competition under the Americans With Disabilities Act. If the tour
appeals, Finchem said, ``the odds are against it being heard,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions are ongoing about moving The Players Championship to
a May date, beginning next season. For the past decade, Finchem
said the subject has surfaced every time television agreements come
up for renewal, but the event has yet to shift from its March
window and might remain there. The existing TV agreements will be
renewed in the fall, but Finchem said he ``would not speculate'' on
the possibility of the TPC shifting dates.

 TEACHER UNION, DAVIS SPLIT ON PUPIL SPENDING  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A week before debate on Gov. Gray Davis' education
plan begins in earnest, the head of California's largest teachers
union said Wednesday there is a growing rift with the governor over
education policy.
</P>
<P>
   The split is one reason the California Teachers Association is
moving ahead with a November ballot measure that would raise the
state's per pupil spending to the national average, a proposal the
governor is against.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a debate I think California needs to have,'' Wayne
Johnson, president of the 300,000-member teachers association, said
in an interview. ``Do we want quality education, and are we willing
to pay for it at at least the national average. (Davis') philosophy
is that he wants above-average test scores with below-average
funding.''
</P>
<P>
   California spends $6,045 per pupil, a number Davis has proposed
raising to $6,313. The national average was $7,583 in the 1999-2000
school year.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between Davis and the politically powerful union
_ which holds great sway in the Democratic Legislature _ may signal
rough roads ahead for Davis' major education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a serious lack of communication between the governor
and the education community,'' said Johnson, who met with Davis for
two hours last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Davis is sponsoring legislation that includes
creating merit scholarships, providing advance placement classes in
all schools and recruiting more teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a time when the state is expected to draw at least $4.2
billion more into its coffers than originally expected, Davis drew
pleas last week from school administrators who are looking for more
money with fewer strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the legislative process will bring some
resolution to some differences,'' Johnson said. ``We will be a lot
stronger in our opposition than last time around.''
</P>
<P>
   San Rafael Democrat Kerry Mazzoni, chair of the Assembly
Education Committee said Davis' education proposals are ``as
controversial if not more controversial'' than last year's.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bustamante, Davis' spokesman, said he does not
understand how anyone can disagree with increased student
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor intends to build on last year's
accomplishments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the latest breakdown came over Davis' failure to
come through on pledged support for Proposition 26, an attempt to
lower the voting threshold for school bonds from a two-thirds
majority to a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't help at all for 26,'' Johnson said. ``He tries to
say we didn't ask, but we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he asked Davis personally to help, suggesting a
mention in the State of the State address. ``We waited,'' Johnson
said. ``When he didn't mention it in the State of the State, we
decided he didn't want to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Bustamante said no propositions were granted mention in the
State of the State but said the governor did follow through on
support for the school bond initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were able to outspend the opposition 23 to 1, there is
not any reason they should lose,'' Bustamante said. ``To not
include the governor and then turn around and try to find a
scapegoat for their loss is rather poor form.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Davis told him that he would support a new
initiative only if the vote threshold was set at 60 percent and if
his people would be in charge of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said CTA and other Proposition 26 supporters have not
decided if they want to move ahead with a new campaign, or if they
are willing to accept Davis' demands.
</P>
<P>
   The CTA has not yet taken a position on Davis' latest education
reforms, Johnson said, adding that they did not come up at last
week's meeting. But the CTA is not going to be as willing to
cooperate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his education reform package last year, we thought some of
those ideas were not very good,'' he said. ``And on other ideas he
put forth, he didn't put forward enough money to make them work.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose group has supported Davis from the beginning,
said the group tried to get along with the governor despite
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting a significantly different relationship,'' he
said.

 WORST WATER IN THE WORLD FOUND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA MINE  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDDING, Calif. _ In an odd chemical fluke that has astonished
scientists, the world's most acidic water has been found deep
inside the polluted remnants of an abandoned mine just west of this
Shasta County city.
</P>
<P>
   Already ranked among the worst pollution sites in the country,
the vast underground web of mining operations at Iron Mountain, a
federal Superfund cleanup site, now has a dubious new claim to
fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the world's worst water,'' said Charles Alpers, a
research chemist at the U.S. Geological Survey who has been
sampling Iron Mountain runoff since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other scientists insisted that the water posed no
threat to human health because it is found in tiny quantities, is
safely diluted and scrubbed clean before it reaches the tributaries
of the Sacramento River downstream, the main source of drinking
water for Redding.
</P>
<P>
   The acidic water, they say, is more a scientific curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Alpers and colleagues at the Geological Survey and the
University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada, first discovered the
rare ``metal-acid'' superwater in field trips in 1990 and 1991. It
took them until now to devise proper tests to figure out just what
they had _ and to get other scientists to believe their results.
</P>
<P>
   The Iron Mountain water was so contaminated with runoff from
abandoned sulfur mines and other extractive industries that
conventional chemical measures no longer worked.
</P>
<P>
   The standard gauge of acidity known as pH, for example,
ordinarily runs from 0 to 14, where zero is considered the
strongest acid, 7 is neutral and 14 is the strongest base.
</P>
<P>
   At Iron Mountain, a sophisticated series of chemical tests
showed some drip-water samples had pH values well below zero _
literally off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little hard for me to fathom at first,'' said Rick
Sugarek, manager of the Iron Mountain cleanup for the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency. ``You have to go to some very
extreme conditions for anything like this to be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The most acidic water sample of all _ and the current
record-holder for an acid found outside a laboratory in a natural
setting _ tested at a negative 3.6 pH.
</P>
<P>
   It came from what the scientists described as a truly hellish
underground world that Dante could scarcely have imagined,
</P>
<P>
   Mining of sulfide ore was conducted at Iron Mountain from the
1860s until the 1960s. The ore was used to make sulfur for Bay Area
oil refineries and to make fertilizer. Copper and precious metals
also were mined intermittently.
</P>
<P>
   Now the abandoned mine consists of gigantic human-carved
chambers with ceilings up to 20 stories high, studded with exotic
blue-green mineral formations. Crumbling rock walls drip with acids
stronger than those found in a car battery.
</P>
<P>
   Air temperatures in the buried mine pit where the worst water
bubbled forth were heated to above 120 degrees Fahrenheit by the
chemical reactions of sulfates encountering water and oxygen.
Random rock falls were a constant worry.
</P>
<P>
   Alpers and his colleagues recently published their findings in
the journal Environmental Science and Technology. An earlier
version of the report was rejected by another leading scientific
journal, whose editors ``could not believe our results,'' Alpers
said.
</P>
<P>
   He and toxic-cleanup managers for the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency led a tour of the Iron Mountain cleanup site for
reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insisted that the cleanup efforts, which have been
under way since 1994, have made a dramatic dent in the Iron
Mountain runoff problem, which they said has been almost completely
contained.
</P>
<P>
   Already, about 80 percent of the dissolved metals such as zinc,
copper and cadmium, which otherwise would be gushing out in the
spring runoff and into tributaries of the Sacramento River, are
being diverted into eight or nine miles of specially lined
acid-resistant pipes, costing $1 million a mile, equipped with
automatic sensors to detect leaks.
</P>
<P>
   The pipes deliver the hellish water, in which nothing but a few
rare acid-loving microbes can live, into settling tanks, chemical
vats and a big high-density sludge-making plant.
</P>
<P>
   Before the effluent is finally released into the river, all the
acids are neutralized with several truckloads of hydrated lime
delivered daily. The reddish-brown sludge, nearly solid, is hauled
up to a plastic double-lined pit left over from the mining
operations. The pit, now 150 feet deep, still has enough room for a
couple hundred more years of waste containment.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first studies of the pollution problem began in early
1980s, the cleanup has cost $210 million, including $65 million
from the EPA and $145 million from the chemical company Rhone
Poulenc, corporate successor of the big mine operators.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA and its contractors now are expanding the effort with a
dam and other new facilities on a stream called Slickrock Creek,
planned to be ready for operation next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Slickrock runoff accounts for about two-thirds of all the
remaining pollution coming off the mountain. Once the new
facilities are operating next year, about 95 percent of Iron
Mountain's pollution problem will have been essentially solved,
Sugarek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a success story,'' he proclaimed, even if it was hard
to tell from the huge eroded mounds of arsenic-laced gold-mining
refuse just in front of where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the acidic Iron Mountain drain water, which can
carry far higher concentrations of metals than ordinary water, pose
no direct threat to human health even though Redding draws its
drinking water from the Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Metals such as copper and zinc are considered nutrients for
humans, but they can be deadly toxics for fish, clogging their
gills. Horrific fish kills, with hundreds of thousands of dead fish
floating to shore, had once been a routine occurence downhill from
Iron Mountain. But no significant die-offs have been noted since
the Superfund cleanup got under way, Sugarek said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's press tour of Iron Mountain stopped just outside the
portal of Richmond Mine, inside which the ``hottest'' acids were
found. Cleanup managers said safety rules required a week's
training before any civilians could be let in for a glimpse.

 FEINSTEIN'S BILL TAKES AIM AT `SOFT MONEY'  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days after Arizona Sen. John McCain returned to
Washington from his failed quest for the GOP presidential
nomination, Sen. Dianne Feinstein picked up his mantle of campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The California Democrat, who is making her own re-election bid
this year against South Bay Rep. Tom Campbell, introduced
legislation Wednesday that would raise individual campaign
contribution limits from $1,000 to $3,000, in return for banning
the use of ``soft money'' now used by parties in unlimited amounts.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also would impose disclosure requirements on the
so-called ``issue advocacy'' advertising during campaigns by
outside interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she wants to ``break the gridlock'' on campaign
finance reform because the odds of passing McCain's original bill,
co-sponsored by Wisconsin Democrat Russ Feingold, are virtually
nil.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill would not raise the individual
contribution limit, but would ban soft money and codify
restrictions on using union dues for political campaigns without
the consent of union members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have voted for versions of the McCain-Feingold campaign
finance reform legislation at least six times in the past four
years, and I continue to support passage of that bill,'' Feinstein
told the Senate. ``I am concerned, however, that this legislation
might not come up for a vote again in this Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he had ``nothing but support'' for Feinstein's
move. Campbell himself helped lead a renegade group of moderate
House Republicans who twice secured House passage of an even
tougher bill than Feinstein now proposes.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's increase in the individual contribution limit _
something she has not advocated in the past _ is designed to entice
support from some Republicans who succeeded in killing the
McCain-Feingold measure on the ground that it would
unconstitutionally limit free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The huge amounts of time that federal elected officials spend
``dialing for dollars'' are often blamed on the $1,000 limit,
because it forces candidates to raise relatively small sums from
vast numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said that in the 29 years since the limit was
established, inflation has shrunk the value of $1,000 to just $328.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the small contributions to an individual's campaign,
I think, that Americans view as corrupting,'' Feinstein said.
``It's the large checks of $100,000, $250,000 and $1 million or
more to parties that create this appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fred Wertheimer, former president of Common Cause, a leading
advocacy group for campaign finance reform, who now leads a similar
group called Democracy 21, suggested that Feinstein's bill only
muddies the waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain-Feingold is the reform bill that people should be
fighting to enact,'' Wertheimer said, since the two senators ``have
already identified themselves as leaders on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether raising the individual contribution limit will be enough
to break down GOP opposition to the total ban on ``soft money''
that Feinstein adopts from the original McCain-Feingold plan
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soft money'' consists of funds raised outside federal
contribution limits _ mainly from corporations, labor unions and
wealthy individuals _ for the purpose of ``party-building''
activities such as voter registration drives, but which are now
seen as a big loophole in campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties increasingly have turned to soft money to finance
elections; the money is often raised and indirectly controlled by
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore raised large
amounts of soft money in their 1996 re-election bid, nearly
bringing on an independent counsel investigation. Gore, now running
for the Democratic nomination, has since called his 1996
fund-raising activities a ``mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein also would impose disclosure requirements on so-called
``issue-advocacy'' advertising, which typically supports a
candidate without directly instructing voters how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Such ads are not currently limited. Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
running for the GOP presidential nomination, drew criticism last
month when a wealthy Texas supporter ran independent pro-Bush ads
during New York's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein would require any expenditures over $10,000 on such
ads, or any individual contributions over $3,000 to groups running
such ads, to be reported to the Federal Election Commission within
48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's measure will be competing against a bill by Nebraska
Republican Chuck Hagel, with two Democratic co-sponsors, that would
limit, rather than ban, soft-money contributions to the national
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Reform advocates have blasted the Hagel bill as offering a
gigantic loophole to state and local parties that would still be
allowed to raise unlimited amounts of soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University Law School Dean Kathleen M. Sullivan and Ira
Glasser, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union,
both testified that limits on ``issue advocacy'' endanger free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said regulation of political money ``does implicate
free speech principles at the heart of the First Amendment,
contrary to the reformers' assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Existing campaign finance laws have created such anomalies,
Glasser said, as allowing wealthy individuals such as Ross Perot or
Feinstein's 1994 Senate opponent, Michael Huffington, to spend
unlimited amounts on campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if an equally wealthy donor wants to enable Colin Powell
to run against Perot, he commits a crime,'' Glasser said. ``This
should not be a result anyone would support.''

 BARBARY TOAST MUST USE VODKA  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ That Hugh ``Windfall'' McColl, man, he must be
 &UR; good. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I was impressed when I heard that the CEO of BofA was awarded
$76 million in cash and prizes for his work last year (he ran the
bank  &UR; and  &LR; discovered a cure for jock itch).
</P>
<P>
   Then I got the  &UR; real  &LR; story. Diane Shields, a worried BofA
customer, showed me the front-page teaser headline in the Tuesday
home-delivery edition of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``BofA chief's '99 pay: $76 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   That's serious coinage.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the ``billion'' was a typo. Million, billion,
godzillion _ the way the Hearst folk are throwing money around,
what's the diff?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'VE WANTED to come here all my life,'' President Clinton said
at the Taj Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what this presidency has been all about _ fulfilling
Bill's fantasies.

<P>
   TWINKIE SHORTAGE leaves East Coast with frazzled nerves, said
the news story.
</P>
<P>
   To which folks in the Bay Area said, ``Whaaat?''
</P>
<P>
   Norm Howard of KQED was a bit more eloquent: ``A shortage of
Twinkies ought to be producing greater tranquility, even a
reduction in violent crime. In accordance with Dr. Blinder's
theory, the number of premeditated double murders of elected
officials, in particular, ought to be plummeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Martin Blinder was the creator of the ``Twinkie Defense'' in
the murder trial of Dan White.
</P>
<P>
   One other way of looking at that news story: There's a shortage
of Twinkies on the East Coast because they're all out here in the
Bay Area making zillions with Internet startups.

   Danny Newhoff, 13, was undergoing leg surgery at Mt. Diablo
Medical Center in Concord last week. Once Danny had been knocked
out (as they say in the medical world), the doctor realized that a
peg to be inserted in the ankle was not going to be the right size.
</P>
<P>
   A peg hunt ensued, and the right one was located at the Stanford
Medical Center. ``Rush it over,'' Stanford was told.
</P>
<P>
   So someone at Stanford hailed a taxi, gave the cabbie the
package and instructions something like, ``Rush this to Mt.
Diablo!''
</P>
<P>
   And the cabbie did. He drove like a madman to the summit of Mt.
Diablo.
</P>
<P>
   From up there you can see the hospital, but it's a 40-minute
drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Cabbie finally made the delivery, doctor pegged the ankle, Danny
is doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   THE DOWNFALL of the Mansions Hotel in Pacific Heights might be
traced to the fateful moment 20 years ago when hotel owner Bob
Pritikin said, ``F_ you, Mrs. Bloomfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritikin built a dilapidated rooming house on Sacramento Street
into an elegant and quirky hotel that hosted JFK Jr., Barbra
Streisand, Liberace and Andrei Sakarov, though not all in the same
room at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But Pritikin rubbed the right people the wrong way. He fell into
a two-decade battle with Anne Bloomfield and her
very-well-connected group of friends and neighbors, who didn't want
his hotel in their exclusive neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Long story short: He wound up with the city suing him for $15
million per year and calling his swishy hotel ``Dangerous to human
life'' because of what his attorney, Angela Alioto, says is,
basically, ``some peeling paint in the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the hotel was life-threatening,'' Alioto says, ``why didn't
they close him down? The city Planning Department held its
Christmas party there two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritikin finally cried uncle. He closed the place and is holding
the world's most elegant garage sale this Friday-Sunday (2220
Sacramento St.).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic,'' Pritikin says, ``that the very day I finally
was forced to sell, their chief crusader died. I wonder if she's in
heaven now, looking for code violations.''
</P>
<P>
   GO DODGERS. That's what the big signs all over town say.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get riled, Giants' fans. It's obviously a cute ad
campaign, and when everyone gets angry, the ad people will paint
``to hell'' in the ap- &QL; 
propriate spot on the signs, or ``and take your smog with you.''
</P>
<P>
   S.F. GOES HOLLYWOOD: Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey will
be all over City Hall tomorrow and next Tuesday, filming scenes
from ``The Wedding Planner.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the tumult was great over the problems caused by the
filming of Robin Williams' ``Bicentennial Man'' last year in the
supervisors' chambers, the Film Commission sent a four-page memo to
the supervisors and mayor, saying, essentially, ``Don't sweat the
Hall stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Memo to ``Wedding'' producers: The supes are prima donnas; give
'em each a cameo role and they won't make a fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``ON VACATION'' is the tag line they put where your column
usually is, and it conjures images of a lazy lout lounging poolside
somewhere, and sometimes that's how it is.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes not. The guy at the other paper, whom I've not
met, is on vacation, but the kind you never want to take, when
personal tragedy comes knocking. Best wishes, old sport.
</P>
<P>
   A MUNI BUS, as reported here, almost ran over Holly Krassner
just after she'd spent an entire day doing free PR work for Muni.
</P>
<P>
   Holly, young and nimble, dived across the pavement, suffering
only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The story inspired Gar Smith of the Earth Island Journal to
create a new slogan for Muni: ``With friends like us, who needs
enemas?''

BRASWELL AWAITS WORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Bobby Braswell is still the men's basketball
coach at Cal State Northridge. But that could change.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell is one of three finalists for the Oregon State job and
a decision by OSU athletic director Mitch Barnhart is expected
within the next couple of days, possibly as early as today.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell, Colorado State coach Ritchie McKay and Milwaukee Bucks
assistant Don Newman are believed to be the front runners for the
position, vacated after the firing of fourth-year coach Eddie
Payne.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell, who interviewed for the job last week, said Wednesday
night that he preferred not to comment on his status.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second consecutive year Braswell, 37, has been
considered for a Pac-10 job. A year ago, he was a finalist at
Washington State. He has one year left on his CSUN contract that
pays him a base salary of $92,700.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell, who inherited a CSUN program that had only seven wins
in 1995-96, has a 65-53 record in four seasons. Northridge was
20-10 and made the Big Sky tournament championship game this past
year, losing to Northern Arizona in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge should have its strongest team next year, with
starters Brian Heinle, Markus Carr, Jeff Parris and Carl Holmes
returning. Five of the team's top seven scorers are coming back.
And John Burrell, the Highland High of Palmdale graduate who led
Nevada in scoring last season, also becomes eligible after
transferring to CSUN last year.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking over the Matadors, Braswell was an assistant for
four years at Oregon, and his West Coast recruiting ties make him a
strong candidate for the position in Corvallis.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old McKay, who Oregon papers say is the No. 1
candidate, was 37-23 in two seasons at CSU. He has four years left
on a contract that paid him $250,000 per year. He coached at
Portland State from 1996-98 and was 26-29. Three of those losses
came against Braswell and CSUN.
</P>
<P>
   Barnhart interviewed McKay over the weekend but has been
unavailable for comment. His secretary said he was on an
out-of-town recruiting trip.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the three finalists, also interviewing for the
job have been Boston Celtics assistant Lester Conner, a former All-
America guard at OSU, USF coach Phil Mathews and Arizona assistant
Jay John.

   CLINTON-INDIA-ASSESS (New Delhi, India) _ President Clinton,
master of the televised town hall meeting, brought his powers of
empathy and persuasion Wednesday to India's Parliament House, where
often is heard an anti-American word. In the time it took him to
deliver his speech, he managed to entertain, flatter and inspire
much of this vast country's political leadership, even as he
tactfully told them things they would rather not hear _ for
example, that the United States still thinks India's 1998 decision
to test nuclear weapons has taken the country in the wrong
direction. By Celia W. Dugger.

   MOONSHINE-TECH (Rocky Mount, Va.) _ Grinning seditiously, a
prominent citizen of this Blue Ridge foothills town takes from his
refrigerator an illegal gift from a moonshiner friend: a syrupy red
liquor in a quart jar packed with grapelike damsonberries. He
offers a taste to his visitor. It is sweet, silky brandy. To a
casual visitor, it all seems a quaint act of hospitality
appropriate to a town that likes to boast of being ``the moonshine
capital of the world.'' But to a task force of state and federal
agents, this area's illicit whiskeys are the work of big-time
criminals _ a new generation of moonshiners who in many cases have
transformed the woodsmen's stills of legend into efficient
distilleries capable of producing thousands of gallons of liquor a
week. Moonshine whiskey, mass-produced with little attention to
health or safety, is growing as a product of interstate commerce.

   SCI-IRISH-ANCESTORS (Undated) _ For any observer of last week's

College in Dublin have developed evidence that Irish men in

four months, in a pattern that some computer makers say is becoming

   SIMPLE-LIFE (Undated) _ Selling simplicity, and the value-added
life, is a booming business. A spate of new Web sites, books and
magazines, from Real Simple and its Web site (realsimple.com) to
O2Simplify.com, a Web site started by Oxygen Media, a multimedia
network geared to women, has discovered a potent buying force with
the promise of paring down. By Julie V. Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLE-LIFE-WEBSITES (Undated) _ Because the simplicity movement
seeks to quell an appetite that can only be sated by doing less
eating _ and proceeds from the flawed assumption that material
supplied by journalists can help _ it is probably doomed. But
before it fizzles, it will almost certainly manage to support a
number of content-driven, advertising-laden Web sites. A review of
several sites. By Joe Queenan.

<P>
   SIMPLE-LIFE-ROBOT (New York) _ How I wish I could say that I am
mowing the lawn while drinking my morning coffee. The trouble is, I
forgot to make the coffee, and also, the mower is doing all the
work here _ the rolling forward, the backing up, the turn-on-a-dime
maneuvering over in the corner by the London plane tree. And, yes,
the grass-cutting. All I am doing is watching a $700 robot whose
one purpose in life is to mow lawns. It is not beeping like R2D2 of
``Star Wars'' or talking like Hal, the maniacal star of ``2001: A
Space Odyssey,'' but its circuit-board brain does know things I do
not: Which way is north, for example. By James Barron.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-RUGS (New York) _ The 13-year-old import embargo on all
Iranian rugs was lifted this week, but that doesn't excite anyone
at Bloomingdales, which never missed carpets from Iran anyway.
``Embargo?'' says a salesman, referring to an open secret at
department stores countrywide: Smuggled carpets from Iran have been
pouring into the country all along, mainly from Canada, with bogus
paperwork to pass customs. By Christie Brown.

<P>
   CONRAD-PENTHOUSE (Hollywood) March 21 _ Penthouse life is not
what one normally associates with Southern California, land of the
rambling ranch and the gated compound. But if you were to imagine
someone embracing the sun-washed, sweeping views atop a West
Hollywood fake chateau, that person might well be Conrad L. Hall.
The man knows a thing or two about light. Hall is expected to take
home his second Academy Award on Sunday for his cinematography on
``American Beauty,'' the acidly funny dissection of dysfunctional
suburban America. It will have been 31 years since Hall won his
first Oscar for ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.'' By Rick
Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-HOUSES (Undated) _ People who live in glass houses are few
and far between. Although dazzling in photographs, the first glass
houses by Mies van der Rohe and Philip Johnson have been remarkably
tricky to emulate. In reality, they were hidden from prying eyes on
secluded country estates, like precious glass gems. That was 50
years ago. Recently, the privacy problem was campilycq dramatized
at a glass house on a busy Tokyo corner. There, the owners hung
full-length draperies all around _ on the outside. Surely, there
must be some middle ground. Lorcan O'Herlihy, an architect who
practices in the Culver City section of Los Angeles, has
successfully found a way to build glass houses that city dwellers
can live in. O'Herlihy's solution is stunningly simple. He uses
clear glass in those places where you want to see out, and
translucent glass in places where you don't. By Sydney LeBlanc.

POISE, NOT NOISE, WORKS FOR BRUINS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ You go to one of the first practices after
the Bruins' blitz of Maryland expecting to see the UCLA players'
chests puffed out and their heads swelled.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins basketball players, after all, long have paraded around
Pauley Pavilion as though the court was their personal runway and
they were poseurs.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the only thing swollen and puffed out Wednesday was Earl
Watson's left eye. Watson needed four stitches to close a cut he
suffered on the eyelid in the opening minutes of UCLA's 105-70 win
over the Terrapins.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the Bruins seemed remarkably, refreshingly
unaffected by the buzz their beating of Maryland engendered. They
might have become the belle of Bracketville, but they're not acting
like they're God's gift to anyone except, perhaps, their parents.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Bruins' humility in the face of that humongous
win over Maryland bodes well for their prospects against
second-seeded Iowa State tonight in an NCAA Tournament Midwest
Regional semifinal game at The Palace.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones' Marcus Fizer and Jamaal Tinsley are going to have
to beat the Bruins. Because eight wins in a row or no, this is one
UCLA team that's not going to be tripped up by its collective
hubris a la the 1991, 1994, 1996 and 1999 squads.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA players have none of the bluster of their athletic
director, who couldn't keep himself from crowing to critics of
Steve Lavin and the program after the Bruins' wins in Minneapolis
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to stay poised and not let the winning streak get
to our heads and think we're on top of the world,'' said freshman
Jason Kapono. ``We always talk about the times we lost six of seven
and people were trashing us.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Bruins' February nose-dive was enough to make
the haughtiest team humble, a 15-point loss at home to Stanford, a
29-point defeat at Arizona State and a 15-point loss at Arizona
providing the most turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose six of seven games,'' senior forward Sean
Farnham admitted, ``you have no reason to be walking around like a
peacock.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but even when they started 8-2, the Bruins didn't walk
around like they owned Westwood. Indeed, incredulous students have
been coming up to redshirt sophomore Billy Knight all year and
telling him how much they really like this season's squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `You guys aren't like past basketball teams. You
guys interact with the student body. You're not arrogant,' '' said
Knight, who doesn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``My freshman year,'' he said, ``there were players on the team
I didn't talk to. It was like they were on another (level).''
</P>
<P>
   That Bruins team, which featured Jelani McCoy (until he quit
after being suspended), Kris Johnson and Toby Bailey, also advanced
to the Sweet 16, only to get so caught up in having dispatched
Michigan in the second round they were no match for Kentucky in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you expect Bruins basketball players to view
cockiness as a birthright. They are supposed to walk with a
swagger. When you think of Bruins basketball, you picture Don
MacLean sauntering to the foul line like he was the sheriff of a
dusty town moseying up to the bar.
</P>
<P>
   This year's team is not like that. These Bruins don't strut,
they sort of slouch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a humble, focused team and I think it all has to do
with Earl Watson, really,'' said assistant coach Michael Holton,
referring to the Bruins' junior point guard. ``He's not a
flamboyant, arrogant person. He's more of a leader by example. He
set the tone for the team real early. He got up in a team meeting
and said, `We came here to win championships and we haven't gotten
anywhere near that level.' He made that statement and it became
kind of a rallying cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson and his favorite target since sixth grade, JaRon Rush,
are from Kansas and Missouri, respectively. Maybe that also helps
explain why these are not your usual dripping-with-conceit Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first UCLA team in a long while in which the
majority of the players didn't grow up in Southern California,
getting spoon fed UCLA lore in such large doses it worked on their
egos like steroids.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' big men, Jerome Moiso and Dan Gadzuric, are from the
West Indies and Holland, respectively. Where they come from, if
you're not a soccer player, you're not a huge deal.
</P>
<P>
   Too, the Bruins have a head coach in Steve Lavin who didn't plot
and pray and press for the UCLA job for years. Unlike Jim Harrick,
his predecessor who had been looking longingly toward Westwood from
his days coaching at Inglewood's Morningside High, Lavin aspired to
be a head coach but at the University of San Francisco, his
father's alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, neither the coach nor his players have the
affectations you expect from those appearing twice a week on one of
college basketball's biggest stages.
</P>
<P>
   True, Lavin has the moussed `do. But he is the first to poke fun
at it, explaining, ``It has a dual purpose. It protects me if they
start throwing pennies at Pauley.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lavin is protective of these players (some might say to a
fault), there's a reason. ``With other team,s I worried about them
having a false sense of opinion of themselves,'' he said. ``But
with this team, I was always more worried about their confidence
being too fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso and Gadzuric, in particular, have eggshells for egos. Or
so they would have you believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be quick to tell you, `I'm not that good. I don't know
why I keep getting the ball,' '' sophomore guard Ray Young said.
</P>
<P>
   He chuckled. Such actors, those two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome and Dan, they kind of fool you in a way,'' Young said.
``They really do come across as not confident. But when they get
into situations in a game, they show another side. With Jerome,
especially, if he gets bumped in a certain way it presses his
button and he'll just give you a look, like, `Give me the ball.
Now!' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's more like it. That's what you expect of a UCLA player. To
command and conquer.

GUNMAN WOUNDS 4 IN HOUSTON-AREA CHURCH, KILLS SELF

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A man angry over being spurned by a woman walked into
a Houston-area church Wednesday night and shot four people before
killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the wounded were listed in critical condition late
Wednesday, a third was in fair condition and the fourth suffered
only a minor wound.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena police Sgt. Mike Baird said the man, angry with a woman
who had refused to be his girlfriend, walked into Iglesia Esposa
del Cordero Pentecostal Church about 9 p.m. with a semiautomatic
pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Baird said he shot the woman, 18-year-old Leslie Contreras, her
38-year-old mother, Angela Contreras, the 49-year-old church
pastor, Carlos Matamores, and an unidentified 32-year-old man.
</P>
<P>
   The man, still unidentified late Wednesday, then went into the
church parking lot in suburban Pasasdena and fatally shot himself.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena, a pretrochemical area with about 134,000 residents, is
about 10 miles southeast of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The mother and pastor were flown to Memorial Hermann Hospital in
Houston with life-threatening wounds, hers in the abdomen, his in
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Contreras was taken by ambulance to Ben Taub Hospital in
Houston with a neck wound, hospital officials said. An official
said the injury is not life threatening, but that she would be kept
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old man was ``grazed across the chest,'' Baird said,
and did not have to be taken to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Baird said the gunman ``apparently was in love with the
18-year-old female (and) ... she told him she liked him like a
brother, but just didn't want to be his girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   Baird said the man then told her ``something bad was fixing to
happen,'' walked out of the church, which was ``full of folks,''
then returned to shoot the four people.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Church member Jose Montana, 34, said he saw the man Wednesday
morning at a nearby Wal-Mart. He said he was making small talk with
the man _ whom he knew only as ``Oscar'' _ when ``he said he was
going to kill someone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was kidding,'' Montana said. ``I told myself that
if I saw him at the church tonight I would call police.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the second church shooting in Texas in the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   A gunman killed seven people and wounded seven others before
killing himself Sept. 15 during a youth rally at Wedgwood Baptist
Church in Fort Worth.

STARTERS MIGHT GET SOME REST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A moderately tough home stretch might not allow
it, but Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson is hoping to ratchet
down the minutes of his starters in the final few weeks of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen games remain after Wednesday night's home game against
the Golden State Warriors, and Jackson would prefer to use the
entire 12-man roster as the Lakers close out the regular season and
prepare for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we don't get out of sync doing that,'' he said.
``If we get out of sync in any possible way, then we've got to get
back to what does get us the wins and how we play to do it. It'd be
nice if you could say, well, you put together a good game in the
first three quarters, then you can rest players in the fourth
quarter, but that doesn't always happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has relied heavily on Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant
and to a lesser extent, Glen Rice. At the other end of the bench,
he's used rookie swingman Devean George and backup centers Travis
Knight and John Salley sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers entered Wednesday's game with a seemingly
insurmountable five-game lead over Portland, giving them plenty of
room for error. But they also play 10 of their last 13 games
against playoff teams, so the reserves will have to earn their time
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to see how they produce,'' Jackson said. ``The
other night (at Miami), everybody had goose eggs off the bench
except for Robert (Horry), and he played a lot of minutes and had a
big shot down the stretch. But it was tough for our bench the other
night, and they felt the fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   __ On guards: Jackson has floated the possibility of giving Ron
Harper an extended rest by placing him on the injured list but said
he's leaving that decision to his veteran guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want him to be the determinator,'' Jackson said.
``He's been the guy that's gone through this process before with
us, and he knows the values of it and what he can get out of it and
if it's worth it for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper, who underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee
last summer, was coy about his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, I could really use some days off. I need that (golf)
swing work, so I can grip that swing right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper wouldn't say how his legs are holding up but said he
would speak with Jackson today about the possibility of taking time
off to recharge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could play 82 games if I was called upon 82 games.
But since we have a nice comfortable five games (lead in the
standings), I think I can take some time off. It won't hurt
nobody.''

SMU SUSPENDS TWO BASKETBALL PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARTHUR GARCIA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMU basketball players Jeryl Sasser and Renaldo Bratton were
indefinitely suspended from the team yesterday for violating team
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The university announced the suspensions in a news release last
night, without naming the players, and attributed the suspensions
to ``inappropriate and disruptive behavior involving a few
students'' in the early morning hours of March 10 at hotel in
Fresno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report released by the Fresno Police Department,
Sasser and Bratton, both juniors, were questioned about incidents
that took place in their hotel room at a party that included
members of the SMU basketball team and the SMU spirit squad.
</P>
<P>
   The SMU basketball team was in Fresno competing in the Western
Athletic Conference tournament, where it lost its first-round game
against Hawaii on March 9. The team was staying at the Radisson
Hotel in downtown Fresno and, according to the police report,
several members of the team and the spirit squad spent the hours
after the loss drinking at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser and Bratton both remained on the team as SMU competed in
the National Invitation Tournament against Southwest Missouri State
last Thursday. SMU spokesman Bob Wright said the school did not
take action against any players before the NIT game because ``the
police report \Rreceived Tuesday by SMU\S contained information not
given to us previously.'' SMU lost the game, ending its season.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser, a 6-foot-6 guard, was named first-team all-WAC and led
SMU in scoring. Bratton, a 6-foot guard, played a reserve role.
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the spirit squad, spirit coordinator Darren
McCoy, an SMU employee and sophomore basketball player DeWayne
Floyd were also interviewed by police, who responded to a call from
a friend of a spirit-team member.
</P>
<P>
   Police informed SMU coach Mike Dement and SMU athletic director
Jim Copeland in the early morning hours about their investigation.
Copeland and Dement didn't return calls to the /Star-Telegram/
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Fresno Police Department spent more than] a week gathering
information regarding the events surrounding the party at the
Radisson. Lt. John Fries said any further criminal investigation on
the Fresno police's part is unlikely because the parties involved
in the report live in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   SMU, however, has launched its own investigation of possible
violations of the university code of conduct during a
school-sponsored trip. The student affairs office has indefinitely
suspended two members of the spirit squad, pending the findings of
the school investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're handling it the same way we would handle any other
potential violation of student conduct,'' said Jim Caswell, SMU
vice president of student affairs. ``There needs to be some
determination of university violations and what sort of response we
need to pursue from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Among several issues being investigated by SMU are the many
documented instances of underage drinking in the police report.
Bratton and the three members of the spirit squad are 20 years old
and the report includes instances of a 21-year-old player giving
vodka to a 20-year-old member of the spirit squad.
</P>
<P>
   Caswell said the university also plans to investigate the role
of McCoy, who coached the spirit squad. McCoy, 22, voluntarily
resigned from SMU in the early stages of the investigation last
week. The police noted that McCoy had ``bloodshot watery eyes, a
strong odor of alcohol'' and said he ``attempted to obstruct police
questioning of one of the spirit members.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, that member of the spirit squad was
being questioned about her concerns of possible illegal behavior at
the party. Sgt. Tim McFadden of the Fresno police said ``there
appeared to be a lot of pressure put on her not to press charges.''
In the report the spirit-squad member said she was worried about
her future at SMU and with the spirit squad should she pursue
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit-team member said yesterday that her lawyers told her
not to comment. Caswell said he hopes to have the school
investigation finished next week.

PROSECUTOR'S WARNING IGNORED: `IT WAS THE OFFICE JOKE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By BETH BARRETT, GREG GITTRICH 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A ``joke'' _ that's how county prosecutor Michael
Kraut described the way the District Attorney's Office handled his
early warnings about dirty cop Rafael Perez, the central figure in
the worst police corruption scandal in city history.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview in August with an LAPD detective, a
well-informed source said Kraut expressed frustration about his
inability to get senior prosecutors to act on his suspicions about
Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the office joke,`` Kraut told investigators, alluding
to his written warnings about the dirty cop in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The source said Kraut told the investigator he was particularly
upset when his boss, Head Deputy District Attorney Richard
Sullivan, failed to follow up on his note questioning Perez's
honesty in the second of two cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the note) sat on his desk for a year,'' Kraut told a Los
Angeles Police Department detective, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut's words give the clearest picture yet of his view about
the importance of his warnings, how they were ignored and how he
was rebuked by his supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons dismissed applying any significance to Kraut's statements.
She pointedly noted that the second case Kraut spotted was handled
by another prosecutor and was not his responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Kraut chose to involve himself in a case that wasn't
his,'' Gibbons said. ``The facts did not bear out his feelings ...
It wasn't his case.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has a very different view of
Kraut's warnings, insisting that if LAPD officials had been
notified immediately, rather than in 1998, Perez would have been
taken off the streets and many of the crimes alleged against
Rampart Division anti-gang officers might not have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the repeated warnings, the District Attorney's Office
failed to officially notify the LAPD about the prosecutor's
concerns in 1997 or even to warn other prosecutors that Perez was
suspected of being dishonest.
</P>
<P>
   During the year prosecutors held onto the information, Perez
framed at least 17 people and stole nearly $1million in cocaine
from an LAPD evidence room. He has told investigators he and other
cops shot at least one unarmed man, beat other suspects, and
routinely committed perjury to send innocent people to prison
between 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the District Attorney's Office and LAPD agree that
Kraut's first warning about Perez was not conclusive enough to have
fingered the dirty cop.
</P>
<P>
   But LAPD sources argue that when that warning is combined with
another botched case that includes concerns about the same cop from
the same prosecutor, the warnings become more of a smoking gun than
a red herring.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut, who could not be reached for comment, has consistently
declined requests for interviews, citing the corruption task
force's ongoing probe and a concurrent internal investigation by
the District Attorney's Office into his attempts to notify senior
prosecutors about Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Kraut's first attempt to sound the alarm, widely referred to as
the Kraut memo, came in June 1997 after he was forced to ask a
judge to dismiss drug charges against a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   During an Aug. 12, 1999, interview with an LAPD detective,
sources said, Kraut explained that he asked for the case to be
kicked out because he had serious questions about Perez's testimony
during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   In sworn statements to LAPD investigators in September, Perez
confirmed Kraut was right, but for the wrong reasons. According to
Perez, Kraut believed he was lying about who his partner was on the
day he arrested Ubaldo Gutierrez. That wasn't the case, Perez said.
He was lying about so much more.
</P>
<P>
   All of the charges against Gutierrez were bogus. Perez, who
agreed to become an informant after hashing out a plea bargain,
told investigators he planted the drugs on Gutierrez. The dirty cop
added that his relationship with prosecutors resembled a ``pissing
match.''
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the Kraut memo has been widely reported for
months. What wasn't known, until the Daily News article Sunday, was
that Kraut made a second attempt to draw his boss's attention to
Perez only weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   In his talk with the detective, sources said, Kraut detailed
that second attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The case that grabbed Kraut's attention this time had been
handled by another prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney Janis
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Just as with Gutierrez, drug charges against a defendant, Victor
Perez, had to be dropped because of a police foul-up. Officer
Perez, no relation to the defendant, and his partner, Nino Durden,
told the prosecutor they could not find the drugs confiscated
during the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The failed prosecution took place less than two weeks after
which Gutierrez was allowed to walk.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Kraut said he reviewed the Victor Perez case
and noticed Officer Perez was involved. To check up on the cop,
Kraut called over to the police evidence room to see whether the
drugs seized during the arrest were on hand. He was told the
narcotics were never missing, a source said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Gutierrez case, Kraut did not write an official memo
or disposition report detailing his concerns. But, he told the
detective, he placed a note on the Victor Perez file and gave it to
his supervisor, Sullivan. Sullivan could not be reached Wednesday
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Sally Thomas, director of central operations, is expected to
complete the prosecutorial office's internal review of Kraut's
warnings by early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Daily News' Sunday article on Kraut's warnings,
the District Attorney's Office agreed to give the LAPD a copy of
the Kraut memo, but insisted that no other memo or note related to
the Victor Perez case could be found or existed to its knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   An official statement released by the District Attorney's Office
earlier this week concluded that the internal review of the
Gutierrez file and the court transcript ``does not support Mr.
Kraut's conclusions, and does not support the contention that this
case would have led to an earlier prosecution of Officer Perez.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement also noted that Kraut ``personally informed''
Officer Perez's supervisor about his concerns about the Gutierrez
case and that the supervisor, a detective at the Rampart station,
said he agreed with the decision to dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The statement did not address why the District Attorney's Office
failed to immediately tell LAPD brass, the Internal Affairs unit,
or even its own prosecutors about Kraut's concerns in case Perez
was a key witness in the future, which he would be.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also ignored the Victor Perez case, which remains
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   There are no audiotapes of Kraut's interview with Castillo.
Sources said Kraut declined to be tape-recorded and police were not
permitted to conduct formal interviews with the prosecutor or his
supervisors. But the District Attorney's Office has promised to
make Kraut available to police for further interviews.
</P>
<P>
   To date, no one has issued a subpoena to Kraut, which would
compel him to tell his story under oath.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ On a walking tour of what's left of
Bracketville, this is the one neighborhood where you don't want to
stand on a corner looking like a tourist who got off at the wrong
bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   Wham!
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Michigan State's smothering defense could land on
your head.
</P>
<P>
   Bam!
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 seed Iowa State could hit you right in the kisser with the
heavy dose of heavyweight forward Marcus Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   Slam!
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 seed Syracuse could send any shot you try right back into
your face, compliments of rejection machine/center Etan Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Jam!
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 seed UCLA could have guard JaRon Rush sail in from out of
the blue to rattle your rims with any number of slick moves, dunk
you very much.
</P>
<P>
   No room at the inn for Cinderella here. Uh-uh. No, sir. Not
unless she's wearing steel-toed boots and has the kind of right
cross that could stand up to at least Leila Ali.
</P>
<P>
   All across America this week, in the mourning after Wisconsin
beating Arizona and Seton Hall knocking off Temple and North
Carolina nailing Stanford, the same loser's lament could be heard
in offices everywhere, just before the NCAA Tournament brackets hit
the shredder: ``At least I got the Midwest right.''
</P>
<P>
   To quote some sage thinkers of our modern times: Duh.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of limited scholarships and parity and Gonzaga, the
Midwest Regional is where the prognosticationally challenged of us
have run for cover and reassurance that we are not the village
idiots of Bracketville.
</P>
<P>
   This is the place where the 12-step recovery program for fallen
hoop pickers starts with an open proclamation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, I'm Dickie V., and I don't know what happened to St.
John's, bay-bee!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it builds you back up by letting you guess from which
direction the sun will rise tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   This is the part of the bracket that even the lamest of us were
able to pick with our eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State, Iowa State, Syracuse and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so No. 3 Maryland did trip in front of UCLA to break up a
clean sweep by the top seeds. But if you've been paying attention
to the Bruins since the sophomore Rush won his eligibility battle
with the NCAA, you'd have realized this is an entirely different
UCLA team than the one that was so inconsistent all year.
</P>
<P>
   It is fitting that the Midwest Regional is being contested at
the Palace, because every team here possesses the talent to be
king.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest is Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell,
the so-called ``Flintstones'' of Michigan State, the team that lost
a hard-fought battle in the national semifinals last season and
seems to be more determined, more committed this time around.
Cleaves gets so much of the notoriety as the point guard, but the
all-around performer Peterson is the one who has so many NBA scouts
champing at the bit.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans of coach Tom Izzo have the kind of senior
leadership that can get them through the tight games, perhaps the
nation's best defense and the added benefit of playing before a
home crowd this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest is the amazing tale of Iowa State, picked to finish
last in the Big 12 but now hurtling along as one of the remaining
Tournament favorites thanks to Fizer. He left the inner-city
problems of Detroit as a young teen, sulked when the coach (Tim
Floyd) who recruited him left to join the Chicago Bulls, and now
returns to the old neighborhood as a sculpted (6-8, 265 pounds),
motivated, model performer.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest is perennial power Syracuse, which rolled to a 19-0
start, then suddenly stumbled with three losses in the span of five
games that had everybody asking questions. The Orangemen have been
close to the mountaintop so many times, but they never plant the
flag as coach Jim Boeheim whines about something.
</P>
<P>
   But in tonight's showdown with the vise grip of Michigan State,
Syracuse will have defense of its own in the 6-9 block of granite
Thomas, who is the Big East's two-time defensive player of the year
and ranks seventh on the NCAA all-time list with 422 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest is UCLA, a month ago on the verge of getting coach
Steve Lavin fired and now hotter than the inside of a microwave
oven for this meeting with Iowa State. The Bruins have won eight in
a row overall and have taken a huge step up with Rush in the
lineup. They have talent and the swagger to go all the way. Just
like the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the bombed-out shell of Bracketville, this is where the big
boys still live.
</P>

TOUGH SCHEDULE READIED BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ UCLA's schedule makers knew their
1999-2000 creation would be challenging. They knew the early-season
complaints would morph into late-season praise. But they never
expected this.
</P>
<P>
   They never expected it to rank among the nation's top-five late
in the season.
</P>
<P>
   They never expected seven of the 12 nonconference foes to make
the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And they never expected four to make the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, 25 percent of the tournament survivors played UCLA
this season: Purdue, North Carolina, Syracuse and Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing preps teams for March Madness like grueling schedules,
brutal road trips and competition in domed stadiums. Syracuse, in
February, qualifies on all counts, since success isn't as important
as experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Vitale and a lot of people said at the beginning of the
season that we didn't have a good schedule, but we've shown how
good it is,'' Bruins forward Rico Hines said on the eve of
tonight's Sweet 16 showdown against Iowa State. ``It's helped us a
lot. It was great preparation for the tournament. Look at how many
teams we played are still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look so tough four months ago. The Bruins opened with
Fairfield, Iona and Morgan State. Although Iona would later win the
Metro Atlantic Conference _ and lose to Maryland in the first round
_ the trio did nothing for UCLA's early-season power rating, which
is primarily based on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the lineup got progressively tougher.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-December, the Bruins played Gonzaga, their first quality
opponent, and lost by 16 points in Pauley Pavilion in one of their
worst performances of the year. Gonzaga would win the West Coast
Conference and reach the Sweet 16 for the second year in a row.
What convinced UCLA to schedule the 'Zags?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for teams we can play without having to
give them a return game,'' said Marc Dellins, UCLA's
media-relations director who doubles as the schedule coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of Pepperdine, which actually filled three
requirements: The Waves are local, and UCLA tries to schedule at
least one Southern California team each year; they did not require
a return game; and, at the time, they were coached by former UCLA
assistant Lorenzo Romar, who's now at Saint Louis.
</P>
<P>
   That the Waves made the NCAA Tournament as an at-large candidate
was an unexpected power-ratings bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also played tournament-bound DePaul and Purdue in the
first of two-year contracts (UCLA will visit both schools next
season).
</P>
<P>
   Then, in January and February, after most teams had finished
their nonconference schedules, the Bruins played at North Carolina
and Syracuse. The matchups were ideal tournament preparation _
high-caliber opponents, long road trips, spacious arenas that
duplicate the shooting conditions usually found in tournament
games.
</P>
<P>
   Add four games against eventual No. 1 seeds Stanford and
Arizona, and by Selection Sunday, the Bruins' once-weak schedule
packed a wallop.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were bashing at the start, but they didn't understand
that by the end it would be one of the toughest in the nation,''
said forward Jason Kapono. ``Playing it, and going through that
losing stretch like we did, really helped the team. It made us see
what we had to change to start winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect more of the same next year, when the Bruins play North
Carolina, Villanova, DePaul, Purdue, Georgia Tech (in the Wooden
Classic) and two games in the Coaches vs. Cancer tournament. St.
John's, Kentucky and Kansas are the other participants.

L.A. ALTERS PET FEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hoping to collar what one official called a
``crisis of epic proportions,'' the Los Angeles City Council on
Wednesday approved a series of rules and higher fees for unaltered
pets and breeder permits that are among the toughest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters expressed hope the new ordinance will reduce the
number of dogs roaming wild through city streets and dogs that are
euthanized.
</P>
<P>
   Under the measure, which will be considered for final approval
next week, licenses would remain at $10 for all altered dogs. Dogs
not spayed or neutered will cost $100 a year and breeders will see
their permit go from $50 to $100, plus additional fees for any
unaltered animals in their possession.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents _ primarily breeders _ say the city already does a
poor job of enforcing its pet ordinances and the tough new rules
will lead even more people to break the law because they won't be
able to pay the higher fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we face a problem of too many stray dogs
and there are too many stray dogs and cats,'' said Charles Ober, an
opponent of the fee hike.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this will not work. It has been an abject failure in other
areas of the country where it has been tried and has been dropped.
Los Angeles has had success with its current programs. We should
let it try to work a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The council voted 10-3, with members saying they feel the
crackdown is needed to reduce the number of euthanized and stray
dogs. During the past fiscal year, the city's six animal shelters
received more than 46,000 dogs and 19,000 cats and about 70 percent
of those were euthanized. About 44,000 stray dogs are believed to
be wandering the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also requires the owners of unaltered cats to keep
their pets indoors as a way to reduce the feral cat population.
Cats are not licensed in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who recently completed a
successful campaign for the Democratic nomination for Assembly,
spoke firsthand of the city's stray dog problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tell you how bad the problem is,'' Goldberg said.
``Everywhere I went, I was chased through many city streets _ and
by well-groomed dogs as well as strays. I carried dog bones
everywhere I went. We have a huge stray and unowned- dog problem
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Animal Services Director Dan Knapp said the fees were set as an
incentive to get people to alter their pets. The cost of the
operation for most animals is less than $100, and the city also is
offering vouchers and free spay and neutering for low-income pet
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who had proposed some type of
action last year to control the roaming packs of dogs through
neighborhoods, said it was an action long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a crisis of epic proportions,'' Ridley-Thomas said.
``It is an alarming threat to public health and safety to the
residents of this region and particularly to children. The county
Health Department said this is the No. 1 health problem for
children, outstripping the likes of measles and mumps.''
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Joel Wachs questioned whether the new program
will work, particularly since only about 25 percent of dog owners
even bother to license their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fooling ourselves if we think this will solve the
problem,'' Wachs said. ``We were dealing with this 30 years ago.
The fact is the city has never given the resources to deal with
this problem. And it is inexcusable that we have a law violated by
75 percent of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   If the city is serious about dealing with the issue, he said, it
should contract with the U.S. Postal Service or the Department of
Water and Power to have those workers fill out cards on any
location where there are dogs. The workers could be paid a fee for
identifying any dogs that are not licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Wachs, however, did end up voting for the measure. The three
opponents were council members Nate Holden, Nick Pacheco and Rudy
Svorinich Jr., who were concerned about the size of the license fee
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The measure does give some leeway to the Animal Services
Department to issue warnings to dog owners and give them up to 60
days to comply before misdemeanor charges are sought.

TIRED DUCKS FALL FROM 8TH PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON _ In the Western Conference playoff race, one night you
are in, the next night you're out.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after tying San Jose for the eighth
postseason berth, a tired flock of Mighty Ducks staggered into
Edmonton on Wednesday and lost a 2-1 decision to the Oilers before
15,673 at Skyreach Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tying the Oilers with 78 points, the Ducks
(31-32-12-2) head to Vancouver two behind San Jose, three behind
Phoenix and four back of Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had won three consecutive games and were unbeaten in
four, but a 4:30 a.m arrival certainly couldn't have helped their
energy level against a struggling Edmonton team that was 2-5-1 in
its last eight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sense whining and crying about it,'' Ducks coach
Craig Hartsburg said of the demanding travel schedule.
``Complaining isn't going to help us now. I'm sure every team has
some games they scratch their heads over.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the Ducks have been scratching their heads about their
woeful penalty killing all season. Anaheim gave up one more
official power play goal and another that was scored three seconds
after a penalty had expired _ long before Ruslan Salei ever had a
chance to get back into the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't have a lot of energy, one of the worst things
to do is kill penalties,'' said Hartsburg. ``But we can't
over-anaylze things, we just have to get ready for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyday something new comes up. You can't get too high when
you win or too low when you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had killed 12 of 13 penalties over the last four
games, but they still came into the game ranked last in the league.
And it took the Oilers only 25 seconds to convert on an
interference call against Vitaly Vishnevski.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Poti scored his eighth goal of the season at 10:52 when his
harmless looking shot from the point deflected off Anaheim
defenseman Kevin Haller past Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim goalie turned in yet another strong performance,
stopping 33 of 35 shots, but he had no chance to prevent Doug
Weight's game-winning goal at 17:01 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks nearly tied the game in the finally minute, after
Hebert had been pulled in favor of an extra attacker. Fredrik
Oluasson set up Kariya for a one-timer from the right circle with
Edmonton goalie Tommy Salo out of position, but the Anaheim winger
missed the net badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't get good wood on it, I don't know what happened,
</P>
<P>
   But to Hartsburg, Kariya and Selanne didn't look like
themselves, especially in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have played a lot the last month, and you saw in the
third they just didn't have the zip to beat anybody. They are tired
guys,'' Hartsburg said. ``Most of the time that (Kariya's shot) is
in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim had tied the game, 1-1, when Ed Ward slipped a rebound
past Salo at 15:23 of the first period after Antti Aalto got a shot
on goal off the face off. It was Ward's first point in four games
for the Ducks.

STORK HAS WAVES RIDING HIGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Who's coaching the Pepperdine men's volleyball
team, Jeff Stork or Marv Dunphy?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the Waves can't tell.
</P>
<P>
   When the coach stands a certain way, gives a certain look and
utters, ``You know what,'' it's Dunphy.
</P>
<P>
   But not this year. This is Stork's team. The Taft of Woodland
Hills graduate is in charge while Dunphy takes a year off to coach
the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got names like Marv Dunphy and Jeff Stork, who's going to
question their authority on volleyball?'' sophomore Chris Van
Ruesen said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stork accepts the Dunphy comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   He knew Dunphy growing up in Topanga Canyon. He played for
Dunphy, first at Pepperdine and then on the 1988 gold medal-winning
Olympic team, and he has been Dunphy's assistant for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves haven't missed a beat. They're ranked second at 14-3
and 11-2 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation heading into
Wednesday's home match with fifth-ranked Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style tends to reflect his style,'' Stork said. ``This
feels like my team and I know I'm keeping it warm for Marv.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has there been a transition period. In fact, Stork became
interim coach at a right time.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine had graduated George Roumain, a two-time national
Player of the Year, leaving a big offensive hole to fill. Stork's
style is, in part, to spread out the offense, which is exactly what
the team needed and has done.
</P>
<P>
   The players immediately took to Stork and even kid him when they
see Dunphy mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they notice subtle differences. Dunphy emphasizes blocking
more than Stork. Stork was a setter, so setting and the transition
game are more important to him. Plus, he substitutes more than
Dunphy But these same players also see Stork more as a guy you can
hang around with and not feel intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little bit looser,'' senior setter Kurt Nelson said.
``He can joke around a little bit more with players. He was a
seteer, so he understands the position and is more demanding. He
demands a more leadership role.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunphy returns to his Pepperdine job Oct. 4, but he regularly
calls Stork for updates and already has watched the team play. He
sat behind the bench and ``coached'' by shouting during plays.
</P>
<P>
   Stork will be happy to turn the program back to Dunphy, but
perhaps by then, the Waves will have won their fifth national
title.
</P>
<P>
   __ Olympians in town: Don't be surprised if UCLA has a lovefest
when it hosts the Olympic softball team for a doubleheader
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the team's 15 members were Bruins: Christie Ambrosi,
Jennifer Brundage, Sheila Cornell-Douty, Lisa Fernandez and Dot
Richardson. A sixth, Stecey Nuveman, is redshirting to play for the
national team. A seventh, Amanda Freed, is an alternate and will
play with the UCLA team.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are $6 for adults and $4 for children at (310) 825-2946.
</P>
<P>
   __ On the track: The nonscoring Northridge Invitational,
featuring athletes from Cal State Northridge, USC, Cal Lutheran and
several other schools plus other unattatched athletes, begins
Friday with the hammer throws and continues Saturday at CSUN's
track at 9 a.m. One featured athlete is Taft graudate Quincy Watts,
who will compete as he continues a comeback attempt.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gymnasts clean up: UCLA's women's gymnastics team won every
event and won the Pac-10 championships at Arizona State, beating
runner-up Oregon State by 1.125 points.
</P>
<P>
   Mohini Bhardwaj won the all-around title and took first in the
vault. Bhardwaj narrowly beat Lena Degteva, who won on the uneven
parallel bars and the balance beam, by .025 in the all-around.

WOMAN SETS OUT TO TOP HER OWN PINBALL RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joining a long, wacky tradition of Guinness record
seekers, Mandi Martin played her 17th straight day of pinball
Wednesday _ just four days from establishing a new world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really about points,'' said the 55-year-old Martin,
as she kept her eyes on the flying metal ball, whirring flippers
and flashing lights of a deluxe pinball machine in her home in
suburban Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``My all-time high score is 1.8 billion, and I don't even keep
track of anything below 300 million anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As she cruised into hour 411 on Wednesday, Martin explained that
she wants to play an endless series of games for 555 hours, 55
minutes and 55 seconds over 23 days, besting the record of 505
hours she said she set in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   She is allowed only one five-minute break each hour, according
to Guinness rules, so she sometimes accumulates her minutes to take
short naps.
</P>
<P>
   A telephone headset lets her talk to press and friends without
halting play, and a revolving team of friends acting as witnesses
gives her occasional shoulder massages to keep her loose and awake.
</P>
<P>
   Her forearms are built up like a patrol cop's, thanks to months
of working out at the gym in preparation for the event, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin chose her goal _ 555 hours, 55 minutes and 55 seconds _
to coincide with her 55th birthday, which she celebrated March 20.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify, Guinness requires that a log of her hours be kept,
and that there be present two sworn witnesses at all times who sign
the log.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the self-described pinball queen will join the
prestigious global ranks of such unbelievable characters as Swami
Maujgiri Maharaj of India, who stood in place for a record 17 years
straight from 1955 to 1973, and Randy Ober of Arizona, who spat a
tobacco wad a record 47 feet, 7 inches in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how the heck she does this,'' said Joe
Breakfield, an insurance broker from Redondo Beach and friend of
Martin's who volunteered as a witness. ``After just an hour's nap,
she's at it again, full of energy. It's an inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a cushioned chair and playing on a machine she says
was loaned to her by rock guitar player Slash from the group Guns
N' Roses, Martin says she decided to break her own record now to
mark the fifth anniversary of the passing of her late husband,
Jerry Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the John Glenn of pinball,'' she said. ``I hadn't planned
on doing this again, but my friends convinced me they'd support me
and it's good for the charities.''
</P>
<P>
   Like her record-setting event 21 years ago, Martin hopes the
publicity will help her raise thousands of dollars for several
charity organizations, including the MusiCares Foundation, which
deals with addiction and housing issues; the domestic violence
prevention group Haven Hills; The Chad Aitken Foundation, which
supports families that lose a young child; Gilda's Club, formed by
actress Gilda Radner to support cancer patients worldwide; and
America's Breast Cancer Ride, a charity bicycle ride.
</P>
<P>
   Martin takes donations on her Web site, www.pinballchamp.com.
</P>
<P>
   A lifetime songwriter who got her start in the entertainment
industry in Nashville, Tenn., in the 1970s, Martin got turned on to
the game while playing after work with friends and says she has set
records in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a DJ in Nashville named Captain Midnight who taught
me all the tricks,'' she said. ``I found out I was really good at
it, and I was hooked from the start.''

UCLA vs. IOWA STATE MATCHUPS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   __ Backcourt: It's difficult to compare the guards because Iowa
State prefers to play with three and UCLA prefers one, Earl Watson,
and two small forwards, Jason Kapono and JaRon Rush. Watson was
brilliant against Maryland (16 assists, no turnovers). Bruins don't
need him to score, but he must make good decisions with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State's lineup features 6-3 point guard Jamaal Tinsley
(10.7 ppg, 6.6 apg), one of the best in the land, and two 6-1 wing
guards, Michael Nurse, a super shooter (12.2 ppg, 40.9% 3-pt.), and
role player Kantrail Horton. Bruins must prevent Tinsley from
penetrating. __ Edge: Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Frontcourt: Iowa State has the best player in America, 6-8
power forward Marcus Fizer (23.2 ppg, 7.8 rpg), and he will try to
overpower the taller, lankier Bruins underneath. Alongside Fizer is
6-4 forward Stevie Johnson (9.1 ppg, 6.1 rpg), who is tough and
athletic.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins will try to force three forwards (Kapono, Rush, Jerome
Moiso) and one center (Dan Gadzuric) on the diminutive Cyclones.
Rush and Kapono must make open jumpers to prevent ISU's guards from
swarming Moiso and Gadzuric in the post. Also, Moiso, who has six
inches on ISU's Johnson, must play big. If he recoils from contact,
as he sometimes does, his size becomes irrelevant. __ Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bench: Also difficult to assess. Iowa State's fate might rest
on the play of two 6-8 forwards, Paul Shirley and Martin Rancik;
each is recovering from a broken foot. Rancik played a few minutes
last weekend. Shirley hasn't played in nine games. If available and
effective, they change the dynamics of the frontcourt matchup.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's bench is deceiving: Gadzuric and Rush are technically
reserves, but they play 25-30 minutes. The real reserves are point
guard Ryan Bailey, who will spell Watson, forward Matt Barnes, who
has played very well lately, and guard Ray Young, whose defense is
more dependable than his jumper. Bruins might need a big game from
Barnes if Gadzuric or Moiso is in foul trouble. __ Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Coaching: After a rough three months, UCLA's Steve Lavin has
made all the right moves in the past five weeks, both strategically
and psychologically. But tonight he'll face one of the best coaches
in the country, Iowa State's Larry Eustachy, who will have his team
as well-prepared as possible. Eustachy doesn't have many options.
It's too late for dramatic changes and a lack of size limits the
way ISU can play. Unless the UCLA staff blunders, Eustachy's bench
advantage won't be enough. __ Edge: Slight to ISU.
</P>
<P>
   __ Intangibles: Bruins are confident but humble, calm but
excited. They are the lower seed and one-point underdogs but have
relished that role in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Cyclones have
exceeded all expectations. How will they react to the success to
being favored to win a Sweet 16 game? Also, there will be thousands
of Cyclones fans here, and Bruins have played some of their best
games away from Pauley Pavilion. __ Edge: UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   __ Outcome: Don't expect another 35-point win or a half-dozen
alley-oop dunks. Cyclones are tougher and much better coached than
Maryland. But once again the Bruins have more good players
especially more good big players than their opponent. The quintet
of Watson, Kapono, Rush, Moiso and Gadzuric is as talented as any
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Answers to two questions will determine the game: Will UCLA's
size offset ISU's quickness? Will ISU's quickness negate UCLA's
size? Cyclones are one-point favorites, but Fizer and Tinsley can't
beat the Bruins by themselves. __ Edge: UCLA, by eight.

LAKERS WIN EASILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Notice was served officially at Staples Center
Wednesday night, for those who hadn't yet gotten the memo: The NBA
dog days of spring have officially arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers did their best to simulate meaningful
basketball in a game lacking any sense of intrigue, but that was
the one feat they couldn't accomplish. Against the Golden State
Warriors, it was enough just to avoid injuries, get the starters a
long breather and walk away with a 119-96 rout.
</P>
<P>
   What the game lacked in providing entertainment, it made up for
in furthering the Lakers' greater goals. The victory, coupled with
Portland's loss to Detroit, pushed the Lakers' lead over the rival
Trail Blazers tosix games, with 13 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers (57-12) have now won 11 straight at Staples, 23 of
their last 24 overall and haven't lost to a Western Conference
opponent since Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   About the only setback the Lakers suffered was Shaquille
O'Neal's lossof ground in the NBA scoring race. He played just 23
minutes (a season-low for a game in which he hasn't ben ejected)
and scored 22 points, handing the lead back to Philadelphia's Allen
Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Warriors (17-50), the Lakers didn't figure to be
tested _ and indeed, they led by as many as 34 points in the third
quarter. But coach Phil Jackson had expected explosive guard Larry
Hughes _ who scorched the Lakers for 41 points two weeks ago _ to
at least make things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant's pride, if nothing else, would be on the line as he
defended Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be something there for him to get his energy going
for this game,'' Jackson said before tipoff, ``and that's the kind
of thing that we need in this game to really go out and play well.
We have to havesomething to challenge us. ... I think it's going to
be a big challengefor (Bryant), just knowing how he feels about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Hughes credit for trying. He scored 26 points on 8-of-22
shooting. But Bryant was resting comfortably on the bench for most
of it as the Lakers established the rout early and sat on it.
</P>
<P>
   So much for interesting subplots.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant finished with 18 points in 28 minutes _ the longest run
of anystarter. Glen Rice added 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   With the season winding down, and the Lakers having all but sewn
up the top seed in the West, Jackson wants every opportunity to
rest his starters for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a game that I will try and use a lot of
players,'' Jackson said before the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors cooperated with that goal, and Jackson was mostly
pleasedwith his bench production, if a little perturbed about 22
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw, celebrating his 34th birthday, and Rick Fox led the
reserves with 14 points each. Travis Knight grabbed a season-high
10 rebounds before fouling out in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Every Laker but John Salley scored, and the Lakers shot 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Jackson to turn the game over to his
bench. Bythe time the Lakers opened the second quarter _ already
leading 37-19 _ Bryant was the only starter on the floor. Less than
two minutes later, he was on the bench too.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help the Warriors any. The Lakers' second string
(Knight,Robert Horry, Fox, Shaw and Derek Fisher) quickly extended
the lead to 31 points with a 26-13 run.
</P>
<P>
   Fox scored 11 points in the run, including a pair of 3-pointers,
to finish with 13 in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers shot 48.9 percent in the half to take a 65-45 lead
into the intermission.

OTHER PLAYERS MUST STEP UP

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Los Angeles Kings coach Andy Murray says there is
a big difference between his team losing Ziggy Palffy for the rest
of the regular season and the Philadelphia Flyers, who learned
Wednesday they will be without top player Eric Lindros through the
first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that asterisk you see next to their name in the
standings, the one that means they've already qualified for the
playoffs,'' Murray said. ``We're still in a dogfight and probably
will be the rest of the way. But both teams have players who can
step up and keep their teams moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy, the Kings' leading scorer with 66 points, could be out
another three weeks with a sprained right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, 27, was disagnosed Wednesday with a Grade II
concussion, his fourth since March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   This concusssion, suffered March 4 when he was hit in the jaw by
Boston's Hal Gill, is considered the most serious, with greater
memory loss and longer recovery time. There also is fear that his
career might be in jeopardy since Gill's hit was not severe but
more like one of dozens a player could receive in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros aggravated the headaches by taking excessive amounts of
ibeuprofen, the painkiller found in Tylenol. Lindros' younger
brother, Brett, was forced to retire from the NHL in 1996 after
suffering three concussions with the New York Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lindros missed the final seven games of the regular
season and the playoffs because of a collapsed right lung.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Flyers (39-22-12) have continued to play well without
Lindros and coach Roger Neilson, who is undergoing cancer
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' problems are confined to the ice. The loss to Anaheim
extended their winless streak to four. They are fifth in the West,
a point ahead of slumping Phoenix. But with nine games remaining,
the Kings need players to pick up their games.
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's linemate Luc Robitaille does not have a goal in 10
games and just one in the last 14. Robitaille and Murray spoke
Wednesday about the slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he is getting his chances and as long as he gets his
chances, they eventually will go in,'' Murray said. ``He is a
pretty upbeat guy by nature, but he knows how much we need him and
he's probably putting a little pressure on himself.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No Word: The Kings got to Philadelphia around 5 p.m. after a
fuel stop in Cleveland but had not heard whether defenseman Sean
O'Donnell will be disciplined for spearing Mighty Ducks defenseman
Vitaly Vishnevski in Wednesday's game at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell was issued a five-minute major for the incident, which
was viewed as retaliatory for Vishnevski's hard check last
Wednesday that has forced Palffy out of the lineup. Palffy is
expected to miss the rest of the regular season with a sprained
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But all major penalties are reviewed by the league office and
the NHL has been coming down hard on offenders. Recently, San
Jose's Bryan Marchment was suspended three games for spearing the
Ducks' Paul Kariya. &QL;

SCOUTING THE AVENGERS

 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the first time in almost six years, I went the
other day to the training camp of a Los Angeles-based professional
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it was a slightly different experience than it was when I
used to visit the Rams and Raiders, for there were only 30 players
present compared to the 100 or so that would be on hand at each of
the those NFL teams' preseason workout sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Los Angeles Avengers are about as far removed
from being an NFL team as the Los Angeles Clippers now are from
being, well, an NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not that far, but L.A.'s newest professional athletic
franchise does operate in the Arena Football League, which is
staged in venues the approx imate size of Aaron Spelling's front
room and which limits its teams' active roster to fewer members
than can be found in Mike Tyson's entourage (20).
</P>
<P>
   But despite the innate quirkiness of a league known mostly for
the astonishing success of one of its alums, Kurt Warner its field
is a mere 50 yards long and 85 feet wide, punts are prohibited, 8
players to a side, etc. the Avengers already have generated more
than passing interest as evidenced by the 4,000 season tickets
they've sold for their eight home matches at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Long before they've played a game that counts they open in
Michigan against the Grand Rapids team on April 15 the Avengers
even have managed to create some controversy with those 1,380
crude, wacky, politically incorrect billboards that have become so
noticeable around Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely getting some attention,'' says the team's 25-
year-old owner, Casey Wasserman, who's had the genetic good fortune
of being the grandson of the legendary entertainment mogul, Lew
Wasserman.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers are guaranteed of getting plenty of media exposure
this spring, which will be vital for them to succeed in an area
with a well-deserved reputation for being indifferent to such
start-up operations.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of their 14 games will be shown by Fox Sports and another
one will be seen nationally on TNN. All will be broadcast live by
the local One-On-One Sports affiliate, KCTD (1540 AM), with the
charismatic Larry ``Smiley'' Kahn and the aesthetically- pleasing
6-foot-5, 299-pound Cypress resident Mike ``Mr.'' Lamb bringing you
the action.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers held their media gathering Tuesday, and the team's
highest-profile player, Todd Marinovich, was engulfed by reporters
wondering why the one-time starting quarterback of the Raiders
would bother to make another comeback at age 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I still can play and still am capable of providing
excitement,'' says Marinovich, who's certainly been capable of
getting his name in the news over the years with his penchant for
nude surfing and charges of marijuana use.
</P>
<P>
   But Marinovich was actually upstaged by the New York Jets' Pro
Bowl receiver, Keyshawn Johnson, who made an unexpected appearance
at the West Los Angeles College facility where the Avengers are
training and where Johnson performed his heroics before attending
USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling great, but I have no idea what's going on with the
Jets,'' says Johnson, who's been involved in a major contract
struggle with the Jets. ``I've been working out like crazy. My
weight's perfect at 215. But my future? Who knows what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson came at the behest of Wasserman, a pleasant fellow with
a boyish face who put up $5 million in November of 1998 for the
rights to the expansion franchise and figures to spend another $3
million this year in expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be in for at least $8 million before the season
concludes,'' says Wasserman coolly. ``We're hoping to have some
good crowds. There have been plenty of positive signs. The season
tickets sales have been good. We've received tremendous corporate
support. Staples Center has become a hot place to be in L.A. And I
think there are a lot of football fans around here thirsting to see
the sport in person.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, as the Avengers' 29-year old, 6-3, 300-pound center, Joe
Burgos, who had played the past four seasons for New Jersey, said,
``It's still football we play. There's plenty of hitting, blocking,
tackling, passing and running. And a whole lot of scoring. It's
just that we play football in a confined area, and everything moves
so much more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing to happen to the Arena Football League was the
tremendous season Kurt Warner had with the St. Louis Rams,'' says
Wasserman. ``You couldn't buy the publicity our league received
because of Warner. That did more for our credibility and visibility
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   For many professional football-deprived L.A. fans, the Avengers
might well fill a vacuum, especially if Marinovich is able play
like he did when he was at USC.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers' coach, Stan Brock, insists it is not even a
certainty that Marinovich will be a starter, and that he must beat
out a four-year Arena League veteran named Scott Semptimphelter.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a cherished L.A. ritual soon might be revived.
</P>
<P>
   But I doubt a Todd Marinovich-Scott Semptimphelter quarterback
debate will incite the passions of fans around here like the one in
the 1960s between Roman Gabriel and Bill Munson, or the one in the
1970s between Pat Haden and James Harris, or the one in the 1980s
between Jay Schroeder and Steve Beuerlein, or the one in the 1990s
between Jim Everett and T.J. Rubley.

LAKERS WIN EASILY, GIVE STARTRS NICE REST
</HEADLINE>
 ...LAKERS WRITEHTHRU (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Notice was served officially at Staples Center on
Wednesday night, for those who hadn't yet gotten the memo: The NBA
dog days of spring have officially arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers did their best to simulate meaningful
basketball in a game lacking any sense of intrigue, but that was
the one feat they couldn't accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Golden State Warriors, it was enough just to avoid
injuries, get the starters a long breather and walk away with a
119-96 rout.
</P>
<P>
   What the game lacked in providing entertainment, it made up for
in furthering the Lakers' greater goals: The victory, coupled with
Portland's loss to Detroit, pushed the Lakers' lead over the rival
Trail Blazers to six games, with 13 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers (57-12) have won four in a row, 11 straight at
Staples, 23 of their last 24 overall and have not lost to a Western
Conference opponent since Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a game like this, just to rest,'' said Kobe Bryant,
who then added with a chuckle, ``Gotta kick our legs up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a popular sentiment on the Lakers bench, which was
unfortunate, since the bench was needed to protect a 22-point
fourth-quarter lead. But the Lakers reserves, in their longest run
in months, struggled a bit with their charge, allowing the Warriors
to knock the margin down to 11 before pulling away again.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson, determined to rest Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal
and the rest of his starters, left the reserves in despite the near
mishap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have taken a loss, I do that once in awhile,'' Jackson
said. ``It was their game to win or lose. They got a lead, they had
to go out there and play it. . . . Golden State came out, played
physical, they started playing hard and our players wanted to not
have to get down and play that hard at that time. The referees were
bored with the game, too; they wanted to make it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Shaw, celebrating his 34th birthday, scored 12 of his 14
points in the fourth quarter to lead the late charge. Rick Fox also
scored 14 off the bench and Travis Knight collected a season-high
10 rebounds before fouling out.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little more drama than the starters wanted to see, but
O'Neal _ averaging close to 40 minutes a game _ was grateful to
play a mere 23 minutes, his lowest in any game this season for a
game in which he wasn't ejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of happy that the guys came in and gave me a lot of
rest,'' said O'Neal, who scored 22 points and was forgiving of the
bench's brief letdown. ``It was a long, boring game, and it
happens. It's hard to keep a 30-, 40-point lead. But a win is a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the Warriors (17-50), the Lakers didn't figure to be
tested _ and indeed, they led by as many as 34 points in the third
quarter. But Jackson had expected explosive guard Larry Hughes _
who scorched the Lakers for 41 points two weeks ago _ to at least
make things interesting by giving Bryant a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Give Hughes credit for trying. He scored 26 points on 8-of-22
shooting. But Bryant was resting comfortably on the bench for most
of it as the Lakers established the rout early and sat on it.
</P>
<P>
   Did Bryant want to get back on the floor to shut Hughes down? He
only smiled sheepishly at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``A little bit,'' he said. ``Phil likes messing with me
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant finished with 18 points in 28 minutes _ the longest run
of any starter. Glen Rice added 17 points before sitting to rest
his strained left Achilles' tendon, which he said was ``acting up a
little.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for Jackson to turn the game over to his
bench. By the time the Lakers opened the second quarter _ already
leading 37-19 _ Bryant was the only starter on the floor. Less than
two minutes later, he was on the bench, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy we had a game like this tonight,'' Jackson said.
``It was a perfect opportunity for us to play everybody. . . . It
wasn't pretty, but there were times it was a good game.''

BAXTER HEALTHCARE TO ADD 200 JOBS
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  GLENDALE, Calif. _ Biotechnology giant Baxter Healthcare Corp.
will spend approximately $200 million and add 200 jobs to increase
production of genetically engineered blood therapy products in the
San Fernando Valley area, the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Deerfield, Ill.-based company, the U.S. subsidiary of Baxter
International Inc., is seeking approval from the Food &AMP; Drug
Administration for a $100 million expansion of its Hyland Immuno
manufacturing plant in Thousand Oaks where it makes the lucrative
recombinant therapy, a treatment for hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Baxter sought federal approval to construct an
additional production line at the Thousand Oaks facility built two
years ago and will make a similar proposal to the European Union by
April 30, said company spokeswoman Tali Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter expects to apply for a third production line by June and
hopes to receive approvals for both by the end of the year, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   This will allow the company to triple production of its
recombinant Factor VIII therapy. Demand for the recombinant product
has doubled in the last five years, said Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will represent an increase of 150 jobs by 2001,
bringing the total employee base in Thousand Oaks to approximately
500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to better leverage our manufacturing
capabilities, and continue to deliver innovative products to
patients around the world,'' Thomas Glanzmann, president of
Baxter's Glendale-based Hyland Immuno Division, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Wartik, manager of economic development for Thousand Oaks,
said the expansion would be great for the region. The company
currently occupies a 100,000-square-foot building on Rancho Conejo
Boulevard north of Lawrence Drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is always interested in the maintenance of its job
base, especially when it contributes to the city's economic
vitality,'' said Wartik.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter is also spending $100 million on a new 40,000-square-foot
plasma-processing plant to be located next to its facility in Los
Angeles. It is expected to be operational in 2003, said Kaplan.
</P>
<P>
   The company will hire an additional 50 employees by the end of
the year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This investment reflects the tremendous opportunity we see for
growth in the biosciences area,'' Harry M. Jansen Kraemer Jr.,
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Delgadillo, deputy Los Angeles mayor for economic
development, said officials worked with the company for over a year
in an effort to ensure Baxter would locate its new facility in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just another demonstration of the prominence of
Los Angeles as a center of the biomed industry,'' said Delgadillo.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter, the world's second-largest maker of medical products,
also will invest an additional $200 million to increase its
medical-making ability overseas. Blood therapy products contribute
about $7 billion, or 30 percent, to the company's annual revenue.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Waiting for the shoe to drop
 &HT;    (For release March 26, 2000.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It is with considerable interest _ and foreboding _ that
I noted the jailing of Rev. Al Sharpton in New Jersey. Sharpton
entered prison on Wednesday to begin serving a 10-day term for
obstructing traffic as part of a July 4 Atlantic City demonstration
against police treatment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly, something similar will happen here. The decision of a
federal judge in the custody case of little Elian Gonzalez has once
again stirred passions. These passions first spilled onto the
streets and expressways of Miami late last year when the Department
of Justice determined that Elian, the Cuban lad found floating on a
raft after his mother drowned escaping Cuba, should be sent back to
his father on the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, many arrests were made as misdemeanors. No one
served any time for blocking streets, for preventing people from
going to work or to the market, for paralyzing a city the Cuban
exiles adopted as their capital, and which they now dominate
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Looming is another emotional reaction to the decision of U.S.
District Judge K. Michael Moore, who ruled that the authority to
determine Elian's status rests with Attorney General Janet Reno and
the Justice Department. And Reno keeps saying the child belongs
with his father.
</P>
<P>
   (Ironically, Reno is a native Miamian who is expected to return
here once the Clinton Administration is phased out. She is
thoroughly despised by the Cuban exile community, and I concern
myself for her safety and peace of mind.)
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the judicial finding, I expected the traffic
to begin welling up again. It didn't. But it's coming, I just know
it. One of the most resolute Cuban exile Sharpton-types already has
promised a demonstration, ``a massive one.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest response will come from listeners to
Spanish-language radio, the Pied Piper of exile reaction. In the
past, Spanish-language radio (which tops Arbitron ratings in South
Florida) have stirred exiles to commit civil disobedience, so
there's no reason to expect anything else this time.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Spanish-language airwaves are crowded with
haranguing talk show hosts and agitated callers, upset that the
U.S. judicial system, in interpreting this nation's laws, went
against those who would keep Elian here forever.
</P>
<P>
   So when does the civil disobedience start? No one's quite sure.
Some say to expect it any moment. Others say it will wait until the
appeals process runs its course, likely all the way to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever it comes, there is going to be chaos in Miami's
streets. Angry paraders will wave their Cuban flags, while those
inconvenienced by it will be even angrier _ and spouting ethnic
epithets out of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the police, many of whom are of Cuban heritage, will
be required to enforce the law, to clear the streets. (It was
claimed in the last go-around that the police let the demonstrators
ride roughshod over them, then exiles later counter-claimed that
the police were too rough with them.)
</P>
<P>
   This brings us back to Al Sharpton. In his jail cell, he is
discovering the price he has to pay for his actions. Likely, he
believes it to be worth it. And perhaps he's right.
</P>
<P>
   If the Miami demonstrations cause similar hardships on the
remainder of the community, then it would appear to me that the
perpetrators ought to get the bill for their actions as well: jail
time, even fines.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the community, I doubt that they will. The anti-Castro
fanaticism that grips Miami is genuine, as heartfelt as any of the
American civil rights movement. We may disagree with their methods,
which include trying to muzzle anyone who does not adhere to their
principles, but their cause is so passionate that I doubt any would
shirk from demonstrating in the face of a prison term.
</P>
<P>
   We'll soon know.
</P>

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Court burdens GOP with tobacco issue
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court did
congressional Republicans no favor when it held that the federal
Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate
tobacco as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is congenial to GOP policy inclinations and is
legally defensible against an also strong argument pressed by the
court dissenters. It is not clear that Congress hasn't kept tobacco
regulation within its own purview, as the five-justice majority
ruled. With the record muddled, it is arguably best to default to
congressional authority.
</P>
<P>
   But even the court majority conceded _ indeed, emphasized _ that
tobacco use is the nation's No. 1 public health issue, especially
the industry's addiction of the young as a future victim clientele.
</P>
<P>
   It was the prevention of youth smoking that FDA was trying to
address, and the court, though disallowing that, all but invited
Congress either to license the agency to take it up or to undertake
the matter itself with legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was certainly not the justices' intention to do so,
the ruling hands Democrats another big-stick issue with which to
pound Republicans in this especially crucial election year.
</P>
<P>
   The public health interest here is clear and overwhelming. Even
the industry itself now concedes tobacco is addictive and that its
use sickens and often kills. Tobacco is the leading cause of
preventable diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But what ought to be a bipartisan, in fact a universal interest
in public health is not. As Democrats have become willing in recent
years to regulate tobacco, the GOP has let itself become a virtual
subsidiary of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 through last year, the leading tobacco companies
contributed $14.3 million to the Republican Party and its election
committees, just $3 million to the Democratic Party and its
election committees.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, tobacco companies and their political action
committees gave $2.2 million to GOP organizations and candidates,
$564,000 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco-regulation legislation Democrats are now certain to
push adds to the GOP's already considerable issue woes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are fighting popular gun-control legislation in
tandem with an increasingly shrill gun lobby, another big
contributor. To broad concerns about education, Republicans can
tender, since they believe there is no legitimate national role,
only the constitutionally dubious and otherwise doubtful panacea of
vouchers. And they are again drumming huge tax cuts of the sort
that flopped in Congress last year to vast public indifference.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of their own John McCain's near thing lost of them,
Republicans have even let Al Gore, although himself a political
misdemeanant on such matters, swipe the campaign-reform issue.
</P>
<P>
   Issue debilities don't necessarily translate into candidate
losses; personalities and personal records count. But GOP
candidates are starting the presidential and congressional races
with some pretty heavy luggage.

   LAGUNA SAN IGNACIO, MEXICO _ No place on earth exists like this
distant lagoon in the middle of Mexico's Baja California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Waves gently lap onto deserted shell-strewn beaches and stars
shine by the millions. And one of the sea's most enigmatic
behemoths, the gray whale, is willing to swim up to human beings
and allow a species that has killed them to caress their
barnacle-encrusted backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you scratch them they open their mouths. I even
touched a tongue once,'' laughed whale-watch guide Romualdo
Fischer, one of the local fishermen who used to fear and avoid the
whales until the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say they hope this magical relationship
between human and marine mammal will be preserved forever thanks to
a March 2 decision by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to scrap a
plan to build a salt-mining operation here in partnership with
Japan's Mitsubishi Corp.
</P>
<P>
   An isolated inlet 600 miles south of San Diego and three hours
from the nearest paved road, the San Ignacio Lagoon is the last
gray whale breeding habitat on Baja's coast that is untouched by
commercial development. Every winter, the whales, which were an
endangered species until five years ago, swim into the lagoon after
a 6,000-mile migration from the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Here they mate or give birth and train their young for the
rigors of life. Once hunted to the brink of extinction by Americans
who called them ``devil fish,'' the whales _ which can weigh up to
30 tons _ are now beloved by tourists who delight in the hiss and
spray of their powerful spouts. Hands reach out to pet the whales
as they cavort next to boats, curious to investigate the human
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Mexico's president declared the San Ignacio Lagoon and
a vast 6.2 million-acre desert around it the Vizcaino Biosphere
Reserve, the largest such protected area in Latin America.
Zedillo's decision to call off the salt mine _ which would have
sucked water out of the lagoon and created miles of salt flats _
came after a five-year battle by Mexican and American
environmentalists that many consider the most significant victory
of their generation.
</P>
<P>
   The environmentalists forged a sophisticated model for action
they say could be replicated around the world to win similar fights
to save habitat.
</P>
<P>
   They filed a barrage of lawsuits in Mexican courts, and enlisted
the help of sympathetic scientists and celebrities like James Bond
movie star Pierce Brosnan.
</P>
<P>
   They used the Internet to link supporters in the Americas, Asia
and Europe, and convinced 43 California cities to adopt resolutions
against the plant and 15 U.S.-based mutual funds to pledge not to
invest in Mitsubishi. They started a consumer boycott of Mitsubishi
dealerships as well as other products, in California and bombarded
the company with more than 1 million protest postcards.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they embarrassed the Mexican government and
Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran this campaign like a modern political campaign, but
always with advice from the Mexicans,'' said Fred O'Regan,
president of the Massachusetts-based International Fund for Animal
Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 Mexican environmental groups joined the coalition
to stop the salt mine, and emerged from the experience stronger
than ever. The rule of law, always vulnerable in Mexico, received a
tremendous boost, said Alberto Szekely, the coalition's Mexican
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory for all because we were able to make our
laws prevail,'' Szekely said. ``If the development had been
allowed, protections for all of Mexico's other reserves would have
crumbled.''
</P>
<P>
   Szekely filed repeated lawsuits in Mexico arguing that the
proposed salt mine violated this country's environmental laws and
the rights of fishermen living near the lagoon in a community
called Punta Abreojos. He had already won the suit on behalf of
fishermen in one hearing last October, and he expected his case to
be upheld if the fight had continued.
</P>
<P>
   Szekely also successfully sued Mexican environmental
authorities, forcing them to sanction the government and Mitsubishi
for infractions committed at an existing salt mine about 100 miles
to the north on the edge of another inlet, Scammon's Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   That salt operation was found guilty of dumping batteries and
industrial discharge into a lagoon where whales also congregate.
Allegations of whether wildlife was harmed by these infractions
remain disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican writer and environmentalist Homero Aridjis was the first
person to signal the alarm over the second proposed salt factory.
Trying to protect animal habitat in Mexico, he said, is often a
frustrating exercise because laws are so frequently ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this time President Zedillo saw this had spilled out
beyond borders and that it might damage him politically,'' Aridjis
said with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of this historic victory, however, environmentalists
now face the challenge of addressing the concerns of several
thousand fishermen in this isolated area who would like more stable
jobs and better education, health care and infrastructure here.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, environmentalists acknowledged, they now run the risk
of being seen as rich interlopers with little credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``The environmental community needs to demonstrate that it's not
just going to walk away from these people,'' said Robert F. Kennedy
Jr., a leading critic of the salt mine who flew to the lagoon this
month with other activists to celebrate Zedillo's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Council,
an American environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   On the east side of the lagoon, residents must truck in their
drinking water from the nearest desert oasis, which is several
hours away. There is no high school, and only parents that can
afford room and board send their children away to study. Doctors
only visit the area every few weeks. And there is no power source
except for a few solar panels.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fishermen already are developing campsites and whale
watching for tourists here. But that activity only lasts for
several months out of the year. Most have to seek work elsewhere or
return to fishing full-time to make a living. Some initially
supported the salt mine, which would have provided construction
employment, 200 permanent jobs and cash for the area.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Peon, a fisherman who also owns a landing strip near the
lagoon, said most local residents turned against the project
because they feared it would spoil their fishing and nascent
whale-watching operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Peon offered a cautionary tale, explaining that people might
still be tempted to mismanage the lagoon if they face economic
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Some years back, Peon said, fishermen in his cooperative had
such a dismal year they gave themselves permission to illegally
slaughter endangered sea turtles here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ate them and sold them,'' Peon said. ``I know if people in
the United States read this it will drop like a bomb . . . But
families were desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   To show they mean business with the fishermen, Mexican
environmentalists brought community development experts with them
on the victory tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next battle is to bring these people what they need and
what they deserve,'' said Melba Pria, director-general for Mexico's
National Institute for Indigenous Affairs. Experienced in
developing jobs in areas that are culturally and environmentally
sensitive, Pria personally opposed the salt factory.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Punta Abreojos, which sits on the ocean near the
mouth of the lagoon, could provide a model for well-managed fishing
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The village of 1,000 inhabitants has run a fishing cooperative
since the 1930s that exports abalone, lobster and other seafood to
Asia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative is so prosperous, said Ana Maria Sandoval, that
she and her eight siblings were all able to attend schools of
higher education and become professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Punta Abreojos was almost solidly against the salt mine, which
would have placed an enormous ocean pier in the middle of sensitive
lobster habitat the community depends on.
</P>
<P>
   The town threw a feast and celebration for environmentalists
after Zedillo announced the salt mine's demise. Children sang songs
_ ``Pollution! No! No! No!'' _ and oysters and lobsters sizzled on
a beachside grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The salt company tried to convince us by saying they would
pave our streets. They would bring us a big highway. said Brenda
Gayita, a university student home for a visit. ``But in exchange
for what?''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   While the environmentalists assembled scientists who argued that
the salt plant would disturb the lagoon's sensitive ecosystem _ and
the whales _ Mitsubishi fought back with its own team of experts,
who contended that whales had co-existed well with the salt
operation on Scammon's Lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Wechselblatt, a vice president of public relations at
Mitsubishi International in New York, said the environmentalists
ultimately won by portraying themselves as ``David against
Goliath.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, President Zedillo saved face for the government and
Mitsubishi by declaring that the salt-mining operation probably was
compatible with the lagoon, but would certainly disturb the
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, some environmentalists suggested, may have also been
reluctant to allow a allow a controversial development in an area
that was designated a United Nation's World Heritage Site in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Andres Rosental, Mexico's former ambassador to the United
Nations, also suggested that Mexican authorities are more attuned
to the demands of environmentalists now.
</P>
<P>
   Rosental _ who knows Zedillo _ was a powerful lobbyist against
the salt mine, enlisting the help of Mexican entrepreneurs who
donated space to put up billboards in Mexico City denouncing the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until now,'' Rosental said, ``Mexico has had a reputation
for being easier to do business in than the United States or Canada
when it comes to environmental laws. But this now shows that the
government can't just plow ahead as it has done in the past.''

   LAGUNA SAN IGNACIO, MEXICO _ No place on earth exists like this
distant lagoon in the middle of Mexico's Baja California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Waves gently lap onto deserted shell-strewn beaches and stars
shine by the millions. And one of the sea's most enigmatic
behemoths, the gray whale, is willing to swim up to human beings
and allow a species that has killed them to caress their
barnacle-encrusted backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when you scratch them they open their mouths. I even
touched a tongue once,'' laughed whale-watch guide Romualdo
Fischer, one of the local fishermen who used to fear and avoid the
whales until the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say they hope this magical relationship
between human and marine mammal will be preserved forever thanks to
a March 2 decision by Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo to scrap a
plan to build a salt-mining operation here in partnership with
Japan's Mitsubishi Corp.
</P>
<P>
   An isolated inlet 600 miles south of San Diego and three hours
from the nearest paved road, the San Ignacio Lagoon is the last
gray whale breeding habitat on Baja's coast that is untouched by
commercial development. Every winter, the whales, which were an
endangered species until five years ago, swim into the lagoon after
a 6,000-mile migration from the Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Here they mate or give birth and train their young for the
rigors of life. Once hunted to the brink of extinction by Americans
who called them ``devil fish,'' the whales _ which can weigh up to
30 tons _ are now beloved by tourists who delight in the hiss and
spray of their powerful spouts. Hands reach out to pet the whales
as they cavort next to boats, curious to investigate the human
cargo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Mexico's president declared the San Ignacio Lagoon and
a vast 6.2 million-acre desert around it the Vizcaino Biosphere
Reserve, the largest such protected area in Latin America.
Zedillo's decision to call off the salt mine _ which would have
sucked water out of the lagoon and created miles of salt flats _

INTERNET DELIVERER KOZMO DROPS LIQUOR FROM MENU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An instant-gratification Internet delivery company,
Kozmo.com, has abruptly withdrawn its applicaton to include liquor
on its products menu following pressure from college officials and
police.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University, Boston University, Boston College, and the
Boston Police Department raised concerns about the company's plans
to deliver everything from six-packs of beer to bottles of Dom
Perignon at no charge to its growing base of customers throughout
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they expressed concern, and we're not
trying to rush this,'' said Will Weddleton, general manager of the
Boston branch of Kozmo.com, a free Internet service that promises
delivery of everything from CDs to Twinkies in less than an hour.
``We're delaying this process to make sure there's plenty of time
to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But university officials and police say they're not interested
in a dialogue. The bottom line for them: Kozmo.com can deliver as
much junk food as it wants, but it can't peddle alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have zero tolerance to underage drinking in this city,''
said Captain William B. Evans, commander of the police department's
Allston-Brighton Precinct, who helped organize local universities
to oppose the Boston Licensing Board's approval of a liquor license
for Kozmo.com. ``We just see this as a way of putting alcohol in
the hands of underage drinking. Who's going to be at that door to
see who's checking their IDs? We have a hard enough time now. We
don't want to open any doors. Really, it's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The protests against Kozmo's expansion come at a crucial time
for the New York-based upstart.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of reversing last year's losses of $26.4 million, the
company filed Wednesday to raise as much as $150 million through an
initial public sale of stock. Kozmo.com, which has more than
100,000 customers in six US cities, plans to offer its menu of
snacks, videos, and brand products such as Starbucks coffee in at
least 10 additional markets by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the online delivery service could lose a sizable market if
officials in Boston and other cities block the company from getting
an alcohol license. Kozmo.com is seeking liquor licenses in other
cities, but has yet to win approval anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The company's local branch in Allston has another problem: The
landlord of its large warehouse on McDonald Avenue is Harvard
University. And school officials have already told Weddleton that
the company would be violating the terms of its lease if it starts
delivering alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sat down with them last week, we said we appreciated
that they had postponed their application,'' said Kevin McCluskey,
director of community relations at Harvard. ``But we said it would
be better if they withdrew it permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo officials, however, say they hope they can work out a deal
with Boston, which is home to some 100,000 college students, many
of whom are well-acquainted with the free service. The company
might ban all alcohol deliveries to college campuses, restrict beer
runs in certain zip codes, and limit the amount of alcohol and the
number of deliveries it would make to certain addresses, Weddleton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that wouldn't be enough for many local university
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would fly in the face of everything we've been working on
to control students' access to alcohol,'' said Jack Dunn, spokesman
for Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear we're going to oppose this,'' said Colin
Riley, spokesman for Boston University, where about 88 percent of
students are under age 21. ``We can't envision any way that this
would work.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE SOFT UNDERBELLY OF 'SOFT MONEY'
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release
 &HT;    Sunday, March 26.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Who knows? Perhaps we'll wake up between now and
Election Day to find that George W. Bush and Al Gore have renounced
soft money, the unlimited contributions they busily solicit from
just about every possible source.
</P>
<P>
   After having all but ignored soft money in the previous race for
the White House, the press has now decided to make a very big deal
out of it. (The soft money issue did make a late splash in the 1996
contest, but that's only because of a sizzling Chinese angle.)
</P>
<P>
   Since then, John McCain has pursued the need to ban soft money
as his political Holy Grail. On his return from Bora Bora, the
senator called on both presidential candidates to eschew soft
money. And Gore has issued his own separate challenge to Bush along
those lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, Bush could wind up as a martyr on the stake of
media vengeance and McCain's wrath. But, thus far, he's chosen to
hold fast to his faith in the power of money to win elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is to be able to encourage individuals to
participate in the process so I can get my message out, so I can
fight through the (media) filter,'' Bush said in explaining his
refusal. Well, viva 'soft money' if it can do the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to bear in mind that after this summer's
political conventions, it'll be illegal for either candidate to
spend so much as a dime that hasn't come from the taxpayers'
pockets. That's because they will opt to fund their general
election campaigns out a special $3-a-head contribution _ it's not
a surtax _ that income tax filers can check off on their federal
returns.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``hard money'' outlays will be off limits to Bush and
Gore as well.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a bit of history: Since 1907, it has been illegal for
corporations to spend any money in a federal election. Since 1947,
it has been illegal for labor unions to spend any money in federal
elections. And since 1974, it has been illegal for anybody to
contribute more than $1,000 to a federal candidate, or more than
$20,000 a year to a political party to use in any way the party
chooses, including directly supporting its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   So all that's left for Bush and Gore to renounce is soft money,
which they can't use directly.
</P>
<P>
   One major school of thought argues that soft money donations
unfairly tilt the political playing field. ``Money is property;
money is not speech,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a recent
Supreme Court opinion that upheld the right of a state to limit
soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has also come close to passing such a federal statute:
at one time, 58 of the needed 60 senators voted for an outright
ban. But until two more come along, soft money remains protected by
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   So, try as they might to get the press hounds unleashed by
McCain off their flanks, Bush and Gore remain powerless to keep any
rich person from saying what he or she will about them.
</P>
<P>
   Were they to collude with those rich guys in mounting an ad
campaign, then all involved could conceivably go to jail. In point
of fact, Bush says that's just what Gore did four years ago, aided
and abetted by his boss in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's known as having your issue and spending it too.

<P>
   ``Gerry, does that cup have a chip in it?''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Sarah has spied the most minute defect in her
Crown Sapphire cup, part of her Wedgwood wedding china that she's
taken to traveling with.
</P>
<P>
   Her publicist, who's unpacking the tea set from a huge leather
satchel, confirms the damage. Sarah passes it off with a shrug and
goes on to explain how a traveling tea service came to be part of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working for Wedgwood, I said, `Why don't we
make a case so we can bring a tea service with us like Queen
Victoria?' I actually was being rather funny, thinking no one would
go for it, because it is such trouble to carry around. But I like
having tea out of a cup and saucer. My mother always said it tastes
better, and it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah knows quite a bit about the way Queen Victoria traveled,
having retraced her royal journeys through Europe for a remarkable
book, ``Travels with Queen Victoria,'' a companion to her first
publication, ``Victoria and Albert: Life at Osborne House.''
</P>
<P>
   An editor before her marriage, Sarah knew how to produce books.
She teamed up with a photographer and a researcher for both
projects, drawing on the queen's voluminous diaries and travel
sketchbooks, housed in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Victoria was wonderfully original,'' Sarah says. ``Off
she went in a horse and carriage to the Italian lakes and mountains
where few people traveled. She had a great sense of adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   And a great sense of history. In addition to her diaries,
Victoria journeyed with a watercolor box, sketching scenery and
supplementing her own painted views with commissioned watercolors
of gilded interiors, banquets and balls. Back in England, she and
Albert would spend nostalgic evenings assembling comprehensive
souvenir albums.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has the same instinct for documentation. Quite a
proficient artist and photographer, she brought along her own
watercolor box and in Coburg, Germany, unwittingly painted the
exact same view the queen had.
</P>
<P>
   Like her royal predecessor, she made sure all her mementos found
their way into leatherbound scrapbooks, and in this effort was
helped by ``my journal lady, Ann Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule Sarah keeps paintings, photographs and press clips,
but no diaries. ``It's very sad, she says with a sigh, ``but media
and communications are different nowadays. If I kept a diary and it
fell into the wrong hands, it would just be awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Victoria, she points out, wrote freely, knowing her
daughter Beatrice could be counted on to go through her diaries
after her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatrice burned hundreds of pages,'' Sarah says. ``I think she
cleaned up things that would be misunderstood if made public _
sharp comments written before an argument was patched up, that sort
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunninghill Park, Sarah's home, scrapbooks take up an entire
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine are green, Beatrice's are maroon and Eugenie's are
blue,'' says Sarah, referring to her daughters, 9 and 11, for whom
she also keeps meticulous records. ``I've saved everything they
have ever drawn, all their writings, every sticky note that says `I
love you,' every little `Welcome home, Mummy.' I like everything to
be kept beautifully for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The children, she says, are the centerpiece of her life. ``I
believe in giving them time,'' explains Sarah, who adds that she
dislikes the English custom of putting children at a separate table
in the kitchen during parties. ``We always eat together, which I
think is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   When she isn't traveling as a spokesperson, a job she does only
in the United States, Sarah tries to arrange her schedule according
to the girls' school hours. ``I still have all my charity work to
do and all my work in Poland and Europe,'' she says. ``But at least
the European flights are just one hour, and then I can be back in
time to pick the girls up from school.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently on plane trips, she's writing thank-you's, having
received 522 gifts and notes for her 40th birthday last October.
``Look at that lump on my finger,'' she says. ``I believe in the
fountain pen and the handwritten thank-you.''
</P>
<P>
   A great one for manners, which she defines as ``acts of
kindness,'' she credits her standards to her mother (``her manners
were impeccable'') and is intent on passing them on to her
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `Always remember that you are just like anybody
else,''' she says, and then recites a line from Rudyard Kipling's
poem, ``If'' _ ``If you can ... walk with Kings _ nor lose the
common touch ...''
</P>
<P>
   Manners, Sarah maintains, are quite different from protocol,
which she characterizes as ``a rule book designed by monarchs,''
and she has much less use for such tradition-bound restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as a royal rebel, she takes a modicum of inspiration
from Queen Victoria, citing an incident in Coburg where Victoria
saw the townspeople cooking bratwurst in the square.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought, `How on earth am I going to try this, because I'm
not allowed to break protocol to go out into the Market Square to
eat sausage?''' Sarah recounts. ``And so she asked one of her
ladies to run down to the Market Square in the dead of night and
bring a sausage back to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has found her own way out of the constraints of royalty
and she's off to Bloomingdale's to do what would be unseemly in
Britain: lecture on table-setting (not surprisingly she's a great
believer in rule-breaking mixes of patterns).
</P>
<P>
   Her tea set, now packed securely in its blue leather case, will
follow, a very large reminder of her affection for Queen Victoria.

</P>
<P>
   ``It's a myth that your fine china should be saved for the
holidays,'' says Sarah, who likes to think of innovative ways to
mix both the formal and the casual.
</P>
<P>
   She'll use her wedding china, but shape a centerpiece around a
daughter's art project. Since she travels frequently, she likes to
use maps and souvenirs to prompt international discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she gathers family heirlooms or finds old photos of
friends to set at each place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with what you already have, like your family china and
linens, and have fun by changing the details,'' she says. &QL;

<P>
   Most of us don't exactly think ``great investment'' when we
think of posters. But movie posters are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   America's obsession with film, combined with movie posters'
striking imagery, has transformed yesterday's dorm-room wall
coverings into valuable art. A ``Dr. No'' poster you could have
bought for a couple of bucks in 1962, for example, now sells for as
much as $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out which current poster will be the next ``Dr. No,''
however, is tougher than ever. As demand has grown, opportunistic
dealers have passed off copies as originals, and movie studios have
diminished values with large print runs.
</P>
<P>
   It's as true for movie posters as for any other kind of art: Buy
what you love. Posters of films you like that also feature strong
visual images are most likely to please your eye and your wallet.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to increase the odds of owning a winner,
follow these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. BEWARE OF COPYCATS. &LR;  An original movie poster has investment
potential; a reproduction does not. Unfortunately, most copies of
contemporary posters are so good that even the experts are often
left scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a poster that measures 41-by-27-inches (the old
standard American ``one sheet'' size, now seldom used for either
originals or copies), is a more unusual size (the gigantic
three-sheet, especially, or the smaller half-sheet or lobby card)
or is printed on both sides (for placement in theater light boxes),
the odds are good that it's an original.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's a printing date or company name _ Portal
Publishing is one major producer _ in small type at the bottom of
the poster, you're looking at a copy.
</P>
<P>
   These indicators aren't foolproof, however. Jose Ma. Carpio, a
consultant for Sotheby's and the owner of poster gallery Cinemonde,
cites one example of a collector who tried to do it himself on eBay
and bought a poster for $6,000: ``When it arrived, it was a color
Xerox.''
</P>
<P>
   Galleries such as Carpio's Cinemonde in San Francisco
(415-776-9988) and the Motion Picture Arts Gallery in New York
(212-223-1009 or www.mpagallery.com) are good sources for
originals, but there are also many smaller dealers across the
country. See ``Learning the Ropes,'' below, for your best
resources.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ... OSCAR. &LR;  Posters of Academy
Award-winning films are more likely to become collectors' items,
but because studios print more of them, they're often less
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Look for surprise hits: Relatively few posters were made for
``Life Is Beautiful,'' for example, so they're worth more.
</P>
<P>
   Historical subject matter also makes for broader and more
lasting appeal, which is why ``Schindler's List'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan'' have already proven good investments.
</P>
<P>
   You should also find out if any print runs were noteworthy. One
``Titanic'' poster, for instance, mistakenly left out actress
Gloria Stuart's name and was printed only in small quantities; it's
much more valuable than other versions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. DEPEND ON DISNEY. &LR;  Disney restricts the number of posters
made for each of its movies, and the company's readiness to file
copyright-infringement suits means there are fewer illegal
reprints. Plus, Disney's artwork and subject matter have great
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, appreciation has been high: A 1967 ``Jungle
Book'' one-sheet cost $75 in the early '90s and recently sold for
$584 at Sotheby's. New posters should see similar returns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. BUY GENERIC. &LR;  Nowadays, vintage posters from certain genres
_ horror films, movies with all-black casts _ are especially
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Which current genres might do well in the future? As we move
into the 21st century, John Kisch, author of the ``Poster Price
Almanac,'' recommends posters of movies with futuristic themes:
``Blade Runner'' and, more recently, ``The Matrix'' have done well
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Carpio adds that since movie-poster collecting is primarily a
male hobby, action movies are a good choice, particularly if they
star a popular male actor. Consider upcoming James Bond films or
those in the new ``Star Wars'' series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. STUDY ABROAD. &LR;  If you think an American film will have
long-term interest, look out for a foreign version of its poster.
These can be quite valuable, since even the biggest blockbusters
typically have more limited distribution abroad, and different
printing and artwork make them novel.
</P>
<P>
   An American poster for ``The Terminator'' sells for $100 to
$200, according to Christie's consultant Tony Nourmand; the Czech
version costs $400 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. BE AN EARLY BIRD _ OR FASHIONABLY LATE. &LR;  If an upcoming film
is predicted to be a hit, get an advance-release poster. They're
usually printed with high-quality techniques on very good paper and
in limited numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pulp Fiction'' advance poster now sells for about $150 _
and it's gone for as much as $316 at Sotheby's _ compared with $35
to $50 for the regular one-sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, watch out for rerelease posters of films that might
be a couple of years old; they occasionally feature better images
or designs than the originals, which make them more attractive to
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. GET AN AIRTIGHT RETURN POLICY. &LR;  Always pay with a credit
card, and make sure your dealer will allow you to return your
poster at any time if it's not what you expected. Otherwise, Carpio
says, you should take your business elsewhere.

<P>
   ``Gerry, does that cup have a chip in it?''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Sarah has spied the most minute defect in her
Crown Sapphire cup, part of her Wedgwood wedding china that she's
taken to traveling with.
</P>
<P>
   Her publicist, who's unpacking the tea set from a huge leather
satchel, confirms the damage. Sarah passes it off with a shrug and
goes on to explain how a traveling tea service came to be part of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working for Wedgwood, I said, `Why don't we
make a case so we can bring a tea service with us like Queen
Victoria?' I actually was being rather funny, thinking no one would
go for it, because it is such trouble to carry around. But I like
having tea out of a cup and saucer. My mother always said it tastes
better, and it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah knows quite a bit about the way Queen Victoria traveled,
having retraced her royal journeys through Europe for a remarkable
book, ``Travels with Queen Victoria,'' a companion to her first
publication, ``Victoria and Albert: Life at Osborne House.''
</P>
<P>
   An editor before her marriage, Sarah knew how to produce books.
She teamed up with a photographer and a researcher for both
projects, drawing on the queen's voluminous diaries and travel
sketchbooks, housed in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Victoria was wonderfully original,'' Sarah says. ``Off
she went in a horse and carriage to the Italian lakes and mountains
where few people traveled. She had a great sense of adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   And a great sense of history. In addition to her diaries,
Victoria journeyed with a watercolor box, sketching scenery and
supplementing her own painted views with commissioned watercolors
of gilded interiors, banquets and balls. Back in England, she and
Albert would spend nostalgic evenings assembling comprehensive
souvenir albums.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has the same instinct for documentation. Quite a
proficient artist and photographer, she brought along her own
watercolor box and in Coburg, Germany, unwittingly painted the
exact same view the queen had.
</P>
<P>
   Like her royal predecessor, she made sure all her mementos found
their way into leatherbound scrapbooks, and in this effort was
helped by ``my journal lady, Ann Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule Sarah keeps paintings, photographs and press clips,
but no diaries. ``It's very sad, she says with a sigh, ``but media
and communications are different nowadays. If I kept a diary and it
fell into the wrong hands, it would just be awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Victoria, she points out, wrote freely, knowing her
daughter Beatrice could be counted on to go through her diaries
after her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatrice burned hundreds of pages,'' Sarah says. ``I think she
cleaned up things that would be misunderstood if made public _
sharp comments written before an argument was patched up, that sort
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunninghill Park, Sarah's home, scrapbooks take up an entire
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine are green, Beatrice's are maroon and Eugenie's are
blue,'' says Sarah, referring to her daughters, 9 and 11, for whom
she also keeps meticulous records. ``I've saved everything they
have ever drawn, all their writings, every sticky note that says `I
love you,' every little `Welcome home, Mummy.' I like everything to
be kept beautifully for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The children, she says, are the centerpiece of her life. ``I
believe in giving them time,'' explains Sarah, who adds that she
dislikes the English custom of putting children at a separate table
in the kitchen during parties. ``We always eat together, which I
think is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   When she isn't traveling as a spokesperson, a job she does only
in the United States, Sarah tries to arrange her schedule according
to the girls' school hours. ``I still have all my charity work to
do and all my work in Poland and Europe,'' she says. ``But at least
the European flights are just one hour, and then I can be back in
time to pick the girls up from school.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently on plane trips, she's writing thank-you's, having
received 522 gifts and notes for her 40th birthday last October.
``Look at that lump on my finger,'' she says. ``I believe in the
fountain pen and the handwritten thank-you.''
</P>
<P>
   A great one for manners, which she defines as ``acts of
kindness,'' she credits her standards to her mother (``her manners
were impeccable'') and is intent on passing them on to her
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `Always remember that you are just like anybody
else,''' she says, and then recites a line from Rudyard Kipling's
poem, ``If'' _ ``If you can ... walk with Kings _ nor lose the
common touch ...''
</P>
<P>
   Manners, Sarah maintains, are quite different from protocol,
which she characterizes as ``a rule book designed by monarchs,''
and she has much less use for such tradition-bound restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as a royal rebel, she takes a modicum of inspiration
from Queen Victoria, citing an incident in Coburg where Victoria
saw the townspeople cooking bratwurst in the square.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought, `How on earth am I going to try this, because I'm
not allowed to break protocol to go out into the Market Square to
eat sausage?''' Sarah recounts. ``And so she asked one of her
ladies to run down to the Market Square in the dead of night and
bring a sausage back to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has found her own way out of the constraints of royalty
and she's off to Bloomingdale's to do what would be unseemly in
Britain: lecture on table-setting (not surprisingly she's a great
believer in rule-breaking mixes of patterns).
</P>
<P>
   Her tea set, now packed securely in its blue leather case, will
follow, a very large reminder of her affection for Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>

 &UR; SIDEBOX: SETTING A ROYAL TABLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a myth that your fine china should be saved for the
holidays,'' says Sarah, who likes to think of innovative ways to
mix both the formal and the casual.
</P>
<P>
   She'll use her wedding china, but shape a centerpiece around a
daughter's art project. Since she travels frequently, she likes to
use maps and souvenirs to prompt international discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she gathers family heirlooms or finds old photos of
friends to set at each place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with what you already have, like your family china and
linens, and have fun by changing the details,'' she says. &QL;

   ``Gerry, does that cup have a chip in it?''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room, Sarah has spied the most minute defect in her
Crown Sapphire cup, part of her Wedgwood wedding china that she's
taken to traveling with.
</P>
<P>
   Her publicist, who's unpacking the tea set from a huge leather
satchel, confirms the damage. Sarah passes it off with a shrug and
goes on to explain how a traveling tea service came to be part of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started working for Wedgwood, I said, `Why don't we
make a case so we can bring a tea service with us like Queen
Victoria?' I actually was being rather funny, thinking no one would
go for it, because it is such trouble to carry around. But I like
having tea out of a cup and saucer. My mother always said it tastes
better, and it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah knows quite a bit about the way Queen Victoria traveled,
having retraced her royal journeys through Europe for a remarkable
book, ``Travels with Queen Victoria,'' a companion to her first
publication, ``Victoria and Albert: Life at Osborne House.''
</P>
<P>
   An editor before her marriage, Sarah knew how to produce books.
She teamed up with a photographer and a researcher for both
projects, drawing on the queen's voluminous diaries and travel
sketchbooks, housed in the Royal Library at Windsor Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Queen Victoria was wonderfully original,'' Sarah says. ``Off
she went in a horse and carriage to the Italian lakes and mountains
where few people traveled. She had a great sense of adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   And a great sense of history. In addition to her diaries,
Victoria journeyed with a watercolor box, sketching scenery and
supplementing her own painted views with commissioned watercolors
of gilded interiors, banquets and balls. Back in England, she and
Albert would spend nostalgic evenings assembling comprehensive
souvenir albums.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has the same instinct for documentation. Quite a
proficient artist and photographer, she brought along her own
watercolor box and in Coburg, Germany, unwittingly painted the
exact same view the queen had.
</P>
<P>
   Like her royal predecessor, she made sure all her mementos found
their way into leatherbound scrapbooks, and in this effort was
helped by ``my journal lady, Ann Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule Sarah keeps paintings, photographs and press clips,
but no diaries. ``It's very sad, she says with a sigh, ``but media
and communications are different nowadays. If I kept a diary and it
fell into the wrong hands, it would just be awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Victoria, she points out, wrote freely, knowing her
daughter Beatrice could be counted on to go through her diaries
after her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatrice burned hundreds of pages,'' Sarah says. ``I think she
cleaned up things that would be misunderstood if made public _
sharp comments written before an argument was patched up, that sort
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunninghill Park, Sarah's home, scrapbooks take up an entire
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine are green, Beatrice's are maroon and Eugenie's are
blue,'' says Sarah, referring to her daughters, 9 and 11, for whom
she also keeps meticulous records. ``I've saved everything they
have ever drawn, all their writings, every sticky note that says `I
love you,' every little `Welcome home, Mummy.' I like everything to
be kept beautifully for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The children, she says, are the centerpiece of her life. ``I
believe in giving them time,'' explains Sarah, who adds that she
dislikes the English custom of putting children at a separate table
in the kitchen during parties. ``We always eat together, which I
think is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   When she isn't traveling as a spokesperson, a job she does only
in the United States, Sarah tries to arrange her schedule according
to the girls' school hours. ``I still have all my charity work to
do and all my work in Poland and Europe,'' she says. ``But at least
the European flights are just one hour, and then I can be back in
time to pick the girls up from school.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently on plane trips, she's writing thank-you's, having
received 522 gifts and notes for her 40th birthday last October.
``Look at that lump on my finger,'' she says. ``I believe in the
fountain pen and the handwritten thank-you.''
</P>
<P>
   A great one for manners, which she defines as ``acts of
kindness,'' she credits her standards to her mother (``her manners
were impeccable'') and is intent on passing them on to her
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `Always remember that you are just like anybody
else,''' she says, and then recites a line from Rudyard Kipling's
poem, ``If'' _ ``If you can ... walk with Kings _ nor lose the
common touch ...''
</P>
<P>
   Manners, Sarah maintains, are quite different from protocol,
which she characterizes as ``a rule book designed by monarchs,''
and she has much less use for such tradition-bound restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   In her role as a royal rebel, she takes a modicum of inspiration
from Queen Victoria, citing an incident in oburg where Victoria
saw the townspeople cooking bratwurst in the square.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thought, `How on earth am I going to try this, because I'm
not allowed to break protocol to go out into the Market Square to
eat sausage?''' Sarah recounts. ``And so she asked one of her
ladies to run down to the Market Square in the dead of night and
bring a sausage back to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah has found her own way out of the constraints of royalty
and she's off to Bloomingdale's to do what would be unseemly in
Britain: lecture on table-setting (not surprisingly she's a great
believer in rule-breaking mixes of patterns).
</P>
<P>
   Her tea set, now packed securely in its blue leather case, will
follow, a very large reminder of her affection for Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBOX: SETTING A ROYAL TABLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a myth that your fine china should be saved for the
holidays,'' says Sarah, who likes to think of innovative ways to
mix both the formal and the casual.
</P>
<P>
   She'll use her wedding china, but shape a centerpiece around a
daughter's art project. Since she travels frequently, she likes to
use maps and souvenirs to prompt international discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she gathers family heirlooms or finds old photos of
friends to set at each place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Start with what you already have, like your family china and
linens, and have fun by changing the details,'' she says. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Most of us don't exactly think ``great investment'' when we
think of posters. But movie posters are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   America's obsession with film, combined with movie posters'
striking imagery, has transformed yesterday's dorm-room wall
coverings into valuable art. A ``Dr. No'' poster you could have
bought for a couple of bucks in 1962, for example, now sells for as
much as $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out which current poster will be the next ``Dr. No,''
however, is tougher than ever. As demand has grown, opportunistic
dealers have passed off copies as originals, and movie studios have
diminished values with large print runs.
</P>
<P>
   It's as true for movie posters as for any other kind of art: Buy
what you love. Posters of films you like that also feature strong
visual images are most likely to please your eye and your wallet.
</P>
<P>
   But if you'd like to increase the odds of owning a winner,
follow these guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1. BEWARE OF COPYCATS. &LR;  An original movie poster has investment
potential; a reproduction does not. Unfortunately, most copies of
contemporary posters are so good that even the experts are often
left scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   If you find a poster that measures 41-by-27-inches (the old
standard American ``one sheet'' size, now seldom used for either
originals or copies), is a more unusual size (the gigantic
three-sheet, especially, or the smaller half-sheet or lobby card)
or is printed on both sides (for placement in theater light boxes),
the odds are good that it's an original.
</P>
<P>
   But if there's a printing date or company name _ Portal
Publishing is one major producer _ in small type at the bottom of
the poster, you're looking at a copy.
</P>
<P>
   These indicators aren't foolproof, however. Jose Ma. Carpio, a
consultant for Sotheby's and the owner of poster gallery Cinemonde,
cites one example of a collector who tried to do it himself on eBay
and bought a poster for $6,000: ``When it arrived, it was a color
Xerox.''
</P>
<P>
   Galleries such as Carpio's Cinemonde in San Francisco
(415-776-9988) and the Motion Picture Arts Gallery in New York
(212-223-1009 or www.mpagallery.com) are good sources for
originals, but there are also many smaller dealers across the
country. See ``Learning the Ropes,'' below, for your best
resources.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION ... OSCAR. &LR;  Posters of Academy
Award-winning films are more likely to become collectors' items,
but because studios print more of them, they're often less
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Look for surprise hits: Relatively few posters were made for
``Life Is Beautiful,'' for example, so they're worth more.
</P>
<P>
   Historical subject matter also makes for broader and more
lasting appeal, which is why ``Schindler's List'' and ``Saving
Private Ryan'' have already proven good investments.
</P>
<P>
   You should also find out if any print runs were noteworthy. One
``Titanic'' poster, for instance, mistakenly left out actress
Gloria Stuart's name and was printed only in small quantities; it's
much more valuable than other versions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. DEPEND ON DISNEY. &LR;  Disney restricts the number of posters
made for each of its movies, and the company's readiness to file
copyright-infringement suits means there are fewer illegal
reprints. Plus, Disney's artwork and subject matter have great
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, appreciation has been high: A 1967 ``Jungle
Book'' one-sheet cost $75 in the early '90s and recently sold for
$584 at Sotheby's. New posters should see similar returns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. BUY GENERIC. &LR;  Nowadays, vintage posters from certain genres
_ horror films, movies with all-black casts _ are especially
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Which current genres might do well in the future? As we move
into the 21st century, John Kisch, author of the ``Poster Price
Almanac,'' recommends posters of movies with futuristic themes:
``Blade Runner'' and, more recently, ``The Matrix'' have done well
on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Carpio adds that since movie-poster collecting is primarily a
male hobby, action movies are a good choice, particularly if they
star a popular male actor. Consider upcoming James Bond films or
those in the new ``Star Wars'' series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. STUDY ABROAD. &LR;  If you think an American film will have
long-term interest, look out for a foreign version of its poster.
These can be quite valuable, since even the biggest blockbusters
typically have more limited distribution abroad, and different
printing and artwork make them novel.
</P>
<P>
   An American poster for ``The Terminator'' sells for $100 to
$200, according to Christie's consultant Tony Nourmand; the Czech
version costs $400 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. BE AN EARLY BIRD _ OR FASHIONABLY LATE. &LR;  If an upcoming film
is predicted to be a hit, get an advance-release poster. They're
usually printed with high-quality techniques on very good paper and
in limited numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pulp Fiction'' advance poster now sells for about $150 _
and it's gone for as much as $316 at Sotheby's _ compared with $35
to $50 for the regular one-sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, watch out for rerelease posters of films that might
be a couple of years old; they occasionally feature better images
or designs than the originals, which make them more attractive to
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. GET AN AIRTIGHT RETURN POLICY. &LR;  Always pay with a credit
card, and make sure your dealer will allow you to return your
poster at any time if it's not what you expected. Otherwise, Carpio
says, you should take your business elsewhere.
</P>

 &HT;    Heading the Jeep down that long, lonesome highway
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD _ The idea is to see how far I can drive in
three-and-a-half days, to take the Jeep down some rough roads, and
to see a chunk of southwest Texas I've never seen before. That's
about as specific as my itinerary got during a recent jaunt through
West Texas. Before it was over, I had logged 1,500 miles, met a
couple of interesting characters, seen where John Wayne died at the
Alamo in the film version, and eaten some of the best barbecue
that's ever crossed my lips. Here are a few observations from my
time on the road:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Boerne, out in the Hill Country, where a buddy of mine owns
the newspaper, there's a modest ranch with the sign, ``El Rancho
Not So Grande.'' It looked like a mighty nice place to me, but I
guess it's all perspective.
</P>
<P>
   I meandered throughout the Hill Country on this trip, then
dropped south and came up along the Mexican border on U.S. Hwy. 90,
avoiding the interstate because it's boring though efficient,
stopping wherever the mood struck to talk to furniture makers, look
at antiques, buy a copy of the local newspaper and fuel up on
coffee and iced tea.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day, I made my way down a dusty road to Alamo
Village in Brackettville, where dozens of movies have been filmed,
including, of course, John Wayne's ``The Alamo.'' It's eerily
realistic, especially the chapel facade, until you realize there's
nothing behind it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other signs spied along the route:
</P>
<P>
   In Hondo, at the city limits, a sign reads, ``This is God's
Country. Please Don't Drive Through It Like Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   In Knippa, east of Uvalde, a community about the size of a
good-sized Holiday Inn, a sign implored, ``Go Ahead and Blink.
Knippa is Bigger Than You Think.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The mesquite trees are in full leaf. One of my column-writing
heroes, Leon Hale of the Houston Chronicle, makes an annual
pilgrimage through South Texas looking for the first signs of
spring, one of which he claims is when the mesquite trees bud out.
By the look of things on my journey, spring came to South and West
Texas at least a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of mesquite trees, which have always struck me as being
spindly, obnoxious plants that crowd out other, more worthy
vegetation, there are a number of folks in the Uvalde area who
build furniture out of mesquite. Mesquite lumber is reddish with
striking swirls of grain. I stopped outside of Uvalde at a woodshop
whose owner has stack-upon-stack of wide-board mesquite, taken from
trees whose girth is much larger than the trees I've seen on the
side of the road. The furniture he displayed was beautiful _ dining
room tables, dressers, and an elaborate lamp with a shade turned on
a lathe out of a single stump of mesquite. I ended up buying a
couple of boards of mesquite and a piece of pecan to make small
boxes. I may go back for a trailer-load some time.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of the best barbecue that's ever passed my lips can be
had at Haby's Hot Pit in Uvalde, home of Dolph Briscoe, a former
governor and the state's largest private landowner. A framed
article from 1997 on the wall from Texas Monthly names Haby's one
of the top 50 barbecue joints in the state. The brisket was to die
for, and the chicken fell off the bone when you looked at it
crossways. Stop there if you're in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Outside of Del Rio, hard by the Mexican border, I stopped at
Lake Amistad, a dammed-up portion of the Rio Grande. Even though
the level is obviously down because of the drought, it's still an
impressive lake. Fact is, it's hard to believe this is the same
body of water that comprises the state's border with its southern
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of water, Seminole Canyon just west of Amistad is
practically worth the trip by itself. This is where the Pecos River
cuts through on its way to the Rio Grande a few miles south. This
close to the end of its voyage, the Pecos looks like a real river,
and the canyon rivals what can be found in Colorado. It's a far cry
from how the Pecos looks in West Texas, near Fort Stockton where I
ran a weekly in an earlier life. There, it's a modest waterway that
in spots you could walk across, especially in drought times like
these.
</P>
<P>
   _ I ended the westward part of my trip in Fort Davis, where I
revisited the McDonald Observatory and viewed some property my
friends own in the valley below. Then it was a quick visit to
Balmorhea pool where scuba divers mingled with catfish in one of
the largest natural pools in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With Junior Brown picking away on the CD, I buzzed quickly
through Fort Stockton to see that little has changed before heading
east along Interstate 10, back to the pine trees and red-dirt
roads.

 &HT;    Counting the November vote could be slow going
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Even though she's not a candidate, County Clerk
Dana DeBeauvoir is looking forward to the November election with
some trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the scenario: A famous Austinite at the top of the
national ballot in a close race. It's not a stretch to say that the
world waits for his home county to turn in election results. And
waits and waits and waits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a recurring nightmare for DeBeauvoir, who has known
repeatedly the frustration of slow ballot counts. She dodged a
bullet last week by reporting 60 percent of the primary votes by 10
p.m., but was frank in her assessment of that performance: ``The
light turnout saved my bacon.''
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall, DeBeauvoir was busy preparing for last
Tuesday's election by warning people not to expect early results.
She wasn't getting the volunteer help she needed, she said. On top
of that, election judges could be slow in getting the ballot boxes
to the central counting station because they also had precinct
conventions to convene immediately after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   DeBeauvoir was expecting a long night and a rerun of carping
about slow vote counts. She surprised everyone _ maybe even herself
_ with the faster-than-expected tabulations.
</P>
<P>
   She isn't promising miracles in November, though, when Travis
County and Texas will be in a national and international spotlight.
DeBeauvoir anticipates a heavy turnout because of Gov. George W.
Bush's presence on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And a heavy turnout, while good for democracy, spells trouble
for the clerk. ``I don't think I'm going to make it by 10 p.m.,''
DeBeauvoir said.
</P>
<P>
   While the 10 p.m. deadline is artificial, it is one that
election officials are under pressure to hit to ensure that the
results are read on the nightly news shows. Because ballot boxes
are open only after the polls close at 7 p.m., that gives ballot
counters three hours to compile results. It's a daunting task even
if election judges don't stop for dinner on their way to the
central counting station, don't get stuck in traffic or are
otherwise delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots are sorted and examined by hand to ensure accuracy,
and accuracy is something on which DeBeauvoir prides herself.
County Commissioner Karen Sonleitner notes that whatever other
complaints people have about Travis County vote counts, challenges
for accuracy are rare.
</P>
<P>
   DeBeauvoir has been pushing commissioners for updated equipment
that may help speed up the vote count, but it isn't cheap and
commissioners have thus far resisted, citing other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The county will have to replace the 10-year-old ballot counting
technology sometime, but not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of if, but when, we get a new system,'' said
Sonleitner, who knows firsthand the agony of a slow count.
Sonleitner, who represents north and northwest Travis County, won
re-election two years ago, but it was a long and agonizing wait for
results.
</P>
<P>
   It was tough, she said, but she lived. While obviously open to
the idea of a new counting system, a high-profile election year is
not the time to test something new.
</P>
<P>
   Better, Sonleitner said, to wait until next year, when the
electoral action will be less intense, to try different equipment.
</P>
<P>
   County Judge Sam Biscoe and Commissioner Todd Baxter get to the
same conclusion by slightly different routes. Biscoe and Baxter say
they are open to discussing modernizing ballot system, but hesitate
to do it just to make results available in time for the 10 p.m.
newscasts. And, they say, this is not a burning issue with most
voters.
</P>
<P>
   They are right, of course. One hears an awful lot of bellyaching
from political junkies about slow vote counts, but the issue
quickly dissipates.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a different story in November, though, when Travis
County is still counting votes after midnight. DeBeauvoir was
wasting no time last week to warn us about that very prospect.

 &HT;    Makeup pro to celebrities offers advice
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Laura Mercier lands on more magazine
covers than the busiest model.
</P>
<P>
   She's on this month's Harper's Bazaar and last year was on the
front of Mirabella, Marie Claire, More and Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't heard of her? You undoubtedly know the women that
Mercier, a makeup artist and creator of a popular cosmetics line,
makes cover-worthy: Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Ashley Judd, Susan
Sarandon ...
</P>
<P>
   Mercier products can be found on the vanities of celebs (Madonna
and Celine Dion are fans) and in the recent InStyle roundup of the
top foundations, concealers, powders and blushes (four of her
formulas are in the top 17).
</P>
<P>
   The Paris native, and a team of 15 makeup artists, visited Saks
Fifth Avenue in Palm Beach last month for five hours of color
consultations and quickie makeup lessons. Roughly 100 women
participated, and a couple were so enchanted that they asked
Mercier to autograph sponges.
</P>
<P>
   Because her trademark is ``the flawless face,'' we asked Mercier
for her top five tips on creating a smooth-as-silk look, regardless
of the products used.
</P>
<P>
   Laying that groundwork is the most important part of your makeup
routine, says Mercier, 41. ``You can push the eyes, you can push
the lips. But the skin should be realistic and light.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Start with a blank slate. ``The preparation of the canvas is
important,'' Mercier says. A smooth foundation cannot be achieved
unless skin is clean, moisturized and protected from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use a light hand. You want to apply just enough foundation
``that gives a sense of the real skin underneath,'' she says. The
trend now is for foundation that looks shiny and glowy. But when
the pendulum swings back to matte, still ``use the least amount of
foundation possible.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Attack imperfections one by one. ``If you have flaws, treat
them separately'' with a concealer, Mercier says. ``Don't try to
cover pimples and flaws with the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're trying to conceal blemishes, Mercier recommends a
brush because it is more precise. A sponge is good for foundation
because the area to be covered is so much larger. Just remember,
when it comes to foundation, the byword is ``sheer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay proper attention to your eyes. If you have dark circles
under your eyes, apply a concealer. ``This is crucial to make an
even look,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But skip foundation around the eyes. The more layers you add,
the more wrinkles will be noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set everything with translucent powder. Take a big, fluffy
brush, dig it into colorless powder and apply a little at a time
around the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   If you used foundation, use a puff with the powder to push the
pigment into the face _ don't rub the puff on your skin or move it
around, just gently push.
</P>
<P>
   Only after you've set the foundation with powder should you move
on to powdered blushes and eyeshadows. Powder on top of powder will
blend easier.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if using creme blush or creme shadows, apply
those before you powder.
</P>
<P>
   Sound complicated? No way, Mercier says. ``It's easy, in fact.
It makes sense.''

 &HT;    In the Grove groove
 &HT;    By Mary Thurwachter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCONUT GROVE, Fla. _ Modern art aficionados are likely to find
the Coconut Grove Bed &AMP; Breakfast especially appealing. Not only is
it in a shaded corner of a historic district, but the
turn-of-the-century home belongs to a Grove artist, Annette
Rawlings, whose work has been exhibited in museums and galleries
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of Rawlings' work _ from tunic dresses and T-shirts to
vases, placemats, dinnerware, paintings and drawings _ are
displayed prominently throughout the two-story house. Guests can
purchase many items, while others adorn the walls of the bedrooms,
hallways and dining area.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't particularly like Rawlings' geometric paintings
with their flowing lines, or her abstract nudes, you may prefer a
more conventional inn. My husband, who appraises art, appreciated
the textiles and paintings far more than I did. But Rawlings'
ceramic pieces, with their bright colors, and swirling lines,
intrigued me.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed in the front bedroom facing the road. It had a
comfortable king-size bed, television, phone, modern white desk and
chair, fresh flowers, and several of the artist's paintings. It had
everything we needed and one thing we didn't: traffic noise. We
couldn't believe how many cars zoomed through this historic
district before midnight. Undoubtedly, the back bedroom would have
been better, but it had already been booked.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there was plenty to like about our visit to Rawlings'
casa. The breakfast, for example, was delightful _ and well
presented. There was orange juice and coffee, of course, but I
especially liked the Belgian waffles, topped in a colorful design
of raspberries and whipped cream. The napkins and dinnerware were
of her own design.
</P>
<P>
   We also enjoyed sitting on the back porch for a picnic before
heading to an antique show at The Mayfair Hotel. We watched the
Rawlings' cat totally ignore the squirrels that raced around what
Rawlings said was one of the oldest, largest banyan trees in the
state. This was a very relaxing spot.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the living room with its high ceiling, fireplace and
hardwood floor provided another comfy place to sit and read or
chat.
</P>
<P>
   The house is a mile away from the shopping area that includes
CocoWalk, a fun spot to shop or people-watch, and The Streets of
Mayfair, an open-air, pedestrian-friendly shopping, dining, and
urban entertainment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Monty's Stone Crab, where we had dinner, is a short drive away.
Also close by is Fairchild Tropical Garden, 83 acres with peaceful
paths through horticultural displays, a rainforest, and palm trees
of all varieties. The $8 admission (which included a tram tour) was
worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   For those looking for a small inn close to shopping and
restaurants _ and for those who like the idea of staying in an
artist's house _ the Coconut Grove Bed &AMP; Breakfast is a good place
to stay.

 &HT;    Gish biography lovingly renders a great career
 &HT;    By Scott Eyeman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ On the short list of great actresses of
the recently expired century, Lillian Gish would have to be in the
top five. Not only did she maintain a career for 80 years, she
created indelible images in films. She could do it on stage as
well, with ``A Trip to Bountiful'' and a reputedly great Ophelia
opposite John Gielgud's Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Until her death at age 99 in 1993, Gish symbolized and
personified the history of the movies, and did it with an integrity
that never wavered or became sanctimonious. More than a great
actress, she was a great lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lillian Gish: A Life on Stage and Screen'' (McFarland) is the
first posthumous biography of Gish. It was written by noted
silent-film musician Stuart Oderman, who was helped by a friendship
with Gish that extended for more than 30 years. Oderman has done a
first-rate job of documenting a one-of-a-kind career and a
remarkable life.
</P>
<P>
   BOO! MORE AHEAD FROM STEPHEN KING
</P>
<P>
   Stephen King has re-upped with Simon &AMP; Schuster for three more
books. The first will be a novel titled ``From a Buick Eight.''
King signed with S&AMP;S a couple of years ago in an innovative
arrangement that gave him a high percentage of the proceeds in
exchange for a very low, possibly nonexistent, advance.

 &HT;    Sad story of author's youth may be Anderson's best
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hesper Anderson writes a good first
sentence: ``My mother killed herself on the first day of spring.''
</P>
<P>
   She also knows how to write a quietly spectacular book.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Mountain Road'' is the story of Anderson's youth, more
or less from 12 to 21, from World War II to the mid-'50s, and of
the extended family that was nearly as important as her blood
family.
</P>
<P>
   Among that extended family were Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya,
Milton Caniff, Burgess Meredith, Alan Jay Lerner and his wife of
the moment, and the momentarily popular Marion Hargrove, author of
``See Here, Private Hargrove,'' and Anderson's first great crush.
</P>
<P>
   They all lived in granite castles deep in the Rockland County,
N.Y., woods, near the mountain called High Tor, on and around South
Mountain Road.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrities that Anderson name-drops throughout the book
aren't there for effect, for ``South Mountain Road'' is the story
of a community of artists, people who took care of each other's
children, listened to each other's troubles, worked on each other's
projects and, in one or two cases, were capable of a truly
astonishing cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Cumulatively, she creates an absolutely believable picture of an
entire social structure, of an insecure girl surrounded by
beautiful vessels of talent that only made her more insecure.
</P>
<P>
   There is a haunting sadness here, not merely because of the way
Mab Anderson died, but in the way it all slowly fell apart. The
band of friends drifted away to other climes and other marriages
and, for a time, Hesper Anderson floundered.
</P>
<P>
   Years after her mom's suicide, after she finally found out what
that tormented woman's wound was, Hesper Anderson became a writer
herself, with such movies as ``Children of a Lesser God'' to her
credit.
</P>
<P>
   Those credits are good, but the achievement she's likely to be
remembered for is ``South Mountain Road.''

 &HT;    Calvino gives us posthumous reason to read the classics
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Each year, in the early 1960s at Bishop
Kenny High School in Jacksonville, came the school raffle. We were
supposed to sell at least 10 chances, at $1 each. For those who did
not, a terrible punishment awaited.
</P>
<P>
   The redoubtable Mr. James Durant IV, an eccentric man who taught
us Latin, French and mathematics, would assign the errant slacker a
book report on Pliny's ``Natural History,'' four massive volumes of
close-printed text kept in the morgue of the Jacksonville Public
Library.
</P>
<P>
   Gaius Plinius Secundus was a Roman official who read
voraciously, wrote encyclopedically and perished spectacularly
during the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of having to read him so horrified us that we sold
raffle tickets like born-again Fuller Brush men. Some students
bought tickets themselves, with their own pocket money. Anything to
avoid Pliny!
</P>
<P>
   In our junior year, a classmate named Robert Pippin failed to
sell his quota. I can recall him walking around with one or more of
the four volumes of Pliny under his arm, like a lost soul in hell.
I doubt he read the whole thing, as his book report dealt largely
with the habits of ants. Yet it was unexpectedly fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   But not fascinating enough to make us want to read Pliny. For
that, I had to wait for the splendid ``Why Read the Classics?,'' a
posthumous collection of essays by Italo Calvino. It is really 36
books in one, with Calvino examining great writers and books in
quirky ways that shed new light on old and often neglected
masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Each essay is worth a review in itself, but I will concentrate
on Calvino's fifth piece, ``The Sky, Man, the Elephant,'' in which
he examines Pliny so brilliantly and engagingly that he turns a
punishment into a treat.
</P>
<P>
   People mostly read Pliny, Calvino says, ``to winkle out bizarre
facts and curiosities.'' Even Pliny's index, contained in Book I,
is bizarre. Under fish, he lists ``Fish which have a small stone in
their head; Fish which hide in winter; Fish which are influenced by
the stars; Fish which have fetched extraordinary prices ...''
</P>
<P>
   Calvino goes far beyond this. He finds poetry in Pliny's
description of the moon, the ``ultimate star, the star most
familiar to those who live on earth, their remedy against the
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   He finds philosophy in Pliny's observation that God is less free
than man, in that he cannot kill himself and cannot make someone
who has lived, never to have lived. Calvino ferrets out some of
Pliny's choicest oddities and notes little clues that give us a
picture of the author's mind and heart. He must have been a decent
fellow, for he noted that ``Men's corpses float on their back,
women's on their front, as if nature wanted to respect the modesty
of women even after death.''
</P>
<P>
   Pliny's favorite creature was the elephant, and Calvino notes
that Book 8 of the ``Natural History'' begins with the elephant,
both because of its ``preeminent size'' and because spiritually
this animal is ``closest to man.''
</P>
<P>
   Why closest? Because the elephant recognizes the language of its
native land, obeys orders, memorizes what it has learned,
experiences the passion of love and the thirst for glory, and
practices virtues that men do not always practice: probity,
prudence, fairness and a decent regard for the sun, moon and stars.
</P>
<P>
   In this admiration for elephants, Calvino acutely describes in
Pliny a kind of ecological, almost sociological awareness, an
empathy with other life forms that is very modern, and quite at
odds with the bloodthirsty picture of Roman antiquity we so often
see on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Calvino has accomplished something magical: He has made
you eager to read Pliny. He does the same for other classic
writers, among them Homer, Ovid, Defoe, Voltaire, Stendhal, Balzac,
Flaubert, Dickens, Tolstoy, Twain, James, Conrad, Borges, Hemingway
and obscurer authors like Giammaria Ortes, Raymond Queneau and
Cesare Pavese.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Calvino gives 14 definitions of a
``classic.'' They are brilliant, poetic and occasionally very
funny. A few examples:
</P>
<P>
   ``The classics are those books about which you usually hear
people saying: `I'm rereading...' never `I'm reading...'''
</P>
<P>
   ``A classic is a book which with each rereading offers as much a
sense of discovery as the first reading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A classic is a work which constantly generates a pulviscular
(dusty) cloud of critical discourse around it, but which always
shakes the particles off.''
</P>
<P>
   And, eeriest of all: ``A classic is the term given to any book
which comes to represent the whole universe, a book on a par with
ancient talismans.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a book to be devoured, or gulped down, or listened
to on tape while commuting. It's a classic on classics, and you
come away from each chapter with a quickened understanding, an
enlivened curiosity, a stirred soul. You have been in contact with
a very humane, brilliant man who has introduced you, or
reacquainted you with, humane, brilliant books.
</P>
<P>
   You vow _ again! _ to watch less TV.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Jacksonville, I visited the downtown public
library to see if the once-dreaded Pliny was still there. It is,
all four volumes, edited by John Bostock, M.B., F.R.S. and H.T.
Riley Esq., published by Henry Bohn in London in 1855, and donated
to the library on Dec. 27, 1924.
</P>
<P>
   It had last been checked out on May 19, 1964. Pippin's name
wasn't on the card, but that was the very month he failed to sell
his 10 raffle tickets and became forcibly acquainted with Gaius
Plinius Secundus, his ants, his fish, his moons, his stars, his
handsome and sympathetic elephants.

 &HT;    Geffen biography stirs controversy _ but little else
 &HT;    By Jeff Salamon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The most revealing passage in Tom King's
controversial biography of David Geffen isn't about David Geffen's
sex life, or David Geffen's legendary temper or David Geffen's
infinite capacity for betrayal. In fact, it isn't really about
David Geffen at all.
</P>
<P>
   The most revealing passage in Tom King's controversial biography
of David Geffen is about Tom King.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, King details his strenuous efforts to get
estranged Geffen confidante Joni Mitchell to sit for an interview.
``I wrote her yet another letter and _ at the suggestion of a
friend who had heard Mitchell mention in a National Public Radio
interview that her cat Nietzsche had learned to dance _ I sent a
box of gourmet cat treats to her home in Bel-Air,'' King writes.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell doesn't nibble, but the reader takes note of King's way
with a cat treat and suspects right off why Geffen was at first
drawn to and then repelled by his choice of biographer.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring that a savvy, gay entertainment reporter for The Wall
Street Journal would be a sympathetic observer of a savvy, gay
entertainment mogul, Geffen in 1996 gave King unprecedented access
to his life, clearing the way for the first-time author to
interview nearly 300 associates, right down to his childhood
shrink. A year later, Geffen turned on King and stopped speaking to
him. Oddly, he didn't stop King from continuing to talk to his
friends and colleagues. But as the publication date approached,
Geffen turned again, doing everything he could to get the book
quashed.
</P>
<P>
   All of which would lead one to expect that ``The Operator: David
Geffen Builds, Buys, and Sells the New Hollywood,'' would be a
dazzling and damning narrative of greed, ego and libido run amok.
But there's nothing amok about King's book at all. Rather than
making Geffen seem monstrous, King commits a worse sin: He makes
David Geffen seem boring.
</P>
<P>
   King lines up the story squarely enough. David Geffen was born
in 1943 in Brooklyn, N.Y., to Abe and Batya Geffen, Jewish
immigrants from Russia and the Ukraine. Abe was a ne'er-do-well
whom Geffen looked down on; Batya an iron-fisted seamstress who ran
the household, supported the family and instilled a strong will to
power in her favorite son. (``The Explanation,'' Geffen's
colleagues dubbed her decades later.) Geffen was a small, antic
child, who spent most of his school hours fidgeting and making
trouble. Today, he'd be hooked up to a 24-hour Ritalin drip.
</P>
<P>
   After an abortive semester at the University of Texas convinced
him he wasn't college material, 21-year-old Geffen got his show-biz
start in the William Morris Agency mailroom and, through hard work,
smarts and ethical corner-cutting, quickly moved up. By his late
20s, he had founded Asylum Records, a Warners subsidiary that gave
him the footing to discover and nurture the likes of Jackson
Browne, Joni Mitchell and the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen's personal life was similarly manic. In between
assignations with male prostitutes and short-term dalliances with a
series of younger, usually troubled men, he dated, with a puzzling
intensity, Cher and Marlo Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, his fortunes took a decisive turn for the better when
he sold his second record company, Geffen Records, home of Nirvana
and Guns N' Roses, to MCA for $545 million in stock. When
Matsushita bought MCA a year later at an inflated price, he was,
give or take a hundred million dollars, a billionaire. A few years
and wise investments later, he, Steven Spielberg and Disney refugee
Jeff Katzenberg founded the Dreamworks studio.
</P>
<P>
   This is, to say the least, rich material for a biographer.
Having participated in the gay liberation movement, the media
transformation of the presidency (Geffen has served as an
unofficial adviser to Bill Clinton), and the simultaneous rise of
recreational drugs, psychotherapy, multinational corporations, and
youth culture, Geffen is basically the latter half of the 20th
century stuffed into one convenient 5-foot-7 package. But ``The
Operator,'' despite its ploddingly chronological structure, barely
gets 1979 right _ or any other year you might care to mention.
</P>
<P>
   What King misses, again and again, is how colorful the world of
show business is. Geffen is undoubtedly a lonely guy, but on the
surface, at least, he's led a fabulous life. Exposing the
tawdriness beneath that surface is a worthy enough endeavor, but
you'd have to give the glitz its due to make the project more than
a mug's game. And King, for whatever reasons, seems
constitutionally incapable of sparkling.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen's wild drug- and sex-fueled Studio 54 years, for
instance, would seem like red meat for a biographer. But King
settles for a brief description of the fabled 54 VIP room (``an
amazing space where such diverse luminaries as Elizabeth Taylor and
Mikhail Baryshnikov could be seen sitting on leather banquettes
chatting with the likes of Betty Ford or Jimmy Carter's elderly
mother Lillian'') that makes it sound like the site of a Pat
Moynihan fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Here is his description of Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young's
Woodstock performance, which ``perfectly embodied the mood and
feeling of the festival'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The stage crew brought out the band's amplifiers, and the
musicians went to work delivering their powerful electric set.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost like you're there, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   There's more in this vein. Kurt Cobain, Axl Rose, and Neil Young
pass through these pages and hardly strike a chord. Courtney Love
comes and goes, and the reader isn't even mildly revolted. Beside
making for a duller read than necessary, this lack displaces a key
part of Geffen's context. Since King fails to make clear what is
actually compelling about the record industry, it's easy for him to
portray Geffen's greed and ambition as that much more naked. Give
Geffen this much: He wasn't a junk bond trader or a takeover
vulture _ he worked with artists, and King gives us no reason to
believe that his support for Laura Nyro and Jackson Browne wasn't
informed by a genuine love of their music.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to pin an ulterior motivation on King, but the
book is so scattershot that much can be chalked up to simple
incompetence. On Page 61, Geffen, in his role as a young talent
agent, is trying to pitch ``a hippie named Lorne Michaels and soon
got him a gig writing for a situation comedy.'' Two hundred and
thirty-two pages and 13 years later, Geffen's friend Paul Simon
``introduced him to his neighbor Lorne Michaels, the producer of
NBC's `Saturday Night Live.''' On Page 439, King writes that Warner
Chairman Steve Ross ``had always said he would buy Geffen Records
when Geffen was ready to sell'' _ a statement that blithely ignores
the fact that, 34 pages earlier, Ross refuses Geffen's offer to
sell the company. On Page 311, when Geffen is trying to sign John
Lennon, King states that the two had met previously, on ``that
bizarre night in 1975 when he, Lennon, Cher, and Harry Nilsson had
ended up in Hugh Hefner's hot tub after Phil Spector had waved a
gun at Geffen.'' Unfortunately, the passage about Spector waving a
gun occurs a page after the hot tub episode _ though the narrative
is so muddled it's tough to parse cause and effect.
</P>
<P>
   This is sloppy work, and though King has to take some of the
blame, as much should be laid at the door of Random House, which
seems to have offered its neophyte author almost none of the
support he clearly needed. (Ironically, what he needed was a David
Geffen-type advocate to hold his hand.)
</P>
<P>
   As a result, King hasn't written a biography at all, but a
600-page log. A biography is supposed to be more than a record of a
person's comings and goings; it should offer a reading of someone's
life. But on the rare occasions that King reaches for that level of
interpretation, he fails.
</P>
<P>
   Early on he writes, ``having tossed aside all notions of right
and wrong, young David Geffen simply lived by different rules than
did the rest of society around him.'' This is a staggeringly naive
statement for an entertainment reporter to make. Geffen's rules, in
fact, are identical to those of the world he belonged to. Cheating,
stealing and lying are common occurrences in show business, which
was established by a host of unsavory types (many of them from the
same immigrant Brooklyn milieu that produced Geffen). Say what you
want about David Geffen, but to the best of King's knowledge, he
never got into bed with organized crime, sent Pinkerton workers to
club strikers over the head or bribed government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen may be a loudmouth and a lousy friend, but by Hollywood
standards of predation, he's a piker. In fact, you'd have a tough
time finding a Hollywood fortune that was bought with fewer victims
per dollar. Most of the people in this book with an ax to grind are
millionaires who think they should be multimillionaires and
multimillionaires who think they should be billionaires. Most of
them play the same crooked game, by the same crooked rules, that
Geffen did _ just not as well. But since King fails to provide an
ounce of professional context for Geffen's behavior, it's easy for
him to write the story as a morality tale rather than a social
history.
</P>
<P>
   One cool customer, King seems _ imagine this _ like David Geffen
without the grace notes. Geffen walks all over people, but you
suspect that's because they're too vividly alive for him to deal
with. His belief in their capacity to reject him is so powerful he
has to beat them to the punch by betraying them first. (That they
are then rendered harmless enough to be welcomed back into his good
graces makes sense, though not to King, who reports one
breakup-to-makeup after another without hazarding a guess as to
what's going on.)
</P>
<P>
   King, by contrast, seems barely acquainted with the people in
his own book. Late in ``The Operator,'' he describes Geffen and
agent Sandy Gallin as ``like brothers, having spoken to each other
on average five times a day, every day _ barring other spats _
since the late 1960s.'' Odd, then, that, Gallin makes no more of an
impression on the reader than a half-dozen other show-biz types who
pass wraithlike through these pages. Likewise, Geffen's one-time
lover and longtime friend Bob Brassel is described in a handful of
passages as dramatically struggling with drug addiction _ and then
the matter's dropped. Brassel continues to show up here and there
as a friend and colleague, but whether or not with a monkey on his
back we don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Geffen supposedly lost his lunch when he discovered how much of
his business dealings ``The Operator'' would detail, but the truth
is it bears little substantive malice. It's too disembodied to do
much damage.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that Geffen's rage was instead triggered by the
realization that King was simply too much of a stiff for the book
to make the sort of splash Geffen was hoping for?
</P>
<P>
   If so, give the Operator this much credit: By making a big stink
about King's botch, he drove it to the No. 20 slot on Amazon before
it even came out. Thanks to him, the last thing anyone is going to
do is ignore the story of his life.

 &HT;    Books are easy part author Nora Roberts
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Nora Roberts does indeed sleep _ every night, she
says _ but her output indicates otherwise. In 20 years, she's
published 134 novels under various names, the most famous being
Nora Roberts, which is all her readers need to know. They'll buy
the book and they'll devour the book, and way more often than not,
they'll love the book if it's by Nora Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't get ideas in my sleep,'' she says wearily.
Roberts, 49, is well into a six-week book tour and frankly, she's
tired, having been asked every conceivable question in every
conceivable way. ``I can't imagine what I haven't been asked,'' she
said. ``If it can be said, I've said it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been on the road for a couple of weeks, you
suddenly start thinking this is what you do. This is your
reality,'' she said. ``You start thinking, `I don't really write, I
just travel across the country, stay in hotels, talk to reporters
and sign books. And that's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Her publisher, G.P. Putnam's Sons, believes in the power of the
book tour, and Roberts hits the road nearly every spring in support
of a new hardcover. This time out, she's pushing ``Carolina Moon,''
a romantic mystery set in the South. Publisher's Weekly said it may
be her personal best, ``as atmospheric and unsettling as a
Tennessee Williams play.'' One hundred thirty-four books under her
belt, and not even the critics can find fault.
</P>
<P>
   But the tour takes its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty good at the tour, but the only part that's fun is
actually making contact with the reader. It's really nice to make
that face-to-face contact ... It's the connection, a personal
connection, for me anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traveling is horrible, the getting up at 4:30 a.m. is
horrible, and possibly in violation of the Geneva Convention,'' she
said. ``I believe that book tours are the only legalized torture in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' story is well-known: Stuck at home during the 1979
blizzard with a 2- and a 5-year-old, she saved her sanity by
writing down the stories that had always been in her head. She's
never stopped. She's well into her second marriage, to a carpenter
hired to build bookshelves. Her children are well grown and she's
undeniably rich enough to take it easy.
</P>
<P>
   But she won't.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I do? I love the process of writing a book. It's
hard work, and has all the pitfalls of hard work, but it's the best
job in the world, and I don't have to wear pantyhose to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home, in a secluded house in a small Maryland town, her
``dream of a typical day'' would be an early-morning workout
(``After all, you sit on your butt the rest of the day''), time
spent on e-mail correspondence and cruising the Internet (``I love
the Net''), then down to work for six to eight hours before
thoughts of what to make for dinner take over.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for my process, I do a fairly quick draft, from Page 1 to
the end. Then I go back to Page 1 to see if the story holds, get to
know my characters better, figure out the thread of the theme,
while fleshing it out, adding texture and taking out what doesn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll do at least one more draft to polish,'' she said.
Never has she given up once a story has begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too stubborn. I have a fairly fluid imagination and a
flexible mind, so that when I do run into a wall with a book, I can
figure a way over, under or around it instead of just backing
off.''
</P>
<P>
   She's an Energizer Bunny of a writer, albeit a bunny with six or
seven arms. She writes under the pseudonym J.D. Robb ``darker,
gritter, slightly more mystery-oriented books, set in the near
future.''
</P>
<P>
   She also keeps her hand in the paperback original romance trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like that form, the short form,'' Roberts said. ``I
remember what it was like to be a voracious reader with a 2- and
5-year-old, and not have much time. I remember how those short, fun
romances saved my sanity.''
</P>
<P>
   She's still a voracious reader _ ``If you don't read, how can
you write?'' _ having packed some Patricia Gaffney, Lisa
Scottoline, Stephen King, Lawrence Block and others for her trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read all across the board,'' she said, before launching into
a glowing recommendation of Gaffney's ``The Saving Graces.'' She's
not reluctant to talk about the scandal involving romance writer
Janet Dailey, who was accused of plagiarizing Roberts' work in
multiple books over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' she said. ``I do think writers,
publishers and readers should take plagiarism more seriously than I
discovered a lot of them do. That is one line that should never be
crossed in our business. I'm pleased we settled and I'm pleased I
could donate the financial settlement to the cause of literacy.''
</P>
<P>
   She as certain as she can be that she won't repeat herself, no
matter how long she continues to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain themes that reverberate, and that becomes a
matter of style,'' she said. ``Family becomes important in a lot of
my work, and certainly romance _ that human need to find a mate,
someone who loves us warts and all and vice versa. Those things
echo with different character types, situations, canvases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having just 88 keys on piano: You can still make a
lot of music.''

 &HT;    Making scents of each country
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Why go around the world?
</P>
<P>
   Because it has been only 600 years since people thought the
world was flat.
</P>
<P>
   Because I've never done it.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's still a mystique to circumnavigating the earth,
to see its boundaries, to see what's out there, to see that that's
all there is. It's still frightening, and exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   And I wanted to experience it, if only briefly. I left West Palm
Beach on Feb. 3 and traveled east with a few detours south to
Arabia, north to China, and who could go around the world without
seeing Australia?
</P>
<P>
   I was back home at 4 a.m. March 3 throwing rocks at my
roommate's second-floor window to let me in.
</P>
<P>
   In that short length of time, I was on 12 airplanes for a total
of 64 hours _ 2 1/2 days _ and in airports probably just as long;
on trains for 24 hours; on a river boat for one day; and on ferries
for seven hours.
</P>
<P>
   It was a marathon trip _ eight countries in four weeks and
sometimes several cities in one country. There were at least four
24-hour periods when I didn't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, nothing bad happened. My schedule ticked away like a
Swiss clock. Nothing was stolen and I didn't miss a plane, although
an ATM in Hong Kong told me there was no money available in my
checking account, which worried me quite a bit until I went to
another machine, which said I had plenty. Whew!
</P>
<P>
   I had to do business in nine currencies.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one major inconvenience and that was in Sydney.
At 1 a.m., I was standing on a road with my backpack in a rough
neighborhood waiting for a taxi. The hotel where I had reservations
was too awful even by my low standards. And the phone in the rooms
didn't work, so I couldn't use my laptop to send my stories. So I
left.
</P>
<P>
   At least I wasn't alone on the sidewalk. There were several
homeless drunks to keep me company, friendly and polite fellas, but
who needs that? A taxi finally came and I said, ``Is there a Hyatt
or Hilton nearby?''
</P>
<P>
   Eight countries, each with different sights, cultures and
smells.
</P>
<P>
   St. James Park in London smelled of clover; Athens of pine
trees; Bahrain and Oman had the dry sagey scent of the desert;
Singapore, the heady fragrance of gardenias and jasmine; Australia,
cow manure and grass, and in China, damp, rich earth.
</P>
<P>
   In that short time, I saw so much _ Buckingham Palace and the
Changing of the Guard, and I was one of the first to ride the new,
humongous Ferris wheel-type ride next to the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the ancient Parthenon on top of the Acropolis in Athens,
the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Opera House in Sydney, and the
Yangtze River in China.
</P>
<P>
   Many times the fast pace had the surreal feeling of a cruise,
especially when I was half awake. I saw a cathedral and had a
fleeting thought: When did Notre Dame get a clock on the tower?
Oops, wrong city, that's Westminster in London.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the real joys of the trip were the people I met.
And by traveling alone, I met many kind and generous men and women,
and I mostly stayed quiet and listened to their stories. I think of
them as my extended family because the world is small and we are
connected in so many ways.
</P>
<P>
   It's wonderful how people will open up to you. I met an Indian
man on the Bahrain-to-Singapore flight who was agonizing over a job
opportunity in Bahrain. He worried that the money wasn't worth the
change in lifestyle from his new home in New Zealand, where he had
a wife and new baby waiting for him. He described the situation and
asked me my opinion. I told him not to take the job, and he decided
then and there to stay put, and he was greatly relieved.
</P>
<P>
   A young, professional Chinese woman on the Hong Kong to
Chongqing flight told me how she missed her job and friends in
Melbourne, Australia, where she and her husband had gone before
Hong Kong's handover to China. Now she lived in Chongqing, where
her husband worked. ``He told me he would never live in China
again, and now we've been there for a year,'' she said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Lisa Rickard, the beautiful vegetarian jillaroo
(cowgirl) in Australia, and Brian Skerrett, the cattle station
owner who chuckled at everything I said. And my Australian stock
horse, Lucille. What a good-natured, big-boned gal.
</P>
<P>
   And of course all the people who helped me, who gave me
directions, suggested where to sleep and where to eat, who helped
me with my backpack, and otherwise made the long road wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   I came away from the trip with two frightening conclusions: The
world is so small and there are so many people, factories, cities
and new suburbs in such a finite place; and the world is so large,
especially when you're on the other side, and it suddenly hits you
that it would take at least two days to get home.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to be home, but I feel like I'm standing still, that I
should be exploring.
</P>
<P>
   And I already miss my greater home _ the world.
</P>
<P>
   SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   MY 42,000 MILES AROUND THE WORLD
</P>
<P>
   Favorite way to communicate with home and work: Cybercafes,
which come in all shapes and personalities, are the best way to
stay in touch. In Singapore, I went to a coffee shop, in Athens I
found a rowdy hangout for Greek computer nerds, and in Sydney I
stumbled on a computer in a bar by the harbor. There was a machine
that you could blow into to check your blood-alcohol level. You
wouldn't want to get an EUI _ e-mailing under the influence.
</P>
<P>
   Easiest way to get money: ATMs are not Greek to me. There are
many things I don't know how to do, but I do know how to work an
ATM, and in just about any language _ Arabic, Greek, Chinese, you
name it. If I'm in doubt about boxes to check, I just guess, and
everything generally turns out OK. Except in Bahrain, I got about
$300 worth of Bahrain dinars when all I needed was $10 for a taxi.
Luckily they had an exchange bureau at the airport, because who
else would want Bahrain money?
</P>
<P>
   Best psychic experience: I always ask taxi drivers how much the
fare will be before I get in. In Chongqing, China, the driver
quoted an amount, but soon it became clear he had no idea where I
wanted to go. He made a flying motion, which meant he wanted to
know if I wanted to go to the airport. I shook my head ``no'' and
repeated the name of the hotel. He didn't understand me, and I was
wondering what to do when I happened to see the hotel up on a hill,
and pointed to it. He laughed, and he explained to the desk person
that he had concentrated on what I was thinking and that's how we
went directly to the hotel _ Chinese mental telepathy.
</P>
<P>
   Most gross moment: At the jackaroo school in Australia, where I
was learning to be a jillaroo, I got the great job of helping
scrape maggots out of a horse's infected hoof. The smell was
indescribable. That was the first of many times I figured I should
probably keep my day job.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ ON THE ROAD _ The idea is to see how far I can
drive in three-and-a-half days, to take the Jeep down some rough
roads, and to see a chunk of southwest Texas I've never seen
before. That's about as specific as my itinerary got during a
recent jaunt through West Texas. Before it was over, I had logged
1,500 miles, met a couple of interesting characters, seen where
John Wayne died at the Alamo in the film version, and eaten some of
the best barbecue that's ever crossed my lips. Here are a few
observations from my time on the road. (Gary Borders is editor and

   SWITZERLAND _ BASEL, Switzerland _ Clang. Creak. Clang. Creak.
You can hear the art of the Museum Jean Tinguely before you see it.
The source of all that noise is a fountain set in the green expanse
in front of the garden entrance. The Swiss artist's Rube
Goldbergesque contraption grinds its gears for no other reason than
to delight viewers with its whimsy. The airy Tinguely museum_ where
the assemblages of machinery, cow skulls, and musical instruments
look like giant toys _ is only one of the many sources of appeal
for art lovers in this town of 200,000 in northwest Switzerland.

   SPAIN _ SALAMANCA, Spain _ This is a town time forgot to forget,
a place where you can stumble through the ages just by ...
stumbling. Stepping down narrow streets after debating fascist
politics late into the night with a Franco-yearning bartender (his
argument: the trains ran on time), running a hand along sandstone
walls centuries have worn smooth or artisans have carved into the
likenesses of saints or popes or frogs or clamshells, passing
students and nuns and old couples locked arm-in-arm ... Traveling
through Salamanca like this, buzzing on its college-town ambiance
and rounds of canas (draft beer), you turn a dark corner you didn't
mean to turn and suddenly find yourself all alone _ as removed from
the modern world as a mid-millennium monk.(Jubera, Atlanta

   WORLD-TB-DAY _ Friday is World TB Day. Though the
lung-destroying illness often is thought of as something that
belongs to Victorian novels _ or to the Third World _ it's a
problem in the United States as well: Georgia is among the 10 worst
states for TB, according to national figures, and the number of
cases is rising. Also rising is the number of cases among
foreign-born migrants to Georgia, from Latino landscapers and
food-service personnel in Cobb County to graduate students at
Georgia Tech. In Georgia, it is even more costly than it needs to
be, advocates and health experts say, because the state has not
applied to Medicaid for reimbursement for TB treatment, meaning
that it misses out on several million dollars each year that the
other TB-heavy states receive. (McKenna, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ ON THE ROAD _ The idea is to see how far I can
drive in three-and-a-half days, to take the Jeep down some rough
roads, and to see a chunk of southwest Texas I've never seen
before. That's about as specific as my itinerary got during a
recent jaunt through West Texas. Before it was over, I had logged
1,500 miles, met a couple of interesting characters, seen where
John Wayne died at the Alamo in the film version, and eaten some of
the best barbecue that's ever crossed my lips. Here are a few
observations from my time on the road. (Gary Borders is editor and
publisher of the Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel.) EMBARGOED for Sunday.

   SWITZERLAND _ BASEL, Switzerland _ Clang. Creak. Clang. Creak.
You can hear the art of the Museum Jean Tinguely before you see it.
The source of all that noise is a fountain set in the green expanse
in front of the garden entrance. The Swiss artist's Rube
Goldbergesque contraption grinds its gears for no other reason than
to delight viewers with its whimsy. The airy Tinguely museum_ where
the assemblages of machinery, cow skulls, and musical instruments
look like giant toys _ is only one of the many sources of appeal
for art lovers in this town of 200,000 in northwest Switzerland.

   SPAIN _ SALAMANCA, Spain _ This is a town time forgot to forget,
a place where you can stumble through the ages just by ...
stumbling. Stepping down narrow streets after debating fascist
politics late into the night with a Franco-yearning bartender (his
argument: the trains ran on time), running a hand along sandstone
walls centuries have worn smooth or artisans have carved into the
likenesses of saints or popes or frogs or clamshells, passing
students and nuns and old couples locked arm-in-arm ... Traveling
through Salamanca like this, buzzing on its college-town ambiance
and rounds of canas (draft beer), you turn a dark corner you didn't
mean to turn and suddenly find yourself all alone _ as removed from
the modern world as a mid-millennium monk.(Jubera, Atlanta

   WORLD-TB-DAY _ Friday is World TB Day. Though the
lung-destroying illness often is thought of as something that
belongs to Victorian novels _ or to the Third World _ it's a
problem in the United States as well: Georgia is among the 10 worst
states for TB, according to national figures, and the number of
cases is rising. Also rising is the number of cases among
foreign-born migrants to Georgia, from Latino landscapers and
food-service personnel in Cobb County to graduate students at
Georgia Tech. In Georgia, it is even more costly than it needs to
be, advocates and health experts say, because the state has not
applied to Medicaid for reimbursement for TB treatment, meaning
that it misses out on several million dollars each year that the
other TB-heavy states receive. (McKenna, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 20.

   TEXAS-DRAWL (Houston) _ What does your accent say about you? In
the presidential race, George Dubbya drops g's from the end of
every word _ he's wish`, hopin` and thinkin` _ and sounds Texas
folksy. It seems to work for politicians and socialites but not
always in the business world or on TV either. A look at the prose
and cons of having a Texas accent, or any accent for that matter.

   BARBER-FAMILY (Houston) _ Whenever the Ortuno family gets
together, you could say it's a hair-raising experience. Ezequiel
Ortuno is a barber. So is his brother, Amado. And his other
brother, Manuel. Sister Janete Ortuno Castro is also a barber. All
told, there are some 60 Ortuno-family cousins who live in Houston;
almost all are barbers. Some have wives who are barbers. Get
anywhere near the Ortuno family, it seems, and you get the urge to
cut hair. By MELISSA FLETCHER STOELTJE (Photo available on NYT

   WAVING-MAN (Berkeley, Calif.) _ Joseph Charles has waved his way

night to celebrate the 90th birthday of Berkeley's famous Waving
Man. It's been eight years since Charles retired from his
celebrated hobby of waving to passing cars at the corner of Oregon
Street and Martin Luther King Way, a hobby he enjoyed for 30 years.

crenshaw or a cantaloupe. They are also called melon pears because
of their demure size _ each one is only about the size of a hand _
and slightly elongated shape. By RUTH FANTASIA.

IT'S IN THE DRAWL, Y'ALL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ He pronounces nuclear as ``nuclar,'' calls the
Midwestern state ``Illinoise,'' brags about his ``sussesses''
(that's successes) and has practically dropped the letter ``g''
from his alphabet when it ends a word.
</P>
<P>
   Does this sound like the next president?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, George W. Bush will never have to fend off
accusations that he lacks Texas roots. While the Texas governor
doesn't have former President Lyndon Johnson's deep drawl, there
are traces of his West Texas upbringing in almost every syllable.
</P>
<P>
   The way ``Dubya'' talks is not expected to become a campaign
issue, although some language experts believe that in a close
election his accent might cost him some votes by subtly reinforcing
a perception that he is not up to the job.
</P>
<P>
   An accent says an ``enormous amount'' about a person, says Donna
Jo Napoli, director of the linguistics program at Swarthmore
College. It can provide clues about where an individual lives or
was reared and his or her level of education and cultural, ethnic
or racial background.
</P>
<P>
   Some accents continue to perpetuate stereotypes. A ``New Yawk''
accent can connote pushiness, while a Southern accent can mark
someone as slow or uneducated. There remains ``a terrific amount of
prejudice'' against most Southern accents, Napoli says.
</P>
<P>
   One of her students, who lived in Georgia until high school when
her family relocated to Pennsylvania, taped a passage with a
Southern accent and a Philadelphia dialect.
</P>
<P>
   The student randomly approached strangers and asked them to
determine age, race and intelligence level from listening to the
tape. Most associated the Georgia accent with lower intelligence
and less education, Napoli says.
</P>
<P>
   However, having a distinct accent is no longer seen as a
detriment to becoming president. Two of the last four presidents _
Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter _ have strong Southern accents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all used to a Southern variety of speech with Bill
Clinton, and no one thinks he is dumb,'' says Napoli. ``You might
think that Bill Clinton is a man of poor judgment, but you don't
think he's a man of deficient intellect.''
</P>
<P>
   In other areas _ particularly the workplace _ a strong accent
can still be a hindrance no matter how smart or talented you are.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are going to succeed in any kind of traditional
organization don't have to just dress alike, but they have to sound
alike to some degree for their ideas to be valued,'' says Tony
Shelton, president of Shelton &AMP; Caudle, a Houston-based firm that
specializes in communication training.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton says speaking the same language in the same way is
particularly important at big oil, banking and accounting
companies, although not so much in the emerging ``dot.com''
companies that value individuality.
</P>
<P>
   Television news is another area where reporters often get rid of
any trace of an accent to be successful. Reporter Cynthia Hunt of
the ABC affiliate in Houston says she has been turned down for
``many jobs'' in television because of her Alabama accent.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Hunt, accents don't matter at KTRK-Channel 13,
which has remained the city's No. 1 news station in part by
highlighting strong personalities. The station snapped her up three
years ago, and she reports the top story on many nights.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt has worked with a vocal coach to learn to control her
accent when needed since it tends to be more pronounced when she is
excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to sound like everybody else or not sound like
me, but I do want to sound professional enough so that I'm not a
distraction,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She takes heart from the fact that ABC News anchor Peter
Jennings has been successful without losing all traces of his
Canadian accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, diversity in the way people look and sound is being
accepted more,'' Hunt says. ``We're given so many images, I think
that's the way it has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain accents are almost always advantageous. To many
Americans, a British accent connotes being refined and educated,
while a French or Italian accent sounds romantic.
</P>
<P>
   Before appearing on TBS's film-and-food show ``Dinner &AMP; a
Movie'' earlier this month, Alberto Baffoni, the Italian-born
executive chef and owner of Simposio Ristorante Italiano, went to
Shelton's firm for help in preparing for his appearance on the
nationally televised broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston chef had won a competition among 10 chefs from
throughout the country to appear on the show. He prepared the
``Sole Sister's Seafood Medley with My God's Holy Sauce'' during
breaks of the TBS showing of ``Sister Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton gave Baffoni some tips for staying calm during the
taping but didn't attempt to alter his accent. ``It reinforced what
he was doing there,'' Shelton says. ``One thing we associate with
Italy is food.''
</P>
<P>
   During the taping, the host of the show was so charmed by
Baffoni's accent that she said, ``Just talk. I don't care what you
say.''
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian salesman who came to Shelton's firm was not so
well-accepted. Although he was charming, his accent did not go over
with his clients in central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``His accent always said he was an outsider,'' Shelton says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Heath, professor of communication at the University of
Houston, recalls that a neurologist once came to him for help in
making his speech more interesting, clear and lively.
</P>
<P>
   But the physician, who studied at a renowned medical school in
Colombia and testified often in insurance cases, did not want his
Spanish-tinged accent fiddled with because he believed it made him
sound more authoritative.
</P>
<P>
   ``My accent earns me an additional $150 to $200 an hour,'' he
told Heath.
</P>
<P>
   What effect accents will have on the presidential race is, thus
far, unclear. Though the likely Democratic nominee, Vice President
Al Gore, claims Tennessee as his home, he retains little vestiges
of a Southern accent. He spent much of his childhood in Washington,
D.C., where his father was a senator, and he attended Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that many people retain the accent they picked up as
a child, which accounts for Bush's Texas-tinged way of speaking.
Although Bush spent summers in Maine and attended an East Coast
boarding school and Yale University, he retains an accent from
early years in Midland and Odessa.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to Lyndon Johnson's Texas accent, though, Bush's accent
is ``melodious,'' says Heath. ``LBJ's accent hurt peoples' ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's nonverbal mannerisms, such as the smirk on his face at
inopportune times during some primary debates, has drawn more
negative reaction than his ``hybrid accent,'' which combines a
Texas twang and the flat sounds typical of New Englanders, Heath
says.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's accent is not strong, agrees Sydney Lamb, professor
emeritus of linguistics and cognitive science at Rice University in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he has a tendency to stumble on his words a little bit.
And he doesn't like long, complex sentences the way Bill Clinton
does or Al Gore,'' Lamb says. ``But he's not nearly as bad as
(former Vice President Dan) Quayle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's tendency to mangle the English language has happened so
frequently that the Internet publication Slate has compiled a list
of ``Bushisms,'' including this one:
</P>
<P>
   During a celebration of ``Perseverance Month'' at a New
Hampshire elementary school, Bush said, ``This is Preservation
Month. I appreciate preservation. It's what you do when you run for
president. You have to preserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb says, ``It will be interesting to see what happens when he
debates with Al Gore, because Gore is very fluent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shelton points out that sometimes a politician can overcome
the drawback of a distinctive accent through the sheer force of his
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at John F. Kennedy. He was so charismatic he was able to
get the audience past his saying `Cuber' instead of `Cuba',''
Shelton says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the years after the Soviet Union's
disintegration, the United States has sent Russia more than $7
billion to safeguard its nuclear arsenal, feed its people, prop up
its space program and nourish the seedlings of a private enterprise
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been, by almost all accounts, less than
stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy has taken a nose-dive. Its space program fell
behind in building its components for the International Space
Station, creating delays for the project and cost overruns for U.S.
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a six-year effort and a half-billion dollars in U.S.
assistance, only a small amount of Russia's nuclear materials are
now stored in secure buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are few signs that America is about to cut off
the aid spigot, now that acting President Vladimir Putin, the
former KGB officer, moves toward becoming Russia's second
democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already tolerated all kinds of shenanigans in Russia for
a very long time,'' said Dan Goure, a deputy director at the
Washington research group, Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin would have to go almost out of his way to do something
so outrageous, so anti-American that it would cause either (the
United States or Russia) to ratchet back their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Goure and others readily concede that direct American aid, plus
$22.6 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and $11
billion from the World Bank have not accomplished a great deal
toward solving Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he held that it is hard to see how any U.S. administration
would suspend aid to a country with the world's largest land mass
and a second largest stockpile of nuclear weaponry. ``If anything
goes wrong, the blame falls on the administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one outspoken critic of aid to Russia predicted that
Putin may prove more successful in dealing with the United States
than his ailing predecessor Boris Yeltsin, whose U.S. relations
went from sweet to sour during his often-rocky tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is smarter, shrewder and more calculating,'' said David
Kramer, senior fellow at the Project for the New American Century,
a small conservative research group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct bilateral aid, in financial terms, is not very
significant for propping up Putin,'' Kramer said. But, he added
that it has symbolic power: ``It sends a political message: if
there is no change in (aid) policy, then it suggests that we are
continuing business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's strategy has been to talk tough and crack down on
Chechen rebels at home as he proposes more accommodation on nuclear
issues abroad. He has endorsed ratification for the long-delayed
START II missile treaty, and said he might be open to changing the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to permit a U.S. missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian leader also restored NATO ties which had been
frayed during the U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk could avert attention from Russian problems, ranging
from widespread corruption to the glacial pace of reforms and
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of friction in U.S.-Russian joint efforts
continues. Among recent examples, the U.S. General Accounting
Office warned earlier this month that Russia and the rest of the
old Soviet Union still have 650 metric tons of enriched uranium and
plutonium. That's enough to make about 40,000 nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those nuclear materials remain in unsecured buildings
and under increasing threat of theft, said the GAO, which is the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after spending $481 million over six years, the United
States completed installation of security systems for just 7
percent of that material, the accounting office reported.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace was traced largely to resistance from the Russian
government, which has locked U.S. officials out of the nuclear
weapons complex where much of the material is stored. Moreover, the
Russian government has soaked up some of the U.S. aid by taxing it.
</P>
<P>
   American costs for safeguarding and dismantling the nuclear
arsenal have reached $5 billion with no clear end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes that these are large amounts of money,''
said Jon B. Wolfsthal, an associate with the Carnegie Endowment for
Peace and a former special assistant and policy adviser for the
U.S. Department of Energy, which runs much of nuclear safeguard
efforts in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, there's no way to overstate the threat that
the United States now faces from the former of Soviet Union,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the nuclear material watched over by guards who had no
coats or boots in the winter and no pay in summer, and nuclear
weapons labs where Russian scientists, unpaid for months at a time,
could sell their expertise to Iran, Iraq or China.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. subsidies have not been completely successful, he
acknowledged, but he added, ``Half a loaf is better than no loaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems have also haunted the U.S.-Russian space projects.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's failure to complete its space station components on
time have been estimated by the House Science Committee to have
cost billions of dollars in extra expenses to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, congressional investigators are currently looking into
safety problems with two Russian-built modules, including one that
has already been launched into orbit for the space station. Neither
module offers enough protection from space debris, neither can
operate after loss of cabin pressure and both have excessive noise
levels, Allen Li, a GAO official, told a House subcommittee on
March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Concern in Congress over whether the Russian space agency was
helping Iran develop long-range missiles prompted both houses to
pass resolutions threatening to cut off Russian space subsidies
unless the president can certify that no missile information was
passed along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the policy of an ally, but that's not what we are,''
said Goure of CSIS. ``The notion of a strategic partnership which
the Clinton administration touted five years ago is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a difficult relationship. There's no doubt
about that.''

   MOSCOW _ When Russians vote Sunday to chose their second
democratically elected president, the probable winner will be
Vladimir Putin, a man U.S. officials expect to strengthen ties with
Washington on national security issues like arms control, weapons
proliferation and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. relationship with the world's second-largest nuclear
power deteriorated drastically in the last two years, punctuated by
a high-pressure stand-off in Kosovo and anti-Western rhetoric by
the increasingly erratic former president, Boris Yeltsin, and
Russian generals.
</P>
<P>
   The slump was an embarrassment to the Clinton administration,
which counts U.S.-Russian relations as a cornerstone of its foreign
policy. Washington had sunk billions of dollars into the
post-communist economy, hoping to speed along democracy by
fostering capitalism. After years of money squandered on both
sides, the White House had little to show for the expenditure in
1999, both in terms of domestic Russian growth and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with great relief for U.S. officials to hear Putin in
the months leading up to Sunday's(CQ) Russian presidential vote
make several overtures to Washington, including a surprising
statement in February that Moscow might consider joining NATO.
</P>
<P>
   This turnabout has triggered warm words from the White House
about Putin, despite alleged human rights abuses in Chechnya and
the mixed signals the Russian has given about how he'll treat
fledgling democratic institutions, like a free press.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see in Putin is a man who wants to leave the past in
the past and move ahead,'' said a senior U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, during a recent trip to Moscow. ``We see
the same way on many issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's major thoughts on foreign policy are summed up in
Russia's new national security doctrine, a document drafted last
summer while Putin was head of Russia's National Security Council,
refined after he became prime minister in August and then made
public after he became acting president on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the change of language in regards to use
of nuclear weapons, that it reflects a shift of strategic thinking
on the part of the Russians. However, the references to nuclear
weapons occupy only a small part of the document.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow-based defense analysts say the real development of the
doctrine is the weight given to internal threats _regional and
economic instability, and a ``critically'' ill-equipped army _ as
opposed to external threats, as the greater national security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also point to the fact that the Russian security
document for the first time omits a section outlining which
countries fall within Russia's sphere of influence, and gives up
historic rights to military bases outside of Russia's territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great shift of thinking. It shows we are not concerned
with expansion any longer,'' said Alexander Zhilin, an ex-army
pilot who now works as a military affairs journalist with the
Moscow News newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the document does include harsh words about what Moscow
views as the development of a U.S.-dominated international system
of conflict resolution. The decision for NATO forces last year to
bomb Yugoslavia without U.N. approval is a symptom of this, Russian
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials say they have been
pleased with the tone set by Putin's seven-month-old government
concerning bilateral relations and security issues, especially the
revival of ties between Russia and NATO in March.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and NATO began cooperating after signing a May 1997
accord aimed at easing Russian fears about the alliance's eastward
expansion to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, but relations
broke down in spring 1999 with the start of the 78-day Kosovo
bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military officials insist that day-to-day working
relationships are more important than seeing eye-to-eye on every
international issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the closest friends can't always get along. What's more
important is consistency. We don't want another Pristina airport,''
said one U.S. diplomat, referring to the flare-up in tension after
a small group of Russian peacekeepers occupied the airport in
Kosovo's provincial capital in defiance of NATO orders.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's step towards the West came none-too-soon for the Clinton
administration and the budding presidential campaign of Vice
President Al Gore. White House officials say that renewal of ties
will go far in helping Gore against Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush when it comes to foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first steps Putin will take toward enhancing
bilateral ties will come immediately after the Russian presidential
elections, when the Russian Duma is expected to vote to ratify the
START II arms control treaty, according to the deputy chairman of
the Duma Defense Committee, Georgy Arbatov.
</P>
<P>
   START II, signed in 1993 and approved by the U.S. Senate in
1996, lowers U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles to about 3,000
warheads each. After almost seven years of parliamentary bickering,
the Duma has consistently refused to vote on the issue. After
December elections, Putin now controls the largest Duma faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the votes to finally push it through the Duma, thanks
to Putin's faction,'' Arbatov said in an interview this week after
heading closed-door meetings between parliamentary, Russian
Ministry of Defense and Foreign Ministry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russian ministries want to ratify the treaty, knowing their
cash-strapped country can ill-afford the upkeep on or security over
a massive stockpile of weapons. With internal terrorist threats now
a reality, as witnessed by the Chechen war, nuclear management has
become a priority for Putin, according to his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this hurdle out of the way, another divisive issue
lurks in the near future, namely President Clinton's decision this
summer about whether to commit the tens of billions of dollars to
developing a national missile defense system, a tool designed to
protect America from nuclear attacks from rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, besides the unanswered question of whether the
technology for such a defense is effective, is that the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the cornerstone of arms control
agreements between Moscow and Washington, prohibits such a system.
Russia violently opposes it, saying it would disrupt parity between
the two countries and spark another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Putin as prime minister made no hints Russia was willing to back
down from this position.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of shuttle diplomacy by high-ranking U.S.
officials like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Russia's
position remains staunch: that any amendment to the ABM would
signal the collapse of all weapons agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Arbatov said the START II ratification would likely include a
stipulation saying Russia would drop out of the treaty if the U.S.
violates the ABM pact.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overall upturn in bilateral relations, however, some
Russians fret over the support the United States has already
extended to Putin.
</P>
<P>
   They fear that the Clinton administration desire to sign arms
control agreements aimed at bolstering Vice President Al Gore's
chance at the White House this year will outweigh criticism in
human rights arenas.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the years after the Soviet Union's
disintegration, the United States has sent Russia more than $7
billion to safeguard its nuclear arsenal, feed its people, prop up
its space program and nourish the seedlings of a private enterprise
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been, by almost all accounts, less than
stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy has taken a nose-dive. Its space program fell
behind in building its components for the International Space
Station, creating delays for the project and cost overruns for U.S.
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a six-year effort and a half-billion dollars in U.S.
assistance, only a small amount of Russia's nuclear materials are
now stored in secure buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are few signs that America is about to cut off
the aid spigot, now that acting President Vladimir Putin, the
former KGB officer, moves toward becoming Russia's second
democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already tolerated all kinds of shenanigans in Russia for
a very long time,'' said Dan Goure, a deputy director at the
Washington research group, Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin would have to go almost out of his way to do something
so outrageous, so anti-American that it would cause either (the
United States or Russia) to ratchet back their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Goure and others readily concede that direct American aid, plus
$22.6 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and $11
billion from the World Bank have not accomplished a great deal
toward solving Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he held that it is hard to see how any U.S. administration
would suspend aid to a country with the world's largest land mass
and a second largest stockpile of nuclear weaponry. ``If anything
goes wrong, the blame falls on the administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one outspoken critic of aid to Russia predicted that
Putin may prove more successful in dealing with the United States
than his ailing predecessor Boris Yeltsin, whose U.S. relations
went from sweet to sour during his often-rocky tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is smarter, shrewder and more calculating,'' said David
Kramer, senior fellow at the Project for the New American Century,
a small conservative research group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct bilateral aid, in financial terms, is not very
significant for propping up Putin,'' Kramer said. But, he added
that it has symbolic power: ``It sends a political message: if
there is no change in (aid) policy, then it suggests that we are
continuing business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's strategy has been to talk tough and crack down on
Chechen rebels at home as he proposes more accommodation on nuclear
issues abroad. He has endorsed ratification for the long-delayed
START II missile treaty, and said he might be open to changing the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to permit a U.S. missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian leader also restored NATO ties which had been
frayed during the U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk could avert attention from Russian problems, ranging
from widespread corruption to the glacial pace of reforms and
disarmament.
</P>
<P>

Kosovo's provincial capital in defiance of NATO orders.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's step towards the West came none-too-soon for the Clinton
administration and the budding presidential campaign of Vice
President Al Gore. White House officials say that renewal of ties
will go far in helping Gore against Republican presidential
candidate George W. Bush when it comes to foreign policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first steps Putin will take toward enhancing
bilateral ties will come immediately after the Russian presidential
elections, when the Russian Duma is expected to vote to ratify the
START II arms control treaty, according to the deputy chairman of
the Duma Defense Committee, Georgy Arbatov.
</P>
<P>
   START II, signed in 1993 and approved by the U.S. Senate in
1996, lowers U.S. and Russian nuclear stockpiles to about 3,000
warheads each. After almost seven years of parliamentary bickering,
the Duma has consistently refused to vote on the issue. After
December elections, Putin now controls the largest Duma faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the votes to finally push it through the Duma, thanks
to Putin's faction,'' Arbatov said in an interview this week after
heading closed-door meetings between parliamentary, Russian
Ministry of Defense and Foreign Ministry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russian ministries want to ratify the treaty, knowing their
cash-strapped country can ill-afford the upkeep on or security over
a massive stockpile of weapons. With internal terrorist threats now
a reality, as witnessed by the Chechen war, nuclear management has
become a priority for Putin, according to his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with this hurdle out of the way, another divisive issue
lurks in the near future, namely President Clinton's decision this
summer about whether to commit the tens of billions of dollars to
developing a national missile defense system, a tool designed to
protect America from nuclear attacks from rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, besides the unanswered question of whether the
technology for such a defense is effective, is that the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, the cornerstone of arms control
agreements between Moscow and Washington, prohibits such a system.
Russia violently opposes it, saying it would disrupt parity between
the two countries and spark another arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Putin as prime minister made no hints Russia was willing to back
down from this position.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of shuttle diplomacy by high-ranking U.S.
officials like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Russia's
position remains staunch: that any amendment to the ABM would
signal the collapse of all weapons agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Arbatov said the START II ratification would likely include a
stipulation saying Russia would drop out of the treaty if the U.S.
violates the ABM pact.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overall upturn in bilateral relations, however, some
Russians fret over the support the United States has already
extended to Putin.
</P>
<P>
   They fear that the Clinton administration desire to sign arms
control agreements aimed at bolstering Vice President Al Gore's
chance at the White House this year will outweigh criticism in
human rights arenas.

SNIPS OFF THE OLD BLOCK 
 
FOR THE ORTUNO FAMILY, BECOMING A BARBER IS A TIME-HONORED
TRADITION

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Whenever the Ortuno family gets together, you could
say it's a hair-raising experience.
</P>
<P>
   Ezequiel Ortuno is a barber. So is his brother, Amado. And his
other brother, Manuel. Sister Janete Ortuno Castro is also a
barber. So are sisters Laura Fraire, Mayda Ortuno, Gloria
Rodriguez, Leticia Ramirez, Maria Alma Ortuno Pineda and Marisela
Ortuno. Of the seven sisters, five are cosmetologists as well as
barbers.
</P>
<P>
   Only one sister, Reyna Gonzalez, defied the odds. She became an
optician.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all.
</P>
<P>
   Ezequiel's wife, Elizabeth, didn't start out as a barber, but
she is one now.
</P>
<P>
   So is Ortuno cousin Jaime Gonzalez. And he's not the only one.
All told, there are some 60 Ortuno-family cousins who live in
Houston; almost all are barbers. Some are married to barbers.
</P>
<P>
   Get anywhere near the Ortuno family, it seems, and you get the
urge to cut hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father always told us, `Wherever you go, if you have a comb
and scissors, you will always have a job, always have a means to
eat,''' Ezequiel says.
</P>
<P>
   He and his siblings stand inside Peluqueria Acapulco Unisex No.
1 and Acapulco Barber Shop No. 2, two comfortably worn shops
located next to each other on the city's east side. Together, the
brothers and sisters represent a veritable coiffure empire
traceable to one man _ father Jesus Ortuno, a barber from Mexico
who moved to the United States in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Now back in Mexico City to care for his aging parents, Ortuno,
65, left behind his hair-trimming offspring _ call them snips off
the old block _ to run his shops. And they run those shops in the
same fashion as their father _ staying open late, working on
weekends, catering to a steadfastly loyal clientele year after
year.
</P>
<P>
   The siblings, who range in age from to 22 to 41, grew up
standing next to their father's chair, watching and learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all went to formal school, too, but that's just where you
learn the basics,'' says Janete. ``The real techniques, we learned
from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The shops are in a neighborhood dotted with modest homes, little
shops, taquerias and signs in Spanish, across from a large,
burned-out lot. Housed in a reconverted old home and garage, the
shops are still decorated with white Christmas lights. Inside,
there are maroon leather barber chairs, some cracked with age, and
TVs and music playing. The sons work on the barber side, the
daughters on the beauty parlor side. (A handful of nonfamily
employees work there, as well.)
</P>
<P>
   The Ortuno family is one of those big, loud, loving families.
The sisters breeze in one at a time, to a flurry of hugging and
cheek-kissing. A passel of toddlers and small children wearing
backpacks (future barbers and cosmetologists, no doubt) circulate
rambunctiously through the store. All the siblings talk at once,
offering their own rendition of history, sometimes slipping into
Spanish, the decibel level rising, until one of them catches a wave
and starts telling an anecdote, at which point the others say
``Sshh!'' and ``Esperate!'' to those who would cut in.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has great hair.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, born in Guerrero, Mexico, was the oldest of nine
brothers, says Janete, the office manager and natural family
storyteller. As a young man, he spent time on a ranch, where he
taught himself to cut hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no mirrors, so they used bowls of water as their
reflection,'' says Gloria, who, as the eldest, serves as a
repository for some of the earliest stories.
</P>
<P>
   He started with his own shop in Mexico City in 1967. Ezequiel
was 4. ``I would help with the cleaning, sweeping, and shining
shoes,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   When their father arrived in Houston, he worked as a barber at
Figaros _ a shop around the corner, just recently closed _ then
rented a shop, saving money to open a shop of his own. For a time,
he also ran a Mexican restaurAn8 &QL;  Wc)it burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Ezequiel was the first of the siblings to become a barber, after
he graduated from high school in 1983. Gloria followed. The rest
fell in line, one after the other. (All went to barber and beauty
school.) Over the years, about 40 nephews were sent from Mexico to
live with Jesus, so he raised not only his own large brood but many
of his brothers' children as well. Through him, all were infused
with the barbering bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want the truth?'' asks Janete, feisty and outspoken. ``My
dad was very strict. If it hadn't been for him, we probably would
have gone our separate (career) ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The only one, it seems, who did not become a barber was their
mother, Maria. Ironically, it was she who cut the children's hair
when they were little. (Dad was too busy.)
</P>
<P>
   Marisela, 23, is another one who, like Reyna, might jump ship
one day. Working toward a business management degree at the
University of Houston, she wants to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll still do hair on the side,'' she insists.
</P>
<P>
   She and Mayda, 22, the only ones who aren't married, still live
in the small family home down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up under the unnerving gaze of an expert barber wasn't
always easy, the siblings say. Jesus Ortuno is a man of exacting
ways. He held his children to high standards and was stinting with
praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would mess up, he would make `stop' motions with his
hands,'' says Gloria, making the cut-throat sign to illustrate.
``So we would stand there combing, combing, until he would finish
with his customer, and then he would come over and start saying,
`What's wrong with you? I send you to school and you still can't
cut hair?'''
</P>
<P>
   It hurt, they say. But it pushed them to get better.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, their father was a pioneer, pushing his daughters
to excel in a nontraditional career. Often, male customers were
skeptical that a female could be a good barber _ a manly skill that
involves shaving, trimming mustaches and so on. Gloria, the first
female, had to blaze the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men would come in and my father would be busy, and they'd say,
`That's OK, we'll wait,''' says Janete. ``When (Gloria) finally got
her chance, she just blew them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrella Ortuno, the oldest of Ezequiel's four daughters, is an
eighth-grader and already making noises that she wants to cut hair
one day. Gloria's daughter, Claudia, already has her cosmetology
license, as does Jasmin, the daughter of Ever Ortuno, a half-sister
from Jesus' first marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Amado's sons say they want to become barbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see us doing it and they want to do it,'' says Janete.
</P>
<P>
   It's because they enjoy their work, she says, and the
companionship that follows. Most of the family members play soccer,
taking over a nearby park after 9 p.m., when the shops close. And
they have big family birthday parties at night _ a cousin acts as
disc jockey _ in the larger shop, covering the windows so clients
won't come knocking for a haircut. (Some do anyway, even during the
family's Thanksgiving celebration.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tips on how to trim, shave and razor cut, Jesus
Ortuno taught his children other important lessons, Ezequiel says.
An important one was to respect one another and other people. To
always be polite, even when others are rude. To stay together, no
matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see other families here in the year 2000, and they're all
scattered,'' says Janete. ``My dad's goal was always the unity of
the family. We're workers, but we're also family.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a family empire that recently came under siege. Last March,
Del Sol, a collection of indoor shops in the adjacent lot, burned
down. The store's management had allowed the hair shops and other
nearby businesses to use its large parking lot for clients. Janete
says the new owner recently asked about buying their shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him it wasn't for sale,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   He said he planned to fence the parking lot, taking away the
shop's parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, she replied. No sale.
</P>
<P>
   The fence went up. Still, the customers come, parking where they
can, making do. This doesn't surprise the Ortunos: They have
clients who drive from as far away as Austin _ about 2 hours _ to
get their hair cut the Ortuno way. It's really not about
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``To them, this feels like little Mexico,'' Ezequiel says. ``And
they say we're `autentico.' Authentic barbers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's how their father taught them.

   MBARE, Zimbabwe _ In a wooden shed behind one of the tiny
cinderblock houses that line this district's narrow dirt roads,
12-year-old Nomsa Mwale struggles with her new role as mother.
</P>
<P>
   Nomsa's father died of AIDS in 1998. Six months ago, her mother
followed him, leaving the five children to make their way in a
world that offers little comfort and less hope.
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, Nomsa stares vacantly away from the people who
have come to see her. She is thin and has a sweet, doe-like face.
With a tiny, wispy voice, she answers the questions about her
family's circumstance, but she does not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The first-born girl, it has fallen to her to care for older
brother Sibongile, 15, and the three younger children: Shonia, 10;
Garikai, 9; and Betina, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Their life is a frenzy of survival guided by little more than
the advice given by their mother as she prepared her children for
their journey without her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me to tell the boys not to go to people's houses
because if something is missing, they will blame them,'' Nomsa
says. ``She said, 'You need to feed the others but also you must
learn to take care of yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was the best advice, because Nomsa has almost no one but
herself.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic in Africa is an orphan-making machine,
striking down millions of men and women in their prime
child-rearing years. A recent United Nations report estimates that
Africa is home to more than 9 million children who have lost their
parents to AIDS. If nothing changes, this number is expected to
triple over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, there are as many as 800,000 AIDS orphans. In one
rural school, 24 percent of its 946 students have lost their
parents to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As international aid groups stagger under the weight of their
task and complain bitterly over the of the lack of funding from the
West _ most notably, the United States _ the machine shows no sign
of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, about 400 Zimbabweans die from AIDS-related illnesses,
most of them likely to have children. It is the same story across
Africa, where new statistics show that 23.3 million people are
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In 1998, 2.2 million
Africans died from AIDS-related illnesses; while 200,000 died in
the continent's many wars.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of Zimbabwe's 11 million to 13 million
residents are HIV-positive, the highest AIDS rate in Africa. In
this one country, roughly half the size of Texas, twice as many
people are infected with the AIDS virus than in all of North
America. An estimated 3,000 more are infected each week.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something unexpected happens, virtually all will die.
AIDS already permeates most lives here. Stories of stricken
relatives are as common as comments on the weather. There is a
never-ending parade of funerals. Mortuaries in the major cities _
Harare and Bulawayo _ remain open 24 hours a day to handle the boom
of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic has decimated the country's most productive layer
of society _ the 18- to 40-year-olds who do the work, pay the taxes
and raise the children.
</P>
<P>
   They leave behind legions like Nomsa with little prospect of the
most basic emotional, physical or material necessities.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-by-8-foot shack occupied by Nomsa and her siblings is
surrounded by rusting lean-tos inhabited by tough-looking older
men. The children share a foul-smelling toilet and shower with the
men.
</P>
<P>
   When the children have food, usually a little something provided
by local charities, they cook on a one-burner stove. From time to
time the food is stolen by the lodgers, who pay Nomsa's uncle to
sleep in the hovels that surround the shed.
</P>
<P>
   The structures are behind a slovenly house owned by Nomsa's long
dead grandparents. The children have no legal rights to the
property, which is owned by their uncle. They have no birth
certificates to prove who they are.
</P>
<P>
   The children do laundry once a month when they have soap. The
girls sleep on the one bed inside the shed. The boys sleep on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   None go to school. They can't afford the equivalent of US$6 to
US$10 in fees each per term much less the US$10 it costs each for
uniforms and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And her extended family?
</P>
<P>
   Their uncle wants to evict them. Nomsa has a legal paper from
him demanding that they vacate the property. He has told them he
wants their space so that he can take in a few more paying lodgers.
He complains to the children bitterly about the money they're
costing him by using up his real estate. He has never been violent,
but the children are terrified of him.
</P>
<P>
   Already numbed by her losses, Nomsa cannot seem to get her mind
around this new threat.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where she will go, she has no answer. A tear streams
down her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Local charities are struggling with the uncle trying to see if
they don't need to just pay him off to leave the children alone.
The uncle has shown little inclination to be compassionate with his
nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what can we do?'' asks Kizito Makore, a volunteer with the
Mashambanzou Charity, noticeably depressed after visiting children.
``They need so much and we have so little to give.''
</P>
<P>
   While the case of Nomsa and her siblings is a bad one, it is
hardly unique.
</P>
<P>
   Before the AIDS epidemic, only 2 percent of African children
were orphaned. The rate now is as high as 11 percent, and UNICEF
expects it to reach 35 percent in Zimbabwe within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those with HIV become infected before the age of 25 and
die while their children are too young to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of orphans comes at a time when extreme poverty has
reduced to near nothing an already feeble social welfare system in
this largely agrarian society. About 63 percent of the people in
Zimbabwe are classified as poor. The unemployment rate is more than
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When AIDS strikes parents, incomes dry up. The family slips
deeper into poverty as it devotes its meager resources to caring
for sick loved ones and eventually transporting a body home and
funeral. In the rural areas, it can cost the equivalent of two
years income to bury a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has shattered the traditional system of extended
families, as witnessed with Nomsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now a fallacy that the African family is there to cushion
the impact on orphans,'' said Marvellous(CQ) Mhloyi, the chair of
population studies at the University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Worsening economic conditions have pushed relatives to be
indifferent, even callous. ``Human beings are selfish,'' Mhloyi
says. ``Under difficult economic times, that degree of selfishness
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, an uncle or other relative would take control
of the parents' assets but would also assume responsibility for the
well-being of the children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now if the parents die, then the uncle will try to take
the house and other property and depend on others to absorb the
orphans.''
</P>
<P>
   New studies show that AIDS orphans are more likely to be
malnourished than other children. When they go to foster families,
they tend to shoulder heavier workloads than other children already
in the families. They are less likely to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Even with so many AIDS orphans, their numbers almost certainly
will rise dramatically. More children live with parents who are
HIV-positive than the number who have already become orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Ngoni Guba, the orphan coordinator for Midland AIDS Service
Organization in Gweru, said the future for these children is grim.
Her organization cares for more than 720 AIDS orphans in central
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are out of school and have no skills training to
allow them to find something to do,'' she says. ``For the boys, you
can foresee delinquency and early manhood. Girls will get married
early _ maybe 15 _ and then what?''
</P>
<P>
   Girls are the most vulnerable. Teenage girls in Africa are eight
times more likely to have AIDS than boys in the same age group.
Most girls get it from older men, ``Sugar Daddies'' who trade sex
for a little money, protection or food.
</P>
<P>
   Many older HIV-infected men will pressure young girls because of
the widely accepted myth in Africa that says a man can be cleansed
of the AIDS virus by having sex with a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a desperate struggle to care for their brothers and
sisters, many teen-age girls turn to prostitution, aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic is also making more and more elderly people
parents again, forcing many to consume their already modest savings
on school fees and the other expenses they had assumed were behind
them. Others must resort to backbreaking manual labor to produce
enough food to feed the additional mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these grandparents are at the stage in life when they
need someone to look after them and then suddenly that are forced
to begin again looking after children,'' said Felicity Hatendi,
UNICEF's external relations officer in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   On a disused golf course outside Harare, Lina Smoke sits on the
hard sandy earth in the shade of a peach tree. Not far away are the
two rusting shacks she's called home for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke, who at 88 seems all bone and callous, smiles sweetly at
Terrence, her 4-year-old grandson who now knows her as mother.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence squats beside her, sucking ravenously on the peal of an
orange, a rare treat. Black ants gather under him, attracted by the
drops of juice.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Terrence and his three siblings, Kenneth, 7;
Sharon, 8; and Rovesai, 10, came to their ``ambuya'' _ the local
word for ``granny'' _ after their mother died of AIDS. Their father
was already dead from an AIDS-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   After their mother died, social workers found their ambuya and
delivered the children to her. Smoke says this was the last time
the government gave her anything.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband used to caddy at the gold course, which has been
reclaimed by native weeds, bushes and trees. He built the shacks
himself two decades ago, and they lived together there until he
died five or six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To feed the children, she works the hard dry land to grow corn
and a green leafy vegetable around the shacks. The children, she
laughs, are too young to help her much with the tilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel too tired, I'm so old,'' she says, sitting in
the wilting afternoon heat. ``I feel I'm going to die any time,
even in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what of the children? She looks at Terrence. ``Put them in
a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest problem today is water. There is none at her home. A
neighbor who used to share now refuses the ambuya and children even
a drop. Another neighbor agreed to supply water but for 100
Zimbabwean dollars a month (a little more than US$2), a shockingly
high price. ``At the moment, I have nothing, so there is no water _
except from the rain,'' she says, clasping her tired, leathery
hands together tightly.
</P>
<P>
   She has another problem. The local government, which owns the
land she occupies, wants to sell off the old golf course and has
told her and the children to leave.
</P>
<P>
   So close to the end of her life, she cannot imagine living
elsewhere and indeed knows nowhere to go. ``Soon, I will be gone
and they can just take it all,'' she says. ``I hope they can
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the AIDS orphans end up under the care of their
grandmothers. As little support and assistance as there is for AIDS
orphans, there is less for the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Vlembeu, Zimbabwe's deputy director for social welfare,
said her country's resources are simply too limited to reach AIDS
orphans. In her office in central Harare, she compares the scale of
disaster to Zimbabwe's 1980 war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to deal with children who would be brought to us by
Army officers and others, but now we have to go out and find
them,'' she said. Her department has only one caseworker in each of
57 rural districts. Many don't have cars. ``Some areas are very
weak, and children are suffering because of it,'' she says. ``We
have inadequate resources, but even the meager resources we have,
people cannot access them.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country there are efforts to fill this enormous void.
</P>
<P>
   In a small remote valley near the northeastern village of
Mutoko, Jean Cornneck tries to provide orphans something
approximating a home. Cornneck _ called Momma Jean by everyone at
the Mother of Peace home _ says the site was selected by divine
provenance six years ago. She says that clues supplied from God via
a woman in South Africa led the home's founders to this site near
an old leper colony.
</P>
<P>
   On instructions from above, the home accepts no government
support and tries to make itself self-sufficient by farming. ``The
Lord told us to help those infected and affected by AIDS,'' says, a
gentle but forceful woman with a round face and short, snowy hair.
``And that's exactly what we do here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she and volunteers have built a half-dozen cottages.
Each has two rooms for sleeping quarters for children, with as many
as 15 in each Spartan room. Each cottage has a kitchen and small
quarters for a woman, who acts as caretaker but is rewarded with
the title ``momma'' by her charges. Mother of Peace is home to 80
children, 35 of whom are under the age of six.
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits. Mother of Peace is at capacity but more
children continue arriving. On once recent day, Momma Jean was
handed a tiny baby, upon whom she immediately began to shower
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Both the baby's parents had died of AIDS and the child's
relatives no longer can care for it. The baby can stay until he is
old enough to leave.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the children at the home have all the signs of AIDS,
many show symptoms of other diseases such as tuberculosis, which is
enjoying a renaissance along with the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 percent of all children under 15 are infected with HIV,
often it came with their mother's milk. In them, the virus lives on
as a morbid connection to mothers and a sad omen of their futures.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the central Zimbabwean village of Mucheke, Tinashe Cami has
known for some time that he's not healthy. He's on the verge of 16,
yet he is so small and frail that he could easily be mistaken for
10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   Children at school have teased him about AIDS because he is so
thin and often is wracked by a cough. A recent test shows he's
HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   He lost both his mother and the woman he came to regard as an
aunt to AIDS. He's lucky because a local group pays for his school
fees and uniform. His aunt's sister allows him to remain in the
house, where he has lived the nine years since his mother's death.
</P>
<P>
   He's a good student, even promising at geography and English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a soldier and a teacher,'' he says, sitting on
the sofa decorated by his late aunt with a fabric adorned with
Valentine hearts. He likes the idea of being a soldier because he
views the army as a force deployed to help people in need.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to teach because he loves children. Even talking about
this ambition causes a smile to break across his face. Despite his
love of children, he has no plans to have any _ in part because of
his illness, but also because he judges the world a poor place for
kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things are going this century, it's very hard to think
of having a family.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks of his mother often. ``I remember her face, it was
round and sweet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The happiest moment of his life came during the ceremony held
when his aunt was laid to rest. In Africa, this usually takes
places some time after the body is buried and represents a farewell
and celebration of the departed one's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a very good feeling about the prospects for her soul,''
he says, smiling a little with the memory. ``Her soul has gone to a
very pure place.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the room from where he sits is a framed copy of her death
notice. On a yellowed newspaper clipping is her picture and the
words: ``No more pain, no more sleepless nights.''
</P>
<P>
   For Tinashe and the mass of Africa's AIDS orphans, this must
describe heaven itself.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Mhloyi, the University of Zimbabwe professor, expresses deep
frustration and helplessness over the epidemic and its unbridled
destruction of her people and society.
</P>
<P>
   She wonders why more isn't done. ``Sometimes you wonder if in
the West AIDS isn't seen as some kind of population control program
for Africa,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, she has watched with amazement the spectacle
over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, the child at the center of a
custody battle between the United States and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this over one boy, when here there are hundreds of
thousands of children in Zimbabwe in so much pain,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The UN's AIDS agency estimates that it needs up to $3 billion to
fight the disease in sub-Saharan Africa. The world spent $600
billion to ward off Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration is seeking $325 million from a
reluctant Congress to fight the AIDS crisis in Africa. About $7
billion a year is spent in the United States on prevention,
treatment and research for AIDS _ even though there are about 25
times more people infected with HIV in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there's a war, the international community reacts
decisively on the basis that it is trying to save lives,'' she
says. ``Look at Bosnia and Kosovo. I don't understand why the
international community hasn't reacted in the same way here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This too is a war.''

<P>
   MBARE, Zimbabwe _ In a wooden shed behind one of the tiny
cinderblock houses that line this district's narrow dirt roads,
12-year-old Nomsa Mwale struggles with her new role as mother.
</P>
<P>
   Nomsa's father died of AIDS in 1998. Six months ago, her mother
followed him, leaving the five children to make their way in a
world that offers little comfort and less hope.
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, Nomsa stares vacantly away from the people who
have come to see her. She is thin and has a sweet, doe-like face.
With a tiny, wispy voice, she answers the questions about her
family's circumstance, but she does not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The first-born girl, it has fallen to her to care for older
brother Sibongile, 15, and the three younger children: Shonia, 10;
Garikai, 9; and Betina, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Their life is a frenzy of survival guided by little more than
the advice given by their mother as she prepared her children for
their journey without her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me to tell the boys not to go to people's houses
because if something is missing, they will blame them,'' Nomsa
says. ``She said, 'You need to feed the others but also you must
learn to take care of yourself.'''
</P>
<P>
   This was the best advice, because Nomsa has almost no one but
herself.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic in Africa is an orphan-making machine,
striking down millions of men and women in their prime
child-rearing years. A recent United Nations report estimates that
Africa is home to more than 9 million children who have lost their
parents to AIDS. If nothing changes, this number is expected to
triple over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, there are as many as 800,000 AIDS orphans. In one
rural school, 24 percent of its 946 students have lost their
parents to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As international aid groups stagger under the weight of their
task and complain bitterly over the of the lack of funding from the
West _ most notably, the United States _ the machine shows no sign
of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, about 400 Zimbabweans die from AIDS-related illnesses,
most of them likely to have children. It is the same story across
Africa, where new statistics show that 23.3 million people are
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. In 1998, 2.2 million
Africans died from AIDS-related illnesses; while 200,000 died in
the continent's many wars.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of Zimbabwe's 11 million to 13 million
residents are HIV-positive, the highest AIDS rate in Africa. In
this one country, roughly half the size of Texas, twice as many
people are infected with the AIDS virus than in all of North
America. An estimated 3,000 more are infected each week.
</P>
<P>
   Unless something unexpected happens, virtually all will die.
AIDS already permeates most lives here. Stories of stricken
relatives are as common as comments on the weather. There is a
never-ending parade of funerals. Mortuaries in the major cities _
Harare and Bulawayo _ remain open 24 hours a day to handle the boom
of bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic has decimated the country's most productive layer
of society _ the 18- to 40-year-olds who do the work, pay the taxes
and raise the children.
</P>
<P>
   They leave behind legions like Nomsa with little prospect of the
most basic emotional, physical or material necessities.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-by-8-foot shack occupied by Nomsa and her siblings is
surrounded by rusting lean-tos inhabited by tough-looking older
men. The children share a foul-smelling toilet and shower with the
men.
</P>
<P>
   When the children have food, usually a little something provided
by local charities, they cook on a one-burner stove. From time to
time the food is stolen by the lodgers, who pay Nomsa's uncle to
sleep in the hovels that surround the shed.
</P>
<P>
   The structures are behind a slovenly house owned by Nomsa's long
dead grandparents. The children have no legal rights to the
property, which is owned by their uncle. They have no birth
certificates to prove who they are.
</P>
<P>
   The children do laundry once a month when they have soap. The
girls sleep on the one bed inside the shed. The boys sleep on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   None go to school. They can't afford the equivalent of US$6 to
US$10 in fees each per term much less the US$10 it costs each for
uniforms and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   And her extended family?
</P>
<P>
   Their uncle wants to evict them. Nomsa has a legal paper from
him demanding that they vacate the property. He has told them he
wants their space so that he can take in a few more paying lodgers.
He complains to the children bitterly about the money they're
costing him by using up his real estate. He has never been violent,
but the children are terrified of him.
</P>
<P>
   Already numbed by her losses, Nomsa cannot seem to get her mind
around this new threat.
</P>
<P>
   When asked where she will go, she has no answer. A tear streams
down her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Local charities are struggling with the uncle trying to see if
they don't need to just pay him off to leave the children alone.
The uncle has shown little inclination to be compassionate with his
nieces and nephews.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what can we do?'' asks Kizito Makore, a volunteer with the
Mashambanzou Charity, noticeably depressed after visiting children.
``They need so much and we have so little to give.''
</P>
<P>
   While the case of Nomsa and her siblings is a bad one, it is
hardly unique.
</P>
<P>
   Before the AIDS epidemic, only 2 percent of African children
were orphaned. The rate now is as high as 11 percent, and UNICEF
expects it to reach 35 percent in Zimbabwe within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those with HIV become infected before the age of 25 and
die while their children are too young to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of orphans comes at a time when extreme poverty has
reduced to near nothing an already feeble social welfare system in
this largely agrarian society. About 63 percent of the people in
Zimbabwe are classified as poor. The unemployment rate is more than
50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When AIDS strikes parents, incomes dry up. The family slips
deeper into poverty as it devotes its meager resources to caring
for sick loved ones and eventually transporting a body home and
funeral. In the rural areas, it can cost the equivalent of two
years income to bury a loved one.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has shattered the traditional system of extended
families, as witnessed with Nomsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now a fallacy that the African family is there to cushion
the impact on orphans,'' said Marvellous(CQ) Mhloyi, the chair of
population studies at the University of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Worsening economic conditions have pushed relatives to be
indifferent, even callous. ``Human beings are selfish,'' Mhloyi
says. ``Under difficult economic times, that degree of selfishness
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, an uncle or other relative would take control
of the parents' assets but would also assume responsibility for the
well-being of the children, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now if the parents die, then the uncle will try to take
the house and other property and depend on others to absorb the
orphans.''
</P>
<P>
   New studies show that AIDS orphans are more likely to be
malnourished than other children. When they go to foster families,
they tend to shoulder heavier workloads than other children already
in the families. They are less likely to go to school.
</P>
<P>
   Even with so many AIDS orphans, their numbers almost certainly
will rise dramatically. More children live with parents who are
HIV-positive than the number who have already become orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Ngoni Guba, the orphan coordinator for Midland AIDS Service
Organization in Gweru, said the future for these children is grim.
Her organization cares for more than 720 AIDS orphans in central
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are out of school and have no skills training to
allow them to find something to do,'' she says. ``For the boys, you
can foresee delinquency and early manhood. Girls will get married
early _ maybe 15 _ and then what?''
</P>
<P>
   Girls are the most vulnerable. Teenage girls in Africa are eight
times more likely to have AIDS than boys in the same age group.
Most girls get it from older men, ``Sugar Daddies'' who trade sex
for a little money, protection or food.
</P>
<P>
   Many older HIV-infected men will pressure young girls because of
the widely accepted myth in Africa that says a man can be cleansed
of the AIDS virus by having sex with a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a desperate struggle to care for their brothers and
sisters, many teen-age girls turn to prostitution, aid workers say.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS epidemic is also making more and more elderly people
parents again, forcing many to consume their already modest savings
on school fees and the other expenses they had assumed were behind
them. Others must resort to backbreaking manual labor to produce
enough food to feed the additional mouths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these grandparents are at the stage in life when they
need someone to look after them and then suddenly that are forced
to begin again looking after children,'' said Felicity Hatendi,
UNICEF's external relations officer in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   On a disused golf course outside Harare, Lina Smoke sits on the
hard sandy earth in the shade of a peach tree. Not far away are the
two rusting shacks she's called home for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke, who at 88 seems all bone and callous, smiles sweetly at
Terrence, her 4-year-old grandson who now knows her as mother.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence squats beside her, sucking ravenously on the peal of an
orange, a rare treat. Black ants gather under him, attracted by the
drops of juice.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Terrence and his three siblings, Kenneth, 7;
Sharon, 8; and Rovesai, 10, came to their ``ambuya'' _ the local
word for ``granny'' _ after their mother died of AIDS. Their father
was already dead from an AIDS-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   After their mother died, social workers found their ambuya and
delivered the children to her. Smoke says this was the last time
the government gave her anything.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband used to caddy at the gold course, which has been
reclaimed by native weeds, bushes and trees. He built the shacks
himself two decades ago, and they lived together there until he
died five or six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   To feed the children, she works the hard dry land to grow corn
and a green leafy vegetable around the shacks. The children, she
laughs, are too young to help her much with the tilling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel too tired, I'm so old,'' she says, sitting in
the wilting afternoon heat. ``I feel I'm going to die any time,
even in the middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what of the children? She looks at Terrence. ``Put them in
a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest problem today is water. There is none at her home. A
neighbor who used to share now refuses the ambuya and children even
a drop. Another neighbor agreed to supply water but for 100
Zimbabwean dollars a month (a little more than US$2), a shockingly
high price. ``At the moment, I have nothing, so there is no water _
except from the rain,'' she says, clasping her tired, leathery
hands together tightly.
</P>
<P>
   She has another problem. The local government, which owns the
land she occupies, wants to sell off the old golf course and has
told her and the children to leave.
</P>
<P>
   So close to the end of her life, she cannot imagine living
elsewhere and indeed knows nowhere to go. ``Soon, I will be gone
and they can just take it all,'' she says. ``I hope they can
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the AIDS orphans end up under the care of their
grandmothers. As little support and assistance as there is for AIDS
orphans, there is less for the grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   Nellie Vlembeu, Zimbabwe's deputy director for social welfare,
said her country's resources are simply too limited to reach AIDS
orphans. In her office in central Harare, she compares the scale of
disaster to Zimbabwe's 1980 war for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to deal with children who would be brought to us by
Army officers and others, but now we have to go out and find
them,'' she said. Her department has only one caseworker in each of
57 rural districts. Many don't have cars. ``Some areas are very
weak, and children are suffering because of it,'' she says. ``We
have inadequate resources, but even the meager resources we have,
people cannot access them.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country there are efforts to fill this enormous void.

</P>

   But there are limits. Mother of Peace is at capacity but more

handed a tiny baby, upon whom she immediately began to shower
affection.
</P>
<P>
   Both the baby's parents had died of AIDS and the child's

billion a year is spent in the United States on prevention,
treatment and research for AIDS _ even though there are about 25
times more people infected with HIV in Africa.

   ``When there's a war, the international community reacts
decisively on the basis that it is trying to save lives,'' she
says. ``Look at Bosnia and Kosovo. I don't understand why the
international community hasn't reacted in the same way here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This too is a war.''

THE ART OF BADGERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE _ In Dick Bennett terminology, the man who sets a
screen is known as a ``blocker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I started coaching high school in the Green Bay area,''
explained the Wisconsin mentor, ``and if I didn't use football
terminology when I arrived there I couldn't get anyone to listen to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   So he takes no umbrage when people say his Badgers are nothing
but a pad-less collection of misplaced gridders who happen to be
playing basketball. ``We try to play as physically as we can within
the rules,'' he said. ``Those who say that are pretty close to the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   With Temple sitting back on on North Broad Street wondering why
the sun had to shine so brightly on them, Wisconsin has officially
become the 2000 NCAA tournament Opponent From Hell. Regardless of
the game's outcome, the Badgers will win the fight. And they may
also win the game that goes along with it. The eighth-seeded
Badgers (20-13) have already broken the will of a pair of
high-octane offensively-oriented teams in Fresno State and
top-seeded Arizona, and now they will try to frustrate, disorient,
aggravate, and just plain humble fourth-seeded LSU (28-5) in the
West Regional semifinals at the University of New Mexico's Pit
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To say that Wisconsin is not your prototypical modern college
basketball powerhouse is to say that coal is no longer America's
heating method of choice. The Badgers are perfectly at home in a
45-44 game. Only junior forward Mark Vershaw averages double
figures in scoring (12.2). Their marquee player, if you'll pardon
the expression, is a rugged guard who gets his jollies by shredding
offensive reputations. Surely, Mike Kelley won't be sailing into
the NBA by virtue of his 5.2 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   They are all happy doing what they do because they all know who
they are. Or aren't. There will be no team meetings asking Coach
Bennett to jazz up his offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to play on a running team,'' said Andy Kowske,
another junior forward, ``I'd pull a hamstring.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely not the running type,'' echoed Vershaw, whose
chief claim to fame is that he is the Big Ten's only married
player. ``That's why I came here. If we were a running team, I'd
probably play five minutes a game.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kelley makes three. No biggies were recruiting him out of
Milwaukee's Pius XII High School. Most Top 40 schools prefer their
point guards to have a smidgen of quickness and be able to shoot,
at least a little. That lets out Mike Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   But to Bennett, this kid looked like a regular Isiah Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike wasn't a flashy scorer in high school,'' Bennett pointed
out. ``But I saw him once and I knew I wanted him to play for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach and the kid can't even get their stories straight.
Coach Bennett says the lad set his heart a'flutter at an AAU
extravaganza in Las Vegas. The kid thinks the coach started making
the goo-goo eyes at him in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing they do agree on was the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike, I'd like to offer you a schol-''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it!''
</P>
<P>
   Thus did wily Bennett secure for himself the services of the
1998-99 Big Ten Defender of the Year (he lost out this year to Ohio
State swatmeister Ken Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Kelley epitomizes what we are going after,'' said
Bennett. ``He's a low-risk, low-maintenance player who doesn't take
unnecessary chances. He is going to be safe with the basketball.
And on defense he will guard everybody from the point guard to the
power forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, you now have the Wisconsin profile. First, you have
sticky, unyielding, aggressive, unrelenting, irritating, and, on
many happy Badger occasions, terrifying, man-to-man defense. The
Wisconsin defense is where offensive reputations come to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you can see the frustration in their eyes,'' said
Vershaw. ``And when we see the other players start to fight among
themselves, we know we have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Then you have the Wisconsin offense. The Badgers have no go-to
guy. What they have are a bunch of ``Do You Mind Taking The Shot?''
guys. A quick shot for these guys is anything taken with fewer than
five seconds on the clock. Transition? Maybe _ maybe _ if there is
a steal between the top of the key and midcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I value possession of the basketball,'' said Bennett. ``I like
to eliminate mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Egos, too. He eliminates them completely. Ten players have
started a game this season for the Badgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't good enough for me to say at any time, `These are
our five guys,' '' Bennett explained. ``The players seem to
understand this. We need to make adjustments according to the
opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is a certified industry phenomenon. He coached
Wisconsin-Stevens Point for nine years (the name ``Terry Porter''
might ring a bell) before upgrading to Wisconsin-Green Bay for a
10-year run that included three appearances in the NCAA tourney and
three in the NIT. He came to Wisconsin five years ago. Though he
says he occasionally got a little frisky at Stevens Point, he has
spent his 15-year Division 1 career recruiting the plowhorses left
behind after the glamour boys were through picking over the
thoroughbreds. Hence the methodical style.
</P>
<P>
   The public may not know him, but his peers certainly do. When
Sports Illustrated surveyed 115 Division 1 coaches last year and
asked which coach's clinic they'd most like to attend, the only
people selected ahead of Bennett were Mike Krzyzewski, Rick
Majerus, and Bob Knight. And when the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
asked 113 Division 1 coaches to identify the coach who regularly
does the best job under the most difficult circumstances,'' Bennett
was No. 2 on that list.
</P>
<P>
   LSU coach John Brady knows who he's up against. ``I have a great
deal of respect for Dick Bennett,'' Brady said. ``I have attended
his clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, what's with Wisconsin's NIT-looking record entering the
tournament (18-13)? Start with a Big Ten schedule (the Badgers
finished sixth). Then remember that it's not easy being
out-athleticised every night you're not playing Northwestern. But
be advised that things began to fall in place for this team in the
middle of February and that Wisconsin, playing under
tournament-type, win-or-else pressure, is 9-3 since Feb. 5, with
all three losses coming to consensus tourney favorite Michigan
State.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Badgers are in the tournament and tournament basketball
is usually half-court basketball. Advice to the Bayou boys: buckle
'em up, sons. The way the Badgers look at it, the team that bleeds
together, beats higher seeds together.

TAR HEELS FLOWER WITH FORTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At first, he was just one of those
happy-to-be-here type players. All Joseph Forte wanted was a chance
to play. Beyond that the 6-foot-4-inch freshman had no great
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In November, at the Maui (Hawaii) Invitational, North Carolina
coach Bill Guthridge gave Forte that chance in the season's first
game against Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Forte scored 24 points in the Tar Heels's 82-65 win. Two wins
later _ over Georgetown and Purdue _ Forte was making a similar
speech. ``All I want is a chance to play,'' he said as he accepted
the tourney's most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to last weekend in Birmingham, Ala. NCAA tournament
South Regional second-round game. No. 8 seed North Carolina vs. No.
1 seed Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Second half. Tie game. Until . . . a 3-point shot from the top
of the key by Forte, followed by another bomb from the top of the
key gave the Tar Heels a 60-53 victory, a win that propelled the
Tar Heels into the South semifinal game against No. 4 seed
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Forte's box score line: 17 points, 5 rebounds, 1 assist, and no
turnovers in 38 minutes 24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Typical. Predicatable and now, as the season moves into an area
that even the most die-hard Tar Heel fans didn't expect their team
to reach, necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal was just to start,'' said Forte, who has done so
all season and is the first freshman in UNC history to lead the
team in scoring (16.2 points per game), which is not insignficant
when you look at an alumni list that includes players named Jordon,
Perkins, Worthy, and Ford. ``After that, I was going to let
whatever happen, happen. But after I got here and started playing
it seemed like everything kept rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Forte's journey to North Carolina began in Marietta, Ga. He was
a budding superstar in eighth grade and the subject of a recruiting
war of sorts for his services in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Forte was scheduled to move on to Marietta's Campbell High
School, but his mother, Wanda Hightower, thought her son didn't
need to be the savior of a program.
</P>
<P>
   So she searched and focused on nationally-known DeMatha High
School in Maryland and famed coach Morgan Wooten.
</P>
<P>
   In a bigger pond, Forte could develop at his own pace, which he
did from the start.
</P>
<P>
   At DeMatha, Forte had to learn some humility as well as
basketball. Forte had him play a season of junior varsity before he
was deemed ready to receive any kind of star treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was tough on my ego,'' Forte conceded. ``But looking back
on it, it was probably the best thing for me. I looked as it a
humility-type thing.''
</P>
<P>
   By his senior season, everyone was chasing him, but Carolina,
with its tradition of success, won the recruiting war.
</P>
<P>
   Forte thought Maryland seemed lukewarm in its pursuit of him,
particularly from coach Gary Williams. Georgetown did not have the
same mystique after John Thompson retired, which put North Carolina
in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But not even Tar Heels coach Bill Guthridge knew quite what
would happen when he started Forte in the first game of the first
season.
</P>
<P>
   If he had seen some summer league games in which Forte more than
held his own with talent like former Maryland guard Steve Francis,
who was the No. 2 pick in last season's NBA draft, Guthridge would
have felt even better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Joseph was a good prospect,'' said Guthridge. ``But
until you work with him, it's hard to tell. I didn't know what to
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   He learned quickly. After scoring 24 points against USC, Forte
followed with 17 points against Georgetown and 21 in the
championship game against Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Forte was doing more than starting. He was starring. ``I knew
after the three games in Hawaii that the cat was out of the bag,''
said Forte. ``I felt like I was kind of cheating because nobody
knew who I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon everyone knew his name. In a season that had been, until
the NCAA tournament wins over Missouri and Stanford, bittersweet
with the most losses for any UNC team in 50 years, Forte has been
the constant, showing up every game, playing 30-35 minutes a night
and producing numbers a veteran might produce, not someone who is
not even 40 games into his college career.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Tar Heels struggled through a series of injuries
and illnesses that kept them on the fringe of the Top 25, or out of
it, for most of the season, Forte has provided the team with a
sense of well-being, that when things do go wrong, he can somehow
provide an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ```He does have a sense of confidence,'' said Guthridge. ``He
knows how to play and poise is a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Poise is very much a part of it. Against Stanford, with a season
on the brink of ending, Forte was the Tar Heels' go-to guy.
</P>
<P>
   Forte said he thought that early in his career. ``After the Maui
tournament I wasn't surprised by keeping it up,'' he said. ``I got
a feeling for it and realized it wasn't all that different from the
speed I played in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   That confidence, which would sound cocky coming from a more
vocal playeer, has been part of Forte's personality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent success, this is hardly a vintage Carolina
team in terms of talent. Although there are the requisite veteran
stars, such as point guard Ed Cota and center Brendon Haywood, no
one on this roster is likely to find his number hanging from the
Dean Dome rafters in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   No one, that is, except Forte. ``He is probably the only
legititmate `banner' player they have,'' said one UNC insider who
has watched the program closely for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   Forte does not know where his season or his career will go
beyond Friday.
</P>
<P>
   With everyone healthy and confident, the Tar Heels matchup well
against Tennessee, Miami, and Tulsa, the other teams still playing
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   If they can win Friday night, and get by the winner of the
Miami-Tulsa winner on Sunday night, anything would seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Tar Heels are just enjoying the turn in a season
that seemed to be doomed to failure only a few weeks ago.

ARIZONA'S GEM SHINES BRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PHOENIX _ There are those who would tell you the Arizona
Diamondbacks should have to pay a tariff for their success. Their
rapid rise to the level of the elite clubs is almost intimidating.
Twenty months is just too quick.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no denying the fact that in winning 100 games last
year and reaching the National League playoffs faster than any
expansion club in history, Phoenix has become the envy of all
baseball. So much so that when the long-awaited realignment, it
will be a coup for the league that gets this one-time desert
outpost.
</P>
<P>
   As a franchise, the Diamondbacks have it all. The Diamondbacks
play in a new 49,000-seat stadium and have drawn 6.6 million fans
in two seasons. Only Colorado, which drew 4 million to Denver's
Mile High Stadium (80,000 capacity) has done better in its opening
season.
</P>
<P>
   Calling themselves ``The Southwest's Team.'' Phoenix is being
marketed with the same efficiency of the NBA's Phoenix Suns. The
Diamondbacks should be. Jerry Colangelo is a managing general
partner of both franchises. What he has done to stabilize the
growth of professional sports in the Valley of the Sun is nothing
short of amazing.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have expressed a preference to be in the
National League. But a two-year trial period is over and the odds
are very good that you'll see them in Fenway Park in 2001.
According to a recent interview with Red Sox chief executive
officer John Harrington, it's a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep hearing rumors about that,'' said Arizona manager Buck
Showalter. ``But it's all the same to me. Just so we get to put on
a major league uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter makes a good point. Last year, Arizona went from worst
to first, something that has only happened six times in major
league history. The Diamondbacks won the NL West by 14 games. In
1995, Colorado made the playoffs in its third year but as a wild
card. The Florida Marlins, who began in 1993, won the 1997 World
Series and then dumped all their key players. You can bet the house
that it won't happen that way for the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Coangelo is committed to doing whatever it takes to field a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along that this would be Arizona's team,'' said
Showalter, who was on the job as manager in 1995, two years before
the expansion draft. We're the Southwest's team. Not just
Phoenix's. We never want to take things for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the novelty of a new stadium and a new franchise would
wear off some day and we were down some the second year (from
3,600,412 to 2,887,170). But the reason our fans are continuing to
support us is because we put a product on the field that they can
be proud of. We take the responsibility very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the moves Coangelo and the Diamondbacks made last year
was the signing of free agent lefthander Randy Johnson. Johnson won
the National League Cy Young award and the heart of Phoenix fans
with a 17-10 record. He led the NL in ERA (2.48), strikeouts (364),
innings (272), and complete games (12). He expects to do as well,
if not better.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lost his only start in the division playoffs against the
Mets, who won the five-game series, 3-1. But the lift he gave his
teammates by helping get them there meant more to the Diamondbacks
than they could every say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of what they accomplished ,'' said Showalter.
``And anybody who was at Shea Stadium last year and thought we'd be
happy with the way things ended doesn't know the makeup of these
players we're lucky enough to surround ourselves with. Good players
make good teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work we did as an organizationn reflects a constant
proving ground. What we did last year has to thrown out the window.
We all know that. Nobody wants to take a step back, but we know
that it's going to be very challenging
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there is any one approach. We have a lot of
people here you can trust. The do their work. They don't assume
anything or take anything for granted. Everyday is another proving
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Diamondbacks went to work last spring, they were given
little chance for success. Johnson had left a Houston club that
hocked part of its future to get him. That he would sign with an
expansion club helped put the Diamondbacks in a new light.
</P>
<P>
   With veterans like Luis Gonzalez, Jay Bell, and Steve Finley
pushing the less-experienced players, there was an old-time
baseball attitude that emerged after a 1-5 start and stayed the
rest of the season. Gonzalez hit .336, second in the NL. Outfielder
Steve Finley won a Gold Glove. Bell hit 38 home runs. Matt
Williams, who drove in 142 runs, was like an extra coach and his
chats with young players were said to be invaluable. Tony Womack
stole 72 bases. The Diamondbacks outscored opponents, 908-676.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mix well,'' said Gonzalez, who had hit .300 or better only
once in a nine-year career that included stints with the Astros,
Cubs, and Tigers. ``It's a good group of guys who go out there and
play hard. We get along in the clubhouse and that carries on to the
ballfield. The younger guys feed off the older guys. We run balls
out. We hit home runs and sprint around the bases. We respect the
game of baseball. It carries over to the younger players.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing surprises the Diamondback players anymore, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great front office and manager,'' Gonzalez said.
``They went out and got key players as well as blue-collar guys.
That's who we feel we are. We're not a flashy team. Just a bunch of
guys who play hard. I don't know about where we might finish. Last
year it was predicted we'd be third or fourth in our division. This
year we're probably the favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks will be the favorite because of solid defense
and pitching. They lost starter Andy Benes to St. Louis and
reliever Gregg Olson to Los Angeles, but the rotation still has
Omar Daal (16-9), Armondo Reynoso (10-6), Todd Stottlemyre (6-3),
and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a special group of guys here,'' said pitching coach
Mark Connor. ``They all get along well. I just want them to be
themselves. Already this spring, I've seen veterans take the young
kids and put their arms around them. That great. I think of lot of
that comes from Buck. As a manager, he has tried to mold the club
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter says it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are the ones who get the credit and that's as it
should be,'' he said. ``There's no secret here. The players made
the adjustments during the year. They met the challenges that April
presented us. I don't think anybody who went through our start
would have thought we'd be where we were at the end of the year.
But the way they stayed together was a real tribute to our
players.''

&HT;     CARROT CAKE THAT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE A MIX 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two ways to make carrot cake: Spend a day in the
kitchen grating carrots and beating eggs, or use a mix. But with
most mixes, you get some wimpy cake that tastes more like cinnamon
than carrots and has the texture of a Twinkie. There is a middle
ground.
</P>
<P>
   By doctoring up a standard mix with a grated carrot, a can of
crushed pineapple, raisins and walnuts, you can make people think
you've spent all day slaving over dessert. The pineapple gives an
off-the-shelf cake mix better texture and moisture while the nuts
and raisins add that homemade touch. And, since the carrots in cake
mixes are minced to a point beyond recognition, the strips of
grated carrot make it look like you really did a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, nothing tastes like a hand-grated, home-seasoned,
made-from-scratch carrot cake. The best recipe we've tried comes
from the Frog Commissary in Philadelphia. This dense round has more
carrots than cake and enough raisins and pecans to make you feel as
if you'd hit gold. Between the layers isn't your normal frosting
but a caramelized pecan-cream filling.
</P>
<P>
   Since the filling is so sweet, this recipe for cream cheese
frosting is lighter than others we've tried. It's easy to spread
but not firm enough for decorating. Refrigerate the frosting for 10
minutes or so if you want to force it through a pastry tube.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if you make it from a mix or from scratch,
good cakes start with freshly grated carrots.

POPPING FURNACE MAKES A DIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My new hot-air furnace works wonderfully, almost too well,
because the plenum really pops when it heats up and cools down. The
popping is telegraphed throughout the duct system, so it is heard
close up and far away. How can I silence it?
</P>
<P>
   J.A., Wilder, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A. Short of building a fiberglass plenum (the big metal duct on
top of the furnace), you have to separate that plenum from the rest
of the trunk ducts (the large, rectangular metal ducts coming out
of the plenum).
</P>
<P>
   To do that, unfasten the ducts from the plenum, and separate
them by a few inches. Then insert a canvas sleeve to make the
reconnection. The plenum will still snap and pop (you can't easily
fix that), but it will not telegraph through that soft canvas
connection. You might be able to have your furnace man do this.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible fix is to have the furnace man reduce the heat
of the air in the plenum; a slight reduction might make a
difference, unless of course it makes the house too cold.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Someone burned alcohol in the bathroom and it scorched an 8-
by 5-inch area of wood on a linen cabinet. It does not look
blistered. How can I restore it?
</P>
<P>
   CHESTER GAY, Foxborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Whether it is painted or stained and varnished, the part must
be sanded heavily to remove all the scorched wood; and that usually
means to the bare wood. Then refinish the surface where the damage
occurred. You will not have to refinish any other part.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some old drawers that are recessed, and do not move
very well. I would like to find some drawer slides to make them
work better. Where can I find them?
</P>
<P>
   RICH WEBER, Norwood, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try the Rockler catalog (formerly Woodworkers store). It has
at least three pages of wood and metal slides. Call 800-279-4441.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am remodeling my kitchen, and am wondering which way to go
with the counter tops: Corian vs. granite. And could the draining
board be granite?
</P>
<P>
   CAROL DAVIS, Wayland, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. First off, I do not suggest a granite draining board. Use a
dish drainer or rubber drainer.
</P>
<P>
   As for Corian vs. granite, it's a tossup. Prices are similar,
although some householders have told me they found granite to be
less expensive. Corian is virtually maintenance free, and scratches
and smudges can be sanded or abraded out with a plastic scrubber.
It's also sensitive to heat. Granite should be sealed with a
masonry sealer; otherwise it will spot and stain. Use the sealer
the granite people give you, or should give you. Stains on granite
are difficult, if not impossible, to remove. Corian comes in many
styles, colors, and granite look-alikes. Choice of granite
``patterns'' is limited, but they are spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   All this said, some householders sing the praises of Corian for
the bathroom, but not the kitchen; others swear by it in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   I have two Corian vanities with self-contained sinks in my
bathrooms and my wife and I like them. My wife priced Corian for
her kitchen redo and reversed her field immediately upon hearing
the cost. She opted for tile. We both are happy with it. The grout
joints are very, very thin, reducing but not eliminating the plague
of dirty, uncleanable grout.
</P>
<P>
   If push came to shove, I would opt for Corian. Remember, there
is more than one type of Corian (the first brand name for this
dense plastic material) out there, each claiming to be better than
the other.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a garden-style condo, and had it painted before
moving in. In the kitchen and living room I see cracks and splits
at the top of the wall, where it meets the ceiling. The painter
returned and covered the splits with plaster, then repainted. The
cracks came back. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN SHERR, Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds as if the real crack and split is at the joint
between wall and ceiling. If cracking appears in the paint itself,
it is because it was put on too thickly. The cure there is to sand
off the paint and apply two thin coats of whatever is being
applied.
</P>
<P>
   The joint, however, is another matter. Putting plaster, spackle,
joint compound, or anything else that gets hard in the joint won't
fix it; the movement of wall and ceiling will break it up again,
very quickly, making it look worse. The gap is there because there
was no tape and compound applied originally.
</P>
<P>
   There are two cures: Install a paper or nylon mesh tape to the
joint and finish off with joint compound. The tape will prevent the
crack from showing through again.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative cure is easier: Either do this yourself or have
the painter do it. Apply a bead of white latex or acrylic caulk in
the joint, then smooth it off with your finger. It will cover the
joint, look reasonably attractive, and will not open up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where can I find large tiles of fairly thick cork for a
floor? I can't find anything in the stores, except for little
bulletin boards of very thin corklike material.

MONEY SPIGOT SHUTTING OFF FOR MANY E-BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beautyscene.com strutted into the online marketplace last fall
with a star-studded editorial board that included former
Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurley Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of beautiful has arrived,'' the San Francisco
e-retailer crowed in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a market crowded with dot-coms offering lipsticks and eye
shadows, beautyscene.com barely made a blush. Less than seven
months after its debut, the Internet cosmetics store recently
acknowledged it faces a cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Its experience reflects the harsher climate in which e-commerce
companies now operate. Once flush with investment, a growing number
of Web stores are now running on empty and some are casting about
for new markets. Analysts say these are signs that the industry is
headed for a shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Internet grocer Peapod Inc. said it may not be
able to continue without additional funds. And now that its merger
with Columbia House Co. has been scrapped, music e-retailer CDnow
Inc. needs a new suitor with deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't too long ago that it was thought any entrepreneur with
a good idea could flourish in cyberspace, selling paperback books,
stereo systems, and other products.
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; today &LR; 's Web isn't as accommodating. Investors are
tightening their purse strings, and e-retailing stocks are falling
back to earth. Smaller dot-coms face increasingly crowded fields in
which to carve out a niche and attract customers. Many are forced
to plow their venture capital money into marketing, spending
millions on everything from billboards to Superbowl advertising in
an effort to build their brands.
</P>
<P>
   And, competition is getting stiffer as old-economy retailers
such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. are starting to figure out what clicks
on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big guys will continue to consolidate and get bigger,''
said Rick Neely, interim chief executive of software seller
Beyond.com, based in Santa Clara, Calif. ``The small guys are
finding smaller places to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely is searching for his own corner in cyberspace. An early
leader in electronic commerce, Beyond.com tried to mimic Amazon.com
Inc. by raising huge investment capital and growing as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The effort failed. And like other companies, Beyond.com is now
moving away from its unsuccessful consumer retailing business to
focus on sales to other firms.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as Value America Inc. and even Amazon.com,
have cut staff. Attempting to avoid a financial squeeze,
MotherNature.com, a Concord start-up that sells vitamins, has been
trimming advertising expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the current Web environment will make it
increasingly difficult for dot-coms such as Furniture.com Inc. to
take their shares public. Furniture.com, a Framingham home
furnishings retailer, announced in January its plans to raise $50
million in an offering that has yet to be scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feeling is that what's done is done,'' said David
Cooperstein, an analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge.
``There are no new stories, no new plots.''
</P>
<P>
   Another backlash could come from manufacturers who have been
willing to supply young dot-coms. Left with a stack of unpaid
bills, some suppliers are getting nervous about selling to new
e-retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a few manufacturers are seething. Andrew Auwerda,
president of cosmetics maker Tony &AMP; Tina, said his New York company
called beautyscene.com's offices many times about overdue bills
totaling $7,500. When the e-retailer finally called back, he was
told the company was having cash-flow problems.

   Auwerda said he was upset. ``It's a lot of money to me,'' he
said, ``considering that we've never had the time to do national
advertising, including those large billboards that they've had.''
Beautyscene.com officials did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Such cash crunches, ironically, are coming at a time when busy
consumers are flocking to the Web to buy books, videotapes, and
even automobiles. One forecast, by Forrester Research, estimates
online retail sales will nearly double this year to $39 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But studies of Internet traffic patterns indicate that the
largest and best-known retailers are ringing up most of those sales
_ bad news for upstarts who have spent millions of dollars on
advertising to lure new shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR; , investors frustrated with the growing losses and heavy
start-up costs of the dot-coms seem to have little interest in
supporting fledgling electronic retailers. The exceptions are those
that have a clear lead over rivals or have carved out narrow
niches.
</P>
<P>
   But many corners of the marketplace, such as beauty and pet
products, are already too crowded to support new players. And with
deep-pocketed companies like Best Buy Co. and Wal-Mart entering the
fray, fewer investors want to back a tiny dot-com, even if it could
be the next Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't start a company focused on selling books right
now,'' said Jonathan Guerster, a general partner with Charles River
Ventures in Waltham. ``The bar has gone up. . . . Those who are
late to the market should not have unrealistic expectations about
their ability to raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   At Battery Ventures, a $450 million venture capital firm in
Wellesley, executives seem almost embarrassed by their forays into
Web sales. They'd rather be known for picking standouts such as
Akamai Technologies Inc., which operates a network of servers, than
sluggish performers such as Petstore.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the poster child for why (Internet consumer retailers)
stink,'' said Tom Crotty, a general partner with the venture
capital firm. ``Right after the pets.com deal, we decided this is
not our type of deal.''

 JULIA'S TRASHY TOGS IN `ERIN' INSPIRE A FASHION DIALOGUE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people would be mortified if their boss told them to
``rethink'' their wardrobe because it was making co-workers
``uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Julia Roberts's character in the new film ``Erin
Brockovich.'' The sassy legal assistant _ who insists on wearing
push-up bras, leather miniskirts and sheer leopard-skin blouses _
retorts to her law-office manager, ``You may want to rethink those
ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the sartorial tension in the box office hit, which
chronicles the real-life story of how Brockovich discovers a
utility company cover-up of contaminated water which is making
residents of a California town ill.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when more men and women are breaking traditional
workplace dress codes, Brockovich's in-your-face attitude and
subsequent success says a lot about society. Is this rebel in a
tank top a role model and a heroine for the new millennium? Or is
she an embarrassment to working professionals?
</P>
<P>
   The Boton Globe invited two women to participate in a dialogue
about office dress codes and self-expression in the workplace.
Kirsten Blocker is an editor at the Boston-based female youth
magazine Teen Voices and a 21-year-old English major at Pine Manor
College in Chestnut Hill. Shari Thurer, 52, is a psychologist in
private practice and an adjunct professor at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   As they began debating over dinner recently, the two were quick
to engage in some Brockovich bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's a feminist's nightmare. Her dress is very
provocative, completely inappropriate, and trashy. It's conveyed in
the movie that a lot of things happened for her because people
found her attractive. . . . I found it sickening,'' says Blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Says Thurer, ``I think the Hollywood writers, directors, and
pitch people wanted her to be trashy and powerful. . . . In this
movie, anyone trashy is good and anyone buttoned-up is bad. . . .
They played with your stereotypes. But in the end, a trashy,
powerful woman is also a cliche. . . . It goes against middle-class
sensibilities and good taste. . . . I would want Erin on the couch
to find out what she was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Blocker was incredulous that a twice-divorced mother of three
young children who is living in a roach-infested house with no
savings or marketable job skills would continuously risk her
paycheck by flashing her bra and cursing at her colleagues. ``Most
of us would lose our jobs,'' says Blocker.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, dragging her kids along on company business also
made no sense, says Thurer. ``It's using your children to justify
your humanity. She's saying, `I have three kids. I'm a good
character.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you couldn't be sexy and be a mom. Demi Moore,
who posed on the cover of Vanity Fair nude and pregnant, changed
all that.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which is set in the desert town of Hinkley, Calif.,
certainly seems a long way from the realities of a city like
Boston. Would Brockovich _ sporting a miniskirt _ have been
successful here? ``Someone watching `Ally McBeal' would say she'd
do great,'' says Blocker, who typically wears casual clothing to
work such as sweaters, skirts, jeans and boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yesterday, I was walking by Park Street station and I saw
a woman (in a very short skirt) with her whole leg exposed. She
looked successful. I wanted to say, `Is your skirt caught in your
hose?' I assume she met (her job's) dress code. Still, it was
shocking. That skirt didn't come mid-thigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Thurer, ``At the university, some of the girls dress quite
sexy. They are clad in . . . tight black pants, fitted shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an element in high fashion that's straight from the
trailer park . . . Nowadays, street culture influences high
culture. It's not just in fashion but in art and music, too. If you
look at modern art, the source might be graffiti. In fashion, it
could be a ripped sweatshirt or a baseball cap.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, sexy dressing isn't always shunned by society.
Consider the popularity of singers like Jennifer Lopez, who
attended the Grammy Awards last month wearing a Versace scarf-dress
with a neckline that plunged to her navel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is being normalized,'' says Blocker, shaking her
head. The Dorchester native, who spends about 20 hours a week
helping area teenagers write articles for the Teen Voices on-line
edition, says many teenagers today admire and accept provocative
attire. ``They say it's fashionable. The feeling is, if you've got
the figure, then you go, girl. It's a feminist's dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Thurer, a Bethpage, N. Y., native who calls herself a
first-generation feminist, remembers a time in the '60s, when ``you
couldn't be a feminist and be attractive. You couldn't shave your
legs or wear lipstick. I got my engagement ring, and I wouldn't
wear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when it wasn't cool to pursue materialism.
You were supposed to join the Peace Corps . . . To be a feminist,
you had to be a drone. I support Erin's right to dress as she
wants. My patients do that. It doesn't mean they're bad or good. In
real life, there are good people with bad taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Thurer dresses the way she wants. A typical work
outfit for her is a faux leopard-print furry short skirt, black
sweater and black boots. ``I like funky clothes. You can sort of
get away with it in the academic world. You don't have to dress in
a gray flannel, buttoned-down way. I have a zebra-print belt, a
bracelet made of dominoes, and a million things with exposed
zippers and seams. I would never wear Talbots or L.L. Bean. I would
think I was dead. That's so non-expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurer concedes there was a time when she did submit to office
dress codes. ``If you're low on the totem pole, you have to
conform.'' What about Brockovich? ``I think what the director
wanted you to think was she derived power from this. She could get
people to look at her. It doesn't particularly offend me. It's not
my taste. It did her as much harm as good. She couldn't get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madonna, Dolly Parton, and Courtney Love all did this. Madonna
exposed her boobs and now she's a mother. But she portrays herself
as master of her soul. If you're powerful enough, you can do
whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause at the dinner table and suddenly Brockovich
doesn't seem so offensive after all.
</P>
<P>
   Blocker recalls how the movie's protagonist emotionally
described her tenure as Miss Wichita long ago. ``She said she was
going to work to end world hunger. She never gets around to it.
Then she grasps rather tenaciously this opportunity to make a
difference in people's lives'' with a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be a woman. You get paid less . . . Often, we're
just looking for a way to shine. It goes beyond money. Often times,
we just want to get out there and start'' changing the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Blocker reveals, she plans to launch her own publishing
house for female authors one day. ``I want to fight for a cause. My
mother worked for Planned Parenthood and the YWCA. When we were
children, she taught me a lot about reproductive rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of women I know, life is about seizing an
opportunity to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Brockovich doesn't just dress provocatively; she
flaunts her sexuality to manipulate men. In one scene, for example,
her manager Ed Masry, played by Albert Finney, asks her how she
intends to retrieve hard-to-find records from the local water
regulatory board. Her response? ``They're called boobs, Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it obnoxious, but Blocker says, ``A lot of us use our
femininity to get stuff. I get free bus rides.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Thurer, ``Hello! It's called charm. If you know what you're
doing, go for it. Sexual power is real. Men do it too. They use
their masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meal winds down and Thurer and Blocker prepare to leave,
it's clear Brockovich has earned mixed reviews. She scored points
for her work and her convictions but not for her methods. The one
question both diners felt went unanswered in the movie was why _
with so much to lose _ did Brockovich insist on her call-girl look?
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kurland, costume designer for the movie, asked the real
Erin Brockovich the same question before he created outfits for
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply? Says Kurland, ``She likes dressing that way. She
thinks she looks good. I think she looks at herself and says, `As
long as I can do it and look good, why shouldn't I?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich does have one complaint since she saw Roberts
portraying her on screen, Kurland adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin said she never wore skirts that long. And she meant it.''

<P>
   ``Some people can get a thrill / Knitting sweaters and sitting
still.'' These lines by Stephen Sondheim don't automatically bring
to mind people in their 20s and 30s. But recently the enthusiasm
for knitting has hit well below the middle-age belt. College
students and young professionals are turning back the clock and
adding a bit of old-fashioned knit-one-purl-two rhythm to their
high-tech lives.
</P>
<P>
   And they're doing it big time.
</P>
<P>
   They're taking lessons and learning from one another. Joining
knitting groups at local libraries and yarn shops. Checking out Web
sites on their computers. And buying patterns to re-create the
couture creations they see on catwalks, in fashion magazines, and
on their favorite celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   They're knitting in the evenings in front of the television. At
noon in cafeterias. They're knitting on subways, buses, planes, and
in waiting rooms. They're even knitting _ contortion style _ while
walking down the street, needles in motion and cell phone pressed
to one ear.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not only women.
</P>
<P>
   Jim H. Grassi, 30, a graduate student in chemistry at Boston
University, took up knitting last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was looking for a creative outlet and decided to take
a knitting course,'' says Grassi. ``I said I'd take it with her.
I'm a skier and thought maybe I'd be able to make a sweater I liked
and one so thick it would stop a bullet. The course lasted eight
weeks. I loved it. I'm hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid baseball fan, Grassi does most of his knitting while
listening to games on the radio. He completed an Icelandic sweater
with snowflake pattern last year. This year he figures he'll double
his output _ 162 games times three hours per game equals two
sweaters by the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about knitting is it's utterly mindless,'' says
Grassi. ``It unhinges the mind. And you don't feel like you're
completely vegetating because when the game's over _ you're halfway
done with a sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Scope, co-owner of the 15-year-old Putting on the Knitz
store in Newton, Mass. and Grassi's instructor, says there's a
waiting list for his evening knitting classes and a shift in his
store's clientele. Today's yarn buyers, he says, are professional
women in their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the attraction is computer related,'' says
Scope. ``Everything is so mechanical these days and knitting is one
thing that a person has complete control over. They're creating a
garment from scratch _ starting with one string and one stitch at a
time. They can fix their mistakes. They're in complete control. And
doing something very creative.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he says, big sweaters knitted with big yarn on big
needles are in. And the ever-growing number of yarn choices include
blended wools, soft alpacas, mohairs, chenilles, and high-end
cashmeres and camel hair. Acrylics are out, natural fibers in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can knit almost everything for under $100,'' says Scope.
Or you can knit single things for many hundreds of dollars. Cathi
Rosengren, owner of I'm in Stitches in Newburyport, says many of
her customers pay $80 a skein for special-order silk blends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new yarns feel great in the hands and are so colorful,''
says Scope. ``Plus knitting is therapeutic. I had a customer in
yesterday. She's a lawyer who said she'd shut her office door the
day before and knitted for two hours. No one knew. Knitting is the
most beneficial when you're the busiest. It makes you relax and
helps you concentrate. Some college kids knit during lectures
because it helps them focus _ they aren't daydreaming or looking
around to see what everyone else is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gonzalez, 27, learned to knit from her aunt as a child and
then picked it up again in college, where she knitted her way
through many a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I retaught myself to knit because I was seeing intricate
knits, cable structures, and color work I wanted to make for
myself,'' says Gonzalez, who began her college career as a pre-vet
major before switching to design at North Carolina State
University. ``I love the feeling of raw wool and its preparation _
the spinning and dyeing. I like creating a structure out of
stitches. It's all very logical, which ties into my science
background.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gonzalez, who works at Woolcott &AMP; Co., a knitting store
in Cambridge, Mass., knits weekly with a group of fellow knitters
whom she's taught over the past few years. Although they knit at
different levels, they get together for the sheer pleasure of
knitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knitting has skipped a generation, so learning to knit is now
cool,'' says Carla Scott, senior editor of Vogue Knitting magazine.
``There are plenty of patterns out there for sweaters, ponchos, and
shrugs. And the novelty yarns and washable wools are great. Plus
knitters can get answers to their questions and share ideas on the
Internet (eknitting.com, knitlest.com, www.kniton.com, to name a
few).''
</P>
<P>
   Knitting even found a seat at the most recent Super Bowl. Not
one but two ads featured knitting, one with Tara Lipinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Piantigini, a librarian, recently started a knitting group
that meets every Monday night at the library, and another new group
has begun meeting at the Brookline Brooksmith. Jennifer Walsh is a
member of a monthly knitting/book club and has also begun to attend
a Thursday afternoon knitting group made up of young neighborhood
mothers. And over at WGBH-TV in Boston, a large group gets together
weekly to knit and lunch in the station's cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Frude, who owns Woolcott &AMP; Co. and presides over a
five-year-old knitting group, says she noticed a big influx of
younger knitters in her store last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of them are high-tech people looking for low-tech
creative outlets,'' says Frude. ``But basically, knitting is and
has always been dictated by fashion. Back in 1978, Perry Ellis came
out with $300 short sweaters with puff sleeves. Women who hadn't
knitted since they were Girl Scouts said `I can do that.' The same
thing's happening today with the chunky designer knits.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she says, celebrities add fuel to any trend. Julia Roberts,
a knitter, helped push the little knitted hat into prominence in
1998 by plopping one on her handsome head in the movie ``Stepmom.''
Other on-the-set knitters are Winona Ryder, Cameron Diaz, and
Hilary Swank of ``Boys Don't Cry.'' Monica Lewinsky told Barbara
Walters that she kept her sanity during her year of infamy by
churning out scarves and sweaters for friends.
</P>
<P>
   Frude says she's thinking of bringing a ``knit out'' to Boston
this spring _ an all-day affair that would feature instruction,
supplies, and fashions. Last October's Knit Out in New York City,
sponsored by the Craft Yarn Council of America, drew 7,000 knitters
and membership in the Knitting Guild of America has increased 10
percent in three years. And according to the council, 4 million
people began knitting last year, a number some store owners cite as
too high.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all newcomers to knitting hover around the
Generation X mark. Dixie Walker, 44, who began knitting two months
ago, attends two knitting classes a week, one in Littleton and
another in Harvard. Although many of her classmates are highly
skilled knitters, they come to class to socialize.
</P>
<P>
   Knitting, in other words, is both a sociable and portable craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about what's happening in our towns, about our
families, and how we hide our yarns from our husbands,'' says
Walker, who works for publisher John Wiley &AMP; Sons. ``It's very hard
to resist yarns on sale. There's always future projects to buy for.
I've got five projects lined up at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Katzenstein, owner of the 24-year-old Wild &AMP; Woolly store
in Lexington, Mass., which imports a wide array of luxury yarns,
credits part of the recent wave of enthusiasm to an innovation by
several yarn companies _ beautifully photographed, hardcover
designer pattern books with accompanying specially dyed yarns.
</P>
<P>
   ``These designer pattern and yarn packages have evolved over the
past couple of years,'' says Katzenstein. ``Some of the most
popular designers are Alice Starmor from Scotland _ she has
wonderful books and beautiful yarns. Kaffee Fassett is an American
who lives in England, and he's very popular. And Jo Sharp, a
relatively new designer, is from Australia, and there's Colinette
from Wales.''
</P>
<P>
   The store also carries yarns from Japan, New Zealand, South
Africa, Japan, and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think knitting attracts process-oriented people _ folks who
like the process of knitting, not just the end product,'' says
Katzenstein. ``The take-charge professional women of today want
something they can't buy. They're also interested in cooking and
gardening. I hate the word `cocooning,' but that's what it's all
about. Yet, like anything else, there are cycles and trends, and
knitting is now trendy.''
</P>
<P>
   And also practical. ``We live in New England; it gets cold here;
people wear sweaters and scarves,'' says Katzenstein.
</P>
<P>
   As well as meditative.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Hinard, a seasoned knitter and psychotherapist, led
two knitting groups in Boston during fall 1998 called ``Knitting as
a Spiritual Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my friends who are in their early 40s were getting a
little disillusioned with trying to find a practice that would
bring them peace of mind and centeredness,'' says Hinard, an avid
knitter who picks up her knitting at red lights and during workouts
on a treadmill. ``That made me think about how I've always found
stillness and calm while knitting. Knitting's so rhythmic and
methodical. In meditation you concentrate on either your breath or
a mantra. In knitting the focus is on your hands and the creation
of stitches. The concentration brings a sense of relaxation, ease,
and balance.''
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, accomplishment and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jaeger, 41, vice president of the Greater Boston Knit and
Crochet Guild, says he learned to knit as a child, from his
grandmother, and remembers many hours happily knitting while
watching ``Wild Kingdom.'' As an adult, he took classes, joined the
guild, and now knits sweaters for himself and his six children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to worry about sizing,'' he says with a laugh,
since whatever comes off his needles will fit one of his offspring.
``But I do feel pressure. I have to knit better than the women (in
the guild) to prove myself.''

IT'S NOT ALL DOWNHILL FOR US SKI TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes the darkness is so dark, the bleakness so bleak, that
a couple of lights shine all the brighter. This is the case with
the US Alpine ski team, as two US skiers created a shining finale
to this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Picabo/Tommy/Kyle/A.J. era, closed out by Picabo
Street's super-G Olympic gold at Nagano, the US team has generally
reverted to its usual World Cup performance, in which a top 20
result is a reason to rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   But heading toward the end of another rather dismal season in
which everyone remained in the shadow of the Austrian juggernaut,
Daron Rahlves and Kristina Koznick made blockbuster finishes, each
winning twice, back-to-back. Rahlves won a rare pair of downhill
victories March 10-11, and Koznick took two World Cup slaloms in
the last two weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In Bormio, Italy, last Sunday at the World Cup finals, Koznick,
a 24-year-old from Burnsville, Minn., burned the tricky bottom of
the second run to nail her second win in two consecutive World
Cups, marking the fourth World Cup slalom win of her career.
</P>
<P>
   Her winning margin Sunday was .13 of a second. An elated Koznick
told Gary Black, publisher of Ski Racing News, that she had been
slow on top and knew the steep, rutted bottom of the course was her
last chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just pathetic at the top,'' she said. ``I knew I had to
turn it up on the bottom section'' to beat Sweden's Anja Paerson,
who was leading after the first run.
</P>
<P>
   According to Marjan Cernigoj, head coach of the US Alpine team,
Koznick nailed the turns on the bottom with the nearly perfect form
that had given her a No. 2 world ranking.
</P>
<P>
   A bright spot looking ahead to Salt Lake City in two years?
</P>
<P>
   Too far to look, said Cernigoj. ``She's just getting started. I
can hardly wait till next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Koznick told Black she had some problems in the beginning of the
season that delayed her ascent on the slalom points board. ``I
changed equipment, and we all turned to shorter skis,'' she said.
``Now I'm in great shape and everything is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Before she picked up the pace, Koznick's best finish was
December 1998, when she won at Semmering, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struggling so much earlier this year, it's great to end
like this,'' she said. ``It gives me a big boost. It's better that
I struggled this year rather than next year, when there are medals
to fight for.''
</P>
<P>
   Koznick sounded more European than American when she said of
next year: ``I want the slalom title. I know I can win if I'm
consistent _ consistently in the top three, not top 15.''
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, Rahlves recaptured some of the downhill glory
that came to this country 16 years ago, when Billy ``Red Sleds''
Johnson pointed his Atomics down the Wengen course, nearly crashed
in winning, and then went on to win three more straight downhills,
one of them in the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   From Johnson and A.J. Kitt to Tommy Moe and Kyle Rasmussen, the
US men downhillers have been just about the only bright spot since
the Phil Mahre era faded.
</P>
<P>
   But just when Moe, Kitt, and Rasmussen were suddenly gone, along
came ``Beach Boy'' Rahlves, a 27-year-old from Truckee, Calif., who
hung 10 and shot the curl to win a pair on the Lillehammer downhill
course.
</P>
<P>
   At 180 pounds, Rahlves is lighter than most downhillers, who
range in the 200-pound class. But with a tailwind and some
excellent gliding skis, Rahlves beat the best, including Austrian
tough guys Hermann Maier and Herman Trinkl.
</P>
<P>
   Rahlves's first win came two weeks ago Friday night, when he
stunned the Kvitfjell crowd after having scored personal bests of
10th and 11th earlier in the season. The first win was unexpected
and sweet. The second, that Saturday, was amazing, even to Rahlves,
who then placed fifth in the super-G the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've won the first race, you don't want to lose,'' said
Rahlves, who called his season finale ``the best week of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these US bright spots, the Austrian and its head honcho,
Maier, made the real headlines of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Maier won four titles _ the downhill, super-G, giant slalom, and
overall _ to tie the all-time greats: Jean Claude Killy (France)
and Pirmin Zurbriggen (Switzerland).

A HIP TURN FOR GOLFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, it wasn't so hard to put together a
varsity golf team in high school 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the coach would do,'' said Brad Faxon, ``was go through
the hallways on the day of a match. If you had an Izod shirt on and
your collar was up, you were on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Faxon, who was one of the few who wanted to be on the
team, some discretion was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the day of a match, you would sneak your clubs into
school,'' he said. ``You never, ever wanted anyone to know you
played on the golf team.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls would laugh, and true jocks _ the ones who collected
letters, scholarships, and cheerleaders _ would make your life
miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were a geek,'' said Billy Andrade. ``Everyone busted you
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that they went around with pocket protectors, but golf just
wasn't a cool thing for kids to do. Well, perhaps in some parts of
the country it was, and perhaps for those sons of club
professionals such as Davis Love and Curtis Strange, but generally
golf was considered the sport your father would play with friends
during weekends at the club. A stuffy game with snobby rules and
loud clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, people would say, `You play golf? That's not even a
sport,'' said PGA Tour veteran Brandel Chamblee.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the most part, you played baseball, football,
basketball, or hockey. If you pursued golf, you did so in your
spare time, perhaps on weekends with your father or grandfather,
but rarely as a solitary pursuit. At least until life got in the
way and the choice was made for you.
</P>
<P>
   For Andrade, the baseball fields got bigger but he didn't, and
those throws from shortstop to first base took a couple of bounces.
</P>
<P>
   For Chamblee, there was the chance to challenge himself without
depending on teammates.
</P>
<P>
   For Mark Calcavecchia, it was a move with his family from
Nebraska, where he was quite large in a small setting, to Florida,
where he watched 13- and 14-year-olds jam basketballs over him.
</P>
<P>
   For Faxon, it was the realization that he was pretty good at
hitting that stationary, white, dimpled ball.
</P>
<P>
   Different reasons for abandoning other sports and concentrating
on golf, though none of them had the slightest to do with being
cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' said Andrade. ``You were still a geek.''
</P>
<P>
   As he said this, Andrade was on the putting green at the Bay
Hill Club &AMP; Lodge in Orlando, Fla., dressed impeccably from the
Footjoys on his feet to the Bobby Jones shirt on his back. He was
in the midst of a PGA Tour event that would eventually earn him
$27,043, and there were times when he would not go 10 feet without
signing a half-dozen autographs.
</P>
<P>
   And if they could see him now _ you know, the ones who so many
years ago called him a geek _ what would they say? The question
made Andrade's friend Faxon laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is, when I go back home now,'' said Faxon, ``kids
who used to play football are telling their friends they used to
play on the golf team.''
</P>
<P>
   How cool is that?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His ability to swing a golf club with unheard-of ferocity and
send a golf ball unheard-of distances quite possibly will make him
the sport's finest player ever. Yet the true measure of Tiger
Woods's greatness may be this simple reality: He has made golf
cool.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, Arnold Palmer breathed life into the game 40 years ago
and made it fun to watch. But while Palmer put golf on TV virtually
by himself, Woods is the one who has gotten people to tune in like
never before.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jack Nicklaus set a standard of excellence that may
never be equaled. But while Nicklaus stockpiled 18 professional
major championships, Woods is the one who has steered pro golf in
directions never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's driving the Tour,'' said Love. ``No doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving it like a Porsche on an open road. To the top of the
leaderboard in TV ratings, consistently past the NBA, where it has
never been. To record-breaking attendance numbers week in and week
out. To the cover of national magazines. To weekly purses that are
in the millions. To city neighborhoods. To a generation of kids
with cell phones, credit cards, and Nintendo games stuck to their
hands.
</P>
<P>
   And no one has noticed the phenomenon more than his colleagues
on the PGA Tour, many of whom, despite getting fewer chances to
win, are benefitting handsomely from Woods's overwhelming presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is the in thing to do,'' said Chamblee, 37. ``I think
Tiger has a lot to do with it. People see him on TV every single,
solitary weekend. You can't watch Tiger and think he's uncool. He
looks pretty cool. He's a big, strong guy. He hits it great. Looks
pretty cool doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Chamblee got turned off by golf's difficulty, but he
returned to the game as a teen-ager and never left its embrace. He
caddied for Ed Sneed in the Colonial Invitational years ago and
remembers one thing about the galleries. While they weren't very
big, said Chamblee, ``They were very polite, very mature.'' But
very ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the 18th green at Sawgrass after Tuesday's practice
round for The Players Championship, Chamblee glanced around at the
hundreds of kids waiting for autographs. Most of them held
programs, flags, photos, or posters they had purchased. Then he
looked at the thousands of spectators who had bought tickets to
walk in the sunshine and watch golf shots that did not count. Many
of them wore designer golf shirts and pleated pants, two-tone golf
shoes, and golf hats from their favorite clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, thought Chamblee, and far different from when he broke
in on Tour a dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd is now younger and they don't necessarily play
golf,'' said Chamblee. ``But they're just coming out to see Tiger
or David Duval. The whole image of Duval even, with the sunglasses.
The look is a young, hip look.''
</P>
<P>
   That's great for him, Chamblee knows, because of the chain
reaction. More fans mean bigger crowds, bigger TV audiences, more
sponsors paying more money. All of which leads to better purses.
It's just that Chamblee and friends have to get used to a different
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the people who are out here wouldn't ordinarily watch
golf, so the crowd is more vocal and apt to yell,'' said Chamblee.
``They'll scream and holler in your backswing. But it's here to
stay, so you better get used to it. There's going to be more
distractions on the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon said it's naive to think that Woods didn't punch the
button that started this wild ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of him, kids made their parents take them out to
tournaments,'' said Faxon. ``It's Tiger, and it's been great for
the game, because when they come, they've seen what a great venue
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is where golf wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a parent, you wouldn't mind your kid spending a
whole day at a golf course,'' said Chamblee. ``You're not going to
get in trouble. You have to go out there and practice and work all
day and be good at this game. If I had a kid, I'd want him to play
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Junior golf is exploding in this country, and
while the PGA Tour, US Golf Association, and PGA of America all
concede that more progress is needed to make the game available to
youngsters, high school and college coaches have more talent at
their disposal than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Drennan, the men's golf coach at the University of Rhode
Island, said a trend has jumped out at him in recent years: Good
athletes are leaving other sports to concentrate on golf at a
younger age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that kids would jump into golf between seasons
of other sports, but no more,'' said Drennan. ``Now they are
locking into golf, polishing their games at a young age, and taking
care of themselves. There is a great pool of talent out there for
scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not have to wander the dormitories of URI in search of
kids with Izod shirts and turned-up collars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We present the success of Matt Griesser as Exhibit A of golf's
new state of ``cool.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're drawing a blank, we'll give you a hint: ``Sign Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, him. Didn't know his name? Neither did the young boy on that
golf course in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he recognized me from the commercials,'' said Griesser,
who was playing golf with European sales representatives as part of
a promotional tour for Footjoy when he was spotted.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a 12-year-old boy in Ireland recognized him from a
series of 30-second commercials for golf shoes and golf gloves
``blew my mind,'' said Griesser. ``I had an extra glove and gave it
to him. Then he asked me sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   How cool is golf? Consider that an obscure actor who plays an
annoying character in TV commercials gets asked for an autograph in
Ireland. Consider that this same actor recently had his own
promotional tour in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty amazing,'' said Griesser, who considers the commercials
a career break of mammoth proportions.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Sign Boy,' '' said Griesser, ``connects with fans because
people really see themselves in him.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they could get as close to the players as ``Sign
Boy'' gets to Duval, Love, Justin Leonard, Jesper Parnevik, Tim
Herron, and Phil Mickelson, they, too, would try to interact with
them. In fact, Griesser said Leonard told him that his portrayal of
``Sign Boy'' was strikingly close to many volunteers he had met.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise to Chamblee that fans are flocking to the game.
Pro golfers dress well, sign lots of autographs, play a game
millions of people can identify with, and follow a code of rules
and etiquette that is admirable.
</P>
<P>
   This popularity was what the Footjoy ads were designed to take
advantage of, specifically with the younger crowd, said Peter
Winch, management supervisor for Arnold Communications in Boston,
creator of the Footjoy commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to show that Titleist/Footjoy was hip, fun again,
that it was not your father's shoe,'' said Winch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It presented (Footjoy) with a big opportunity with the younger
generation, showing that the brand was cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Other giants of the corporate world have realized the star power
golfers have with the younger generation. Microsoft, for example,
recently recruited Sergio Garcia to help sell its new home video
golf game.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these companies know the results of a survey you may
have missed. When a group of New York youngsters, aged 7-13, was
asked what their favorite sport was, golf finished No. 1. Ahead of
football, basketball, and baseball. Don't be stunned, because Woods
is arguably the most recognized athlete in the world, supplanting
Michael Jordan for that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan? To a new generation of kids, they aren't sure what he
used to do, but they know he plays golf. Lots of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's cool.

EXPERIENCING WEALTH SECONDHAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My heart goes out to all those multimillionaires afflicted with
Sudden Wealth Syndrome. There is nothing quite so poignant as the
pain of the rich. I feel I share that pain, in a way, as a victim
of secondhand Sudden Wealth Syndrome. It works kind of like
secondhand smoke. You get sick from hearing so much about other
people's money.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden Wealth Syndrome has been much in the news lately. It's an
affliction identified by an enterprising pair of California mental
health professionals who have set up something called the Money,
Meaning and Choices Institute in a San Francisco suburb. The
institute assists the newly rich grapple with the psychological
torment of having so much money.
</P>
<P>
   The people who seek their help aren't fly-by-night ``Who Wants
to Be Millionaire?'' rich. These are people with serious money,
some of the new multimillionaires who, if I can believe what I read
(not always a wise idea), are multiplying faster than Easter
bunnies.
</P>
<P>
   According to a story in the Los Angeles Times, victims of Sudden
Wealth Syndrome worry about having so much money and at the same
time worry about losing it. They find themselves questioning their
values, their purpose in life. They have everything they always
wanted _ the big house, the fancy cars, the exotic trips. Yet
money, according to the people at the Money, Meaning and Choices
Institute, has also brought these people ``a sense of isolation,
uncertainty and imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   One patient complained of a ``growing gap with his old friends
that made it difficult to talk about the most mundane things in
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he can't talk to his old friends the way he used to.
He's rich. Money changes friendships, relationships. Money changes
everything.
</P>
<P>
   According to the LA Times story, the founders of the Money,
Meaning and Choices Institute maintain that Sudden Wealth Syndrome
isn't about money at all, but about change. Still, it's the
peculiar change that money brings, which means that at root, it
really is all about money.
</P>
<P>
   Our national love affair with money may be a fatal attraction.
Sometimes, I catch myself hoping for an economic recession, nothing
really devastating, just serious enough to put an end to the plague
of Sudden Wealth Syndrome and with it secondhand Sudden Wealth
Syndrome, the feeling that you can't bear to hear or read one more
story about somebody with gobs of money.
</P>
<P>
   Money, money, money. That's all people talk about. Stock options
and IPO's. Executive bonuses. Market fluctuations. Investment
opportunities. You mention you saw a movie and nobody asks if you
liked it. They want to talk about the financing, and how much it
grossed last weekend. You can't pick up a newspaper or a magazine
without seeing the face of some newly hatched millionaire grinning
at you. Everybody is full of tales of instant riches and
conspicuous consumption.
</P>
<P>
   How are those of us who'll never make even our first million
supposed to feel about all these people awash in money? Should we
envy them? Resent them? Be grateful? Learn from them? Worship them?
Pity those who suffer from Sudden Wealth Syndrome? Take perverse
pleasure in their unhappiness? Or should we just be appalled by the
excess? Maybe somebody will set up an institute to help people with
secondhand Sudden Wealth Syndrome. I hope they'll accept credit
cards.

IN PRAISE OF GREAT AND GRAND WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   March is Women's History Month, that time of year when we have
our attention called to yet another set of women whose
contributions to civilization have been dismissed by the powers
that be. This throng of hidden heroines made me think of women
whose contribution to my own life I've personally overlooked,
carelessly thinking their lives had been undistinguished.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, I had the most unusual grandmothers and
great-grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   My father's mother was born in Russia, and after some
particularly nasty pogroms, she and my grandfather made the
decision to come to the United States. They traveled for weeks to
the nearest port, but when they went to board the ship, my
grandmother Hessie found her way barred because she was visibly
pregnant with my father.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get on this ship in that condition,'' the guard
informed her, but when my grandfather turned around, planning to
return home with her, Hessie is reported to have said, ``You're not
pregnant. Go!'' She planned to follow when my father was born.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather, it turns out, had a terrible time. He ended up
in Worcester, &UR;  &LR; Mass., alone and unemployed, and so he wrote Hessie
that he would be returning to Russia and his lucrative hat-making
business. She replied with a warning: If he came back, he would
find the key to his house with a neighbor because she and the
children were on their way to America.
</P>
<P>
   Hessie made that decision because soon after my father was born,
a band of marauding Cossacks rode into the village. My grandmother
stuffed her sleeping infant into a cold oven and then hid with her
three older children in the woods behind her house. She had no
intention of remaining in such a dangerous place for Jews and so
she finally boarded that boat, with a 6-week-old baby and the other
children in tow. She found work in Worcester as a lady barber. As a
child, I lived below her in a four-family house she finally managed
to purchase with her earnings.
</P>
<P>
   She never said a word about the difficulties of immigrating to a
new country. I heard this story from my dad.
</P>
<P>
   My mother's mother was a young child when she and her parents
and an aunt and uncle set off from Russia, determined to leave for
the same reasons. An epidemic cut a wide swath through the party in
Constantinople, killing Sarah's father, her aunt, and her uncle.
Though Sarah became ill, my great-grandmother Anna hid her from
officials who were collecting the bodies of the afflicted. She also
refused an offer to leave Sarah with a kind Turkish family eager to
adopt an adorable 2-year-old. Instead, the two slowly made their
way to America.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hard life. When my great-grandmother went off to work,
the neighbor watching my grandmother locked her in a closet. When
Anna remarried a man with four children, and then rapidly gave
birth to five sons, Sarah was expected to run the household and
care for the children as if she were an adult. When she met my
grandfather, she sprinted for the door. My grandfather owned an
Army &AMP; Navy store that thrived after the Depression; he and Sarah
managed to send their fourth child and only son to college. As a
preteen, I lived with my grandparents in the triple-decker they'd
managed to buy for themselves in Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother never breathed a word about her past. I heard
this story from my mom.
</P>
<P>
   From the security of my position, it's hard to imagine the
insecurity of theirs. My foremothers arrived at Ellis Island only
two generations ago, not knowing the language, uncertain if they
could find housing, work, or a sense of belonging. Still, there was
no going back and so they marched boldly into an unknown future,
thereby ensuring mine.
</P>
<P>
   I was watching TV a number of years ago, observing Russian women
lining up for hours to buy bread. Something stirred in me and I
found myself picking up the phone and calling my dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen,'' I said, ``I never thought to thank your mother or
you for coming to this country and offering me a chance at the
American dream. If the women in our family hadn't been so daring,
I'd be one of those ladies in line, hoping to secure some food for
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   My father laughed. ``Are you out of your mind?'' he asked. ``You
wouldn't be in line anywhere. You'd be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, grand women. For everything.

GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it didn't generate any Page 1 headlines, a conference
last weekend at Wheelock College could turn out to be a banner
event for parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   For years, it's been clear that the people who make toys and the
people who study children's development aren't on the same page.
``Playing for Keeps: A Conference on the Future of Play'' hopes to
be the beginning of the end of the disconnect between the two
groups, bringing manufacturers and educators together for the first
time to explore the role that play and toys have in our children's
lives.
</P>
<P>
   It's about time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers like conference presenter Diane Levin, a Wheelock
professor and author, have long documented the way single-purpose
toys such as Rock &AMP; Roll Ernie by Fisher Price (push a button and
it sings a song and shakes) rob play of its creative value and
interfere with children's learning. Professors Dorothy and Jerome
Singer of Yale University, who also spoke on Saturday, have spent
years looking at the way violence in children's television and
videos impedes imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $20 billion toy industry hasn't been listening.
</P>
<P>
   Toy manufacturers continue to offer a steady stream of toys that
thwart healthy development. In recent years, one of the most
troubling trends has been the way content intended for adult
audiences is marketed to children, typically through toys spun off
from movies, said presenter Daphne White, founder and executive
director of the Lion &AMP; Lamb Project (www.lionlamb.org), a
grass-roots initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix,'' for instance, is an R-rated movie, but Matrix
action figures are marketed for preschoolers. Duke Nukem 3D, a new
adult video game set in a porn shop, features hard-core violence
and pornography, but the action figures based on it are sold in toy
and comic-book stores and the grip game is marketed for children 10
and up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When play is endangered, kids are at risk,'' says early
childhood educator Edgar Klugman, cofounder of the ``Playing for
Keeps'' conference and a professor at Wheelock.
</P>
<P>
   Cofounder John Lee, CEO of Learning Curve International, an
educational toy manufacturer, hopes the conference will lead the
entertainment and toy industries to develop a code of ethics about
the marketing of violence for children. His company manufactures
toys that promote healthy development, including Thomas the Tank
Engine wooden train set and Felt Kids, a pretend-play system.
Educational companies like his have a 15 percent share of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   That the two sides of the fence were even in attendance was
gratifying to Klugman and Lee. There were about 200 registered
attendees, including the CEO of FAO Schwarz and representatives
from Fisher Price and ToySmart.com. But the biggest players in the
toy market, Hasbro and Mattel, were not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just beginning to get the message,'' says Lee.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying premise of ``Playing for Keeps'' is that it is
through play that children make sense of the world and learn how to
cope with it. Whether their play becomes a healthy foundation for
developent and learning depends on the materials and toys they
play, with as well as the environment they play and grow in, said
keynote speaker James B. Comer, psychiatrist, author and professor
at Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   The more unstructured, open-ended, and imaginative the play, the
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``By being active agents in their world, children learn they can
have a positive effect on it,'' said Levin. If a preschooler
playing in the sandbox, for instance, concludes, ``I can make this
log not fall over, I can solve this problem,'' she's on her way to
becoming a problem-solver. ``She's seeing the world as something
she can navigate, not as something to be defeated by,'' said Levin.
</P>
<P>
   That has far-reaching implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that child is learning to read, she's more likely to
conclude, `I can figure this out, I can accomplish this because I'm
a person who can figure things out,' '' said educational
psychologist Doris Bergen, a professor of child development at
Miami University in Ohio who also spoke at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, creative play fosters a sense of competence that
carries over into academic learning and into an outlook on life
while the lack of it puts children at risk, said Klugman.
Unfortunately, creative play is increasingly under assault.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the conference and in interviews, researchers
explained why:
</P>
<P>
   --TV, video, and computer screens. The time children spend in
front of screens takes away from time spent in creative play and
increases their dependence on the screen for entertainment. The
younger they are when screen exposure begins, the more this is
true. ``Kids can get to the point where they don't know how to
play,'' said Levin. She is author of ``Remote Control Childhood?:
Combating the Hazards of Media Culture'' (NAEYC).
</P>
<P>
   --Too much structure. When children are in control of their own
play, setting its parameters, solving problems, and making the
rules, it translates into self-confidence and a sense of personal
efficacy, said Bergen. The more they are engaged in lessons and
organized sports, and the younger they are when they begin them,
the less control they have, the less beneficial the play. ``It's
good exercise and it may sometimes be fun, but it's not good
play,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   --Single-purpose toys. Open-ended toys, from blocks and
manipulatives to art supplies and pretend props, serve as an
adaptive mechanism, said Bergen: ``They're a way for kids to work
out the worries and concerns of life. When you can't feel in
control in real life and you can be in control in play _ you say
when the dolls go to bed, what they have to eat or wear, or whether
the trucks go up the ramps or speed down them _ the play becomes a
coping mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Toys that come with an agenda don't let that happen. ``Push a
button and music plays, push another one and a different kind of
music plays _ that isn't nearly as good as handing a child a toy
instrument and letting her make her own music,'' said Levin.
Unfortunately, the need for these toys is a vicious cycle: The more
single-purpose toys a child has, the more dependent she is on the
toy's agenda. Because she isn't getting the chance to develop her
imagination or rely on herself to create interesting play, she gets
bored more easily, needs another structured toy, and flexes her
imagination less and less.
</P>
<P>
   --Toys with violent themes. These toys carry a double whammy,
said Levin: Not only does violent content desensitize a child so he
begins to accept it as normal, but the content and nature of the
toy don't allow him to develop a sense of personal competence.
``There's no problem-solving involved; it's the same theme repeated
over and over again,'' she said. The less well developed a child's
sense of personal efficacy, the more susceptible he is to violent
content. The ramifications for this are far-reaching, too, but not
in a positive way: ``Kids are more likely to lash out (in
aggressive and violent ways) when they haven't had the experience
of feeling effective and competent,'' says Levin. The younger they
are when they're exposed to violence in toys and on the screen and
the more frequent the exposure, the more they internalize the
message that violence is the way to feel powerful.
</P>
<P>
   --Technology in toys. Just as this is a subject of debate among
parents, this was an area of tension among the presenters.
``Healthy play gives children the chance to have ownership of
ideas, technology in toys tends to take that away from them,'' said
Bergen. She said research shows that exposure to computer play and
toys with technology affects how a child's brain develops,
typically shortening attention spans and increasing the need for
instant gratification.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchel Resnick, an associate professor in the Media Lab at
MIT, said technology has been unfairly painted as demonizing
creativity. Done right, he said, ``new technology can expand the
range of fantasies kids can try out.'' LEGO's Mind Storm, for
instance, enables a child to build with LEGOs and create a program
on the computer to make the creation respond to light or touch.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of ``Playing for Keeps,'' two subcommittees had been
formed. One, headed by White, was charged with drafting a
preliminary code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   As daunting a task as that might be, anything less could not
only shortchange our children and the future of play but also all
of society. ``If coalitions like this one are not successful,''
said Comer, ``by the year 2050, we will be living in a very
different and difficult society.''

ASSAULT ON A REFORMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bradley Smith, a law professor at Capital University in Ohio,
believes that political candidates should not be forced to engage
in constant money-grubbing. He believes elections should not be
rigged to make incumbents all but invulnerable to challenge. He
believes that most members of Congress do not auction their vote to
the highest bidder. Oh, and he believes the Federal Election
Campaign Act could use an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing especially outre there. Yet because of his views, Smith
has been labeled ``a nihilist'' (By US Senator Dick Durbin), a
``flat-earth society poobah'' (in the Atlanta Constitution), a
throwback ``to the dark days of Watergate'' (by Scott Harshbarger,
the president of Common Cause), and the equivalent of David Duke,
the Unabomber, and Slobodan Milosevic (by the Syracuse
Post-Standard). He has also been likened to pornographer Larry
Flynt (in the St. Petersburg Times), to Dracula (by pundit Mark
Shields), and to a police chief who favors criminals (by Joshua
Rosenkranz, president of the Brennan Center at New York
University).
</P>
<P>
   What has triggered this invective is the nomination of Smith, a
scholar of election law, to serve a six-year term on the Federal
Election Commission. The FEC is made up of six commissioners, three
chosen by the Republicans, three by the Democrats. (All are
formally appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.)
Several of the current commissioners share Smith's belief that
federal election law needs to be changed. Unlike him, they want the
government to regulate campaign practices more strictly. Smith
believes the government should lighten up. For preaching such
heresy, he is being flayed by the forces of ``reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he was even nominated, The New York Times berated the GOP
for ``considering an Ohio law professor'' who criticizes existing
law ``instead of scouring the country for a distinguished
individual with a passion for reform.'' The Washington Post termed
his writings ``quite radical'' and warned that picking him ``would
betray every pious utterance the president has made about campaign
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   What Smith's writings reveal, though, is a man deeply concerned
with making democracy stronger.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, he argues that the contribution limits imposed
after Watergate have made politics worse, not better. By strictly
controlling the amount of money supporters could give to
candidates, Congress thought it would reduce the cost of
campaigning, diminish the power of special interests, and make the
whole system more open and competitive. It failed on all counts.
Campaigns for Congress cost more than ever, influential elites _
media bigshots, unions, pressure groups _ have grown in clout, and
federal incumbents are now virtually challenge-proof.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's critics go ape when he suggests that the $1,000 limit on
campaign donations be scrapped, or dares to observe that money may
not, in fact, be such a perverter of politics. But it shouldn't be
scandalous to notice that a law isn't working, or to ask whether
its assumptions have held up.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1974, candidates could raise most of the funds they
needed from a small cadre of wealthy supporters; that freed them to
talk about real issues with real voters. Since 1974, on the other
hand, candidates have been forced to spend a larger portion of each
waking day chasing $1,000 checks. With inflation _ 1,000 1974
dollars are worth only $290 today _ the problem has grown more
acute.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is hard to run for Congress and impossible to run for
the White House without having either a pre-existing network of
donors or an immense personal fortune. That has tilted the playing
field in favor of insiders and multimillionaires. It helps explain
why this year's presidential nominees will be the sitting vice
president and the son of a former president _ each of whom
benefited from a vast Rolodex of fundraising contacts. It also
explains why the reelection rate in Congress routinely tops 95
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't evident, says Smith, that money corrupts candidates.
Three other factors are much better predictors of how a legislator
will vote: party affiliation, political ideology, and the views of
constituents. ``Where contributions and voting patterns
intersect,'' he has written, ``they do so largely because donors
contribute to those candidates who are believed to favor their
positions, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   What is evident is that campaign finance caps stack the deck in
favor of incumbents. ``Incumbents begin races with high name and
issue recognition, so added spending doesn't help them much,''
Smith writes. ``Challengers, however, need to build that
recognition.'' That takes money _ often a lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, of course, Smith's analysis of federal election law
matters less than his ethics and experience. Everyone who knows him
attests to his integrity, and all agree that his knowledge of
election law is encyclopedic. The job of the Federal Election
Commission is to enforce existing law; Smith says he is willing and
able to do so. That ought to settle the matter _ unless the Senate
is prepared to say that the only persons qualified to enforce a law
are those who think it is perfect. Smith would make an ideal
regulator: He understands the risks of too much government. If only
more bureaucrats had his insight.

A FREE DAILY STARTS A FUROR IN PHILADELPHIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ ``If we owned a cow it would give condensed
milk.'' That slogan for Philadelphia's two-month-old Metro paper
reinforces the most crucial point about the free daily distributed
in partnership with the area's public transportation agency, SEPTA.
Size isn't everything.
</P>
<P>
   Metro is shrunken news in a shrunken format, a 24-page tabloid
filled with three-paragraph Associated Press stories designed to be
read in a short commute. It has an editorial staff of 18 and
harbors few journalistic pretensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a summary of the news,'' says Floyd Weintraub, a vice
president for Metro International in North America. ``Nothing more
or nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Metro/SEPTA deal has spawned a big controversy. Monday,
about 60,000 of the roughly 160,000 daily Metros began being
distributed on 1,100 city buses, a location off limits for the sale
of The Philadelphia Inquirer or its tabloid sister, The
Philadelphia Daily News. That kind of access issue has generated
cries of First Amendment foul, and a lawsuit, from the companies
that own the Inquirer and Daily News, The New York Times and Boston
Globe, and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Metro's Swedish-based parent company _ having launched
papers in European cities from Prague to Helsinki _ is looking to
bring the free commuter daily to other US cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have identified 60 cities worldwide,'' says Weintraub, of
possible future markets. At a time when many papers are losing
time-pressed readers, could they lose ad dollars to a Metro
offering a Cliff Notes version of the news?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fear level here,'' says Philadelphia magazine editor
Stephen Fried. ``Whether it's really something to be afraid of in
the marketplace . . . it's hard to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking aspect of Metro is its two-page color TV
listings. The rest of the color-splashed paper is a tightly
formatted mini-review of the day's major events _ from the NASDAQ
rebound to the furor over former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet
_ that is heavily reliant on wire services. There are local
columns, sports news, entertainment tidbits, weather maps, movie
listings, and Roger Ebert film reviews. One page, marked as an
advertisement, is produced by SEPTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've designed a product for people to read in 20-25
minutes,'' says publisher Jack Roberts, an ex-Daily News hand.
``I'm not going to say I'm anything other than what I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question of what exactly Metro is _ victim or villain _
is the subject of tangled litigation. In late January, Philadelphia
Newspapers Inc., Gannett Satellite Information Network Inc. and The
New York Times Co. challenged Metro in federal court. Having lost
several legal skirmishes, the plaintiffs are now bogged down in the
appeal process.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, according to plaintiffs' attorney Michael Schwartz,
is the arrangement that allows Metro favored access to areas like
the SEPTA buses. In a recent case, a Chilean court ruled against a
partnership between Metro and the Santiago mass transit system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern here is that SEPTA, a government agency, has sold
to Metro preferential distribution rights on its property,
government property,'' says Schwartz. ``What we were really dealing
with . . . (are) First Amendment circulation rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Metro attorney Edward Rogers has accused the plaintiffs of
``gang(ing) up on a fledgling, free transit newspaper in order to
preserve their choke hold on print advertising in the Philadelphia
region,'' in a display of ``economic bullying.''
</P>
<P>
   For distributing Metro, SEPTA receives $30,000 a month in ad
revenue, another $15,000 a month for cleanup costs, and uses the
daily page to communicate with readers. For the nation's fifth
largest public transportation system with almost 1 million daily
riders, Metro is ``all part of upscaling the travel experience,''
says general manager John Leary Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The nagging question is whether Metro is under SEPTA's editorial
sway. ``If we were to have a major controversy, I would fully
expect it to be a front page story and I would have zero problem
with this,'' says SEPTA director of public affairs Richard Maloney.
Roberts also stresses Metro's independence, but acknowledges that
it would ``treat those stories just like we treat the other
stories,'' meaning with a few short paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to assess Metro's impact in the market is difficult at
this point. Roberts cites a readership survey indicating that its
audience skews young (more than 50 percent are under 45) and female
(57 percent of readers are women). According to the survey, a third
of Metro's readers also say they don't read other papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably have a readership that's closer to a broadcast
(audience) than a newspaper readership,'' says Roberts. ``I'm
bringing people into the market who don't read newspapers.'' Given
the declining circulations at the Inquirer and Daily News, that's a
touchy subject. ``I can't be responsible for their circulation
losses,'' adds Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens in Philly, it may not be Metro's only US
testing ground for a newspaper/public transit alliance that could
roil the local media scene. According to MBTA spokesman Joe
Pesaturo, Metro officials approached them about moving into Boston
in 1998, but ``we declined to participate in this endeavor.'' A
spokeswoman for the Chicago system says conversations with Metro
``never got beyond the exploratory stages.'' Cheryl Johnson, of the
Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, says discussions
there are in ``very preliminary stages. We've certainly been very
willing to listen to what they had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   More bullish is Dennis Mochon, marketing manager for the San
Francisco area's BART system. ``We've been talking with them for
over a year. There is interest,'' he says. ``The revenue could be
as much as $1 million a year.''

   I just paid $35 to hang onto my Internet domain name for one
more year. Antony Van Couvering says I paid too much. ``Let's put
it this way,'' says Van Couvering. ``If e-mail is free, domain
names should be free.''
</P>
<P>
   And for an hour on the evening of March 23, they will be.
</P>
<P>
   Van Couvering says his New York company, registerfree.com, will
give away an Internet domain name to anyone who stops by and
requests one between 9 and 10 p.m. Eastern time. It's a flagrant
publicity stunt, aimed at snatching a bit of attention from Network
Solutions Inc., the giant of the business of selling domain names.
</P>
<P>
   When the federal government first began commercializing the
Internet, NSI won the monopoly right to sell all domain names
ending in .com, .net, and .org. Now that monopoly is at an end, and
dozens of small firms are offering cut-rate domain name sales.
Despite its name, registerfree.com generally charges for its
services. Still, Van Couvering's price of $19.95 per year beats
NSI's $35. And Van Couvering says he'd welcome a future in which
domain names don't cost anything.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, domain names aren't absolutely essential to life on
the Internet. For proof, start your Web browser and type in the
following: 204.71.200.74.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to our old friend, Yahoo. That clump of numbers you just
typed is Yahoo's ``IP address,'' the true address of the site as
far as Internet computers are concerned. All that www.yahoo.com
stuff you usually type was created to make life easier for humans,
who have the devil of a time remembering strings of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When you type in words, they're translated into numbers by a
network of server computers called Domain Name Servers, or the DNS
system. Your Yahoo request goes to a DNS computer which checks a
list and finds that www.yahoo.com equals 204.71.200.74. The
connection is made, and off you go.
</P>
<P>
   When you buy your own Internet domain, you're buying your own IP
address, and a handy word address that's linked to it. The company
that sells you the domain, known as a ``registrar,'' inserts the
data into the DNS system. Now, anyone who wants to find you on the
Internet won't have to memorize your IP address, just your domain
name. Instead of typing 207.155.252.14 to see my Web site, just
type www.monitortan.com.
</P>
<P>
   The system works quite well. But why should it cost $35? We're
talking about a trivial exercise in database management; basically
adding one domain name and its underlying IP address to the
millions of others stored in the DNS system.
</P>
<P>
   NSI also charges $35 a year to renew the domain name. Partly,
this is to make sure that unused domain names eventually get
deleted and resold to others. But that means you're paying $35 a
year to make sure that NSI leaves your domain name alone. It feels
a little like a protection racket.
</P>
<P>
   But NSI has parlayed it into a position of extraordinary
strength. The company has just agreed to be acquired by data
security firm VeriSign Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., for $21
billion.
</P>
<P>
   This sum astonished even jaded veterans of the Internet economy.
But it makes a certain degree of sense, now that Gartner Group
analyst John Pescatore has explained it to me:
</P>
<P>
   VeriSign is creating a one-stop service for companies moving
onto the Internet. Firms that come to NSI for a domain name will be
offered a range of other services from VeriSign that they will need
to open their virtual shops, such as encryption to protect
customers' credit card numbers. The NSI acquisition is just an
aggressive way of guiding all these would-be e-commerce titans to
VeriSign's front door.
</P>
<P>
   If VeriSign plays its cards right, Pescatore says, those $35 a
year domain name fees will soon become irrelevant, anyway. He
expects the prices to fall and the fees to be waived altogether for
e-commerce firms willing to buy lots of other services.
</P>
<P>
   Van Couvering also hopes to make big money by selling follow-on
services to e-commerce, with domain names tossed in for free. But
lacking the name recognition of NSI, he's hoping to attract
customers by giving away free domains to all comers.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like another desperate Internet something-for-nothing
business plan. My favorite kind. Besides www.monitortan.com is too
long. Time for something short, snappy, and absolutely free.

LOTUS COMMITTED TO SMARTSUITE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When computer network administrator Bill Bonner types a memo, he
uses the omnipresent word processor Microsoft Word, which is part
of Microsoft's equally commonplace Office software suite.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonner's just about the only Microsoft Office user you'll
find at his company, Hitchiner Manufacturing Co. of Milford, N.H.
The other 300 white-collar workers at this metal casting shop have
standardized on SmartSuite, from Lotus Development Corp. And Bonner
has no intention of making them switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under a lot of pressure from some of our customers to
convert,'' says Bonner. But SmartSuite works fine, and even though
he personally prefers Office, Bonner can't justify the cost of
switching over the entire company.
</P>
<P>
   While 120 million users worldwide run Microsoft Office, Lotus,
based in Cambridge, Mass., has found a profitable niche serving 20
million users who want an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clearly a number two player in this market, says Lynne
Capozzi, Lotus' vice president of SmartSuite development, ``but
it's still a strong position for us.''
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite is overshadowed by Lotus' flagship Notes and Domino
groupware products, and Lotus officials admit they've cut back on
SmartSuite research and development. Still, Lotus officials say
they plan to maintain their presence in a market Lotus once
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a longstanding commitment to SmartSuite,'' says
Capozzi. ``We have no plans to walk away from the product.''
</P>
<P>
   SmartSuite's low profile is a sharp contrast from Lotus' early
history. One SmartSuite component, the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet, was
one of the world's most popular software programs during the 1980s.
Indeed, 1-2-3 is generally credited with sparking the success of
the original IBM Personal Computer, the parent of most of today's
PCs. The software was a ``killer app'' that made personal computers
so useful that companies bought millions of PCs just so they could
use 1-2-3 to do their bookkeeping and financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But 1-2-3 had been designed for Microsoft's earlier operating
system, MS-DOS. When Microsoft introduced Windows 3.0 in 1990,
Lotus was slow to produce a Windows version of 1-2-3. Microsoft
filled the gap with Excel, a graphically oriented spreadsheet
originally designed for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. Soon Excel
was gobbling up market share from 1-2-3. Matters got worse when
Microsoft began selling complete suites of office software, with
word processor, spreadsheet, database and presentation graphics
program all in one.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lotus had SmartSuite ready to go in 1993, the race
was essentially over. Both Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect, once the
world's most popular word processing program, had been consigned to
also-ran status.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Le Tocq, research director for the Gartner Group in San
Jose, Calif., says only about 8 or 9 percent of new office suite
sales are going to Lotus. But that doesn't count upgrades to its 20
million existing users. ``You sell updates to your installed base,
and that doesn't count as share,'' says Le Tocq. ``Lotus still has
quite a good update base.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the company continues to produce enhanced versions of
SmartSuite, such as the Millennium Edition 9.5 released last year.
Recent versions of SmartSuite have included IBM's ViaVoice speech
recognition technology, enabling people to write documents by
speaking to their computers. Capozzi admits that few customers use
this feature, but the numbers are growing.
</P>
<P>
   However, Lotus isn't looking to make too many more dramatic
improvements to future versions of SmartSuite, and the company has
reduced its R&AMP;D expenditures on the product. The logic is simple:
Office software suites are ``mature'' products. A word processor
processes words, a spreadsheet crunches numbers. Capozzi says
there's little point in adding more bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   But that means Lotus' SmartSuite unit can keep selling
essentially the same product with minor improvements. This keeps
costs down. Capozzi won't break out the exact profit numbers.
Still, she insists that SmartSuite makes money, even though it
usually sells for a discounted upgrade price of $149, compared to
Microsoft Office's upgrade price of $249.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus moves a lot of copies of SmartSuite by including them with
new computers. Parent company IBM will sell 10 million PCs this
year with SmartSuite pre-installed, and Lotus has similar deals
with some other firms, including the Japanese PC maker Toshiba.
</P>
<P>
   Capozzi won't say how much the company collects on these
bundling deals, but admits that the chief goal here is market
share, not profit. ``It's definitely a volume play,'' Capozzi says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Lotus also benefits from the popularity of its Notes
and Domino software for helping people work in teams. SmartSuite is
designed to meld seamlessly into a Notes environment, so companies
that standardize on Notes and Domino are often quite willing to go
with SmartSuite as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just found ourselves in Notes so much that it made sense to
go with SmartSuite,'' says Eric Stratmann, director of information
resources for Albemarle Corp., a chemical manufacturer in Baton
Rouge, La. Stratmann checked out Microsoft Office, but preferred
the way SmartSuite and Notes worked together. ``We felt it was more
tightly integrated with Notes, and it had the same look and feel as
Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Microsoft has proven time and again, customers need a mighty
good reason to buy someone else's software once you've got them
hooked. Too bad Lotus lost most of its customers before it grasped
this principle. Still, there are 20 million left, and Lotus plans
to keep them.

VOLVO XC _ SMOOTH AND SURE OF FOOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was expecting the brawny, solid ``clunk'' that the doors made
when I slammed them. Classic, rugged Volvo. The smooth ride on the
highway and the stiff, clinging carve through corners was no
surprise, either.
</P>
<P>
   What I was not expecting was its performance in snow and, more
particularly, on ice. It was as sure-footed there as any SUV, and
more stable, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   And I am thankful that, before I took it on the road for a week,
I got to test the Volvo on the slippery course used by the New
England Motor Press Association in its annual winter vehicle
competition. It was here that the 2000 Volvo XC AWD chewed through
snow and would not let ice keep it from its assigned line.
</P>
<P>
   Set it in half a foot of crusty snow and try to make it spin. No
go. Drive it straight ahead at 40 on a sheet of glare ice, stomp
the ABS, and take your hands off the wheel. It came to a steady,
straight stop. Put it into a tight turn on the ice and try to make
it fishtail. The Volvo would allow no such thing. Start from a stop
on an icy upgrade. You could feel the ABS and traction control
working in concert to reduce spin, wheel-by-wheel, so that it
seemed it was a four-legged creature walking its way up a slippery
hill.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're longing for one of those $50,000-plus SUVs, this
may be the best all-season car a cold-weather driver could own.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has long been associated with sturdiness, safety, a
certain tweedy cachet, and station wagons. Until recently, a third
of all Volvos sold were wagons. Then, in 1997 the XC _ for Cross
Country _ was introduced as a 1998 model. Now, the XC accounts for
25 percent of Volvo's wagon sales, and has helped boost wagon sales
to 50 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the minivan and the SUV, the Volvo XC has
found a home.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, of course, makes other wagons: front-wheel drive, the V70
all-wheel drive. The XC is the countrified version of the latter,
and Volvo has aimed it correctly at city and suburban drivers with
an eye on an active, outdoor lifestyle. But it is also a great car
for folks who live in the country, folks for whom any trip out for
anything is at least a 30-minute round trip and for whom the
weather is not always an ally.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, I'm grateful I got to drive this in the winter test.
Otherwise, I might not have realized what was in my hands. Outside,
even though it's a bit more of a wedge than the boxes of the past,
it still looks simple, pure Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, add the $2,200 package that includes leather seats, a
sunroof, simulated wood appointments, and you could be in any
luxury sedan. The leather buckets up front are fairly firm, though
I'd like them a bit more supportive at the thigh _ like the bench
seat in the rear, for instance. It's a 60/40split that opens to a
generous cargo area as big as most found in SUVs. The cargo area
also features a pop-up, rear-facing seat for children (as many as
three tots).
</P>
<P>
   The Cross Country has 6.5 inches of ground clearance, an inch
more than the V70 AWD. It's also two inches taller. This doesn't
mean you'll want to go off-road bushwhacking with it, but it does
mean it will move a bit better through deep snow and that you get
some of the up-high, airy feeling an SUV can give you.
</P>
<P>
   The list of standard features is lengthy and includes heated
outside mirrors, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control,
pollen and dust filters, sunroof, remote keyless entry and
security, eight-way power adjustable driver's seat, and a premium
sound system.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features, too, are impressive and they include a
high-strength steel passenger safety cage; transverse engine that
distributes crash energy away from front-seat occupants; air bags
for front passengers and side curtains for front and middle seats;
and seatbacks that change shape to cushion front-seat passengers
and reduce back, head, and whiplash injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cross Country is powered by a 2.4-liter, in-line
five-cylinder engine. It's a 20-valve DOHC power plant with light
pressure turbo. Power gets transferred through an
electronically-controlled, four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   You do not get the impressive snap that some turbocharged
engines give you, but on the highway it gives a smooth, steady
surge that is impressive after how sedate it seems moving slowly
over country roads. It delivered just over 20 miles per gallon in a
wide mix of driving.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, quite firm and with no sense of lateral sway even at
speed on sharp corners, is delivered with a front suspension that
mixes hydraulic struts, coil springs, and a stabilizer bar. In the
rear is Volvo's multilink, semi-independent suspension, coupled
with coil springs and gas shocks.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Cross Country stand out, however, is its traction
control/drive train system. Most of the time, 95 percent of the
torque is being delivered to the front wheels. If there's minor
slippage up there, a traction-control system adjusts
wheel-to-wheel. When the going gets slippery or rough or reckless,
however, a monitoring system picks up differences in rotation
between front and rear wheels and, using a viscous coupler that
acts much like a clutch, distributes more torque to the rear. At
times, 95 percent of the torque can be delivered there, depending
on where the wheels are spinning and where the best bite can be
had. It is a seamless transfer that the car does for you.
</P>
<P>
   It was this system, which also employs the ABS brakes to cut
wheel spin to one wheel while delivering torque to others, that
gave the Cross Country the sensation of a stalking, four-footed
beast that I felt while running it uphill on a sheet of glare ic.
And it is this system that puts it among the best winter cars you
could buy.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The center console/armrest is too low. I found myself hunching
down to put my right elbow onto it.
</P>
<P>
   --The driver's side seat controls, down on the outer edge of the
seat, are in too cramped a space and you end up fumbling around for
them. Volvo ought to go the way of some other manufacturers and put
them on the door.
</P>
<P>
   --The cupholder, shaky and shallow, could not hold a bottle of
water securely.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The two-step bins in the front doors. You could keep change,
pens, other small items on rubber-bottomed top step; maps, larger
items on lower step.
</P>
<P>
   --The cargo-netted bins that ran along the side of the cargo box
at the rear of the car.

ANTILOCK BRAKES WORK _ WHEN USED PROPERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (l and f coding)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can be both fascinating and perplexing to watch new
automotive technology make its way to the market. It seems
inevitable that promise will, for at least a time, get snagged on
the horns of ignorance and distrust.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen it with the automatic transmission, brighter
headlights, seat belts (Remember the bizarre argument that seat
belts were not safe because they might trap you in your car after a
wreck?) and air bags.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ABS _ anti-lock brake systems. I've had experienced
drivers tell me they don't trust them, don't understand them, don't
want them. I've talked to young drivers who learned nothing in
driver's education about how to use them safely.
</P>
<P>
   What is called for is an unlearning of old ways (pump the
brakes) by the experienced driving generation and a concentrated,
mandatory education in their use in driver training programs for
the young gneration.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing for a combination of these is the ABS Education
Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of companies that manufacture
anti-lock brake systems.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes are not a new invention. They were used in
Germany in the 1930s to stop trains; used in World War II to stop
airplanes on carrier decks; Plymouth offered a model with ABS in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Their first major inroads in the United States came in the
mid-1980s in high-end autos, according to Rosemarie Kitchin of the
education alliance. Four years ago, ABS systems crept into less
expensive models, and last year they were installed in about
two-thirds of all cars built.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Kitchner said, too often the salespeople at dealerships do
not instruct car buyers in their use, and an education alliance
survey found that two-thirds of drivers between 18-24 had not been
taught how to use ABS in driver education.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this is unfortunate because ABS is a great safety
feature that, once understood, is comfortable to live with and easy
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Some basics:
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that in an emergency, you had to pump your brakes
while trying to slow down. It was up to the driver to sense wheel
lock-up and back off the brakes before the car turned into a
hurtling sled that could not be steered. Even a single wheel
locking up meant that the braking capabilities of all four wheels
had to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ABS is designed to do that ``sensing'' for you and to help you
not only stop your vehicle in an emergency situation, but to let
you steer even with the brakes jammed on.
</P>
<P>
   When you stomp the brakes in a four-wheel ABS vehicle, a central
control unit monitors electronic pulses from sensors at each wheel.
If a sensor tells the control unit that a wheel is about to lock
up, a computer signals a valve to limit hydraulic pressure to the
brake at that wheel. This allows the wheel to rotate, even if for a
brief moment, and thus avoids lock-up. Meanwhile, the other brakes
can remain fully engaged, though it is likely that they, too, will
be gripped and ungripped at various times as each approachs
lock-up.
</P>
<P>
   So young or old or somewhere in between, if you don't know about
ABS and how to use the system, get yourself educated.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't own an ABS car now, you likely will in the future,
and you should, because they are a good thing. If you rent a car,
Kitchin said, chances are 9 in 10 you'll get one with ABS.
</P>
<P>
   Know your own car, of course, but always check for ABS in cars
you rent or borrow. If you own one car with ABS and one without,
think about braking before you drive either.
</P>
<P>
   Learn that the pulsing of the pedal and the chattering sounds
you hear when ABS brakes are applied with force is normal. It's the
grip and ungrip function at work.
</P>
<P>
   If you hear that chatter and feel that pulse each time you slow
when driving, you are probably driving too fast in bad conditions.
</P>
<P>
   If you are taking driver training, insist that your teacher
instruct you in using ABS. If you already have a license, take a
course, or take Kitchner's advice: Go to church. On a Tuesday. When
the parking lot is deserted. Set up some cardboard boxes and use
your brakes as you try to avoid hitting them.
</P>
<P>
   You can also try them out on a deserted road that has snow,
gravel or ice on it or is slippery with rain. Learn to put the
brakes on and keep them on. Put the brakes on before you attempt to
steer around any obstacles (particularly important in SUVs). Learn
to steer with the brakes on.
</P>
<P>
   A warning: If you have a car with only rear-wheel ABS, the rules
are different. These are found mostly in light trucks, vans, and
SUVs. In these vehicles, you can still lock up the front wheels and
lose the ability to steer. When you feel lock-up, let off the
brakes and let the front wheels start rolling again so you can
steer.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ABS and have mastered its uses, don't get stupid and
think the system makes you invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ABS will not eliminate the possibility of skidding. ABS will not
stop your vehicle in a shorter distance, and, in fact, in some
instances will increase that distance slightly (though the tradeoff
for control is well worth this slight boost in stopping distance).
</P>
<P>
   For new drivers, ABS education should be mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   For older drivers, reluctant to embrace new technology, Kitchin
has other advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you say is that if they know how to use it and can avoid
a squirrel, a dog, a ball, somebody chasing a ball _ if they can
avoid one obstacle, they'll avoid a crash, an injury, they might
save a life,'' she said.

&HT;     AN UNCOMMON MELON WITH DELICATE FLAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RUTH FANTASIA  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you saw them in the store, you probably didn't know what
they were. Pepino melons are one of those odd things placed on the
exotic fruit table.
</P>
<P>
   Like more common melons, pepinos can be eaten raw but they are
certainly now as big as a crenshaw or a cantaloupe. They are also
called melon pears because of their demure size _ each one is only
about the size of a hand _ and slightly elongated shape.
</P>
<P>
   Though they haven't caught on in the United States, Elizabeth
Schneider writes in ``Uncommon Fruits and Vegetables,'' that in
Japan, pepinos are offered as a gift, as a dessert, and even as a
showpiece. Not unreasonable since pepinos have a lightly
greenish-yellow skin with violet or mauve dappled stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Pepino melons have a delicate flavor and are as refreshing as
summer cucumbers, writes Schneider.
</P>
<P>
   Availability: Erratically available somewhere between late
winter and early summer.
</P>
<P>
   Selection and storage: Sniff the fruit deeply, writes Schneider.
It should smell lightly sweet, almost like honeysuckle. When
pressed, the flesh should give like a partly ripe plum but not be
soft. Avoid pepinos with dents or bruises. The undercolor of the
skin should be golden to pinky-apricot, Schneider writes, not
greenish.
</P>
<P>
   If the color is not quite right, keep the pepinos at room
temperature until they become more golden. Try not to keep it
longer, as the delicate flavor will fade quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Preparation: Pepino melons simply need to be sliced and peeled.
Even the soft, pulpy seeds are edible.
</P>
<P>
   Uses: Serve pepino raw in fruit salads, wrapped in prosciutto as
you would honeydew.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritional information: Pepino is low in calories and high in
vitamin C.

   Continuing his week-long spiritual pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
Pope John Paul II visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in
Jerusalem on Thursday, where he declared that the Roman Catholic
was ``deeply saddened'' by the Christian persecution of Jews
through the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   But some Jews were disappointed that the pope stopped short of
apologizing for the failure of Pope Pius XII and the Vatican to
speak out when Nazi Germany was rounding up millions of Jews across
Europe and dispatching them to death camps for extermination.
</P>
<P>
   ``As bishop of Rome and successor of the Apostle Peter,'' the
pope said Thursday, ``I assure the Jewish people that the Catholic
, motivated by the Gospel law of truth and love, and by no
political considerations, is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of
persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews
by Christians at any time and in any place.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope continued, ``The rejects racism in any form as a denial
of the image of the Creator inherent in every human being.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a ceremony in the memorial's darkened Hall of
Remembrances, where his aides laid a wreath in memory of the 6
million Jews killed in the Holocaust. The pope recalled that the
victims had included some Jewish neighbors and friends from his
childhood in Nazi-occupied Poland, when he was known as Karol
Wojtyla.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's emotionally charged remarks were broadcast live on
Israeli television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to Vad Yashem to pay homage to the millions of
Jewish people who, stripped of everything, especially of human
dignity, were murdered in the Holocaust,'' the pope said. ``More
than half a century has passed, but the memories remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to remember. But we wish to remember for a purpose,
namely to ensure that never again will evil prevail, as it did for
the millions of innocent victims of Nazism.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward the pope met a half dozen Holocaust survivors and
Polish Jews from his hometown, Wadowice. When one woman began
weeping, the pope consoled her with a gentle touch on her arm.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose grandparents died in the Nazi
death camp at Treblinka, was among the Israeli officials at the
ceremony. ``You have done more than anyone else to bring about the
historic change in attitude of the toward the Jewish people,''
Barak told the pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``You raised the flag of fraternity to full mast, setting into
liturgy a request for forgiveness, for wrongs committed by members
of your faith against others, especially against the Jewish
people,'' the prime minister said. ``We appreciate this noble act
most profoundly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Israelis said they wished the pope had gone further and
explained the Vatican's silence during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But other Israelis observed that the pope had already gone
further than his predecessors in working for greater understanding
between Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's very gesture of coming here marks a turning point
for Jews and Christians,'' Eli Zborowski, one of the Holocaust
survivors who met the pope, said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope also issued a blessing of Israel when he met President
Ezer Weizman. When the last pope to visit the Holy Land, Pope Paul
VI, did so in 1964, he refrained from even mentioning Israel by
name.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The pope used his visit to the Holocaust memorial to press for
solidarity between Jews and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this place of solemn remembrance, I fervently pray that our
sorrow for the tragedy which the Jewish people suffered in the 20th
century will lead to a new relationship between Christians and
Jews,'' the pope said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us build a new future in which there will be no more
anti-Jewish feeling among Christians or anti-Christian feeling
among Jews,'' he said, ``but rather the mutual respect required of
those who adore the one Creator and Lord, and look to Abraham as
our common father in faith.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the need for amicable coexistence between Jews and
Christians, the pope also met with Israel's two chief rabbis,
Eliyahu Bakshi Doron and Israel Meir Lau. They presented him with a
Bible inscribed with a passage from the book of Micah: ``For
everyone who will walk, everyone in the name of his God, and we
will walk in the name of the Lord, our God, forever and ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has already broken new ground for the Vatican during
his week-long pilgrimage, visiting a Palestinian refugee camp near
Bethlehem, where he deplored the ``torment'' of the Palestinians,
and celebrating Mass in Bethlehem's Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul was also the first pope to visit the Nazi death camp
of Auschwitz and to attend worship services at a synagogue in Rome.

&HT;     IF IT'S NOT WORTH WATCHING, IT MUST BE ON NBC 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By TIM GOODMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why NBC doesn't throw in the towel is beyond understanding. The
network has only a few quality shows left and its new shows this
season outside of ``West Wing'' have been embarrassingly bad.
</P>
<P>
   What it really ought to do is join ABC in giving up entirely.
Just use Regis Philbin to mop up and turn out the lights. Forget
sitcoms and dramas. Go with a game show.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NBC doesn't have Regis, it has Maury Povich, so it
ought to schedule ``Twenty One'' every night, even though it's
horrible. Why? Because nothing could be as bad as the network's two
latest shows, ``Daddio'' and ``Battery Park'' (both Thursday).
Unless you count the two shows they replaced, ``Jesse'' and ``Stark
Raving Mad,'' the heretofore double nadirs of big-league network
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Thursday was ``must-see'' TV? Now it's
unwatchable. Now we're begging for Maury Povich and that simpleton
game show of his, even though he's so easy to loathe. Just try to
survive two minutes of ``Daddio.'' Go ahead. You'll be begging for
Maury's sound-proof booth where the contestants can't hear his
inanities.
</P>
<P>
   If only it were that easy on ``Daddio.'' This is a family sitcom
and you ought to know from experience that NBC doesn't do well with
families (or sitcoms, of late). This hugely embarrassing, laughless
black hole is centered on stay-at-home dad Chris (Michael Chiklis
of ``The Commish'') and his lawyer wife Linda (Anita Barone). They
have four kids to juggle. Reminder: Cloying TV kids are best served
as singles or, in dire moments, in pairs. Four make you think about
murder. Or Maury.
</P>
<P>
   The premise, and we use that term loosely once again, is about
the adventures of Chiklis as a stay-at-home father. Boy, there's a
cutting-edge idea. That's never been done before. That's a rarity
in the real world. What next, a sitcom about these weird, wacky
things called computers?
</P>
<P>
   So what we get are endless jokes about manhood, spilled food,
disciplining the kids, plus a mean-spirited neighbor thrown in for
what appears to be comic effect but in reality is a diversion from
the lack of laughs in the main plot. Formulaic doesn't begin to
describe how utterly lame this show is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddio'' will lose about 8 million ``Friends'' viewers and
won't lead people to ``Frasier,'' either.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Battery Park,'' which attempts some kind of
broad, stylistic approach to cop humor but feels forced and
strained and witless throughout. The show centers on a group of
detectives a la ``Barney Miller'' but fails to ignite the sense of
character that show did so wonderfully. This show is from Gary
David Goldberg (``Spin City''), who loves standard sitcom
convention more than almost anyone. But this time he doesn't have
Michael J. Fox _ or good writers _ to lift the material from the
grasp of the mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Perkins is the cold-hearted captain who aspires to be
mayor. She's thoroughly unlikable and can't wring a laugh from the
turgid one-two jokes that Goldberg employs throughout. The only
shining light here is Justin Louis as Lt. Ben Hardin. He can make
the flattest of all jokes stand up and almost sing because his
delivery is so good. With a little help, he could stand out. The
problems, however, go way deeper than one guy waiting desperately
for a knock-out punch line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battery Park'' is just dumb. The characters are broadly drawn
and uninteresting. There are two gonzo detectives. A dumb one. A
dumber one. And a woman who, when not showing her bare midriff, is
put in super-tight sweaters that scream, ``I'm packing heat.'' You
get the feeling that a lot of sitcom hack tendencies are being
tossed around and mixed together here, hoping that out of
familiarity laughs will spring.
</P>
<P>
   They don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddio'' and ``Battery Park'' are excellent examples of why
the sitcom genre is dying. They break no new ground. They rely on
laugh tracks _ loud ones _ to slap a giggle out of viewers who
otherwise would be unaware that something funny was just said. They
put cardboard cut-out characters on the screen so that we will
easily identify with them (wacky neighbor, dumb cop, cute kid,
etc.) and take the easy, tried-and-true route whenever possible.
</P>
<P>
   A minimum of creative effort is being put forth in these shows.
NBC ought to know _ from ``Jesse'' and ``Stark Raving Mad'' and a
lot of other examples _ that the public is too smart for this.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   8 Oscar nominations: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), actress
(Annette Bening), director, original screenplay, cinematography,
film editing, original score. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays
a man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing,
daringly hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's
a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed
Up. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Being John Malkovich'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack
</P>
<P>
   and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: director, supporting actress (Catherine
Keener), original screenplay. It's a loopy original. John Cusack
plays a quirky file clerk who discovers a door that leads into the
noggin of actor John Malkovich. Toying with big concepts _ the
nature of identity, the lust for celebrity, sexual desire, the
illusion of free will, it's playfully profound one moment, gonzo
the next. (SM)1 hour, 52 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond the Mat'' R (profanity and violent content)
</P>
<P>
   A wrestling documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining, revealing, sickening and, at times, enthralling.
Barry W. Blaustein's documentary grabs professional wrestling by
the throat and rarely lets go. His camera tracks former and current
wrestling stars, peeks beyond the walls of the World Wrestling
Federation, follows beefy wrestler wannabes and takes a deep look
at the upstart organization Extreme Championship Wrestling. (Bob
Longino)1 hour, 42 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Jack'' Unrated (designed for mature audiences.)
</P>
<P>
   An anime feature
</P>
<P>
   directed by Osamu Dezaki.
</P>
<P>
   A sci-fi anime that's equal parts action scenes and gory
surgeries. The title character investigates the crash-and-burn
symptoms of super athletes, who broke world records two years
earlier at the 1996 Olympics. It's all very hardboiled, except for
when the movie focuses on Black Jack's sidekick, an unbelievably
annoying little girl named Pinoko. (SM)1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Boiler Room'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Giovanni Ribisi,
</P>
<P>
   Vin Diesel and Ron Rifkin.
</P>
<P>
   A high-powered descendant of ``Wall Street'' and ``Glengarry
Glen Ross,'' this study of muscle-mouthed stockbrokers aiming to
make their first million before getting their first wrinkle pays
onscreen tribute to those two movies. It's a bracing reminder that
greed is still good _ so long as you don't get caught when you
pretzel the rules. (SM) 1 hour, 59 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys Don't Cry'' R (sex, profanity, nudity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hilary Swank
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscar nominations: actress (Hilary Swank), supporting actress
(Chloe Sevigny). This intense true story of Teena Brandon, a
21-year-old woman who believed she was a man. After cutting her
hair and reversing her name, she hung out with some hard-drinking
rednecks in rural Nebraska, which didn't work out. The movie is a
bit low-budget, but it's still a remarkable film. (ERG)1 hour, 54
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: picture, director, adapted screenplay,
supporting actor (Michael Caine), art direction, original score,
film editing. John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half,
Dr. Larch (Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in
his Maine orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's
protege, Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the
world. (ERG) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Drowning Mona'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Danny DeVito,
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler, Neve Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   As we get to know Mona (Bette Midler) through flashbacks, we
quickly understand why nobody is disturbed by her demise. It turns
out that the Yugo in which she took a header into the Hudson River
had its brakes sabotaged. Police Chief Wyatt Rash (Danny DeVito)
begins investigating her murder and finds that everyone in town had
something against Mona. (Hap Ernstein, Palm Beach (Fla.) Post)1
hour, 30 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Emperor and the Assassin'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gong Li
</P>
<P>
   and Li Xuejian.
</P>
<P>
   The birth of a nation, Chinese-style. Set in 221 B.C., Chen
Kaige's film tells the true story of how the would-be emperor of
all China sets about unifying the then-existing six kingdoms into
one. Though long and occasionally confusing, the movie has the
panoramic impact of a Kurosawa epic, the bloody violence of a Greek
tragedy and the human intrigue of a Shakespeare drama. (ERG) 2
hours, 40 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth film about an
everyday mom with business spunk who, without a law degree but with
a lot of pluck, helps crash a big-time company responsible for
devastating health problems in a small, dirt-poor town. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.'' (Bob Longino)2 hours, 11 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' R (bloody violence and raw language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Devon Sawa,
</P>
<P>
   Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' aims for young audiences with an
``X-Files: The Wonder Years'' science/suspense plot about a kid who
escaped death from a plane crash and learns more than mortals
should about death. Our hero (Devon Sawa) and six others find
they're still targeted for death. The Grim Reaper, feeling cheated,
has plans for them. (Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder Newspapers)1 hour,
33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghost Dog:
</P>
<P>
   The Way of the Samurai'' R (strong violence and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Forest Whitaker
</P>
<P>
   and John Tormey.
</P>
<P>
   Director Jim Jarmusch takes the overused gangster genre and
makes it compellingly unfamiliar. Ghost Dog (Forest Whitaker), who
makes a fascinating lone wolf, is a gun-for-hire who follows the
philosophy of the samurai, especially their utter devotion to their
masters. His is the man who saved him as a teenager from thugs:
Louie (John Tormey), a tubby, graying soldier working for a gang
boss. (SM)1 hour, 54 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' R (profanity, drug content,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and suicide)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Winona Ryder
</P>
<P>
   and Angelina Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: supporting actress (Angelina Jolie). Two
fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna Kaysen's
memoir about the two years in the '60s she spent at a mental
hospital, the movie goes for a rip-roaring tone reminiscent of
``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.'' Winona Ryder steadies the
movie, but Jolie provides the fireworks as a charismatic sociopath.
(ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks
</P>
<P>
   and Michael Clarke Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   4 Oscar nominations: picture, supporting actor (Michael Clarke
Duncan), adapted screenplay, sound. A manipulative but meticulously
crafted, absorbing and beautifully acted adaptation of Stephen
King's prison novel. Tom Hanks plays a 1930s death row guard whose
latest prisoner, a mysterious hulk played by Duncan, has mystical
powers of healing. (SM) 3 hours, 2 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanging Up'' PG (profanity and mild sexual themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Diane Keaton,
</P>
<P>
   Meg Ryan and Lisa Kudrow.
</P>
<P>
   Breezily written by the Ephron sisters and briskly directed by
Diane Keaton, the movie's ads want you to believe it's a
side-splitting sibling comedy about three sisters (Keaton, Meg
Ryan, Lisa Kudrow) trying to connect. However, it's really an aging
parent-confused adult child story in which Ryan tries to be all
things to her dying dad (Walter Matthau). (ERG)1 hour, 32 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on Earth'' PG-13 (sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris Klein,
</P>
<P>
   Leelee Sobieski and Josh Hartnett.
</P>
<P>
   A limp and clueless variation on ``Love Story.'' Leelee
Sobieski, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett star as kids in a love
triangle. Trapped in this hermetically sealed setting, with a
script that would run 10 minutes if the cliches were yanked out of
it, they can't win. (SM) 1 hour, 37 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hurricane'' R (profanity and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Denzel Washington
</P>
<P>
   1 Oscar nomination: actor (Denzel Washington). Washington
delivers his best performance in years as pugilist Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, the middleweight contender wrongly imprisoned
for nearly 20 years in a triple murder. Though ably directed, the
film contains some fabrications to tell this otherwise compelling
true story. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Al Pacino
</P>
<P>
   and Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   7 Oscar nominations: Picture, actor (Russell Crowe), director,
adapted screenplay, cinematography, film editing, sound. Crowe, the
hot-tempered cop in ``L.A. Confidential,'' gives an astonishing
performance. He plays Jeffrey Wigand, a real-life cigarette
industry consultant who blew the lid off the tobacco industry. Al
Pacino plays the ``60 Minutes'' producer dogging the story. (ERG) 1
hour, 37 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia'' R (profanity, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julianne Moore
</P>
<P>
   and Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   3 Oscar nominations: supporting actor (Tom Cruise), original
screenplay, song. A mesmerizing tapestry about broken families,
love and forgiveness. Unfolding at fever pitch and studded with
small miracles of acting, writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson's
movie is exhilarating and exhausting, the sort of thing you live
through as much as watch. The payoff is well worth it. (SM) 2
hours, 59 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' PG ( sci-fi violence and mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gary Sinise,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's Red Planet opus is too much like other films
(``Contact,'' ``The Abyss'' and, especially, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey''), but it's still a decent popcorn movie packed with
thrills and sharp special effects. Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Connie
Nielsen and Jerry O'Connell are part of an astronaut team trying to
rescue others lost on Mars. (SM) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' memoir about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is a remembrance of
how things can pass from our lives but never really leave us.
Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is
a shy only child whose life changes when his mom (Diane Lane) gives
him a Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon)
objection. (ERG) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Next Best Thing'' PG-13 (profanity, partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Madonna
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue, the melodramatic situations, the performances all
scream ``Phony!'' Madonna and Rupert Everett play best pals (she's
straight, he's gay), who end up raising a child together. Some bad
movies, of course, are perversely enjoyable. This isn't one of
them. (Robert W. Butler, Kansas City (Mo.) Star) At metro theaters.
1 hour, 40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ninth Gate'' R ( violence and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Johnny Depp
</P>
<P>
   and Lena Olin.
</P>
<P>
   A major disappointment from Roman Polanski, the film stars
Johnny Depp in a tale of old books, the devil and the gateway to
satanic powers. Imagine one of those seasonal Halloween horror
houses, but designed by librarians. And what do you get at the end
of the trek? The spectacle of a bunch of rich twits in black robes,
play-acting a satanic mass. (SM) 2 hours, 13 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel

   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi rip-off of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures.
In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM)1 hour, 47 minutes. C-

   ``Rear Window'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Stewart,

<P>
   Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic is restored and re-released.
Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly star in a New York peep show of
suspected murder. Let's enjoy the movie for what it is: a sexy (if
sometimes sexist) chamber drama that gradually, expertly ups the
suspense to excruciating levels, all without breaking a sweat. (SM)
1 hour, 54 minutes. A-

<P>
   ``Reindeer Games'' R (sex, violence, nudity, and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Affleck,
</P>
<P>
   Charlize Theron and Gary Sinise.
</P>
<P>
   When it's good, it's very good, but when it's bad. ... Ben
Affleck plays an ex-con who poses as his former cell mate in order
to bed babelicious Charlize Theron and gets caught in a nasty mess
with her psycho brother (Gary Sinise), who wants him to help rob a
casino. With John Frankenheimer as the director, the movie is
always watchable, but sometimes it's just plain ludicrous. (ERG)1
hour, 45 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo Must Die'' R (violence, some profanity
</P>
<P>
   and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jet Li and Aaliyah.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the martial arts genre, the violence is strong. This
is Jet Li's first English-language film and it has a great look and
an edgy feel, along with some broad swaths of humor. (Kevin Thomas,
Los Angeles Times)1 hour, 55 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream anymore, but it's a decent wrap-up of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween get-up. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis,

<P>
   and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   6 Oscar nominations: picture, director, supporting actor (Haley
Joel Osment), supporting actress (Toni Collette), original
screenplay, film editing. A surprising, spine-tingling gem.
Eight-year-old Cole (Osment) can see restless phantoms with their
skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film that speculates on
what the relationship between the restless dead and a liaison to
the living world might be. (SM)1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Snow Day'' PG (mild peril and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A lame kids movie about Syracuse, N.Y., schoolkids trying to
extend one out-of-school snow day into two. Chevy Chase plays a TV

   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG)1 hour, 16 minutes. B+

<P>
   ``Waking the Dead'' R (sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup
</P>
<P>
   and Jennifer Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   A haunting romance in which an aspiring politician (Billy
Crudup) in the early '80s thinks his radical beloved (Jennifer
Connelly), killed in a car bombing in the '70s, may be back from
the dead. Crudup is superb and Connelly is effective in a more
limited role. The movie is a little too earnest, a little slow, but
it's more than recommended to those who love fine acting. (ERG)1
hour, 43 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever It Takes'' PG-13(sexual situations and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Shane West
</P>
<P>
   and Jodi Lyn O'Keefe
</P>
<P>
   Very loosely based on ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' this generic
teen-hormone comedy has two seniors who help each other woo the
girl of their dreams and/or lust. The cast is pleasant enough, but
if you saw a single John Hughes movie in the '80s, you've seen this
territory covered with more style and insight. If your kid is
begging to go, do whatever it takes to palm him or her off on a
clueless grandparent. (ERG)1 hour, 32 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Nine Yards'' R (sexuality, nudity, and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Perry
</P>
<P>
   and Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   A comedy with a body count and familiar mafioso premise, but
with enough twists to eventually overcome its familiarity. Bruce
Willis stars as a hit man. As in ``The Sixth Sense,'' he doesn't
seem to mind playing genial straight man to his funnier cast mates:
Matthew Perry, Patricia Arquette and Kevin Pollak. (SM)1 hour, 43
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonder Boys'' R (profanity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Douglas,
</P>
<P>
   Tobey Maguire
</P>
<P>
   and Frances McDormand.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Douglas plays scruffy, scattered English lit professor
Grady Tripp in director Curtis Hanson's (``L.A. Confidential'')
well-written version of Michael Chabon's novel. Part satire and
part coming-of-age tale of a man in his 50s, the film is full of
episodes and digressions that are as interesting as the final
destination. It's also a feast for actors, who make the most of
tiny, telling moments. (SM) 1 hour, 57 minutes. B

 &HT;    Small-town romance oddly outdated
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The earth of ``Here on Earth'' is stuck in a 45-year time warp.
The movie's small Massachusetts town seems to have no fast-food
chains, no cell phones, no computers. The townsfolk drink vanilla
shakes (instead of smoothies) at the local family-owned diner. The
young people fall in love over Robert Frost's poetry (instead of,
say, the lyrics of some alt-rock band).
</P>
<P>
   Trapped in this hermetically sealed setting, with a script that
would run 10 minutes if the cliches were yanked out of it, the
movie's young stars can't win. Chris Klein (``American Pie'') plays
arrogant prep-school senior Kelley, whose clash one evening with
blue-collar local Jasper (Josh Hartnett) results in an accident
that burns down Mable's Table. That's the restaurant owned by the
mother of Samantha (Leelee Sobieski), whose role as Jasper's
kinda-sorta girlfriend becomes even shakier when she starts
swapping moony glances with Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley and Jasper are ordered by the town's judge (a sardonic
black woman who seems to have been flown in from syndicated daytime
television) to spend the summer rebuilding the restaurant. Kelley
even has to rent a room from Jasper's family, though he refuses to
be civil to them.
</P>
<P>
   So it's trouble when Kelley and Samantha bond over Frost's poem
about birch trees. Once hurt by a prep-school boy, Sam's sister
(former Atlantan Elaine Hendrix) warns, ``They are all the same.''
The movie plays like a woodsy, nonmusical version of ``West Side
Story,'' until it tries to be ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski, whose self-amused levelheadedness is appealing, has to
tackle the movie's worst moments. Seeing shirtless, sweaty Kelley
at the construction site, she murmurs, ``I'm hot.'' Then there's
the mimed baseball game she plays with Klein on their first date.
Twice she shares this exchange with her screen dad:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be your father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be your daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in ``Here on Earth'' is very, very nice. That's a big
problem. Drama is based on conflict, on people fighting to get what
they want. Here, the characters try to outdo one another being
sweet and dispensing homey wisdom. Meanwhile, the score by Andrea
Morricone (yes, Ennio's son) drowns us in molasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on Earth'' is a missed opportunity. Sure, it's not one of
the brainless teen comedies now monopolizing the multiplex. But it
could have been so much more, a drama that showed teenagers in a
true light: as complex individuals trying to cope with their
first-time feelings of true love and bitter grief. Unfortunately,
the makers of ``Earth'' (screenwriter Michael Seitzman and
first-time feature director Mark Piznarski) never manage to spark a
single real emotion.

PG-13 for sensuality and thematic elements.1 hour, 37 minutes.

 &HT;    Affair of the heart rings achingly true in `Dead'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps a better title for ``Waking the Dead'' would be ``The
Haunting.'' This earnest and ultimately affecting film, based on a
novel by Scott Spencer, deserves kudos simply for trying to be
about something. It's a romance in which the lovers are less
star-crossed than at political cross purposes. It's also a kind of
ghost story in which a young, up-and-coming politician is haunted
by ... well, that's pretty much the theme of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Bouncing back and forth between the early 1970s and 1982, when
clean-cut Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) is running for senator,
the film focuses on Pierce's passionate affair in the '70s with a
liberal _ some would say radical _ activist named Sarah (Jennifer
Connelly) and his current political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier sections, we see the two as soul mates with
conflicting approaches to society. She's a committed leftist
working through the church for the usual catalog of '70s causes.
He's more middle of the road, believing that you change the system,
not wreck it. When she calls him a cog in a machine, he says that
cogs make machines run better. She replies that they go in circles
until they're worn out and replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Then she's killed in a car bombing (it's the first scene). Or is
she? A decade later, the heartbroken Pierce has tried to get on
with his life, including his long-held dream of running for
political office. But suddenly he's starting to hear Sarah's voice
in the dark, to half-glimpse her across a crowded street. Is he
going nuts, or is she somehow back from the dead?
</P>
<P>
   Director Keith Gordon (``A Midnight Clear'') gets a lot of the
'70s period details exactly right, from Pierce's idiotic,
trend-surfing brother in his fringed vest (by the '80s, of course,
he has an earring) to the fatuous and sometimes venal limousine
liberals through whom Pierce hopes to realize his ambitions. And
Gordon gets us to care about these characters even when they lose
their individuality and verge on symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly he gets us to consider the idea of commitment _ to a
person, to a cause, to a lifelong dream, to the ever-receding past.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup is, in a word, superb. His glad-handing campaigning, with
its forced heartiness, eerily suggests what a run for office by
John F. Kennedy Jr. might have looked like. And a nervous breakdown
in a restaurant in front of his family is a pure tour de force.
This guy can out-act Matt Damon and Ben Affleck combined.
Hopefully, the right movie and role (read, more commercial) will
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly, who here looks like a cross between Ally Sheedy and
Ali MacGraw in ``Love Story,'' has a more limiting role. To her
credit, she never completely alienates us even when she's being her
most hippie-dippy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking the Dead'' has pacing problems. It has slight tonal
problems. But it's a good fit for anyone who loves fine acting;
anyone who has ever believed, as Sarah does, that ``sometimes
meaningless gestures are all you have''; and anyone who knows that
loss can become a kind of shadow-life obsession-oblivion.

 &HT;    `Whatever' doesn't have what it takes
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Whatever It Takes'' is more dispiriting proof that Hollywood
is willing to do whatever it takes to make a buck. Last spring's
mini-trend was the teening of Shakespeare. This year, the classic
of choice _ and the term is used loosely _ is Edmond Rostand's
great 19th-century play ``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet again, the poetic good guy helps the thickheaded jock woo
the girl he should be courting himself. But Hollywood couldn't
possibly handle anything as heavy as an ugly teenager who doesn't
get the girl. So here's the twist. Ryan (Shane West) and Maggie
(Marla Sokoloff) are perfectly attractive longtime buds and
next-door neighbors who've always treated each other like brother
and sister. But Ryan, like every other boy at school, has a crush
on Ashley (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe), senior class hottie. She happens to
have a soulless jerk of a cousin (James Franco), who sees a good
thing (read one-night stand) in Maggie. The two guys agree to help
each other in the wooing department. From there, it's the sort of
spring-break bunk that's been packing 'em in since ``Porky's'' was
a piglet.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is pleasant enough, with O'Keefe having the most fun as
a stereotypical queen-bee high schooler, complete with entourage.
But if you saw a single John Hughes movie from the 1980s, you've
already seen this territory covered with more style and insight. If
you have a preteen just begging you to take him or her to this
movie, do whatever it takes to palm the kid off on a clueless
grandparent.

<P>
   ``Waking the Dead'' is the kind of movie that will one day have
clerks at video stores furrowing their brows. Even now I can hear
the exchange at Blockbuster now: ``Hey Bill, where does this one
go? Drama? Politics? Love story?'' ``Dunno, Ed. Stick it
miscellaneous. Next to 'Titanic.'''
</P>
<P>
   Resistant to categorization as it is, ``Waking'' tries on
several hats and manages to wear most of them skillfully. Taken as
a man's evaluation of his own self-worth, it's insightful and
complex. As a romance, the movie is even more effective despite
some clunky dialogue and a script that doesn't always know what to
do with its characters when they're not in love. At a different
time, ``Waking the Dead'' might have been marketed as a Valentine's
Day date movie. During an election year, it's a ``to thine own self
be true'' warning to Bush and Gore, et al.
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated in the little-seen ``Mother Night,'' director
Keith Gordon can really sink his teeth into a story about a morally
conflicted hero. He's got a lulu of one in Fielding Pierce (played
by Billy Crudup), an idealistic U.S. Coast Guard officer turned
district attorney who has ``future in politics'' all but stamped on
his birth certificate. The year is 1972, the scene Chicago; our man
has a Kennedy profile and the integrity to match.
</P>
<P>
   The potential Achilles heel to a ``Mr. Smith'' outcome for
Fielding is a passionate relationship with Sarah Williams (Jennifer
Connelly), a heavily left-leaning activist whose world views don't
entirely mesh with those of our future Washingtonian. She calls
herself his ``Jiminy Cricket,'' but they stay happily if not always
philosophically together. After Sarah is killed in a politically
motivated car bombing, a devastated Fielding enters the `80s with a
new girlfriend, influential backers and an eye toward winning a
vacant congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: He can't shake Sarah from his thoughts neither her
person nor her principles. As the election draws closer, Fielding
finds himself increasingly racked with self-doubt and heading
toward a breakdown. Plus he's seeing Sarah everywhere he goes at
the foot of his bed, in crowds and airport corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The film jumps back and forth between the two decades,
juxtaposing the election-minded Fielding with the open-minded guy
he used to be. We get extended glimpses of Sarah, including a
couple of scenes demonstrating how uncomfortably she fits in the
life he is creating, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, of course, this premise shouldn't work. Fielding and
Sarah wouldn't last a month together, much less two years. But
somehow, inexplicably, Crudup and Connelly make us believe that
nothing can or should keep these two people apart. Their chemistry
is simply wonderful. Charismatic even when he's conflicted, Crudup
is in practically every scene, delivering the kinds of monologues
that are usually reserved for plays. It's a potentially star-making
performance, if anybody sees this movie. But then again, people
said the same thing about Crudup's turn as Steve Prefontaine in
``Without Limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly's is the trickier part, largely because in Robert
Dillon's script (adapted from the novel by Scott Spencer), Sarah is
underwritten as the teary martyr. Often reduced to the kind of
dialogue that real people don't speak ``You are the incarnation of
your family's ambition. I am the incarnation of your family's
fear'' Connelly still manages to bring the character beautifully to
life. In some of her earlier exchanges with Fielding, her
mannerisms and deliveries even suggest Jodie Foster, ``Waking the
Dead's'' executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its two leads, ``Waking the Dead'' doesn't bother
with developing any of the other characters in any great detail.
Hal Holbrook is on hand as Fielding's political mentor and Molly
Parker is Holbrook's niece, Fielding's second girlfriend. And
here's hoping that Janet McTeer's Oscar nominated work in
``Tumbleweeds'' will keep her from ever again having to play
nothing roles like Fielding's sympathetic older sister.
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on Gordon, the talented actor turned director who
seems more than capable of steering a multifaceted story in several
directions without losing its heart. ``Waking the Dead'' should
give a viewer plenty to think about, no matter where it is shelved.

politically motivated car bombing, a devastated Fielding enters the
`80s with a new girlfriend, influential backers and an eye toward
winning a vacant congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   One problem: He can't shake Sarah from his thoughts _ neither
her person nor her principles. As the election draws closer,
Fielding finds himself increasingly racked with self-doubt and
heading toward a breakdown. Plus he's seeing Sarah everywhere he
goes _ at the foot of his bed, in crowds and airport corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The film jumps back and forth between the two decades,
juxtaposing the election-minded Fielding with the open-minded guy
he used to be. We get extended glimpses of Sarah, including a
couple of scenes demonstrating how uncomfortably she fits in the
life he is creating, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Logically, of course, this premise shouldn't work. Fielding and
Sarah wouldn't last a month together, much less two years. But
somehow, inexplicably, Crudup and Connelly make us believe that
nothing can or should keep these two people apart. Their chemistry
is simply wonderful. Charismatic even when he's conflicted, Crudup
is in practically every scene, delivering the kinds of monologues
that are usually reserved for plays. It's a potentially star-making
performance, if anybody sees this movie. But then again, people
said the same thing about Crudup's turn as Steve Prefontaine in
``Without Limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Connelly's is the trickier part, largely because in Robert
Dillon's script (adapted from the novel by Scott Spencer), Sarah is
underwritten as the teary martyr. Often reduced to the kind of
dialogue that real people don't speak _ ``You are the incarnation
of your family's ambition. I am the incarnation of your family's
fear'' _ Connelly still manages to bring the character beautifully
to life. In some of her earlier exchanges with Fielding, her
mannerisms and deliveries even suggest Jodie Foster, ``Waking the
Dead's'' executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from its two leads, ``Waking the Dead'' doesn't bother
with developing any of the other characters in any great detail.
Hal Holbrook is on hand as Fielding's political mentor and Molly
Parker is Holbrook's niece, Fielding's second girlfriend. And
here's hoping that Janet McTeer's Oscar nominated work in
``Tumbleweeds'' will keep her from ever again having to play
nothing roles like Fielding's sympathetic older sister.
</P>
<P>
   Keep an eye on Gordon, the talented actor turned director who
seems more than capable of steering a multifaceted story in several
directions without losing its heart. ``Waking the Dead'' should
give a viewer plenty to think about, no matter where it is
shelved. &QL; 
_________ &QL;

   CLINTON-INVESTIGATION (Washington) _ The Justice Department has
launched a criminal inquiry into whether thousands of White House

York Senate campaign. Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., heading the House
panel looking into the issue, says she took 26 trips to New York in
seven months last year. That cost taxpayers $182,421, and the

racist but he was one of the greatest pioneers in motion pictures,
and the removal of his name was an extreme example of political
correctness. The directors' action would be like judging the
presidencies of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton only
by their mistakes. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

Our rating: 2{ stars 
By DAVID KRONKE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Daddio,'' a situation comedy about a smart and fun
stay-at-home dad, is mildly progressive-minded in its set-up and
comfortably old-fashioned in all other facets of its execution. One
is easily forgiven for wishing the laugh lines had a little more
sparkle, and it's a less than ideal companion series to the bawdy
``Friends,'' which airs before it, but the premise and the cast are
solid enough to expect future improvement and a decent prime-time
run.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chiklis stars as Chris, a guy who chucks his dead-end
job to stay with his kids when his wife, Linda (Anita Barone),
lands a lucrative post in a law firm. The kids are your usual
precocious brood _ ace jockette Shannon (Cristina Kernan),
conniving Max (Martin Spanjers), adorable Jake (Mitch Holleman) and
a baby. There's also an intelligence-challenged pal (Kevin Crowley)
and a grumpy neighbor (Steve Ryan) who both could easily have just
been drained out of a Cuisinart in the Nick at Nite offices.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising comic possibilities here come from Chris'
induction into the ``mommies club,'' an assortment of neighborhood
women who hang out and share parenting tips. In particular, Amy
Wilson as Barb, a painfully earnest woman determined to be the
perfect mother _ while wringing all the fun and spontaneity out of
her children's existence _ seems a perfect foil for Chiklis, who
does a nice slow burn as she goes into a mini-lecture on the
difference between ``fruit juices'' and ``fruit drinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's episode ends with Chris delivering, in essence, the
series' statement of purpose: There's no shame or emasculation
whatsoever in a man doing this kind of work when he loves his
children. There's more than a little commitment, as well as ample
wit, in the moment, and it ensures that we're willing to watch
executive producers Matt Berry and Ric Swartzlander build on the
modest promise of tonight's pilot. &QL; 
---The show: ``Daddio.'' &QL; 
What: Family sitcom about a stay-at-home father. &QL; 
The stars: Michael Chiklis, Anita Barone, Cristina Kernan, Martin

&HT;     FIREFIGHTER TESTIFIES IN LAWSUIT AGAINST DOOR-OPENER COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PETER HARTLAUB  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A former San Francisco firefighter testified
that she tried in vain to inhale oxygen from outside a burning
garage where she and other firefighters were trapped because of
what her lawyer contends was a malfunctioning door opener.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Stapper, now 39, says she clawed at the garage door in
the early morning of March 9, 1995, before losing consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   She is suing the Genie Corp., a leading manufacturer of garage
door openers, for some $8 million in damages. Stapper contends that
the garage door opener did not work, and that the nylon cord that
can disengage the door from the automatic system had burned.
</P>
<P>
   In the third week of the trial, Stapper was guided to the
witness stand Wednesday, she recalled the house fire that left her
blind, with burns over 40 percent of her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled my mask off because I was suffocating in it, and I
tried to stick my face in the crack in the garage door so I could
get some air,'' Stapper said Wednesday, turning her head in the
direction of the Superior Court jury. ``When I sucked in I ... felt
like I was breathing fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-alarm fire, which started at 1 a.m., took more than
two hours to control in part because of 70 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters reportedly didn't see smoke or flames when they
entered the open garage at the home in the city's Diamond Heights
neighborhood. By the time they retreated, the garage door had
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Louis Mambretti, a 25-year veteran of the department, died
in the fire. Besides Stapper, two other firefighters, Keith Onishi
and John Pieretti, were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Genie declined to comment outside court. The company
has maintained that the garage door opener did not malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all agree that what happened to Melanie Stapper is a tragic
situation,'' Mary Wirth, a lawyer for the company, said at a
pretrial hearing. ``But it didn't happen because of a faulty garage
door opener. She was injured because the firefighters did not watch
her back.''
</P>
<P>
   Stapper wore her dark blue firefighter's dress uniform to court,
and was guided up to the witness stand by her lawyer, Browne
Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Greene began his questioning by asking if Stapper could see
where she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't know if it was a courtroom, I would just see a
bunch of blurs,'' Stapper said.
</P>
<P>
   Stapper turned her head in the direction of the jury as Greene
asked her if she saw any colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just see some white,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, tears flowed as Stapper talked about her slow recovery.
Several jurors looked at the floor and at least one reached for a
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've accepted the fact that my vision is not getting any
better,'' Stapper said before breaking into sobs.
</P>
<P>
   Stapper said she counsels other burn victims, and speaks to
firefighters about the incident, but needs daily medical care. She
said she has flashbacks and nightmares about the fire and recovery
process, which she described as ``pure hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last at least two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, one of the witnesses estimated that Stapper
could be entitled to as much as $6.9 million in economic damages
for wages loss and medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Genie lawyers disputed the figure.
</P>
<P>
   Stapper is also asking for non-economic damages for pain and
suffering.

<P>
   What took them so long to remake last year's instant classic
``She's All That''? Regardless of the reasons for the unacceptable
delay _ and from the evidence onscreen, creative perfectionism was
not one of them _ ``Whatever It Takes'' is finally here. And boy,
those who thought ``She's All That'' could never be equaled were so
wrong. In fact, this thing proves that it can be virtually carbon
copied.
</P>
<P>
   This one's got it all. It's got the sub-Cliff's Notes reworking
of a literary masterwork _ in this case, ``Cyrano de Bergerac'' as
opposed to ``Pygmalion'' _ in a modern-day high school setting.
It's got Jodi Lyn O'Keefe playing the exact same kind of snooty
teen queen. It's got an even cuter actress than O'Keefe as the
unconvincing ugly duckling. It's got a big, climactic prom scene.
And it's got a really sweet guy hero who takes the whole movie to
realize the obvious about which girl is right for him.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, director and former television actor David Raynr
presents it all in the most homogenized, flavorless sitcom style
imaginable. See? Classic all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan (Shane West of TV's ``Once Again'') and Maggie (Marla
Sokoloff of TV's ``The Practice'') are lifelong next-door neighbors
and best friends. They're both at a loss for prom dates because,
apparently, he's obsessed with the school's most popular girl
(O'Keefe's Ashley) and his neighbor's too smart and picky. The
thing is, Ashley's dumb jock cousin Chris (James Franco) wants
Maggie in the worst way, mainly because she's the only girl who's
never given him the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   So Chris and Ryan make a secret pact. They'll trade their inside
knowledge to help one another get that crucial prom date with their
heart's desire. Through such modern miracles as call waiting, Ryan
helps the crass Chris appear sensitive to Maggie's mind. Via tips
on how to act like a jerk, Chris teaches Ryan to convince
status-conscious Ashley that he's more than just an
accordion-playing geek.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly needs mentioning that, through all of this mildly
titillating skulduggery, we never have the slightest doubt that
there's no one like the girl next door.
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say? You want what? Originality? Or at least
something marginally distinctive? That's not what these movies are
about!
</P>
<P>
   But OK, if you must have something different, how about Ryan's
posse of dweeby friends who do mildly risque things? It looks like
their scenes were written and shot after the rest of the movie _
and after ``American Pie'' became a huge hit _ and they play like
afterthoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Still not different enough for you? How about the totally
outrageous moment when the gym floor opens up and all the fancy
dressed dancers fall into the pool underneath? Now, some killjoys
may mention that that scene is lifted from something called ``It's
a Wonderful Life,'' like such an obscure reference matters or
something. Who cares about movies that were made during the time of
``Cyrano'' anyway? &QL; 
________ &QL; 
The film: ``Whatever It Takes'' (PG-13; language, nudity). &QL; 
The stars: Shane West, Marla Sokoloff, Jodi Lyn O'Keefe, James
Franco. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by David Raynr. Written by Mark
Schwahn. Produced by Paul Schiff. Released by Columbia Pictures. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 32 minutes. &QL;

   On Jan. 10, Time Warner shareholders from Ted Turner on down
were high-fiving one another as they watched their stock soar 39
percent, to $90 a share, after America Online said it planned to
acquire the media giant.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't the only investors celebrating. That same day,
frenetic trading drove the stock prices of Time Warner rivals up an
average of 14 percent: Walt Disney (15 percent), News Corporation
(19 percent), Seagram (11 percent), and Viacom (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't come as a big surprise, according to new research
from academics at San Diego State University and Ohio State
University. After looking at takeovers of 141 companies and their
competitors from 1982 to 1991, researchers found that most rival
companies experienced a jump in market value as well.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? There's an increased probability that those
competitors will become targets themselves, and investors know
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very, very smart,'' says co-author Ralph
Walkling, a finance professor at Ohio State's Fisher College of
Business. ``It factors the probability into the stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Those rivals whose price doesn't move _ which is less than half
of them _ may never make it to the merger alter. But those
companies whose shares rise, the study found, have certain
attractive characteristics in common, including lower managerial
ownership and a greater debt capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The company with the biggest gains on the day of the merger
announcement is the one most likely to consummate a merger within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation as the most
likely takeover candidate among Time Warner's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing which company is the next target in a given industry is
appealing. After all, shares of target companies typically increase
more than those of the bidding company.
</P>
<P>
   But Walkling cautions investors who are eager to plow money into
companies like News Corporation. ``Remember _ stocks may have
already adjusted by the time individual investors get into them,''
he says. ``That definitely is a big risk factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the market may be smarter than you are. &QL;

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    California voters recently passed Proposition 22, which says
that only marriages between men and women are officially
recognized, and yet the state legislature already extends some
benefits to domestic partnerships.
 &HT;    In December, the Vermont Supreme Court ruled pretty much the
same thing: Gay couples cannot be deprived of the legal benefits
enjoyed by married heterosexuals. In both cases, the usual brigade
of talking heads bobbed across my television screen screaming that
these cases constituted an assault on marriage.
 &HT;    I'll say. This is what marriage has come to? A bunch of pension
rollover deferments, tax loopholes and health-care portability
abatements?
 &HT;    Now, I'm a straight first-time husband with two legitimate kids,
and according to America's family-values czar, the thrice-married
Rep. Bob Barr of Georgia, my love-laced nest is the source of all
that is good and true in this world (where are my royalties?) and
is now under siege.
 &HT;    I happen to think Barr is right. But it's not gay folks I'm
worried about; it's Adam Smith. Increasingly, marriage is being
recast as just another budget item in everyone's personal finance
portfolio.
 &HT;    The House just passed a bill reducing the ``marriage tax
penalty.'' Prenuptial agreements were once optional instruments for
multimillionaires; now legal Web sites instruct us that ``every
couple should and must have a prenuptial agreement or marriage
contract.''
 &HT;    In our pop culture, the wife or husband as economic object is
now a routine Hollywood plot device. Ever since ``Indecent
Proposal,'' that consumerist reworking of the fabled ``droit du
seigneur,'' and all the way up to the recent ``The Bachelor''
(Chris O'Donnell must marry somebody by a certain date or lose the
big inheritance), the message is clear: Next to money, romance is
second-rate bunk.
 &HT;    Must I mention Rick Rockwell and ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' At one point the show's proposed host was none
other than Marla Maples.
 &HT;    Increasingly, marriage is being converted into a neo-feudal
property arrangement for the Nasdaq gentry. Even dating these days
is understood as little more than the discovery period before the
big merger.
 &HT;    WB's new dating show, ``Change of Heart,'' arranges for a boy or
girl who is going out with someone to date someone else and then
come on the show to discuss the two before deciding between them.
You may recognize this process. It's called comparison shopping.
 &HT;    What is happening to marriage is the culmination of the market's
radical reshaping of the culture at large. The invisible hand is
tearing away the ideals that once held together most of our
institutions. Hospitals used to operate under some unwritten notion
of altruism. Now patients are ``health care consumers'' told to
shop among various doctors or ``gatekeepers'' whose new duties
include monitoring the flow of gross costs.
 &HT;    Schools are also undergoing a similar metaphorical shift with a
customer-clerk relationship replacing the old student-teacher one.
The Dewey principle of public education for all? Let 'em eat
vouchers.
 &HT;    Even churches have hired market consultants, and now the surging
congregations out West gather in huge warehouse temples selling
spirituality the way Home Depot moves precut lumber. It makes sense
that love would go the same way _ just another failed ideology,
like communism, collapsing in the path of the market's
indiscriminate force to lay bare the economic decision at the core.
 &HT;    According to the academics, this is where marriage began. Feudal
dads chose their children's spouses to upwardly mobilize
themselves. Romantic passion is said to be a cultural construction
that dates from the 12th-century poetic tradition of courtly love
and developed into a new ideal of romance in the court of Eleanor
of Aquitaine.
 &HT;    Then, the story goes, the growing humanism of the Renaissance
and the Industrial Age emancipated men and women to become wild
romantic honeys _ like Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald or Nick and Nora
Charles.
 &HT;    I've never bought this stuff. Maybe that's how it developed for
some Burgundian merchant class. But I spent four college years with
my face in a Lewis &AMP; Short dictionary translating Latin. Horace's
Pyrrha, Catullus's Lesbia. Trust me, romantic love predated the
French.
 &HT;    But the public institution of marriage, declared sacred and
presided over by the clergy, did not. Despite what Barr may think,
marriage was largely a private vow made between two people without
witnesses. (For Christianity's first 1,000 years, marriage was even
a suspect state, arguably a mockery of God's love and doctrinally
inferior to celibacy.)
 &HT;    Protestant agitation made marriage into an official public

didn't catch up until the Council of Trent in 1563. The British
Parliament did not make marriage a state-sanctioned event until

version of free love but, in fact, the remnant of the oldest form
of marriage, the romantic vow.
 &HT;    Have you ever fallen in love? And run around cooing to all your
friends like a moon-drunk calf? That fine little moment, I'm
willing to bet, has always been at the beginning of most marriages.
Recasting the institution as some kind of tax-loophole, Defense of
Marriage Act, comparison-shopping, bridal-auction bargain deal is
the real threat _ not homosexuals in love.
 &HT;    But I don't want you to think I don't set limits. I have kids; I
am a father; I draw the line.
 &HT;    Precisely because Barr and I agree that love-in-marriage is the

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Twenty-five years after the fall of Saigon, the Vietnam of the
war years seems a vanished and discredited civilization animated by
obsessions worthy of Melville.
 &HT;    The circumstance that begat the struggle _ the Cold War _ has
vanished. The personalities that drove it _ Ho, Kennedy, Johnson,
Nixon and their advisers _ have vanished, mostly.
 &HT;    All the soldiers are middle-aged or older, and many are dead.
The memoirs have slowed. Of the Americans, only McNamara and
Kissinger continue, self-consciously, to brood out loud.
 &HT;    Yet the ghosts remain at the table, rising whenever Washington
contemplates a military adventure. Nicaragua, Grenada, Panama,
Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo were all seen through the
shadow of Vietnam. For American statecraft, the legacy is as
profound as that of World War II.
 &HT;    In the victorious nation, some of the old landmarks endure, the
hotels and restaurants of Saigon, the tunnels of Cu Chi, the rubber
plantations, the sampans on the Perfumed River in Hue. The rain
forest has reclaimed the battlefields, leaving only relics, the
hulks of tanks and helicopters, rusting weapons, mines and bombs,
ordnance that will remain lethal for a hundred years. Bones still
leech to the surface at Verdun and Stalingrad, and so too, at a
thousand places in Vietnam.
 &HT;    To Vietnamese Communists of the older generation, the struggle
was life itself. It was a kind of soul-struggle and heavenly
mandate at the same time.
 &HT;    When the writer Stanley Karnow asked General Giap how long he
was prepared to go on fighting, the great commander said, 10, 20,
50, 100 years. As long as it took to win, regardless of cost. The
price was high, 2 million lives, but it was paid.
 &HT;    Had it been higher by twice, the Vietnamese would have had to
dig a little deeper. And they would not have hesitated, for what
was at stake was the noble ideal of unification and freedom to
pursue their totalitarian dream. A friend of mine once described
perversity as a situation that enlisted your curiosity while
discouraging your understanding.
 &HT;    There is something fantastic about the state of affairs today.
With the resumption of diplomatic relations, Vietnam has become a
tourist destination for Americans, many of them former soldiers or
civil servants who saw duty in the war. Journalists return by the
hundreds.
 &HT;    It is possible for an intrepid traveler to visit the Ia Drang
Valley or the Bong Son plain, much as old soldiers and their
descendants visit Omaha Beach and Bastogne. And it is possible,
too, to inspect the fortifications at Dien Bien Phu, where the
French came to such grief in 1954.
 &HT;    The countryside is lovely and the beaches superb. Three or four
thousand dollars buys you a golf package. Begin your round at the
links in the Saigon suburbs, then motor by air-conditioned van to
Dalat and Vung Tau, golf all day long and dine nicely in the
evening.
 &HT;    So Vietnam is becoming a normal country, with all the capitalist
apparatus of a normal country, the Internet and cell phones,
entrepreneurs and bankrupts. You could think of it as an Asian
Czechoslovakia, except you won't find Vaclav Havel. Vietnam is sui
generis.
 &HT;    It will proceed in its own way in its own time, when it has
breathing room and the blessing of the free market and its
enforcer, the International Monetary Fund. Doubtless, among the old
soldiers there will be some nostalgia for the time, a generation
and more ago, when Vietnam was not a normal country.
 &HT;    Their savage civil war commanded the attention of the world.
Their heroic efforts brought down a president and excited the
imagination of revolutionaries everywhere: one, two, three, many
Vietnams. A pity Che Guevara did not live to savor the victory. Not
a small thing at all for a tiny nation ever on the margins of
history. Never, never discount the elbow that pride gives to
conduct.
 &HT;    I was a newspaperman, and when I left Vietnam in the spring of
1967, I went to Ireland to write a memoir of my time there, fully
conscious that conditions were unsettled. And, indeed, nine months
later _ after the Tet offensive _ the question Can This War Be Won?
was replaced by How Bad Is It?
 &HT;    I had no intention of writing history, only to convey the
alarming ambiguities of the war and the country, the bizarre
relations among Americans and between Americans and Vietnamese, all
in the context of formlessness and disorder.
 &HT;    From the earliest days, it was obvious that the Vietnam War was
something new in the modern American experience, a war fought along
ideological lines _ the lines drawn by the Cold War _ and not for
any reason of imminent danger to the national security or even in
support of a historic ally.
 &HT;    In the beginning, it wasn't even a war, but something called
``counterinsurgency,'' a think-tank neologism that concealed as
much as it disclosed. In the early days, Vietnam had the aura of a
grand adventure, like Cuba 1898.
 &HT;    Successive American administrations insisted that fundamentally
it wasn't about Vietnam at all. It was about Communist
expansionism. It was about dominoes tumbling to Singapore. It was
about the Soviet Union and what the Red Army would do in Europe if
the American Army failed to hold the line in South Vietnam. Our
allies would have reason to doubt our word and resolve _ not that
they were much interested in an Asian war themselves.
 &HT;    In fact, Vietnam was a country of dark beauty, both the
landscape and the remote villages. In the highlands, the land
seemed to step away in five shades of green and nothing moved on
the horizon. The country seemed to be asleep, as empty as any wadi
in Arabia, yet out of the range of eyesight the land was teeming
with people and wildlife in a primal state.
 &HT;    The villages were constructed of hardwood, wonderfully austere,
lyrical in their vertical shapes, stilted houses placed just so one
to the other. If they had been poems, they would have been haiku,
stirring an emotion that you felt but could not explain. The
rhythms of these villages were slow-moving, patient, somehow
outside time. The war was distant.
 &HT;    I believed that such a people had their own sense of the great
density of things and of how offensive it was to nudge fate or to
try to alter the natural order.
 &HT;    I had no idea what that natural order was, but I believed that
they knew, and that I was not a part of it, and that in these
villages they were the ones who counted. I was an intruder, a
foreigner who arrived unbidden into the neighborhood with a camera,
a notebook, a deadline and oh-so-friendly intentions that concealed
sinister intent.
 &HT;    The villagers were always hospitable while revealing little of
themselves. Sooner or later I would be gone, back to wherever I had
come from, and they would remain.
 &HT;    My days were crowded, fraught, often hilarious, sometimes
dangerous _ and in the after-silence of a military action, with the
body bags gathered around the command post like bundles of laundry,
heartbreaking.
 &HT;    I spent my days making notes and then revising the notes into a
coherent ``piece,'' one that would be read by the U.S. secretary of
defense in his office and the Bethesda milkman on his coffee break.
 &HT;    There were four zones of reality, the first three being the
American version, the Saigon version and the Hanoi version. The
Hanoi version of the progress of the war was taken less seriously
than the others, because in 1966 and 1967 the North's leaders were
out of sight; they did not invite you around for a drink at the end
of the day to discuss the coming offensive.
 &HT;    As for the fourth version, that was the situation as it actually
was _ but no one knew precisely what that was, and this was not
owing to lack of effort or ingenuity or some failure of critical
intelligence. Frivolous and careless are not the words that come to
mind when discussing those who were trying to make sense of the
war.
 &HT;    The fact was this: No one knew the truth of things, whether the
tide was in or out or where on the shore we stood. A mysterious
turbulence was rampant under the skin of the war, an id that was
beyond anyone's control or prediction, or even comprehension.
 &HT;    In 1967, I was half the age I am today, and while the young
writer could not look forward with assurance, the older writer
looks backward with _ astonishment. All I have to go on is my
memoir, and I read it now as I would read an account written by a
much younger brother or a son.
 &HT;    Many of the stories told there I had forgotten, and many I
remember are not there _ not the clandestine late-night visits to
the swimming pool at the Cercle Sportif, not the kindness of the
nurse at the field hospital in Nha Trang and specifically not the
story of the infantryman who wanted to shoot me dead and would have
too, if his company commander had not stepped between us.
 &HT;    The stories included examples of the disgraceful side of
journalism: I was photographing dead Americans following a
firefight on the Bong Son plain. The photograph is on my office
wall today, the only good one I ever made of the war _ a still life
at dusk, black and white, three bodies on wooden pallets, rifles
beside them, palm trees above them, a composition of appalling
silence and melancholy.
 &HT;    I never sent it to be published because I remembered the
murderous look on the grunt's face and the utter weariness of the
company commander as he explained that it had been a very bad
afternoon, and then paused, because of course I knew that. I had
been with them. For a moment the captain was at a loss. My world
was in opposition to his. He said at last, Those casualties were
that man's friends.
 &HT;    Back in America, I had trouble letting go of the war. The war
had been my life, and I had no regrets, but it was time to turn to
something else. These many years later, I wish I had written more
about the Saigon government, that thin coat of paint on the listing
hull.
 &HT;    I wish I had written more about American statecraft, peace
feelers, bombing halts, cloak-and-dagger in Geneva and mysterious
negotiators in Paris. I wish I had met the enemy, face to face over
a drink at the end of the day. More notebooks for the archive, the
facts unchanged.
 &HT;    Of course the war was unwinnable. It was useless to fight the
Vietnamese. They would have fought for a thousand years.
 &HT;    The vast, humid, unquiet land of Vietnam was a leviathan that
swallowed everyone up. These many years later, I believe that for
too many of us Vietnam was like Herman Melville's doomed whaling
ship, adrift ``on a masculine sea,'' our university. It was a
privilege to have been there.

   ``You know,'' says Igor Shadkhan, as we sit in his office and
discuss his longtime friend Vladimir Putin, ``Henry Kissinger came
here to St. Petersburg when Putin was deputy mayor. Putin spoke to
him in German.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, has a few unlikely
friends, and one of them is Igor Shadkhan _ a Jewish documentary
film producer who says he was a quiet anti-Soviet dissident in his
day.
</P>
<P>
   Any self-respecting KGB officer should have had three different
kinds of alarm bells ringing over these attributes, but not, it
seems, the future president. Shadkhan made a film about Putin in
the early '90s, when the latter was first deputy mayor of
Petersburg and became his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Kissinger asks Putin, 'What did you do before this?' And
Putin says, 'I was in the secret service.' And Kissinger says, 'Me,
too!'''
</P>
<P>
   Shadkhan has a lot of good stories about Vladimir Putin
(pronounced POO-teen), all seemingly calculated to reveal traits
that will play well to a Western audience. Another one is about a
trip to Germany, during which Shadkhan confessed to Putin that, as
a Jew, he could never feel comfortable around Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he understood exactly how I felt, but said: 'You
should try to understand that this is a new Germany. They are not
Nazis any longer.' And he persuaded me to think again.''
</P>
<P>
   These stories have at least as much symbolic as real truth. The
first exculpates Putin from his association with the world's great
terror instrument, the KGB, by revealing that, East and West, the
power people were all at it, all privy to dark secrets and darker
deeds.
</P>
<P>
   The second shows a liberal, humane and decent European,
sensitive to Jewish feelings on the Holocaust, but wise enough to
know these should not be used to prejudge contemporary Germans.
</P>
<P>
   This is quite an extraordinary picture for an officer of a
secret police force that used both Nazi stereotypes and
anti-Semitic (``Zionist'') conspiracy theories as part of its
quotidian output. Yet it is how many Russians who regard themselves
as liberal wish to see him; and it is how Western leaders hope he
will be.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of Western foreign ministers whom he has received
have all been given time over the allotted hour and emerged to
spout variations of President Clinton's upbeat formulation of ``a
man we can do business with.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Cook of Britain went in with a list of human-rights points
on Chechnya, only to be met with a high-octane presentation on
precisely that subject. He came out saying the meeting was
``positive'' and ``good,'' even as more stories of torture and mass
executions streamed out of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow I watched Putin answer questions from the public in a
phone-in organized by the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. To one
caller, who ventured that ``the ideology of communism was still
very dangerous,'' he said that he felt ``pretty much the same as
you ... people should see in practice the ideas you and I advocate,
the ideals of democracy and the market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   I watched him again, in London, as he was interviewed early this
month by Sir David Frost. He demonstrated many of the same
qualities: an alert, controlled poise; the ability to project easy
familiarity; a well-briefed acuity in defending the seemingly
indefensible. (In Chechnya ``there are terrorists who kidnap
innocent people by the hundreds and keep them in cellars, torture
and execute them. ... Bandits of this kind _ are they any better
than Nazi criminals?'')
</P>
<P>
   He also gave the reassuring impression that, in him, Russia has
found a humane version of Peter the Great, a ruler who will open
the country to the influence of a world at once gentler and more
dynamic than Russia has ever been. (``I cannot imagine my own
country in isolation from Europe and what we often call the
civilized world,'' Putin said. Could Russia join NATO? ``I don't
see why not. I would not rule out such a possibility.'')
</P>
<P>
   It is now a conventional trope that Putin is a mystery. But why
he was promoted to a position where he now stands poised to win the
presidency of Russia in the March 26 elections is not a mystery. He
is very good, and particularly so in the areas where a modern
politician must be. He is a consummate public performer.
</P>
<P>
   From its dark bowels the KGB has produced a star, one who speaks
of his former institution with proud dignity. ``I have never wanted
to be a James Bond,'' he told Frost. ``But working in state
security was something I had always wanted _ since back in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   He comes to the international arena trailing clouds of odium
from a Chechen war that has seen all-out assaults by the Russian
army on towns _ especially the capital, Grozny _ with no
discrimination between civilians and fighters. Accounts of torture,
beatings, rapes and killings in prison camps like the notorious
Chernokozovo are too well documented to be misinformation or hype.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Putin argues that the Russian army is defending Europe
and ``what we call the civilized world'' from terrorism and
extremism. Against this claim, both domestic and international
protests have so far been muted. The Russian writ runs again in the
Caucasus _ but with freedom, not oppression, on its banners. The
Chechens, Putin told Frost, ``are not a defeated people. They are a
liberated people.''
</P>
<P>
   If foreign governments can find some encouragement in this, they
can also find much to worry about: Putin's past in the KGB; the
high proportion of his current allies who share that past; his
pride in it; the brutality of his war in Chechnya; his callous
treatment of the Babitsky case; the insistence on a stronger state.
</P>
<P>
   All of these make human-rights champions in Russia, and a wide
arc of opinion in the West, deeply skeptical, even hostile _ even
before he starts to govern. But that is Putin through Western eyes;
the eyes that see him as a mystery. He is less of a mystery to
Russian eyes, which are not moistened much by the plight of the
Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Many Westerners see the KGB as an undifferentiated horror; most
Russians do not. For a very brief period, democratically minded
Russians did turn against the security services. After the failure
of the August 1991 coup against President Mikhail Gorbachev, the
statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky was wrenched off its plinth outside
the KGB's Lubyanka headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Living in Moscow at the time, I was near tears as I watched the
crowd try to bring down the massive sculpture of the austere
terrorist who founded the service. The crowd, however, was not
large, and most observers were not as moved as I was. This, one of
the great images of the fall of communism, had much less resonance
in Moscow than in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The KGB was weakened, but it was not reformed. Its crimes were
never properly examined, and there was no consistent public
pressure to do so. Soon after Dzerzhinsky's toppling, a bust of
Yuri Andropov, long-serving KGB chief and briefly general secretary
of the Soviet Communist Party, was prudently removed from its niche
in the Lubyanka wall. In December, Vladimir Putin, who served under
Andropov, ordered it restored.
</P>
<P>
   KGB men had been heroes of Soviet fiction and journalism since
the 1920s. From the mid-'30s to World War II, the depiction of the
agent as hero became particularly clear-cut, a notable example of
the Soviet genius for dissimulation. It was an image that many
millions of Soviet citizens accepted, at least in part.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1988 book on the KGB, Amy Knight quotes a former
Czechoslovak intelligence officer, Ladislav Bittman, to the effect
that the typical Soviet foreign intelligence officers ``radiate
more self-confidence and personality than a diplomat without the
KGB connection. A KGB official dresses more elegantly, entertains
more freely and shows more individuality even in discussing
sensitive foreign policy issues and Soviet politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the theme of civilized men doing dispassionate analysis
for a rather less civilized leadership runs strong. In an interview
in Komsomolskaya Pravda in early February, Sergei Ivanov _ like
Putin, a former middle-ranking foreign intelligence officer and a
close friend whom Putin made secretary of the Security Council _
said modestly that ``the cream went into the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a word on the human-rights defenders. Andrei Sakharov said
not long before his death in 1990 that the one organization which
expressed respect for him was the KGB. Do you believe the opinion
of this man?''
</P>
<P>
   I could find no reference or memory of Sakharov's saying such a
thing. Late last month, though, Sakharov's widow, Elena Bonner,
signed a letter with other former dissidents calling Putin's
fledgling regime ``the introduction of modernized Stalinism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Putin image of civility and Europeanism, however, is
accented by his attachment to St. Petersburg, the place he was born
and spent most of his career. The city was meant to be a window on
Europe and a door for it. Putin is said now to represent it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet searching for clues to the ``real'' Putin can be
frustrating. Those who know him well offer little more than
variations on the positive line _ admiration, praise, an impression
of sober industry and self-sacrificing loyalty. The people who care
most about democracy in Russia do fear him, however, and say they
have cause. They see him as the past returned, and say so.
</P>
<P>
   I talked one evening in Moscow to Sergei Kovalev, a onetime
protege of Sakharov. In his frowzy office in a crumbling apartment
building, he remains serene but as uncompromising as ever.
</P>
<P>
   For him, as once for Sakharov, liberal democracy is available,
so why not have it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin's priority will be to increase the powers of the state,
and in Russia that tradition is a grim one. He will be efficient,
but efficient in what cause? I heard that he talked of KGB men
being 'dropped into power like paratroopers' under his rule.
Yeltsin at least made efforts to overcome the reflexes of the party
boss he had been. In this case, we see a glorying in the traditions
of the KGB, and the power they now have.''
</P>
<P>
   In last December's parliamentary elections, Putin's party,
Unity, won more than 25 percent of the votes, almost as many votes
as the Communists. It did so on one policy: Vote for Putin, the
savior of the country. It acts as the Kremlin's anchor, uniting
with the Communists to manufacture a complaisant parliamentary
leadership. Putin will not use his power base to make war on
capitalism, but he wants to send packing those responsible for
bringing it to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In London I met Pyotr Aven, a former trade minister and now head
of Alfa-Group, one of Russia's largest banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have a clean role model at the top,'' he said.
``Clearly, that has not been the case. Then we must choose. Do we
want the Asiatic model _ which is corrupt but works as long as you
have a dictator who is active? Or do we want the democratic market
model _ which works, but only with transparency and reliability? At
the moment it is a mix. Putin has to choose; I think he is bound to
choose the latter option.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Russia has become a capitalist country _ distorted,
corrupt and inefficient _ but with small and large capitalists who
can be opposed only with a force he cannot use without destroying
what progress there has been.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, for all of his popularity, is constrained. He cannot, any
more than any other contemporary leader, command the economy. He is
also constrained by the weakness of his state in the world. This
will dictate a continuing collaboration with the West.
</P>
<P>
   But his experience has made him suspicious of the West and alert
to further incursions on what he sees as Russia's interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now a firm consensus view at the highest level that
Russia must make its own economic and security decisions,'' says a
Swedish-born investor, Peter Castenfeld, who has worked closely
with successive Russian governments, including Putin's.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the root of this view lies the perception that the West, in
particular America, misused its position of power under labels like
'strategic partnership' and 'free market reform' when Russia was
weak. They think America was intrusive and manipulative inside the
Kremlin. They think professed Western values are a cover for
self-serving positions, and that the 'international community' is
largely jury-rigged.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't seen by them as being anti-American. They just
think America is so powerful that it is unpredictable, because it
is able to project domestic political needs into the international
arena at will. So they want to strengthen the state _ to make the
economy work better, be more rule-based and market-oriented. They
also want to strongly resist increased geostrategic pressure on
their neighbors. They fear very much that NATO will be pushed to
expand into the Baltics. Estonia is 20 minutes by car from Putin's
and Ivanov's hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been clear in the central things: his desire for power
and his effectiveness in wielding it. He is also a master of the
sine qua non of modern, or perhaps postmodern, politicians: He can
manipulate symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most potent of those in post-Soviet Russia is that of
the Orthodox Church. Putin is the first Russian leader since Czar
Nicholas II who can plausibly proclaim himself a believer, having
been baptized soon after birth and remaining faithful to the creed.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony in the Kremlin to celebrate the New Year, Putin

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``You know,'' says Igor Shadkhan, as we sit in his office and
discuss his longtime friend Vladimir Putin, ``Henry Kissinger came
here to St. Petersburg when Putin was deputy mayor. Putin spoke to
him in German.''
 &HT;    Vladimir Putin, Russia's acting president, has a few unlikely
friends, and one of them is Igor Shadkhan _ a Jewish documentary
film producer who says he was a quiet anti-Soviet dissident in his
day.
 &HT;    Any self-respecting KGB officer should have had three different
kinds of alarm bells ringing over these attributes, but not, it
seems, the future president. Shadkhan made a film about Putin in
the early '90s, when the latter was first deputy mayor of
Petersburg and became his friend.
 &HT;    ``So Kissinger asks Putin, 'What did you do before this?' And
Putin says, 'I was in the secret service.' And Kissinger says, 'Me,
too!'''
 &HT;    Shadkhan has a lot of good stories about Vladimir Putin
(pronounced POO-teen), all seemingly calculated to reveal traits
that will play well to a Western audience. Another one is about a
trip to Germany, during which Shadkhan confessed to Putin that, as
a Jew, he could never feel comfortable around Germans.
 &HT;    ``He said he understood exactly how I felt, but said: 'You
should try to understand that this is a new Germany. They are not
Nazis any longer.' And he persuaded me to think again.''
 &HT;    These stories have at least as much symbolic as real truth. The
first exculpates Putin from his association with the world's great
terror instrument, the KGB, by revealing that, East and West, the
power people were all at it, all privy to dark secrets and darker
deeds.
 &HT;    The second shows a liberal, humane and decent European,
sensitive to Jewish feelings on the Holocaust, but wise enough to
know these should not be used to prejudge contemporary Germans.
 &HT;    This is quite an extraordinary picture for an officer of a
secret police force that used both Nazi stereotypes and
anti-Semitic (``Zionist'') conspiracy theories as part of its
quotidian output. Yet it is how many Russians who regard themselves
as liberal wish to see him; and it is how Western leaders hope he
will be.
 &HT;    The parade of Western foreign ministers whom he has received
have all been given time over the allotted hour and emerged to
spout variations of President Clinton's upbeat formulation of ``a
man we can do business with.''
 &HT;    Robin Cook of Britain went in with a list of human-rights points
on Chechnya, only to be met with a high-octane presentation on
precisely that subject. He came out saying the meeting was
``positive'' and ``good,'' even as more stories of torture and mass
executions streamed out of Chechnya.
 &HT;    In Moscow I watched Putin answer questions from the public in a
phone-in organized by the daily Komsomolskaya Pravda. To one
caller, who ventured that ``the ideology of communism was still
very dangerous,'' he said that he felt ``pretty much the same as
you ... people should see in practice the ideas you and I advocate,
the ideals of democracy and the market economy.''
 &HT;    I watched him again, in London, as he was interviewed early this
month by Sir David Frost. He demonstrated many of the same
qualities: an alert, controlled poise; the ability to project easy
familiarity; a well-briefed acuity in defending the seemingly
indefensible. (In Chechnya ``there are terrorists who kidnap
innocent people by the hundreds and keep them in cellars, torture
and execute them. ... Bandits of this kind _ are they any better
than Nazi criminals?'')
 &HT;    He also gave the reassuring impression that, in him, Russia has
found a humane version of Peter the Great, a ruler who will open
the country to the influence of a world at once gentler and more
dynamic than Russia has ever been. (``I cannot imagine my own
country in isolation from Europe and what we often call the
civilized world,'' Putin said. Could Russia join NATO? ``I don't
see why not. I would not rule out such a possibility.'')
 &HT;    It is now a conventional trope that Putin is a mystery. But why
he was promoted to a position where he now stands poised to win the
presidency of Russia in the March 26 elections is not a mystery. He
is very good, and particularly so in the areas where a modern
politician must be. He is a consummate public performer.
 &HT;    From its dark bowels the KGB has produced a star, one who speaks
of his former institution with proud dignity. ``I have never wanted
to be a James Bond,'' he told Frost. ``But working in state
security was something I had always wanted _ since back in
school.''
 &HT;    He comes to the international arena trailing clouds of odium
from a Chechen war that has seen all-out assaults by the Russian
army on towns _ especially the capital, Grozny _ with no
discrimination between civilians and fighters. Accounts of torture,
beatings, rapes and killings in prison camps like the notorious
Chernokozovo are too well documented to be misinformation or hype.
 &HT;    And yet Putin argues that the Russian army is defending Europe
and ``what we call the civilized world'' from terrorism and
extremism. Against this claim, both domestic and international
protests have so far been muted. The Russian writ runs again in the
Caucasus _ but with freedom, not oppression, on its banners. The
Chechens, Putin told Frost, ``are not a defeated people. They are a
liberated people.''
 &HT;    If foreign governments can find some encouragement in this, they
can also find much to worry about: Putin's past in the KGB; the
high proportion of his current allies who share that past; his
pride in it; the brutality of his war in Chechnya; his callous
treatment of the Babitsky case; the insistence on a stronger state.
 &HT;    All of these make human-rights champions in Russia, and a wide
arc of opinion in the West, deeply skeptical, even hostile _ even
before he starts to govern. But that is Putin through Western eyes;
the eyes that see him as a mystery. He is less of a mystery to
Russian eyes, which are not moistened much by the plight of the
Chechens.
 &HT;    Many Westerners see the KGB as an undifferentiated horror; most
Russians do not. For a very brief period, democratically minded
Russians did turn against the security services. After the failure
of the August 1991 coup against President Mikhail Gorbachev, the
statue of Feliks Dzerzhinsky was wrenched off its plinth outside
the KGB's Lubyanka headquarters.
 &HT;    Living in Moscow at the time, I was near tears as I watched the
crowd try to bring down the massive sculpture of the austere
terrorist who founded the service. The crowd, however, was not
large, and most observers were not as moved as I was. This, one of
the great images of the fall of communism, had much less resonance
in Moscow than in the West.
 &HT;    The KGB was weakened, but it was not reformed. Its crimes were
never properly examined, and there was no consistent public
pressure to do so. Soon after Dzerzhinsky's toppling, a bust of
Yuri Andropov, long-serving KGB chief and briefly general secretary
of the Soviet Communist Party, was prudently removed from its niche
in the Lubyanka wall. In December, Vladimir Putin, who served under
Andropov, ordered it restored.
 &HT;    KGB men had been heroes of Soviet fiction and journalism since
the 1920s. From the mid-'30s to World War II, the depiction of the
agent as hero became particularly clear-cut, a notable example of
the Soviet genius for dissimulation. It was an image that many
millions of Soviet citizens accepted, at least in part.
 &HT;    In her 1988 book on the KGB, Amy Knight quotes a former
Czechoslovak intelligence officer, Ladislav Bittman, to the effect
that the typical Soviet foreign intelligence officers ``radiate
more self-confidence and personality than a diplomat without the
KGB connection. A KGB official dresses more elegantly, entertains
more freely and shows more individuality even in discussing
sensitive foreign policy issues and Soviet politics.''
 &HT;    Indeed, the theme of civilized men doing dispassionate analysis
for a rather less civilized leadership runs strong. In an interview
in Komsomolskaya Pravda in early February, Sergei Ivanov _ like
Putin, a former middle-ranking foreign intelligence officer and a
close friend whom Putin made secretary of the Security Council _
said modestly that ``the cream went into the KGB.
 &HT;    ``And a word on the human-rights defenders. Andrei Sakharov said
not long before his death in 1990 that the one organization which
expressed respect for him was the KGB. Do you believe the opinion
of this man?''
 &HT;    I could find no reference or memory of Sakharov's saying such a
thing. Late last month, though, Sakharov's widow, Elena Bonner,
signed a letter with other former dissidents calling Putin's
fledgling regime ``the introduction of modernized Stalinism.''
 &HT;    The Putin image of civility and Europeanism, however, is
accented by his attachment to St. Petersburg, the place he was born
and spent most of his career. The city was meant to be a window on
Europe and a door for it. Putin is said now to represent it.
 &HT;    And yet searching for clues to the ``real'' Putin can be
frustrating. Those who know him well offer little more than
variations on the positive line _ admiration, praise, an impression
of sober industry and self-sacrificing loyalty. The people who care
most about democracy in Russia do fear him, however, and say they
have cause. They see him as the past returned, and say so.
 &HT;    I talked one evening in Moscow to Sergei Kovalev, a onetime
protege of Sakharov. In his frowzy office in a crumbling apartment
building, he remains serene but as uncompromising as ever.
 &HT;    For him, as once for Sakharov, liberal democracy is available,
so why not have it?
 &HT;    ``Putin's priority will be to increase the powers of the state,
and in Russia that tradition is a grim one. He will be efficient,
but efficient in what cause? I heard that he talked of KGB men
being 'dropped into power like paratroopers' under his rule.
Yeltsin at least made efforts to overcome the reflexes of the party
boss he had been. In this case, we see a glorying in the traditions
of the KGB, and the power they now have.''
 &HT;    In last December's parliamentary elections, Putin's party,
Unity, won more than 25 percent of the votes, almost as many votes
as the Communists. It did so on one policy: Vote for Putin, the
savior of the country. It acts as the Kremlin's anchor, uniting
with the Communists to manufacture a complaisant parliamentary
leadership. Putin will not use his power base to make war on
capitalism, but he wants to send packing those responsible for
bringing it to Russia.
 &HT;    In London I met Pyotr Aven, a former trade minister and now head
of Alfa-Group, one of Russia's largest banks.
 &HT;    ``We must have a clean role model at the top,'' he said.
``Clearly, that has not been the case. Then we must choose. Do we
want the Asiatic model _ which is corrupt but works as long as you
have a dictator who is active? Or do we want the democratic market
model _ which works, but only with transparency and reliability? At
the moment it is a mix. Putin has to choose; I think he is bound to
choose the latter option.''
 &HT;    In fact, Russia has become a capitalist country _ distorted,
corrupt and inefficient _ but with small and large capitalists who
can be opposed only with a force he cannot use without destroying
what progress there has been.
 &HT;    Putin, for all of his popularity, is constrained. He cannot, any
more than any other contemporary leader, command the economy. He is
also constrained by the weakness of his state in the world. This
will dictate a continuing collaboration with the West.
 &HT;    But his experience has made him suspicious of the West and alert
to further incursions on what he sees as Russia's interests.
 &HT;    ``There is now a firm consensus view at the highest level that
Russia must make its own economic and security decisions,'' says a
Swedish-born investor, Peter Castenfeld, who has worked closely
with successive Russian governments, including Putin's.
 &HT;    ``At the root of this view lies the perception that the West, in
particular America, misused its position of power under labels like
'strategic partnership' and 'free market reform' when Russia was
weak. They think America was intrusive and manipulative inside the
Kremlin. They think professed Western values are a cover for
self-serving positions, and that the 'international community' is
largely jury-rigged.
 &HT;    ``This isn't seen by them as being anti-American. They just
think America is so powerful that it is unpredictable, because it
is able to project domestic political needs into the international
arena at will. So they want to strengthen the state _ to make the
economy work better, be more rule-based and market-oriented. They
also want to strongly resist increased geostrategic pressure on
their neighbors. They fear very much that NATO will be pushed to
expand into the Baltics. Estonia is 20 minutes by car from Putin's
and Ivanov's hometown.''
 &HT;    Putin has been clear in the central things: his desire for power
and his effectiveness in wielding it. He is also a master of the
sine qua non of modern, or perhaps postmodern, politicians: He can
manipulate symbols.
 &HT;    Among the most potent of those in post-Soviet Russia is that of
the Orthodox Church. Putin is the first Russian leader since Czar
Nicholas II who can plausibly proclaim himself a believer, having
been baptized soon after birth and remaining faithful to the creed.
 &HT;    At a ceremony in the Kremlin to celebrate the New Year, Putin
came into the vast hall from one side to meet the patriarch of
Moscow and all the Russias, Aleksei II, who entered from another.
Putin knelt to kiss the patriarch's hands.
 &HT;    It was an act rich in paradox: the former KGB colonel kissing
the hands of one who _ according to a dossier published in the
early '90s _ was more than usually helpful to the KGB while rising
through a hierarchy that was routinely vetted and controlled by the
security services.
 &HT;    ``Vladimir Vladimirovich,'' said the master of ceremonies as he
rose, ``what is your message for the new millennium?''
 &HT;    ``Love,'' said the president-to-be.

   On Jan. 10, Time Warner shareholders from Ted Turner on down
were high-fiving one another as they watched their stock soar 39
percent, to $90 a share, after America Online said it planned to
acquire the media giant.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't the only investors celebrating. That same day,
frenetic trading drove the stock prices of Time Warner rivals up an
average of 14 percent: Walt Disney (15 percent), News Corporation
(19 percent), Seagram (11 percent), and Viacom (10 percent).
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't come as a big surprise, according to new research
from academics at San Diego State University and Ohio State
University. After looking at takeovers of 141 companies and their
competitors from 1982 to 1991, researchers found that most rival
companies experienced a jump in market value as well.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? There's an increased probability that those
competitors will become targets themselves, and investors know
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very, very smart,'' says co-author Ralph
Walkling, a finance professor at Ohio State's Fisher College of
Business. ``It factors the probability into the stock price.''
</P>
<P>
   Those rivals whose price doesn't move _ which is less than half
of them _ may never make it to the merger alter. But those
companies whose shares rise, the study found, have certain
attractive characteristics in common, including lower managerial
ownership and a greater debt capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The company with the biggest gains on the day of the merger
announcement is the one most likely to consummate a merger within a
year.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation as the most
likely takeover candidate among Time Warner's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing which company is the next target in a given industry is
appealing. After all, shares of target companies typically increase
more than those of the bidding company.
</P>
<P>
   But Walkling cautions investors who are eager to plow money into
companies like News Corporation. ``Remember _ stocks may have
already adjusted by the time individual investors get into them,''
he says. ``That definitely is a big risk factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the market may be smarter than you are. &QL;

were high-fiving one another as they watched their stock soar 39

   There's nothing like good news for making investors nervous. As
the economy continued to grow strongly into the month of February,
it set a record for the longest economic expansion _ peacetime or
wartime _ in U.S. history. So, where does that leave investors?

   Retirement savers have enjoyed a pretty good run lately _
probably even better than they think. Or so I concluded after
studying the performance of 24 leading mutual funds used in 401(k)
plans. Most investors collected a nice ``installment bonus'' on
their 401(k)-plan investments. Not because they invested
brilliantly but because they invested methodically, making regular
tax-deductible contributions....By Scott Burns, ``Worth'' magazine &QL;

<P>
   Three readers came to Mary Menchaca's rescue with similar
recipes for Ricotta Cookies _ and were happy to share them.
Hopefully, they're like the ones Menchaca remembers her grandmother
making.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine M. Blagg of Tujunga noted that the recipe she sent
along is one of her favorite cookies and can be decorated with
buttercream frosting and assorted candies for any holiday or
festivity. ``The batch is so large that it is great to take to work
or other social functions.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bushelle of Woodland Hills shared the same recipe except
hers has 1 cup of softened buttered instead of 1/2 cup margarine as
in Blagg's, and she drops them by tablespoonfuls instead of
teaspoonfuls. So suit yourself and try either way.
</P>
<P>
   A bit different variation on the theme was submitted by Sandra
Smith of Sylmar. Give them a whirl. Sounds like you're in for a
special treat. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ITALIAN COOKIES &QL; 
(Shared by Catherine M. Blagg, Tujunga and Linda Bushelle, Woodland
Hills) &QL; 
1/2 cup margarine, softened &QL; 
2 cups granulated sugar &QL; 
3 eggs &QL; 
1 pound ricotta cheese &QL; 
1 teaspoon vanilla &QL; 
4 cups flour &QL; 
1 teaspoon baking soda &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
Vanilla frosting &QL; 
Colored candies
</P>
<P>
   Cream together margarine, sugar and eggs until light and fluffy.
Beat in ricotta cheese and vanilla until mixed. Add flour, baking
soda and salt, mixing until well blended
</P>
<P>
   Drop by teaspoonfuls on lightly greased cookie sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven 12 minutes or until bottom of
cookies are lightly browned.
</P>
<P>
   Frost with your favorite vanilla frosting and sprinkle with
colored candies as desired. Makes lots of cookies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
RICOTTA-CHEESE COOKIES &QL; 
(Shared by Sandra Smith, Sylmar) &QL; 
2 cups granulated sugar &QL; 
1 cup margarine OR butter (2 sticks), softened &QL; 
1 container (15 ounces) ricotta cheese &QL; 
2 teaspoons vanilla &QL; 
2 large eggs &QL; 
4 cups all-purpose flour &QL; 
2 tablespoons baking powder &QL; 
1 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1 1/2 cups powdered sugar &QL; 
3 tablespoons milk &QL; 
Red OR green sugar crystals
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, with mixer at low speed, beat granulated sugar
and margarine until blended. Increase speed to high; beat until
light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. At medium speed, beat in ricotta
cheese, vanilla and eggs until well combined.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce speed to low. Add flour, baking powder and salt. Beat
until dough forms.
</P>
<P>
   Drop by level tablespoons about 2 inches apart on ungreased
cookie sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 350-degree oven about 15 minutes or until
cookies are very lightly golden (cookies will be soft). Remove
cookies to wire rack to cool.
</P>
<P>
   When cookies are cool, prepare icing. In a small bowl, stir
powdered sugar and milk until smooth. With small metal spatula or
knife, spread icing on cool cookies. Sprinkle with red or green
sugars. Allow icing to dry completely, about 1 hour. Makes about 6
dozen cookies. &QL;

I would appreciate an easy Caesar Salad dressing recipe without
eggs. I make all my salad dressing, since I have not found any
bottled dressings to my liking. &QL;

I would like a recipe similar to the Hearty Autumn Harvest Soup
served at the Fresh Choice restaurant. It is thick and creamy and
includes butternut squash.

December by a fairly robust majority in the Duma, and standing an
almost inevitable chance of being elected in Russia's popular vote

most of whose working life has been spent with the KGB, is no
exception. Does he come to power with the bottled-up energies of a
hitherto frustrated reformer, determined to take Russia into
Europe? Or does his heart lie in the paranoid, ruthless old world
of the Cold-War Soviet security services? Or is he in reality a
Kremlin insider, a crafty new-Russian power-broker who revels in
sleaze and arm-twisting? Any one of these three faces could be the
real Putin, the other two just political disguises...By The

strong, determined man, supported since parliamentary elections in
December by a fairly robust majority in the Duma, and standing an
almost inevitable chance of being elected in Russia's popular vote
March 26. So, then, is Putin just what the Russian doctor ordered?
Not so fast. Most of the significant things that Putin has done,

career as a spy, have been scary...By The Economist &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Spies are good at concealing their motives.
Presumably Vladimir Putin, acting president of Russia since Jan. 1,
most of whose working life has been spent with the KGB, is no
exception. Does he come to power with the bottled-up energies of a
hitherto frustrated reformer, determined to take Russia into
Europe? Or does his heart lie in the paranoid, ruthless old world
of the Cold-War Soviet security services? Or is he in reality a
Kremlin insider, a crafty new-Russian power-broker who revels in
sleaze and arm-twisting? Any one of these three faces could be the
real Putin, the other two just political disguises...By The

   NEW DELHI _ President Bill Clinton's visit comes at a time when
India is gaining greater prominence in Washington's South Asia
policy. U.S.-Indian relations, freed from their Cold-War
constraints, have steadily improved, although important bilateral
differences remain.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. policy has yet to free itself from the India-Pakistan
straitjacket, New Delhi views potential strategic ties with
Washington in a larger framework that includes its biggest
neighbor, China. India has no real ally in a world in which most
states of consequence are in economic and military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does India have to fend for itself, it is facing in
Asia a growing imbalance of power inimical to its long-term
interests. At the center of this imbalance is an increasingly
powerful and assertive China, whose rapid rise has been accentuated
by the decline of Russia and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   China, in its pursuit of power politics, has done everything
possible to keep India boxed in on the Subcontinent, using Pakistan
as a surrogate. China has also gained a strategic foothold in
Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's five-day visit is richer in photo opportunities,
speeches and tourism than in substantive agreements. The visit,
however, could set the stage for real strategic cooperation on
issues of mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
   India and the United States have much in common: pluralistic
political systems, a free press, the rule of law, a secular ethos
and immense diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as the past decade of missed opportunities testifies, a
strategic partnership can emerge only by resolving bilateral
disputes on the nuclear issue and U.S. approach toward Pakistan and
China. These major differences dwarf other disagreements, such as
on labor, environment and trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear divide is rooted in the U.S.-sponsored Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, which regards only nations that tested a
nuclear device before 1967 as legitimate nuclear-weapons states.
India's decades-old opposition to this regime has made it a target
of Western technology controls.
</P>
<P>
   India resents being treated by U.S. policy as a Siamese twin of
Pakistan. It also frets at the respect accorded to China, to the
extent that Washington has let Beijing off the hook on its nuclear
and missile transfers to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India would like Washington to be on the side of the world's
largest democracy, not on the side of the world's largest
autocracy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-Indian differences will not be easy to settle. This has
been underscored by both Clinton and by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he could not accept India's new status as a
nuclear-weapons state. Mrs. Albright wants New Delhi to accept U.S.
demands because a qualitatively better relationship ``will depend
largely on what India does.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, America's political significance for India flowed
from a largely negative context: as the initiator of an expanding
web of technology controls, the originator of Pakistan-versus-India
games, the architect of sanctions and the wielder of pressure over
the disputed territory of Kashmir and nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   For enduring bilateral cooperation to emerge, the negative
aspects have to be alleviated.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, this is already happening. Attitudes are
changing in both capitals. India has never had a government as
U.S.-friendly as the present one, which has engaged Washington in a
strategic dialogue and opened many lucrative market opportunities
for American businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But India's U.S.-friendly posture can endure only on the basis
of tangible reciprocity and an overall bilateral accommodation.
This demands, on India's part, realism and a better appreciation of
the role of hard bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   India so far has emerged empty-handed from protracted
negotiations despite a series of unilateral concessions, such as
agreeing in 1998 to accept negotiations on a global
fissile-material production ban and its more recent lifting of
quantitative restrictions on U.S. imports.
</P>
<P>
   With less than a year left to his presidency, Clinton can do
little more than put U.S.-India relations on a path of closer
cooperation. But if he helps set in motion an institutionalized
process of strategic engagement, the slow but sure results could
transform Asian geopolitics in the years ahead. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``As he says, he's outlived two of his physicians,'' said John
W. Taylor, one of some 50 admirers who gathered at an Oakland
restaurant Wednesday night to celebrate the 90th birthday of
Berkeley's famous Waving Man.
</P>
<P>
   It has been eight years since Charles retired from his
celebrated hobby of waving to passing cars at the corner of Oregon
Street and Martin Luther King Jr. Way.
</P>
<P>
   Each weekday morning for 30 years, Charles greeted every
passerby with his waving hand _ a tradition that began in 1962 with
a daily exchange of waves between him and a neighbor. In the
mid-1960s, an admiring motorist presented Charles with a pair of
yellow gloves, which made his waves easier to spot from the fast
lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``People laughed at me, said I was crazy for doing it,'' Charles
said when poor health forced him to hang up his gloves in 1992.
``Some people called me communist. Neighborhood high school kids
would pass by, go home and tell their parents, `Mr. Charles must be
going crazy,' but it just stuck, and I enjoyed it so.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles later moved inside and started to wave from his front
window. People still noticed, and honked in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, who was born in Louisiana, was elevated in popular myth
to the pantheon of Great Berkeley Characters. He has been the grand
marshal of two parades. His yellow gloves have been enshrined in
the Berkeley History Center.
</P>
<P>
   And Charles' contribution to the mental stability of his
community, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of motorists
who happily waved back over three decades, is well-remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bush, now a young adult, recalls the Waving Man as a
neighborhood institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember growing up and leaving to go to school, and he
would stand on the corner, rain or shine, and wave to the cars
going by,'' he said. Bush added that local kids took delight in
imitating Charles' admonition to all who passed by: ``Have a GOOD
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We respected him,'' Bush said. ``He showed us that no matter
what, you could be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's mother, Cleopatra Bush, said Charles continued giving to
those who knew him. ``Even after he stopped waving, he was always
working in his yard, and he would stop and give me a hug,'' she
said. ``He would always call on my birthday, and he would always
send me a card.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie Conger, an Alameda County Superior Court judge, got to
know Charles after exchanging waves with him on her drive to work.
They, too, share birthday traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there at 6 a.m. tying balloons to his porch railing,''
she said Wednesday. ``And he makes me gumbo for my birthday every
year. He cooks wonderfully.''
</P>
<P>
   As his birthday guests spoke, Charles worked the tables at
Kinkaid's restaurant in Oakland's Jack London Square. Wearing a
black suit and walking with a cane, he shook hands, kissed the
women and told each person to ``Enjoy yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them all, my friends,'' he said after returning to his
table and his glass of Jack Daniels. Charles said growing older
didn't daunt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know nothing about that, because I feel good,'' he
said. ``The Good Lord lets me feel good every day, loving everybody
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his eyes landed on a female friend who had just arrived.
``Come here, sweetheart,'' he said. ``Gimme sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles also traded kisses with Mable Cotter, who leaned forward
from her wheelchair as her husband, Ralph Cotter, looked on with a
smile. The Cotters and Charles became friends during Charles'
career at the Oakland Naval Supply Center, where he worked from
1942 to 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep smiling,'' he told Mable Cotter. ``Call me every day,
now. I'll be looking for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles' oldest friend at the party was Jessie Esprit, who will
turn 90 next week. She attended 12 years of public school with
Charles in their hometown of Lake Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   Esprit remembered Charles as a ``very, very beautiful'' young
man who was devoted to his high school sweetheart, Flora Shade.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one girlfriend, and he never left that girlfriend,''
Esprit said. ``She was a pretty girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles married her after graduation. She died in 1982, having
seen her husband praised on the CBS evening news by the late
Charles Kuralt.
</P>
<P>
   Esprit said other women were attracted to the young Charles
``because he was a baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles was widely lauded for his skill at first base during his
years with the Lake Charles Black Yankees, a Negro League team.
Charles said he was once struck out by the great Satchel Paige.

ROADBLOCK FOR MISTER
 STRAIGHT TALK

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - You're John McCain and you can no longer talk
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Not if you want to remain a Republican. Not if you still want to
be president of the United States. And you do.
</P>
<P>
   During your long campaign for the Republican presidential
nomination, it was your plain-spoken, unvar nished, often brazen,
occasionally insolent talk that got you the most attention and the
most respect.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you must keep your mouth shut.
</P>
<P>
   Or worse, you must play an elabo rate game of make-believe by
faking genuine support for George W. Bush, the man who defeated
you.
</P>
<P>
   You don't like Bush. It was clear to everyone who watched you
during the campaign. You haven't changed your mind.
</P>
<P>
   You dislike Al Gore even more, of course. But if Bush becomes
presi dent, he'll have the Republican nomination locked up again
four years from now and you won't get another shot at the big
prize.
</P>
<P>
   You need Bush to lose.
</P>
<P>
   You're in the same position Ronald Reagan was in when he lost
the nomination to Gerald Ford. If Ford had managed to defeat Jimmy
Carter in 1976, Reagan's running mate, Nelson Rockefeller, would
have had the inside track on the nomination in 1980, and Reagan may
not have gotten an other shot at the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan needed Ford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   He pretended to support Ford but really didn't. And Ford lost.
The rest, as they say, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bush needs your support and you're going to give it to him,
Reagan-style.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, you told CBS' Dan Rather that you'll support Bush
but, ``Exactly how that happens and under what circumstances and my
degree of enthusiasm obviously are questions that are yet to be re
solved.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Straight Talk Express stops here.
</P>
<P>
   It came to a grinding halt earlier this month in Sedona when you
pulled out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Your speech was a first-rate demon stration in exactly how to
damn with faint praise.
</P>
<P>
   You stood under a beautiful blue sky with the majestic Red Rocks
behind you, dusted with snow, and said, ``I congratulate Governor
Bush and wish him and his family well. He very well may become the
next president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   You didn't say he should become the next president, or that he
must become the next president. And you certainly didn't say you
were going to do everything in your power to make sure Bush became
the next president.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, John McCain, the maverick presidential
candidate and Vietnam War hero, the man who models himself after
Teddy Roose velt _ often using the big stick of his convictions to
pummel politicians and journalists _ decided to talk softly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of saying exactly what you feel about the
soon-to-be-crowned Republican nominee, you chose to beat around the
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves the best wishes of every American,'' you said of
your former opponent. ``He certainly has mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Best wishes?
</P>
<P>
   That's what you offer via greeting card to the third-cousin
you've never met after she sends you the an nouncement of her
impending nup tials.
</P>
<P>
   You have other options.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to run for president as an independent candidate,
you could go back to talking straight. You could be even more
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   But you won't. That would leave you without the backing of a
major political party and, in the end, you'd lose. You want to win.
You still want to become president.
</P>
<P>
   You're John McCain and you can no longer talk straight.

the silence barrier and assumed a position of prominence from which
it is not likely to retreat. And it says much for the health of the
local scene that many young Asian artists have settled in New York.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Court burdens GOP with tobacco issue
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The conservative majority of the U.S. Supreme Court did
congressional Republicans no favor when it held that the federal
Food and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate
tobacco as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is congenial to GOP policy inclinations and is
legally defensible against an also strong argument pressed by the
court dissenters. It is not clear that Congress hasn't kept tobacco
regulation within its own purview, as the five-justice majority
ruled. With the record muddled, it is arguably best to default to
congressional authority.
</P>
<P>
   But even the court majority conceded _ indeed, emphasized _ that
tobacco use is the nation's No. 1 public health issue, especially
the industry's addiction of the young as a future victim clientele.
</P>
<P>
   It was the prevention of youth smoking that FDA was trying to
address, and the court, though disallowing that, all but invited
Congress either to license the agency to take it up or to undertake
the matter itself with legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was certainly not the justices' intention to do so,
the ruling hands Democrats another big-stick issue with which to
pound Republicans in this especially crucial election year.
</P>
<P>
   The public health interest here is clear and overwhelming. Even
the industry itself now concedes tobacco is addictive and that its
use sickens and often kills. Tobacco is the leading cause of
preventable diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But what ought to be a bipartisan, in fact a universal interest
in public health is not. As Democrats have become willing in recent
years to regulate tobacco, the GOP has let itself become a virtual
subsidiary of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 through last year, the leading tobacco companies
contributed $14.3 million to the Republican Party and its election
committees, just $3 million to the Democratic Party and its
election committees.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, tobacco companies and their political action
committees gave $2.2 million to GOP organizations and candidates,
$564,000 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco-regulation legislation Democrats are now certain to
push adds to the GOP's already considerable issue woes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are fighting popular gun-control legislation in
tandem with an increasingly shrill gun lobby, another big
contributor. To broad concerns about education, Republicans can
tender, since they believe there is no legitimate national role,
only the constitutionally dubious and otherwise doubtful panacea of
vouchers. And they are again drumming huge tax cuts of the sort
that flopped in Congress last year to vast public indifference.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of their own John McCain's near thing lost of them,
Republicans have even let Al Gore, although himself a political
misdemeanant on such matters, swipe the campaign-reform issue.
</P>
<P>
   Issue debilities don't necessarily translate into candidate
losses; personalities and personal records count. But GOP
candidates are starting the presidential and congressional races
with some pretty heavy luggage.

VOLVO XC _ SMOOTH AND SURE OF FOOT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was expecting the brawny, solid ``clunk'' that the doors made
when I slammed them. Classic, rugged Volvo. The smooth ride on the
highway and the stiff, clinging carve through corners was no
surprise, either.
</P>
<P>
   What I was not expecting was its performance in snow and, more
particularly, on ice. It was as sure-footed there as any SUV, and
more stable, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   And I am thankful that, before I took it on the road for a week,
I got to test the Volvo on the slippery course used by the New
England Motor Press Association in its annual winter vehicle
competition. It was here that the 2000 Volvo XC AWD chewed through
snow and would not let ice keep it from its assigned line.
</P>
<P>
   Set it in half a foot of crusty snow and try to make it spin. No
go. Drive it straight ahead at 40 on a sheet of glare ice, stomp
the ABS, and take your hands off the wheel. It came to a steady,
straight stop. Put it into a tight turn on the ice and try to make
it fishtail. The Volvo would allow no such thing. Start from a stop
on an icy upgrade. You could feel the ABS and traction control
working in concert to reduce spin, wheel-by-wheel, so that it
seemed it was a four-legged creature walking its way up a slippery
hill.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're longing for one of those $50,000-plus SUVs, this
may be the best all-season car a cold-weather driver could own.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo has long been associated with sturdiness, safety, a
certain tweedy cachet, and station wagons. Until recently, a third
of all Volvos sold were wagons. Then, in 1997 the XC _ for Cross
Country _ was introduced as a 1998 model. Now, the XC accounts for
25 percent of Volvo's wagon sales, and has helped boost wagon sales
to 50 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the minivan and the SUV, the Volvo XC has
found a home.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo, of course, makes other wagons: front-wheel drive, the V70
all-wheel drive. The XC is the countrified version of the latter,
and Volvo has aimed it correctly at city and suburban drivers with
an eye on an active, outdoor lifestyle. But it is also a great car
for folks who live in the country, folks for whom any trip out for
anything is at least a 30-minute round trip and for whom the
weather is not always an ally.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, I'm grateful I got to drive this in the winter test.
Otherwise, I might not have realized what was in my hands. Outside,
even though it's a bit more of a wedge than the boxes of the past,
it still looks simple, pure Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, add the $2,200 package that includes leather seats, a
sunroof, simulated wood appointments, and you could be in any
luxury sedan. The leather buckets up front are fairly firm, though
I'd like them a bit more supportive at the thigh _ like the bench
seat in the rear, for instance. It's a 60/40split that opens to a
generous cargo area as big as most found in SUVs. The cargo area
also features a pop-up, rear-facing seat for children (as many as
three tots).
</P>
<P>
   The Cross Country has 6.5 inches of ground clearance, an inch
more than the V70 AWD. It's also two inches taller. This doesn't
mean you'll want to go off-road bushwhacking with it, but it does
mean it will move a bit better through deep snow and that you get
some of the up-high, airy feeling an SUV can give you.
</P>
<P>
   The list of standard features is lengthy and includes heated
outside mirrors, heated front seats, dual-zone climate control,
pollen and dust filters, sunroof, remote keyless entry and
security, eight-way power adjustable driver's seat, and a premium
sound system.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features, too, are impressive and they include a
high-strength steel passenger safety cage; transverse engine that
distributes crash energy away from front-seat occupants; air bags
for front passengers and side curtains for front and middle seats;
and seatbacks that change shape to cushion front-seat passengers
and reduce back, head, and whiplash injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cross Country is powered by a 2.4-liter, in-line
five-cylinder engine. It's a 20-valve DOHC power plant with light
pressure turbo. Power gets transferred through an
electronically-controlled, four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   You do not get the impressive snap that some turbocharged
engines give you, but on the highway it gives a smooth, steady
surge that is impressive after how sedate it seems moving slowly
over country roads. It delivered just over 20 miles per gallon in a
wide mix of driving.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, quite firm and with no sense of lateral sway even at
speed on sharp corners, is delivered with a front suspension that
mixes hydraulic struts, coil springs, and a stabilizer bar. In the
rear is Volvo's multilink, semi-independent suspension, coupled
with coil springs and gas shocks.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Cross Country stand out, however, is its traction
control/drive train system. Most of the time, 95 percent of the
torque is being delivered to the front wheels. If there's minor
slippage up there, a traction-control system adjusts
wheel-to-wheel. When the going gets slippery or rough or reckless,
however, a monitoring system picks up differences in rotation
between front and rear wheels and, using a viscous coupler that
acts much like a clutch, distributes more torque to the rear. At
times, 95 percent of the torque can be delivered there, depending
on where the wheels are spinning and where the best bite can be
had. It is a seamless transfer that the car does for you.
</P>
<P>
   It was this system, which also employs the ABS brakes to cut
wheel spin to one wheel while delivering torque to others, that
gave the Cross Country the sensation of a stalking, four-footed
beast that I felt while running it uphill on a sheet of glare ice.
And it is this system that puts it among the best winter cars you
could buy.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The center console/armrest is too low. I found myself hunching
down to put my right elbow onto it.
</P>
<P>
   --The driver's side seat controls, down on the outer edge of the
seat, are in too cramped a space and you end up fumbling around for
them. Volvo ought to go the way of some other manufacturers and put
them on the door.
</P>
<P>
   --The cupholder, shaky and shallow, could not hold a bottle of
water securely.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The two-step bins in the front doors. You could keep change,
pens, other small items on rubber-bottomed top step; maps, larger
items on lower step.
</P>
<P>
   --The cargo-netted bins that ran along the side of the cargo box
at the rear of the car.

ANTILOCK BRAKES WORK _ WHEN USED PROPERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (l and f coding)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It can be both fascinating and perplexing to watch new
automotive technology make its way to the market. It seems
inevitable that promise will, for at least a time, get snagged on
the horns of ignorance and distrust.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen it with the automatic transmission, brighter
headlights, seat belts (Remember the bizarre argument that seat
belts were not safe because they might trap you in your car after a
wreck?) and air bags.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes ABS _ anti-lock brake systems. I've had experienced
drivers tell me they don't trust them, don't understand them, don't
want them. I've talked to young drivers who learned nothing in
driver's education about how to use them safely.
</P>
<P>
   What is called for is an unlearning of old ways (pump the
brakes) by the experienced driving generation and a concentrated,
mandatory education in their use in driver training programs for
the young gneration.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing for a combination of these is the ABS Education
Alliance, a nonprofit coalition of companies that manufacture
anti-lock brake systems.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-lock brakes are not a new invention. They were used in
Germany in the 1930s to stop trains; used in World War II to stop
airplanes on carrier decks; Plymouth offered a model with ABS in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Their first major inroads in the United States came in the
mid-1980s in high-end autos, according to Rosemarie Kitchin of the
education alliance. Four years ago, ABS systems crept into less
expensive models, and last year they were installed in about
two-thirds of all cars built.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Kitchner said, too often the salespeople at dealerships do
not instruct car buyers in their use, and an education alliance
survey found that two-thirds of drivers between 18-24 had not been
taught how to use ABS in driver education.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this is unfortunate because ABS is a great safety
feature that, once understood, is comfortable to live with and easy
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Some basics:
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that in an emergency, you had to pump your brakes
while trying to slow down. It was up to the driver to sense wheel
lock-up and back off the brakes before the car turned into a
hurtling sled that could not be steered. Even a single wheel
locking up meant that the braking capabilities of all four wheels
had to be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   ABS is designed to do that ``sensing'' for you and to help you
not only stop your vehicle in an emergency situation, but to let
you steer even with the brakes jammed on.
</P>
<P>
   When you stomp the brakes in a four-wheel ABS vehicle, a central
control unit monitors electronic pulses from sensors at each wheel.
If a sensor tells the control unit that a wheel is about to lock
up, a computer signals a valve to limit hydraulic pressure to the
brake at that wheel. This allows the wheel to rotate, even if for a
brief moment, and thus avoids lock-up. Meanwhile, the other brakes
can remain fully engaged, though it is likely that they, too, will
be gripped and ungripped at various times as each approachs
lock-up.
</P>
<P>
   So young or old or somewhere in between, if you don't know about
ABS and how to use the system, get yourself educated.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't own an ABS car now, you likely will in the future,
and you should, because they are a good thing. If you rent a car,
Kitchin said, chances are 9 in 10 you'll get one with ABS.
</P>
<P>
   Know your own car, of course, but always check for ABS in cars
you rent or borrow. If you own one car with ABS and one without,
think about braking before you drive either.
</P>
<P>
   Learn that the pulsing of the pedal and the chattering sounds
you hear when ABS brakes are applied with force is normal. It's the
grip and ungrip function at work.
</P>
<P>
   If you hear that chatter and feel that pulse each time you slow
when driving, you are probably driving too fast in bad conditions.
</P>
<P>
   If you are taking driver training, insist that your teacher
instruct you in using ABS. If you already have a license, take a
course, or take Kitchner's advice: Go to church. On a Tuesday. When
the parking lot is deserted. Set up some cardboard boxes and use
your brakes as you try to avoid hitting them.
</P>
<P>
   You can also try them out on a deserted road that has snow,
gravel or ice on it or is slippery with rain. Learn to put the
brakes on and keep them on. Put the brakes on before you attempt to
steer around any obstacles (particularly important in SUVs). Learn
to steer with the brakes on.
</P>
<P>
   A warning: If you have a car with only rear-wheel ABS, the rules
are different. These are found mostly in light trucks, vans, and
SUVs. In these vehicles, you can still lock up the front wheels and
lose the ability to steer. When you feel lock-up, let off the
brakes and let the front wheels start rolling again so you can
steer.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ABS and have mastered its uses, don't get stupid and
think the system makes you invulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ABS will not eliminate the possibility of skidding. ABS will not
stop your vehicle in a shorter distance, and, in fact, in some
instances will increase that distance slightly (though the tradeoff
for control is well worth this slight boost in stopping distance).
</P>
<P>
   For new drivers, ABS education should be mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   For older drivers, reluctant to embrace new technology, Kitchin
has other advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you say is that if they know how to use it and can avoid
a squirrel, a dog, a ball, somebody chasing a ball _ if they can
avoid one obstacle, they'll avoid a crash, an injury, they might
save a life,'' she said.

   NY-ASIAN-ART (New York) _ Asian art in Manhattan is not what it

the silence barrier and assumed a position of prominence from which
it is not likely to retreat. And it says much for the health of the
local scene that many young Asian artists have settled in New York.

 JULIA'S TRASHY TOGS IN `ERIN' INSPIRE A FASHION DIALOGUE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most people would be mortified if their boss told them to
``rethink'' their wardrobe because it was making co-workers
``uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Julia Roberts's character in the new film ``Erin
Brockovich.'' The sassy legal assistant _ who insists on wearing
push-up bras, leather miniskirts and sheer leopard-skin blouses _
retorts to her law-office manager, ``You may want to rethink those
ties.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the sartorial tension in the box office hit, which
chronicles the real-life story of how Brockovich discovers a
utility company cover-up of contaminated water which is making
residents of a California town ill.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when more men and women are breaking traditional
workplace dress codes, Brockovich's in-your-face attitude and
subsequent success says a lot about society. Is this rebel in a
tank top a role model and a heroine for the new millennium? Or is
she an embarrassment to working professionals?
</P>
<P>
   The Boton Globe invited two women to participate in a dialogue
about office dress codes and self-expression in the workplace.
Kirsten Blocker is an editor at the Boston-based female youth
magazine Teen Voices and a 21-year-old English major at Pine Manor
College in Chestnut Hill. Shari Thurer, 52, is a psychologist in
private practice and an adjunct professor at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   As they began debating over dinner recently, the two were quick
to engage in some Brockovich bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's a feminist's nightmare. Her dress is very
provocative, completely inappropriate, and trashy. It's conveyed in
the movie that a lot of things happened for her because people
found her attractive. . . . I found it sickening,'' says Blocker.
</P>
<P>
   Says Thurer, ``I think the Hollywood writers, directors, and
pitch people wanted her to be trashy and powerful. . . . In this
movie, anyone trashy is good and anyone buttoned-up is bad. . . .
They played with your stereotypes. But in the end, a trashy,
powerful woman is also a cliche. . . . It goes against middle-class
sensibilities and good taste. . . . I would want Erin on the couch
to find out what she was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Blocker was incredulous that a twice-divorced mother of three
young children who is living in a roach-infested house with no
savings or marketable job skills would continuously risk her
paycheck by flashing her bra and cursing at her colleagues. ``Most
of us would lose our jobs,'' says Blocker.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, dragging her kids along on company business also
made no sense, says Thurer. ``It's using your children to justify
your humanity. She's saying, `I have three kids. I'm a good
character.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you couldn't be sexy and be a mom. Demi Moore,
who posed on the cover of Vanity Fair nude and pregnant, changed
all that.''
</P>
<P>
   The film, which is set in the desert town of Hinkley, Calif.,
certainly seems a long way from the realities of a city like
Boston. Would Brockovich _ sporting a miniskirt _ have been
successful here? ``Someone watching `Ally McBeal' would say she'd
do great,'' says Blocker, who typically wears casual clothing to
work such as sweaters, skirts, jeans and boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yesterday, I was walking by Park Street station and I saw
a woman (in a very short skirt) with her whole leg exposed. She
looked successful. I wanted to say, `Is your skirt caught in your
hose?' I assume she met (her job's) dress code. Still, it was
shocking. That skirt didn't come mid-thigh.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Thurer, ``At the university, some of the girls dress quite
sexy. They are clad in . . . tight black pants, fitted shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an element in high fashion that's straight from the
trailer park . . . Nowadays, street culture influences high
culture. It's not just in fashion but in art and music, too. If you
look at modern art, the source might be graffiti. In fashion, it
could be a ripped sweatshirt or a baseball cap.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, sexy dressing isn't always shunned by society.
Consider the popularity of singers like Jennifer Lopez, who
attended the Grammy Awards last month wearing a Versace scarf-dress
with a neckline that plunged to her navel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is being normalized,'' says Blocker, shaking her
head. The Dorchester native, who spends about 20 hours a week
helping area teenagers write articles for the Teen Voices on-line
edition, says many teenagers today admire and accept provocative
attire. ``They say it's fashionable. The feeling is, if you've got
the figure, then you go, girl. It's a feminist's dilemma.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Thurer, a Bethpage, N. Y., native who calls herself a
first-generation feminist, remembers a time in the '60s, when ``you
couldn't be a feminist and be attractive. You couldn't shave your
legs or wear lipstick. I got my engagement ring, and I wouldn't
wear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when it wasn't cool to pursue materialism.
You were supposed to join the Peace Corps . . . To be a feminist,
you had to be a drone. I support Erin's right to dress as she
wants. My patients do that. It doesn't mean they're bad or good. In
real life, there are good people with bad taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Thurer dresses the way she wants. A typical work
outfit for her is a faux leopard-print furry short skirt, black
sweater and black boots. ``I like funky clothes. You can sort of
get away with it in the academic world. You don't have to dress in
a gray flannel, buttoned-down way. I have a zebra-print belt, a
bracelet made of dominoes, and a million things with exposed
zippers and seams. I would never wear Talbots or L.L. Bean. I would
think I was dead. That's so non-expressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurer concedes there was a time when she did submit to office
dress codes. ``If you're low on the totem pole, you have to
conform.'' What about Brockovich? ``I think what the director
wanted you to think was she derived power from this. She could get
people to look at her. It doesn't particularly offend me. It's not
my taste. It did her as much harm as good. She couldn't get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madonna, Dolly Parton, and Courtney Love all did this. Madonna
exposed her boobs and now she's a mother. But she portrays herself
as master of her soul. If you're powerful enough, you can do
whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause at the dinner table and suddenly Brockovich
doesn't seem so offensive after all.
</P>
<P>
   Blocker recalls how the movie's protagonist emotionally
described her tenure as Miss Wichita long ago. ``She said she was
going to work to end world hunger. She never gets around to it.
Then she grasps rather tenaciously this opportunity to make a
difference in people's lives'' with a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be a woman. You get paid less . . . Often, we're
just looking for a way to shine. It goes beyond money. Often times,
we just want to get out there and start'' changing the world.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Blocker reveals, she plans to launch her own publishing
house for female authors one day. ``I want to fight for a cause. My
mother worked for Planned Parenthood and the YWCA. When we were
children, she taught me a lot about reproductive rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of women I know, life is about seizing an
opportunity to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Brockovich doesn't just dress provocatively; she
flaunts her sexuality to manipulate men. In one scene, for example,
her manager Ed Masry, played by Albert Finney, asks her how she
intends to retrieve hard-to-find records from the local water
regulatory board. Her response? ``They're called boobs, Ed.''
</P>
<P>
   Call it obnoxious, but Blocker says, ``A lot of us use our
femininity to get stuff. I get free bus rides.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Thurer, ``Hello! It's called charm. If you know what you're
doing, go for it. Sexual power is real. Men do it too. They use
their masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   As the meal winds down and Thurer and Blocker prepare to leave,
it's clear Brockovich has earned mixed reviews. She scored points
for her work and her convictions but not for her methods. The one
question both diners felt went unanswered in the movie was why _
with so much to lose _ did Brockovich insist on her call-girl look?
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kurland, costume designer for the movie, asked the real
Erin Brockovich the same question before he created outfits for
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply? Says Kurland, ``She likes dressing that way. She
thinks she looks good. I think she looks at herself and says, `As
long as I can do it and look good, why shouldn't I?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich does have one complaint since she saw Roberts
portraying her on screen, Kurland adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin said she never wore skirts that long. And she meant it.''

U.S. AND JAPAN FAIL TO AGREE ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEREGULATION
PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Talks between the United States and Japan over
deregulation of the telecommunications market ended here in failure
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Although negotiators had extended their discussions for one day,
they failed to reach an agreement on the magnitude and speed of
reductions in the fees that Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.
charges for access to its local network, to which 99 percent of the
phones in Japan are connected.
</P>
<P>
   Further deregulation of the telecommunications market here is
fast becoming the most contentious trade debate between the United
States and Japan since negotiators struggled over opening the
Japanese automobile market in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States contends that Japan's refusal to move more
swiftly to allow unfettered competition here imperils the future of
the Japanese economy. ``This is not the U.S. against Japan,'' said
Richard Fisher, deputy U.S. trade representative, at a press
briefing. ``This is Japan against the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Japan's resistance to further deregulating
telecommunications forced Japanese consumers and businesses to pay
high prices for telephone services and Internet access. He
contrasted the rate his daughter pays to use the Internet in the
United States _ less than $9 a month or about 900 yen _ with the
7,830 a month that one of her Japanese friends pays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should a Japanese girl be at such a disadvantage to an
American girl?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been seeking an immediate 41 percent
reduction in the fees, which eat up as much as 40 percent of the
revenue of NTT's competitors. Japan has offered to reduce rates by
22.5 percent over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Japan says that the United States' demands threaten 70,000 jobs
at NTT, the former government telephone monopoly in which the
government retains a 59.1 percent stake. Japan also argues that
sharply lowering interconnection fees would reduce service in
unprofitable areas.
</P>
<P>
   But Fisher countered by saying that while it was a government's
responsibility to worry about social issues like layoffs, opening
the market to competition would create more jobs. He noted that in
the United States in the last four years, 90,000 new jobs have been
created in the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who governs Japan?'' he asked. ``The elected people, the Diet,
the government or a monopoly?'' The Diet is Japan's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is worried that the United States will take the matter to
the World Trade Organization before the heads of the leading
industrialized nations meet in Okinawa in July. Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi considers the success of that meeting to be critical
to the success of the ruling party in parliamentary elections that
must be held by mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher played to those concerns. ``The road to Geneva begins in
Tokyo,'' he said, referring to the headquarters of the WTO. ``We'll
see what actions might be taken and we reserve all options.''

PAKISTAN'S MILITARY RULER SCHEDULES LOCAL ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ With President Clinton due to visit Pakistan
on Saturday, the country's military ruler on Thursday announced a
first step toward the gradual return of democracy _local elections
that are to begin in December.
</P>
<P>
   But full restoration of a civilian government is likely to be a
long way off.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Islamabad, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who
seized power in a coup last October, said voting for a new
three-tier system of local councils would continue through July
2001. He offered no schedule for elections after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``From here we will move forward, step by step, to provincial
and national levels, in due course of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, like many other countries, has been pushing
Musharraf for a timetable to bring Pakistan, a nation of 150
million people, back to democracy. But the general dismissed any
notion that he was responding to foreign pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am doing everything in the national interest,'' he said. ``I
don't need approval from anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did not get approval, at least not from the White House.
``It is a positive step, but what we are looking for is a road map
to national elections and a restoration of democratic rule in
Pakistan,'' said the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Since overthrowing Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Oct. 12,
Musharraf has vowed to set in place a ``real democracy,'' replacing
what he called a ``sham democracy'' that he said was dedicated more
to corruption than to good government.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, as in the past, the general sounded much like a
dedicated populist, proposing a vast system of village and district
councils and a guaranteed number of seats for women, minorities and
the poor, whom he referred to as ``workers and peasants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to empower the impoverished, the people at the
grass-roots level,'' he said, adding that the voting age would be
lowered from 21 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   These professed democratic impulses are in contrast to some of
Musharraf's recent actions. In January, he required all higher
court judges to take a loyalty oath that would bar them from
challenging army decisions. And last week he banned all political
meetings at public places, as well as strikes and processions.
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining independence in 1947, Pakistan has been a pinwheel
of alternating civilian and military governments. Musharraf's coup
came after 10 years of democracy, which in turn came after 11 years
of army control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In past months, the general has sloughed aside demands for
elections, saying there were more important tasks at hand, like
forestalling national bankruptcy and collecting unpaid bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday one of Pakistan's English-language newspapers, Dawn,
reported that the government had so far recovered $291 million in
non-performing loans, a sizable sum but still only 10 percent of
the total amount in default.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf said that past elections had been corrupted by money
and that new voter rolls needed to be compiled and identity cards
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The elections ``have been manipulated and distorted,'' he said.
``No one has any faith in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has been in South Asia since Sunday night, is
scheduled to arrive in Pakistan on Saturday morning and stay about
five hours.
</P>
<P>
   A specific time frame for a complete return to democracy is
still likely to be high on the president's agenda, as will the
subject of Islamic militants who train in Pakistan and operate in
Indian-controlled Kashmir.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The 2000 Biennial at the Whitney is not, as you may
have been led to believe, another ``Sensation.'' Relieved?
Disappointed? The little pre-game flap over Hans Haacke's
``Sanitation'' may have created an impression that this biennial
would be akin to that Brooklyn exhibition or maybe to the biennial
in 1993, which was heavy on heavy-handed politics. But Haacke, it
turns out, is the only artist among nearly 100 in the show whose
work fits that bill. It is the most uncontroversial biennial in
years.
</P>
<P>
   This is not good.
</P>
<P>
   It is the expedient outcome of an administrative change that
partly explains its neutral character. When Maxwell L. Anderson
arrived as the Whitney director in July 1998, much of the museum's
staff left or was pushed out, so he had to cook up a way to put
together a biennial quickly. The solution was a team of outside
curators, spread across the country, with different perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   They met and compromised, and this is the result: a show without
a theme, no strong point of view, not much sex, no dead pigs, no
fecal matter or rotting eggs or mannequins with a penis for a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds boring, no?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it is. The show goes out of its way to be ecumenical,
independent, geographically diverse, representative of all media,
including the Internet, and different from what the New York power
brokers would do. All this is admirable. A few artists du jour,
like Vanessa Beecroft and John Currin, make the cut, but very few.
We get a group from Texas instead. Another from California. Lots of
fresh names. Honorable veterans like Luis Camnitzer and
lesser-knowns, like Rina Banerjee, who have shown at places like
the Bronx Museum of the Arts or the Queens Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   It's truer than previous biennials to what goes on across the
country, truer to the character of the American scene, where
artists come from other countries, more respectful of different
generations and multiple strategies.
</P>
<P>
   And flat, which may partly be chalked up to the quality of art
at this moment. Like life, art has its lulls. The first
three-quarters of the 20th century may have led people to believe
that a Picasso or a Matisse or a de Kooning would always be around,
but let's face it, the party has been winding down since the early
'80s and what's left are a few stalwarts, stragglers and latecomers
doing the best they can. We all want to fall in love. But these
days you've often got to squint to find someone you'd want to take
home.
</P>
<P>
   So be it. Resist the temptation simply to leave. Keep an open
mind. Check out paintings, for example. The biennial has plenty,
some inexplicable, like Vernon Fisher's scumbled abstractions and
Katherine Sherwood's works, which look like poor imitations of
Terry Winters' early pictures. Lisa Yuskavage's bimbos don't do it
for me, either. But John Currin's do, and so, mildly, do Kurt
Kauper's fictive divas, proudly outlandish in their ridiculous
outfits, and also Linda Besemer's hard-edge abstractions, which are
multicolored stripes on plastic panels draped like towels over
aluminum rods.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Huerta's deadpan heads and houses, pastel colored and
sleek, carry the flag for what seems like a cool new wave of
California painters, with a slender undertone of identity politics
added in his case. Joseph Marioni upholds the monochrome tradition
stylishly, and Richard Tuttle, as always, is a shaman with
translucent daubs of acrylic paint and plywood. It's too bad his
works hang in one of the show's crowded, mixed-up galleries,
eclecticism having led to an occasionally chaotic installation.
</P>
<P>
   That's a range to choose from. In the equally broad category
that you might call quasi-painting, the biennial has Vik Muniz's
photograph of his copy of Gericault's ``Raft of the Medusa'' in
Bosco chocolate syrup _ yes, Bosco _ which looks less distinctive
than it sounds. But William De Lottie's ``Love Letters Straight
From Your Heart, Part 1'' is something much better: several
rectangular aluminum panels wrapped in bright polka-dot and
flower-patterned cloth, the panels affixed to the ends of long
metal poles, which protrude several feet from a wall. The room is
floodlighted so that the panels cast shadows complicating the
effect. Where the poles attach to the panels they also skewer
photocopied newspaper pictures of Adolf Eichmann and Isaiah Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   De Lottie is one of the show's oddballs. I don't know precisely
what he is up to, but his work, which takes off from '60s abstract
painting, is wacky enough to be completely unforgettable, and it
suits the current trend for decorative abstraction while staying
very much on its own track.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Grigely is another example of this individualist spirit
and a newly fashionable figure who deserves the attention. He makes
an irregular colored grid from scraps of paper, Post-Its, foreign
bills and claim-check stubs on which he and his friends have
scribbled notes to each other. Grigely is deaf. This is how he
communicates. The result twists a kind of anonymous modernism into
a personal, almost voyeuristic art.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Yukinori Yanagi, who has shown at the Queens Museum,
reimagines Jasper Johns's modernist classic ``Three Flags'' in the
form of an ant farm. Anarchic humor piles onto irony. The work will
deteriorate as the ants dig through it _ which, considering the
flags, may have political meaning to Yanagi but doesn't spoil his
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Yanagi's flags aren't paintings or sculptures precisely.
Sculpture, strictly speaking, is the weakest of the traditional
media in the Biennial, which reflects sculpture's general state
these days. Two exceptions: Sarah Sze gets the prize for sheer
industry with her spiral Tinkertoy of lights, mirrors, potted
plants and several thousand other little things, and Josiah
McElheny's gorgeous colored glass vases exemplify straightforward,
unapologetic high craftsmanship. A made-up story by McElheny goes
with the vases, about their being 1950s designs derived from
dresses by Christian Dior, which is a pointless Conceptual conceit
except that the curvaceous shapes do convey two of the essential
ingredients of haute couture, sex and style.
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Wodiczko and Cai Guo-Qiang, in different ways, also
fall into a gap between Conceptual Art and sculpture. They deserve
special mention. Cai, who is one of the most interesting artists
around, is selling feng shui lions in a Buddhist grotto beside the
museum lobby. (You'll see.) And Wodiczko, whose usual locale is
outdoors, more or less survives inside the museum, displaying a
bizarre video device with voice-activated pictures. It is worn like
a backpack to strike up conversations with strangers on the street.
The strangers respond either to the person or to the device.
Suffice it to say that the gizmo, which only sort of works, slyly
functions as a metaphor for the comic inadequacy of casual
communication.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A few things in the show seem merely dutiful or reflexive or
dumb. Thornton Dial is an overrated folk artist. Chris Verene's
photographs of middle-aged men photographing teenage girls are
pornography pretending to be social commentary, and they're no
excuse for him to have been pulled from virtual obscurity. John
Coplans' photographs of himself have become simply unbearable. And
someday I may grasp the attraction of Louise Lawler's pictures of
art installations, but I'm still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Dawoud Bey, whose best photographs are in black and white and
earlier than the overly romantic ones of young men he shows here,
deserves to be in some biennial, so he's a different matter. So is
Robert Gober, who rehashes old territory with several beeswax legs
and enamel sinks. A few of the legs, along with a reproduction of a
piece of wood draped over one of them, are soft and droopy, like
overripe brie, recalling, in an interesting way, Dali's famous
symbolism for the mortification of the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Having demonstrated modern surreal illusionism to a new
generation, Gober also comes to mind at Leandro Erlich's
installation in which rain falls, thunder crashes and lightning
flashes between windows in a narrow alley. Erlich, a newcomer, is
one of the show's surprises, along with Michael Joo, whose
transparent, headless Buddha and synthetic white dogs with models
of human hearts in them extend Matthew Barney's weird bodily
transformations in the direction of science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Internet art is a biennial first. Much has been made of this
fact. Unfortunately, most of the sites I visited didn't amount to
much more than scrolling texts, fuzzy pictures, remote video
cameras and interactive gimmicks. They were slow to download and
visually inert. One of these days the Internet will come up with
something good, but Mark Amerika's ``Grammatron''
(www.grammatron.com) typifies the problem: ``a thematic hybrid of
cyberspace, cabala mysticism and critical theory,'' is how the
biennial catalog describes it. It's worse: oceans of jittery photos
and disconnected phrases like ``he is him and I would be her if
only she would let me'' and ``the It transponding my feelings for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Benjamin's ``Superbad'' (www.superbad.com) is better, a
funhouse of abstract animation, visual gags and Op teasers, easy to
access, graded for different Net skills. Like most Net art, it
exploits the Web's random, helter-skelter ethos. Ken Goldberg's
``Ouija 2000'' (http://ouija.berkeley.edu) isn't bad, either, a
remote Ouija board that is a metaphor for the mystification of the
Web and the public's unquestioning faith in it.
</P>
<P>
   Net art is the upstart that video art used to be. Now video is
ubiquitous, and several videos stick out among the works in the
show. The best is Doug Aitken's (which was at the Venice Biennale),
a strange, beautiful, completely engrossing spectacle of a man
walking and dancing through an empty city at night, on multiple
screens in a sequence of spaces that make the work into a
sculptural experience.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment is Shirin Neshat's new work. Her subject, the
gap between Islamic men and women, was best expressed in a
dual-screen video of a male singer and a female singer, also in
Venice. Neshat has run out of gas here. This video opens with a man
and a woman passing in a landscape, and it fast devolves into
melodrama. It is implausibly acted and incomprehensible, like a
foreign soap opera _ or could Neshat intend this as a parody? I
doubt it. Either way it misses the mark badly.
</P>
<P>
   More successful is the video installation by Inigo
Manglano-Ovalle, who lately proffered glasses of Antarctic water at
the Bronx Museum. In ``Le Baiser/The Kiss,'' he washes the windows
of Mies van der Rohe's glass Farnsworth House. Besides illustrating
the link between architectural transparency and personal
surveillance, the work, which looks as neat and sleek as Mies'
building, sweetly honors a flawed monument. Every time
Manglano-Ovalle wipes the window with his squeegee, the squeegee
makes a sound like a big wet kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Fridge's black and white video, ``Vault Sequence,'' is
memorable in a different way: seven minutes of steam turning into
ice crystals in his kitchen freezer, the video running backward (I
think) so that the crystals, like sparklers, yield to swirling
vapor, a kind of mini-galaxy, very Zen and wry. And the effect of
Paul Pfeiffer's tiny digitally manipulated videos, one of the
basketball player Larry Johnson and the other of Tom Cruise
thrashing on a sofa, are inversely proportionate to their size.
They're worth a look, too.
</P>
<P>
   A few more: Dennis Adams' splendid video, in which he hands out
stills from a film about a girl being chased through an orphanage,
mixes suspense and humor in a way even Hitchcock might envy. Lutz
Bacher's ``Olympiad'' evokes another famous director. Bacher used
to show unlikable paintings of Vargas pinups she had commissioned.
Here she takes a hand-held camera through the empty Olympic stadium
in Berlin where Leni Riefenstahl's propaganda masterpiece was shot.
</P>
<P>
   Bacher has added glitches and flare-ups to corrupt her tape, and
a static soundtrack, making the work as crude as Riefenstahl's
``Olympiad'' was polished. It's an opaque saga that runs on but
ends up being more than historic table-turning and a riff on
another female icon (Riefenstahl this time instead of Vargas
girls), because the camera conveys the melancholy beauty of the
modern ruin of the stadium and park around it.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Kolbowski's video is also O.K. Her ``Inadequate History
of Conceptual Art'' is a work of seminostalgic Conceptualism.
Artists talk about works of Conceptual Art from the '60s and '70s.
We see their hands only, out of sync with the voices, and the
awkward, disembodied effect is touching, like watching someone
else's home movie, in addition to which the intimacy of their
descriptions of the art, even when the art is almost impossible to
visualize, makes the art world seem like a small, friendly place.
</P>
<P>
   One of the speakers in Kolbowski's video happens to be Hans
Haacke. Haacke's ``Sanitation'' barely deserves mention as art, but
in the culture wars, the quality of the work is rarely the
governing issue. Inspired by the skirmish over Chris Ofili's ``Holy
Virgin Mary'' in ``Sensation,'' at the Brooklyn Museum last year,
Haacke has concocted an installation in a darkened room.
</P>
<P>
   On the back wall he has printed statements by New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and other conservative politicians. They are
printed in Fraktur, a typeface the Nazis promoted for a while.
Three U.S. flags of decreasing size are also on the wall, arranged
again, curiously, like Johns' ``Three Flags,'' one on top of
another, the smallest flag folded on the diagonal. The sound of
marching troops comes out of a squadron of trash cans. Beside them
on the floor Haacke has laid a framed collage of newspaper
clippings about ``Sensation,'' onto which he painted a passage from
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   To hear about the work is virtually to have seen it. There's not
much to see. Isn't it remarkable how much this brouhaha parallels
the last one? A big new survey making headlines before it opens. A
media-fueled escalation. A work that, sight unseen, offends the
Anti-Defamation League on behalf of Jews instead of a group of
Roman Catholics. The artist claiming to be shocked,  &UR; shocked &LR;  by
the reaction. The museum, after public hand-wringing, declaring
that it will defend the right to free speech, damn the
consequences, knowing perfectly well that this is the kind of art
this artist does and that the consequence of all the publicity will
be to help the box office.
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder why much of the public is so cynical about
contemporary art?
</P>
<P>
   A little credit. Haacke has been an influential figure for 30
years (he did ant farms early on), and his best work mixes
investigative journalism, wordplay and theater. It can be funny and
annoying to the conservatives and businesses he aims to annoy. His
worst work is platitudinous. ``Sanitation'' must be the worst thing
he has ever done. It demeans the public's intelligence, never mind
that the Anti-Defamation League says it demeans the Holocaust. Nazi
comparisons are almost automatically far-fetched, and while it is a
stretch for anyone to assert that using Fraktur and the sounds of
jackboots cheapens the memory of people killed by the Nazis, it is
hardly more unbelievable than comparing the mayor to Hitler, which
passes for political insight in certain art circles these days. Too
bad Haacke was not being ironic, because then his installation
might at least have been a good joke about New York cocktail party
blather.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the mayor is suddenly made to seem virtuous for doing
nothing. He should thank Haacke. And if he has not already, he
should thank the league for turning an attack on him into a slight
of Holocaust victims, still an unthinkable taboo even for a
contemporary artist.

&HT;     STATE WEIGHS RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY CARE PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ California lawmakers are struggling with ways to
address the shrinking number of emergency rooms in the state,
chronic overcrowding and specialists who are refusing to be on call
for complex cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unmitigated disaster,'' said state Sen. Jackie Speier,
D-Daly City, who co-chaired a Senate hearing Wednesday on emergency
medicine. ``California has lost 19 emergency rooms since 1997,
while the number of visits have increased from 8.8 million to 10
million this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors testified about lines of people on gurneys in crowded
hallways, near-death experiences for patients and the refusal of
insurers to pay a reasonable amount for services, if they pay at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Their complaints reflected what has been happening around the
state. Physicians and their practice groups have gone bankrupt,
teaching hospitals are buried in debt, and more emergency rooms are
turning away ambulances because of overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers expressed concern, but the intricacies of the
market and unpalatable decisions involving paying for and rationing
health care have left many shaking their heads in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a road map, it's so complex,'' said state Sen. John
Vasconcellos, D-Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency wards have been especially hard hit because the system
leaves them without any leverage in the marketplace, said Dan
Abbott, medical director of the emergency department at St. Jude
Hospital in Fullerton. They are required to see everyone who walks
in, including the estimated 22 percent who have no insurance, but
no one is willing to pay the tab, Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a federal mandate for care, but there is no federal
mandate for payment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Abbott said, California's insurance plan for
the poor pays the lowest amount per beneficiary of any of the 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, private managed care companies are paying as little
as 20 or 30 percent of the cost of services, Abbott said. The
California chapter of the American College of Emergency Room
Physicians cited the case of a young woman with a Tylenol overdose
whose insurance would only reimburse the doctor $20.90.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of token payments: $20.90 to treat a 10-month-old
with a seizure; $16.77 to treat a 38-year-old with a kidney stone;
and $70 to treat an 84-year-old man with a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the emergency room for a Los Angeles inner-city
hospital dropped a 6-inch stack of computer printouts on the
witness table that represented all the claims they had sent to
insurers that remained unpaid after six months. Some had been
submitted five and six times over two years.
</P>
<P>
   William Wehrle of the California Association of Health Plans
said many bills are sent to the wrong address or have errors in
them. He said it is normal for insurers to take more time to review
claims submitted for emergencies because there is typically no
prior authorization for services and no existing contract with the
treating physician.
</P>
<P>
   Wehrle sympathized with the emergency physicians, but said
health plans are being squeezed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is volunteering to pay higher health insurance
premiums,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One consequence of low physician payments is a growing rebellion
among specialists needed to treat complex emergency cases. They are
taking themselves off on-call lists.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals have been forced to pay specialists like
neurosurgeons as much as $500 per day to be on call, said Anthony
Armada, senior vice president of Northridge Hospital Medical Center
in Northridge. Furthermore, he said, the hospitals are having to
guarantee the doctors a minimum amount for their services if the
patient is indigent or doesn't pay.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, it is not always possible to convince specialists to
be listed for on-call work, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, where the University of California at San
Francisco/Mount Zion Medical Center closed its emergency room in
November, the remaining hospitals are increasingly turning away
ambulance traffic because they are overwhelmed. When three or more
hospitals go on diversion, patients in need of emergency care are
taken to the nearest hospital, which must accept them, no matter
how crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a slow-motion disaster,'' said John Brown, director of
emergency services for the San Francisco Health Department. ``When
we have our next big problem, an earthquake or flu epidemic, we
will be having preventable deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Speier said the state needs to step in and insist that a minimum
number of emergency beds are available in each community.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, has included an extra $25 million
in the latest budget to pay emergency room physicians who care for
indigent patients. A bill sponsored by state Sen. Don Perata,
D-Oakland, would penalize insurers that fail to pay on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state's got to pay it's fair share, and the HMOs have to
pay for services rendered, and the consumers are going to have to
be willing to pay for quality care,'' Speier said.

`WHATEVER IT TAKES': A THINLY VEILED `CYRANO' WITH THE PROM IN
MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you've ever taken high school French, chances are you know
the plot of ``Whatever It Takes,'' which is basically ``Cyrano de
Bergerac'' updated to the age of e-mail and two-line phones. Not
that anyone has a long, misshapen nose. Please! One character does
have an embarrassing rash on her feet, and (though we never
actually see it) hair on her back, but this information is supplied
as deserved comeuppance to a teen-age princess who thinks she's, as
it were, all that. Most everyone looks fresh-faced and appealing,
sexy but not too sexual, just like they did in high school.
Remember?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you've made it past junior high, you aren't part
of this movie's target audience in the first place. ``Whatever It
Takes,'' directed by David Raynr from a script by Mark Schwahn, is
yet another teen-ager-oriented romantic comedy showcasing the looks
and talent (mostly the former) of young television stars. It's also
the latest evidence that, when it comes to realistic, emotionally
complex renderings of adolescent life, shows like ``Freaks and
Geeks,'' even the second-rate ``Get Real,'' to say nothing of ads
for Mentos and Mountain Dew are far ahead of most theatrically
released feature films aimed at the same market.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan (Shane West) is a nerdy accordion player whose best pal is
his sensitive, Salinger-reading next door neighbor Maggie (Marla
Sokoloff). Blind to his true feelings, he pines after Ashley (Jodi
Lyn O'Keefe), the most popular girl in school, whom the camera
follows around like a lecherous assistant principal. So far, this
could be a summary of ``Snow Day.'' But to complicate matters,
Maggie is pined after by Chris (James Franco), a hunky,
narcissistic jock. With three weeks to go before the prom, Chris
and Ryan, boldly transgressing the line between the social elect
and the socially invisible, enter into a pact. Each will help the
other win his dream girl. But their plans go comically awry when
...
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. If you don't know in the first five minutes who will
end up with whom, not even summer school can help you. The
predictable plot is not itself a crime: you can guess the endings
of ``As You Like it,'' ``His Girl Friday,'' and ``Pretty in Pink''
fairly easily too. But the script's way of handling its romantic
complications is unusually obtuse and insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   As he wakes up to his true feelings for Maggie, Ryan loses his
sweetness and vulnerability and becomes as much of a creep as
Chris. This might be interesting were it within the scope of the
film' s intentions, but his sustained, gratuitous humiliation of
Ashley played entirely for laughs strikes an ugly, misogynist note.
Like Chris and Ryan, Raynr and Schwahn exploit Ashley and O'Keefe
for her sex appeal and then proceed to trash her.
</P>
<P>
   What will make ``Whatever It Takes'' watchable when it shows up
some Saturday night six months from now on cable are jokes and
situations that have nothing to do with the main characters. Aaron
Paul as Ryan's dorky loser friend provides a welcome burst of
loose, anarchic energy, and Richard Schiff has a lunatic turn as a
coach with control problems.
</P>
<P>
   There is an amusing takeoff on Tom Cruise's Bob Seger-in-briefs
lip sync from ``Risky Business,'' this time featuring an accordion,
boxer shorts, a cowboy hat and ``Play That Funky Music, White
Boy.'' There is also a crowd-pleasing safe-sex demonstration,
conducted by Ryan's mother, the school nurse (Julia Sweeney).
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the much anticipated prom is ``Titanic Dreams,''
and it inspires a slapstick finale that nearly rescues the movie
from the watery grave of its perfunctory and meretricious happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: Whatever It Takes is rated PG-13. It contains some
sexually suggestive situations and language, and brazen mockery of
one of the top-grossing films of all time.

`SUCH A LONG JOURNEY': A LIFE AS TOPSY-TURVY AS THE STREETS OF
BOMBAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gustad Noble (Roshan Seth), the hero of Sturla Gunnarsson's
``Such a Long Journey,'' is, his surname notwithstanding, a timid,
confused, decidedly ordinary man. He's a sort of Parsee Willy
Loman, putting in his time as a bank clerk, quarreling with his
eldest son, Sohrab (Vrajesh Hirjee), and daydreaming, in sepia
tones over a moody swing soundtrack, of his privileged youth and
his absent friend, the swashbuckling soldier Jimmy Bilimoria
(Naseeruddin Shah).
</P>
<P>
   To lead a decent, ordinary life is not so easy in the Bombay of
1971, with the third war with Pakistan on the horizon and the filth
and corruption of the city lapping at every doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a Long Journey,'' adapted from a novel by Rohinton
Mistry, sometimes feels as crowded as the Bombay streets on which
it was so beautifully filmed. Gustad's quiet petit bourgeois life
teems with incident and emotional complication.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to filial rebellion and rumors of war, he must
contend with his wife's resentments, his daughter's malaria, the
unpredictable behavior of his mentally ill neighbor and the
clownishness of a lecherous co-worker. On top of all this, the
shadowy Bilimoria, an agent in a covert branch of the Indian
military, has enlisted Gustad in a confusing (to him and to us)
scheme to funnel money to the Bangladeshi resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In following all this, it may help to know something about the
recent political history of the Indian subcontinent, and about the
place of the Parsee minority in Bombay society. (The Parsee are
descendants of Zoroastrians who fled from Persia to India in the
eighth century.)
</P>
<P>
   But like a good novel, ``Such a Long Journey'' imparts a great
deal of fascinating information in the course of telling its story.
It's rich in detail and character, and soaked in the atmosphere of
its time and place.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens Friday at the Sony State, is also studded
with memorable scenes and arresting performances, most notably
Seth's. His Gustad is a man who without undergoing a dramatic
transformation _ he is consistently anxious, temperamental and
mistrustful _ nonetheless manages to win our sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Soni Razdan gives a similarly complex performance as his
impatient, superstitious wife, Dilnavaz. As Bilimoria's shadowy
associate, the great Om Puri, with his granite pockmarked face,
provides a ground base of sorrowful stoicism to anchor Gustad's
antic worrying.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with ``Such a Long Journey'' is its
storytelling. There is simply too much happening, and Gunnarsson is
not very good at interweaving or subordinating plots.
</P>
<P>
   Gustad's life, which should be a tightening tangle of
complication, instead feels like one thing after another. The
emotional force that should impel us toward the eventful never
accumulates, and the result is that a film that might be
devastating and unforgettable is merely touching. &QL;

<P>
   The title of ``All I Wanna Do'' tells you nothing at all about
the movie except, by inference, that it's for and about teen-agers.
Like ``She's All That,'' ``Down to You'' and ``Whatever It Takes,''
this innocuous, intermittently charming coming-of-age comedy has
been given a name that refers to nothing at all, evokes no
particular associations and is likely to be forgotten shortly after
you leave the theater.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, the title _ the third, after the more
evocative but less marketable ``Strike'' and ``The Hairy Bird''
were scrapped _ seems especially inapt. ``All I Wanna Do,'' which
opens Friday in Manhattan, takes place in 1963 at Godard's, a
proper New England boarding school for girls. In this milieu, if
the script is to be trusted, young ladies expressed themselves
crisply and grammatically, with occasional malapropisms and
redundancies (``I loathe and abhor it'') thrown in for effect.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting this symphony of high diction is Lynn Redgrave as the
school's embattled headmistress, whose grimacing upper-crustiness
seems to have been learned from studying the accents of the
millionaire and his wife on ``Gilligan's Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Godard's is the kind of place where Odette Sinclair (Gaby
Hoffmann), newly arrived from Detroit with her horse in tow, soon
earns a reputation among her peers for daring verbal wit because
she says things like (I'm not kidding) ``up your ziggy with a
wah-wah brush.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All I Wanna Do,'' the first feature directed by Sarah
Kernochan, a screenwriter who has worked on such diverse projects
as ``9{ Weeks'' and ``Sommersby,'' mixes such prim old-fashioned
naughtiness with more consequential misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Odette, a smart, politically astute young woman, soon joins a
proto-feminist consciousness-raising group called the DAR
(Daughters of American Ravioli, in honor of the young women's
favored snack, which they consume cold, straight from the can.)
</P>
<P>
   The daughters are the usual melange of teen-age girl types: the
slut (Monica Keena), the angry rich girl (Kirsten Dunst), the
bulimic (Heather Matarazzo) and so on. They dream of becoming
magazine editors and scientists, but Odette, who has the talent to
become, in the words of one of her chums, ``a speechwriter or a
demagogue,'' aspires to be an ``ex-virgin'' instead and enlists her
pals in a conspiracy to arrange a clandestine tryst with her
boyfriend, Dennis (Matthew Lawrence).
</P>
<P>
   The '60s arrive just in time. Godard's is about to merge with a
boys' school called St. Ambrose, and a faction of the DAR mounts an
ingenious (if slightly incredible) plot to preserve the school's
identity. The film's politics seem a bit anachronistic, projecting
a 1990s feminist critique of co-education onto a time in which
ambitious young women were more likely to be agitating for
admission to institutions reserved for men.
</P>
<P>
   But in any case ``All I Wanna Do'' is more fable than history.
How else does one explain the presence of a gang of skinny, artsy
townies who seem to be hanging around waiting to be cast as extras
in the new Beck video?
</P>
<P>
   ``All I Wanna Do'' lurches between girl-power melodrama and
bratty farce, but the ungainliness is part of the film's charm.
Adolescence is an awkward time, and so were the '60s, for that
matter. It's hard not to be won over by the spirited sloppiness of
Kernochan and her cast, who gamely assay even the most stilted
period absurdities of the script. Sometimes you think you're
watching a finishing-school remake of ``Animal House,'' at others a
made-for-the-WB version of ``The Group.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film is surprisingly pleasant, thanks to smart,
unstereotyped performances _ especially by Hoffmann and Dunst _ and
the filmmaker's evident respect and affection for her characters. &QL;

$5 BILLION DISBURSEMENT SETTLED FOR WARTIME FORCED LABORERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ A long, often bitter negotiation intended to settle
once and for all Germany's financial obligations from the Nazi
years ended Thursday with an agreement on how to allocate $5
billion among surviving forced laborers and others driven to work
in Hitler's concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached after a long night of talks, provides for
the payment of $4.075 billion to the forced laborers, mainly
non-Jews from Central European countries overrun by the Nazis, and
to a much smaller number of mainly Jewish slave laborers.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that perhaps 1 million former forced laborers
will qualify to receive payments, as will about 240,000 former
slave laborers who toiled in the Nazi camps. An advertising
campaign will alert potential claimants, who are each expected to
receive an average of $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining money _ just under $1 billion _ will be divided
principally between a new German foundation intended to provide
educational programs related to the Holocaust and people who lost
property, money that was in German banks, or money owed to them by
German insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of how the money is to be shared out has been
successfully settled,'' said Otto Lambsdorff, the chief German
negotiator. The agreement came three months after an accord on a
sum of $5 billion was reached.
</P>
<P>
   Talks in recent weeks were marked by heated disagreements _
between Poland and negotiators for Jewish victims, between the
German government and all the claimants and between Central
European states. ``Frankly, people were getting very tired of the
sight of each other,'' said one person involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   After heated disagreements, the parties decided that $906
million should be paid to Poland and that the same amount should be
given to the Jewish Claims Conference. About 3 million Polish Jews
and roughly the same number of Catholic Poles were killed during
World War II, giving rise to a competitive victimhood that has
often proved acrimonious.
</P>
<P>
   Ukraine will receive $862 million, Russia $417.5 million,
Belarus $347 million, and the Czech Republic $211.5 million. A
further $400 million will be divided among other countries, and
another $25 million will be reserved for those who suffered
injuries from Nazi medical experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is late in the day, and perhaps it's little, but it's
something,'' said Israel Singer, the chief negotiator for the
Jewish Claims Conference. ``What would be welcome now would be a
German statement spelling out the moral dimension of this accord.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in a speech to the Israeli Knesset, Johannes Rau,
the German president, said: ``I ask forgiveness for what Germans
have done _ for myself and my generation, for the sake of our
children and our children's children.'' Singer suggested that the
president should append some similar statement to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But German feelings have been severely tested by the talks. What
began more than a year ago with a preemptive offer of $1.7 billion
from German firms and the government, intended in part to head off
potential suits against German companies in the United States,
often degenerated into angry haggling that led to a tripling of the
initial sum.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many companies that have invested heavily in the United States _
including DaimlerChrysler and Deutsche Bank _ were anxious for what
they called ``closure,'' an assurance that they would not face
class-action suits. At the same time, they clearly resented what
they saw as the unreasonable pressure to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   Claimants were often exasperated by the slow-moving talks and
the sometimes defiant attitude of the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has already paid more than $50 billion in reparations to
victims of Hitler since World War II, but had generally avoided
payments to compensate the millions of people put to work by the
Nazis for their labor and suffering.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. deputy treasury secretary who was
co-chairman of the talks, said the United States would put in place
measures aimed at preventing further lawsuits. A statement from
German firms involved in the fund said details of their legal
protection would be spelled out in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said it hoped
that the payments would begin before the end of the year. The
Bundestag must pass relevant legislation before payments are made.

 &HT;    `New' Pompidou perfect for contemporary arts
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 26.
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Imagine mooring an ocean liner in the Fairlie-Poplar
district, one with all the big pipes on the hull, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   That, in effect, is what architects Renzo Piano and Richard
Rogers did in 1977 with their Pompidou Center on the Right Bank of
Paris. The high-tech-looking behemoth, a multidisciplinary arts
center, dwarfed the historic buildings nearby and thumbed its nose
at their architectural traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Castigated as an affront to the dignity of this courtly city,
the painted (vivid blue, green, red and yellow) lady nevertheless
became one of Paris' most popular tourist attractions. But
accommodating 23,000 visitors a day _ half the number that fills
Turner Field _ for 20 years took a toll. When it closed in 1997 for
renovation, it needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after two years and upwards of $88 million, the Pompidou
Center is back in fine fettle. No more peeling paint. No more
cigarette butts in the crevices of its famous exterior escalator.
Best of all, the renovation has improved the place.
</P>
<P>
   Renzo Piano Building Workshop, the Genoa, Italy, firm creating a
master plan for the Woodruff Arts Center, designed the exterior and
public spaces. The spacious lobby is flanked by two mezzanines. One
houses Zed Zed, a snappy cafe done up in red velvet and chrome,
which is run by the chic restaurateur Costes, of Cafe Marly fame. A
new art bookstore is off the lobby below it; Printemps Design
Boutique is on the other side. Neon signs make finding one's way
around easier.
</P>
<P>
   There are four new theaters for dance, music, cinema and plays.
A retrospective of Piano's architectural career inaugurated space
to be devoted to design.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and fifth floors have been given over to the National
Museum of Modern Art. It reopens in retooled galleries with
revamped exhibits. The design takes better advantage of the great
view. New terraces show off the sculpture collection against the
rooftop vista.
</P>
<P>
   The galleries offer a broader perspective of modern art that
encompasses all the arts. Models of important buildings, as well as
displays of chairs and appliances, are in galleries adjacent to
their chronological analogues in painting and sculpture. There are
even a few works of outsider art: Bedecked with red and black
signs, ``Le Magasin de Ben'' (Ben's Store), for example, would be
at home in Georgia but for the French words and the signs' European
handwriting.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's take on the unfolding of modern art has a European
spin. However, mixing nationalities is de rigueur, to the point
that country of origin is not even mentioned on the labels.
Large-scale installations, by artists such as Jean Dubuffet, Josef
Beuys and contemporary American stars Tony Oursler and Mike Kelley,
literally add an extra dimension to the display.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller galleries alternating with the spacious ones are perfect
for showing drawings, sketches and photographs that need more
intimate scale. In fact, some of these displays, which often travel
on the side roads of art history, are among the most interesting.
Atelier Breton shows off French writer Andre Breton's stuff:
Curios, walking sticks, primitive art and paintings by his
surrealist friends hang in a happy jangle.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth floor is given over to temporary exhibits and a
white-tablecloth restaurant, Georges, which features a spectacular
view. It is also run by the Costes family, the Parisian equivalent
of the Buckhead Life Group. (Cafe Beaubourg on the plaza, an ``in''
haunt for artists and intellectuals, is also a Costes property;
reservations, 01-48-87-96-65.)
</P>
<P>
   You can round out your visit by touring the Brancusi Atelier, a
small building adjacent to the center built in 1997. The Renzo
Piano design makes use of the contents of the original studio _
tools, sculptures, bases _ without trying to re-create it.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget to stop by the fountain on the opposite side of
the plaza from the atelier. The perfect distillation of the
insouciant character of the Pompidou, it is the only place in Paris
where you will find a pair of voluptuous red lips spitting water
into a pool against the backdrop of a Gothic cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The Pompidou Center, on Rue St. Martin, is open
11 a.m.-10 p.m. daily except Tuesdays. Admission is $2.25-$13.50,
depending on which and how many things you visit. For program
information: www.centrepompidou.fr., or call 01-44-78-12-33.

 &HT;    Vibrant college town an age-old Spanish gem
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 26.
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALAMANCA, Spain _ This is a town time forgot to forget, a place
where you can stumble through the ages just by ... stumbling.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping down narrow streets after debating fascist politics
late into the night with a Franco-yearning bartender (his basic
argument: the trains ran on time), running a hand along sandstone
walls centuries have worn smooth or artisans have carved into the
likenesses of saints or popes or frogs or clamshells, passing
students and nuns and old couples locked arm-in-arm ... Traveling
through Salamanca like this, buzzing on its college-town ambience
and rounds of canas (draft beer), you turn a dark corner you didn't
mean to turn and suddenly you're all alone _ as removed from the
modern world as a mid-millennium monk. Just you and that empty,
walled-in street and central Spain's carbon-black sky and the
inevitable medieval cathedral, looming up ahead like a sacrament
you feel obligated to observe.
</P>
<P>
   It's at moments like these that you check your watch and wonder:
Is this the 21st century? Or the 13th?
</P>
<P>
   Then the time-traveling spell is broken: The sound of students
from the nearly 800-year-old University of Salamanca laughing their
heads off, or caroling some Spanish ditty, rolls out a cafe window
cut into one of those thick old walls. And instead of a friendly
fascist bartender (``Not fascist _ Francoist,'' Miguel, the
bartender at the wonderful La Fontana, insists), this cafe is
likely to be equipped with computers for e-mailing friends around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Salamanca does all the centuries well. Though its streets are
lined with one vintage architectural showpiece after another, it
has avoided calcifying into a for-tourists-only museum. Unlike
look-but-don't-touch vacation jewels, Salamanca remains a vital
university town of 160,000 people, even at its most historic core.
</P>
<P>
   As a tourist destination, the city _ a three-hour train ride
west of Madrid _ isn't as well-known as other midsize stopovers,
such as Toledo, Seville and Granada. But Conde Nast Traveler
recently declared Salamanca one of Europe's unknown gems, and its
widest reputation is as a haven for students and adults to spend a
summer or semester learning Spanish, at the University of Salamanca
or at a host of other language institutes in town.
</P>
<P>
   So those who know Salamanca tend to love it in a very personal
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go to Salamanca, you don't have to go anywhere else.
It's one of the best-kept secrets,'' says Daniel Stone, an Atlanta
elementary school teacher who has lived in Salamanca twice, first
to attend the university and most recently as a chaperone for
Atlanta high school students who studied there for a semester last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd recommend Salamanca to someone traveling through
Spain, Stone smiles prankishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me says no,'' he says. ``I'd like to keep it a
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamanca has drawn students and tourists for centuries. The
university, founded in 1218, is Spain's oldest, and by the 15th
century was considered one of the ``leading lights of the world''
(according to one pope), up there with learning centers in Oxford,
England; Bologna, Italy; and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the city goes back a lot further. It has been
conquered by all the greats: Hannibal (217 B.C.), the Arabs, the
Visigoths, the Muslims, Napoleon. The Roman Bridge, 2,000 years
after it was erected, still spans the gentle River Tormes.
</P>
<P>
   Salamanca today rises from the stark, bull-raising plains of
Castilla y Leon province like an ancient oasis, the domes and bell
towers of its two cathedrals visible from miles away. It's a busy,
compact town that in a bright light has a honey glow, the result of
the fine-grain sandstone used on so many of the buildings.
Intricate, almost overwhelming carvings grace many of the
buildings, in a style known as Plateresque, described in one
guidebook as ``Spain's version of Flamboyant Gothic.''
</P>
<P>
   Full of tourists, Salamanca is not annoyingly touristy; its
many, eclectic bookstores contain far more books than postcards. It
is a city where one minute you're standing inside the roaring
silence of a 12th-century church, the next you're listening to a
pizza joint's mellow piped-in remake of the Bee Gees' ``Where Is
the Love?'' The ancient and the contemporary often are virtually
the same thing here: Salamanca has been designated by UNESCO as a
World Heritage City (essentially a national monument), so building
codes allow some interiors to be modernized, as long as the
exterior is returned to its original form _ brick by brick.
</P>
<P>
   So the Casa de las Conchas (House of Shells), one of the city's
most distinctive landmarks, with scalloped shells playfully carved
over the 18th-century mansion's exterior, today is used as a
bright, modern library where you can find the latest issue of
Sports Illustrated or The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salamanca felt like home. It's comfortable,'' says Heather
Stoltenberg, an Ohio Wesleyan University junior who spent last
semester studying at the University of Salamanca. ``I loved the
Plaza Mayor, being able to sit outside and watch people stroll by
and have a (coffee) or a Coke. The culture there is so much more
relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   All roads here do seem to lead to the Plaza Mayor. It's
considered by many to be Spain's finest public plaza. A wide,
four-story, arcaded space built by the native Churriguera brothers
around 1755, the plaza sets the town's tone.
</P>
<P>
   It's an easygoing gathering place (it hosted bullfights through
the 19th century) where adults drink and eat at the outdoor cafes,
and students meet ``under the clock'' to hang among musicians and
magicians and hordes of other students. You don't need an agenda
here: Just stroll. You'll bump into a restaurant or tapas bar or
boutique (one sells Lladro, the fine Spanish porcelain many
tourists covet) for almost any taste, though the welcoming Cafe
Novelty is a good place to start.
</P>
<P>
   The plaza comes even more alive for a couple of weeks beginning
Sept. 8, when live music fills it nightly during Salamanca's
festival.
</P>
<P>
   The city's other physical and psychic anchors, the cathedrals
and the university, are within easy walking distance of the plaza.
</P>
<P>
   The two main churches are impressive, worthwhile stops, even for
the cathedral-weary. The Old and the New Cathedral look like one
building, the old leaning against the new, as one observer
described it, ``like a chick under the wing of a hen.''
</P>
<P>
   The golden stone facade of the New Cathedral (begun in 1513 and
finished in 1733) is a stare-at-forever wonder, sculpted with
religious imagery _ popes, bishops, angels _ to within an inch of
its life. Inside is a booming, almost never-ending series of
medieval chapels, altars and crypts.
</P>
<P>
   Explore this cathedral and you might never have to explore
another _ except for the Old Cathedral, which you enter through the
new one.
</P>
<P>
   With your first step through the Old Cathedral's door, you
instantly step back another couple hundred years. Started in 1150,
it has a simpler, more burnished feel than its neighboring upstart.
The bright religious art makes it seem as much gallery as
cathedral; the breathtaking main altarpiece is made up of 53 panels
depicting the life of Christ and the Virgin, painted in colorful
tempura.
</P>
<P>
   The university is two blocks away. While no longer ranked with
the world's great schools, it still gives the city a distinctly
hallowed flavor.
</P>
<P>
   When you walk through the halls, you walk in the footsteps of
Columbus, who came here to consult the school's then-famed
astrology (yes, astrology) faculty, before his journey to India _
er, America.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its famous facade _ it puts the plater in plateresque,
with ornate carvings of kings, popes, gods, goddesses and a famous
frog, which brings good luck if you can spot it _ lies the austere
lecture room of Friar Luis de Leon. It remains as it was four
centuries ago, when in 1573 de Leon was arrested there and jailed
during the Inquisition (among his crimes: preferring the Hebrew
version of the Bible to the Latin).
</P>
<P>
   He returned famously five years later, striding back into the
classroom and beginning his lecture to rapt students, ``As I was
saying yesterday ...''
</P>
<P>
   Salamanca has always done all the centuries well.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: All major domestic and international carriers

 &HT;    Don't miss Swiss city rich in art, museums
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 26.

<P>
   BASEL, Switzerland _ Clang. Creak. Clang. Creak.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear the art of the Museum Jean Tinguely before you see
it. The source of all that noise is a fountain set in the green
expanse in front of the garden entrance. The Swiss artist's Rube
Goldbergesque contraption grinds its gears for no other reason than
to delight viewers with its whimsy.
</P>
<P>
   The airy Tinguely museum _ where the assemblages of machinery,
cow skulls and musical instruments look like giant toys _ is only
one of the many sources of appeal for art lovers in this town of
200,000 in northwest Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Its Kunstmuseum, which Basel claims is the oldest public art
institution in the world, is known for its holdings of Holbein and
other northern masters, and the city has several venues devoted to
contemporary art and architecture. Only 20 minutes out is the
Fondation Beyeler, a must-see collection of modern art ensconced in
a serene building designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, who is
creating the master plan for the Woodruff Arts Center.
</P>
<P>
   Basel is also a great spot to take in sights just over the
close-by French and German borders. Vitra, a furniture
manufacturer, has commissioned a group of buildings by
international architects for its German headquarters in Weil am
Rhein, a half-hour away. Le Corbusier's dramatic pilgrimage
cathedral in Ronchamp, France, is about 80 miles from Basel.
</P>
<P>
   But Basel's offerings are hardly limited to fine art. Even
though you can walk from one end of the historic city center to the
other in a morning, this tidy town along the Rhine River is home to
30 museums on just about anything that might pique your interest.
Fire engines. Antiques. Medicine. Teddy bears. You can find it
here, in a picturesque setting that looks like something out of the
Brothers Grimm.
</P>
<P>
   Basel's history is as a center of learning and culture. It is
home to the oldest university in Switzerland, founded in 1460, and
to the country's first musical theater. Humanist scholar Erasmus is
buried in its cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost imagine him walking the winding, hilly streets of
the densely woven old town. Packed with charming buildings in brick
and stucco that are often enhanced by wide shutters and flower
boxes, it wears its history with pride. Wandering around is
certainly part of the fun. The red stone Rathaus (Town Hall),
decorated with frescoes, is the jewel of Market Square. The
12th-century Munster, the largest cathedral, rises along the Rhine.
Goldsmiths work in their shop windows so you can stand and watch
them maneuver their tiny precision tools.
</P>
<P>
   The comfortable scale of city and the broad reach of
institutions make Basel a good destination for families. Also
helpful, at least some of the labels in most museums are translated
into English.
</P>
<P>
   Here is just a sampling of its cultural amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Basel Paper Mill
</P>
<P>
   Basel, a center of knowledge in medieval times, was also a
capital of book publishing and its related industries. The water
wheel still churns in the canal outside the half-timbered mill,
dating from 1478, powering the paper-making going on within. In
what might be one of the most delightful experiences of your stay,
you can follow the process that turns rags into paper (they are
literally beaten to a pulp) and even make some yourself.
</P>
<P>
   As a man (who seems to be straight out of central casting's
medieval artisans division) stirs a vat of boiling rags with a
wooden spoon on the ground floor, a craftsman upstairs makes tiny
letters from molten metal. You can set these letters yourself on
the next floor of the narrow building and run the whole concoction
through a press. Among several other displays is a section on
book-binding.
</P>
<P>
   Fondation Beyeler
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of your trip will be a visit to this 3-year-old
museum, which displays the splendid collection of Basel art dealer
Ernst Beyeler and his wife, Hildy. Beyeler's impeccable eye is
evident in the choice examples he acquired of classic modern
masters Monet, Picasso, Matisse, Miro, Giacometti _ and ensuing
generations from Andy Warhol to Anselm Kiefer. The museum
intersperses European art with examples of the tribal arts that
were a source of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The one-story stone and glass museum is a treat in itself.
Architect Piano, whom the High Museum wants to design its expansion
(partly on the basis of this building), has created an elegant but
understated environment for the art, enhanced by a roof that lets
in natural light. Nestled in the countryside, it offers views of
gardens and rolling hills. The Beyeler, which has a restaurant in
an adjacent building, an old villa, is an easy 20-minute tram ride
from Basel.
</P>
<P>
   Historical Museum
</P>
<P>
   Housed in a deconsecrated 14th-century church, the museum, whose
collection started in the 16th century, chronicles the history of
Basel dating to the Celts. The medieval armor and ornamented swords
in the military displays will grab the kids. Dress uniforms make
peacocks out of soldiers. Richly paneled medieval and Renaissance
guild rooms, featuring stained glass, ceramic stoves and heavy
furniture, suggest the lifestyles of the periods.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Jean Tinguely
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Swiss architect Mario Botta, this museum offers an
in-depth look at the late Swiss sculptor and experimental artist,
who died in 1991 at age 66. Known for his imaginative merging of
junk sculpture and kinetics, he's a sort of mechanized
Rauschenberg. Tinguely is more complicated than he first appears.
Death is a frequent subject, and some of the works take a macabre
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, his work is great fun. Witness the delight of the children
making their own art on a replica of his drawing machine, which
requires inserting the crayon into a holder, turning on the machine
and watching it doodle.
</P>
<P>
   More telling are the otherwise dignified adults stomping on
floor buttons to make, say, a mechanized hammer pound like Woody
Woodpecker on the head of a toy doll.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss Museum of World Culture
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has no equivalent facility devoted to the study of man
around the world, and this one, which owns one of Europe's finest
ethnographic collections, is fascinating. Life-size tableaux
display, often quite dramatically, cultural artifacts from places
such as Oceania and Africa. Besides the traditional ceremonial
objects, such as masks and weapons, the museum presents a sense of
everyday life. The interior of one African hut even includes a
late-model fridge bearing a Coke magnet.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which occupies a high-ceilinged old building it
shares with the Museum of Natural History, owns an exhaustive
collection of textiles. Costumes on display during my visit spanned
the globe, from embroidered leatherwear of Eastern Europe to
gorgeous Japanese kimonos.
</P>
<P>
   Museum of Natural History
</P>
<P>
   Lions and tigers and bears, oh my! Kids will enjoy this array of
taxidermied animals (also insects) set in small displays suggesting
natural habitats. Considering that the delight in dinosaurs will
never be extinct, the room devoted to their remains will definitely
be a draw. Be sure to see _ and how could you miss? _ the
multihorned triceratops.
</P>
<P>
   Doll's House Museum
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of bears, the teddy variety is present in abundance in
this delightful little museum ensconced in a newly renovated
department store. Take a kid for cover if you want, but you'll find
plenty of childless adults openly enjoying the displays of dolls,
toys and year-round Christmas items. Best of all are myriad
miniature vignettes, which re-create their subjects in startling
detail. The 19th-century bakery, for example, is represented down
to the currants on a bun. Don't tell your kid, but these displays _
which encompass various aspects of daily life, including a
hospital, a bridal shop and an amusement park, replete with moving
parts _ are actually history in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   Vitra Design Museum
</P>
<P>
   This manufacturer of high-design furniture has created the
appropriate manufacturing compound by commissioning stellar
international architects, three of them Pritzker Prize winners, to
design its buildings 10 miles across the German border. Portuguese
architect Alvaro Siza designed a factory building. Japanese star
Tadao Ando turned a conference center into a series of spare
meditative spaces. Frank Gehry, in a commission before his
celebrated design of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in northern
Spain, made a museum of cubes and sweeping forms in 1989. Vitra's
collection of modern chairs originally installed in the Gehry
building, is housed in the garage of the former firehouse, all
sharp diagonals and cantilevered planes by deconstructivist Zaha
Hadid.
</P>
<P>
   Take a Swiss or German taxi to reach Vitra, in the city of Weil
am Rhein. Bring your passport. You'll need to book a tour to see
all the buildings on the campus other than the public museum.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Swissair, Air France and British Airways fly to
Basel. Sale fares on midweek departures are $436 for travel through
April 6; $488 April 7-30; and $528 May 1-June 15. Saturday night
stay required. (Regular fare is $959 for midweek departures through
May 27.)
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lodging: The city of museums is also a city of hotels. Der
Teufelhof is both. In two adjacent mansions housing two
restaurants, two theaters and a bar as well as guest rooms, the
hotel offers eight rooms that are decorated by different artists
(changing every two years). Also available: 25 bright modern rooms
with original art. For more information, call 61/261 10 10, or send
a fax to 61/261 10 04.

 &HT;    Where warbirds go to fly again
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 26.
 &HT;    By J. Edwin Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ For almost every day of every week during the
past 29 years, Tom Reilly has taken ``living history'' to a higher
altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, the founder and owner of the Flying Tigers Warbird
Restoration Museum, a few minutes up the road from Disney World,
specializes in amusements for big boys and girls. Reilly makes the
past come alive _ obtaining, for the most part, the wreckage of
World War II airplanes, then rebuilding them from top to bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it takes to put them back into original condition and
make them fly once again, we do it,'' Reilly says as he leads a
visitor through his 19,000-square-foot hangar in which restored
relics are parked wing to wing. Some of the older, lighter aircraft
are hanging from the ceiling, held aloft by support cables.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of this tour is that Reilly and the rest of the
museum's guides have actually flown these planes or helped restore
them. Because there is no time limit on these tours, guides are
eager to answer any and all questions, and expound at length on the
various aircrafts' strengths and weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's technicians are working on a P-51 Mustang, the wreckage
of which was found on a hillside in Minsk, Russia. Within a year,
Reilly says, the warbird will be flying once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's the fascination with not only this project, but all
the others,'' Reilly says. ``They're heavy and fat, drip oil and
smell bad. But darned if I haven't fallen in love with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The old warbirds have had that effect on others also. On this
day, two visitors approach Reilly as he works on an aircraft
engine. Fascinated, they humor him when he asks them to hand him a
wrench. Next thing they know, they are up to their elbows in
``bomber blood'' (aviation-speak for hydraulic oil), spending the
better part of a half-hour learning the intricacies of a Cyclone
nine-cylinder radial, air-cooled engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They loved it,'' Reilly says. ``Not only did they get to see
history in the making, they also got to touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   What visitors to this vast complex get to see, smell and touch
is the history of flight, everything from 1920s biplanes to Cold
War-era jets, with plenty of WWII warbirds in between. On permanent
display is a B-25 Mitchell bomber, the plane Jimmy Doolittle's
pilots flew en route to their famous ``30 seconds over Tokyo''
bombing run against Japan in the early days of the war. Movie buffs
will also recognize the two B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, the focal
point of ``12 O'Clock High,'' starring Gregory Peck.
</P>
<P>
   Less-recognizable aircraft, at least to the untrained eyes of
the aviation-impaired, include Corsairs and Warhawks, Stearmans and
Ryans, Magisters and Starfighters.
</P>
<P>
   Tour guides will give you an aeronautical primer, pointing out,
for example, that the two-seat Ryan trainer you're looking at was
manufactured by the same company that built The Spirit of St. Louis
for Charles Lindbergh. The 1943 two-seat Stearman also is a biplane
of distinction: According to the plane's flight records, it was
flown by former President George Bush. And the yellow-and-green
camouflage 1955 Fouga Magister, recently obtained from Israel, was
used in ground-attack combat during the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of the World War II aircraft come and go,'' says
Reilly, 57. ``We restore them for clients, then put them on public
display until the clients are ready to take possession of them.
It's an ongoing, never-ending process. For every project we
complete, another two come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly and his technicians have restored 27 warbirds in the past
29 years, and a 28th is almost ready to roll out the door and take
to the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``In essence,'' he says, ``what we do is restore rich toys for
rich boys and girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage toys, to be exact _ 57-year-old combat aircraft with
colorful names and heroic bloodlines: Thunderbolts, Liberators,
Lightnings, Texans and Mustangs.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring these relics takes at least two years and can cost as
much as $2.5 million _ a bargain, according to aviation experts.
After all, Corsairs, Warhawks and Mitchell bombers no longer roll
off wartime assembly lines. Of the more than 11,000 Mitchell
bombers manufactured during the war, for example, only 38 exist
today _ nine of which were restored by Reilly's crew. And, as is
the case with most antiques, values have escalated in the past 30
years. The fully restored Mitchell bomber that could be purchased
in 1979 for $6,000 today costs $500,000. In 1979, a Mustang _ the
plane Chuck Yeager flew in combat years before breaking the sound
barrier _ was worth $30,000. Today it is valued in excess of $1
million. That Flying Fortress that cost $30,000 in 1979 now sells
for $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly began this venture in 1970, the year the soft-spoken,
unassuming New Jersey native settled in the Orlando area, after
purchasing five pre-WWII fixed-gear planes in Canada. Selling four
of them to other aviation enthusiasts, he decided to restore the
other for himself. In short order, his hobby became a passion,
which eventually turned into a very lucrative business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing you know, I've got more planes than I know what to
do with,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That problem was solved in 1988, when he purchased the hangar
complex at Kissimmee Airport. It wasn't long before WWII pilots
started showing up with their family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when we started calling this place a museum and
charging admission,'' Reilly says. ``Of course, it's not like most
museums in that we encourage people to touch whatever they like.
Our philosophy from the start was that everyone should be in touch
with history. Everything's just sort of blossomed from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly has traveled the world over _ Bolivia, Greece, Greenland,
Germany and France _ in search of planes and parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Accumulate enough parts and pretty soon you've got enough to
rebuild a warbird,'' he says. ``I've got haystacks of parts. That's
why, while some people like to call this place a working museum,
others call it a fairy tale land for junk collectors.''
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ At 6,000 feet, my left hand was on the stick
of the 1944 model AT-6 Texan, my right making sure once again that
the emergency release of my parachute was still where it should be.
I listened via headphones to the instructions of Jay Vandersluis,
the veteran pilot who sat in the rear seat of the Marine Corps
two-seat trainer, as we zipped along at 230 mph.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a part of Warbird Adventures, operated alongside Tom
Reilly's warbird museum by owner Graham Meise and his top gun, Thom
Richard. For a nominal cost, these pilots will take you aloft, test
out the strength of your stomach with a few barrel rolls and loops,
then turn over the controls to you _ even if you're not a licensed
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. If you run into trouble, your instructor can
immediately regain control of the craft with an identical set of
controls aft.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, you've got the appearance of control. And it
doesn't take long to gain a true appreciation for precision, and
for the craftsmanship of the mechanics and technicians far below in
the hangar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you ready for some fun?'' Vandersluis asks. And before my
mind can rationalize the question, the aviator drops the Texan's
left wing, and the deep-blue panorama of open sky slides away,
replaced moments later by the tiny checkerboard of distant earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we call a wing-over,'' Vandersluis says. ``It's
one of the basic defensive entry-level maneuvers for aerobatics.
Now it's your turn. Level off ... uh-huh, now you've got it. Slow
it down ... good, keep it at 80 mph, right rudder ... yeah, that's
it. Way to go. Now we'll do a loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has life gone by with such dizzying clarity. Wing-overs to
the left, wing-overs to the right at 80 and 90 mph, followed by
loops at 180 mph. Then Vandersluis' all-time favorite: the Cuban 8,
a loop followed by a roll-out to the left and then another loop.
</P>
<P>
   Once we've leveled out and turned back toward the airport, he
asks, ``So what did you think of that? Sort of gives you a greater
appreciation for those pilots of yesterday, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   I was speechless. Awed. Subdued by the ride of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Our touchdown on the airport's runway minutes later was the
perfect culmination of a historical day _ first seeing and touching
aviation history in the warbird museum, then tasting it as never
before at 6,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: Prices start at $140 for front-seat flying for 15
minutes to an hour. Extra packages include aerobatics, in-flight
video and in-flight 35mm still pictures. Instruction is also
offered in 5- and 10-hour courses ($2,500-$4,750), depending on
your experience as a pilot; aerobatics and tailwheel training; and
formation training. 1-800-386-1593.

`WAKING THE DEAD': THE GHOSTS OF IDEALISM AND AN OBSESSIVE LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keith Gordon's painfully earnest screen adaptation of Scott
Spencer's novel ``Waking the Dead'' grasps at a fusion of
historicism and heartbreak that we normally expect to find in
sprawling Hollywood epics, not in interior psychological dramas
like Spencer's novel. But in falling short of its goal, the movie
raises the question of whether it's possible to film an intelligent
tear-jerker that prompts us to think and cry at the same time. Or
are serious suds and serious ideas a cinematic oxymoron? At its
best, ``Waking the Dead'' suggests an intellectually upscale answer
to ``Love Story.'' At its weakest, it comes off as a stiff, muted
exercise in countercultural nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as though ``Waking the Dead'' flaunts an advanced
degree in political science. But the movie, which resurrects a
shopworn but still useful debate about joining the system to change
it from within versus working from outside to bring it down is
certainly thoughtful by Hollywood standards. In framing the debate
as a quarrel between an aspiring Kennedy-like politician and his
radical activist girlfriend in the 1970s (and taking her side more
than his), the movie makes an honorable attempt to enshrine the
impassioned idealism of an era that has faded into ``Forrest Gump''
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking the Dead'' is also a more politically sophisticated
rewrite of Spencer's most famous novel, ``Endless Love'' (whose
screen adaptation by Franco Zeffirelli flattened a tale of crazy
erotic obsession into smoochy teen-age kitsch). Each book focuses
on an obsessive love affair whose demise leaves its male
protagonist suffering psychotic tremors.
</P>
<P>
   The brokenhearted hero of ``Waking the Dead'' is Fielding Pierce
(Billy Crudup), a working-class golden boy who ascends from Coast
Guard officer through Harvard Law School into the rough-and-tumble
of Chicago politics. His true love, Sarah Williams (Jennifer
Connelly), is a beautiful, headstrong idealist who on their first
date lightly announces, ``I want a life of unbelievable adventure
and profligacy and at the last possible moment ... sainthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah makes good on that pronouncement. She travels to Chile
under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church to help feed the
poor and organize resistance to the oppressive right-wing
government. Shortly after returning to the United States in 1974,
she is murdered in a car bombing in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding never gets over it. Although he moves on with his life
and runs for Congress under the tutelage of Isaac Green (Hal
Holbrook), a hard-boiled Chicago power broker, and conveniently
becomes engaged to Isaac's niece Juliet (Molly Parker), he is
increasingly haunted by the past. As his first congressional race
heats up, his obsession with Sarah escalates to the point where he
begins catching glimpses of her on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, he begins entertaining serious doubts about her
death and wonders if somehow she escaped the car bombing and for
mysterious reasons has remained in hiding. Ultimately, his
obsession puts his political career, his forthcoming marriage and
his sanity in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing ``Waking the Dead'' to the screen, Gordon, whose
previous movies ``A Midnight Clear'' and ``Mother Night'' (from
Kurt Vonnegut) exuded the same aura of heavy-duty seriousness, has
captured his protagonist's romanticism but little of his
self-destructive craziness. The movie has its rapturous moments,
but its emotions never spill over familiar romantic bounds into the
realm of the scary. As hard as ``Waking the Dead'' works to make us
wonder if Sarah is really still alive, the movie refuses to follow
its protagonist over the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the disappointment of ``Waking the Dead'' has to do with
its central performance. Crudup is a creditable actor who puts a
great deal of craft into his performance, but (it may be a trick of
the camera) there is no light in his eyes, and for that reason,
here, as in earlier movies, he seems strangely unknowable. That
absence of a gleam translates into a diminished charisma that is
further undermined by Robert Dillon's screenplay, which gives
Fielding too little of substance to say, especially when he is on
the political stump. Crudup is much stronger in moments of
emotional stress, especially in a scene near the end in which his
tightly wound composure suddenly cracks.
</P>
<P>
   As Sarah, Connelly captures a burning ethereality and
willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Crudup
connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness
of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious
fervor.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie makes a terrible mistake by continually and
abruptly cutting back and forth between the '70s and the early
'80s. The movie is forever stumbling over itself and breaking its
own spell. At exactly the moment it begins to draw us in to one of
its stories, it makes another leap, and the mood is broken. Because
it barely distinguishes between the two decades, the flashbacks
have none of the resonance of treasured memories.
</P>
<P>
   The movie still has some aching moments, but they come mostly
from a soundtrack that makes haunting use of Joni Mitchell's ``Case
of You,'' Peter Gabriel's ``Mercy Street'' and Lori Carson's wisp
of a ballad ``Snow Come Down,'' which wafts over the final credits.
If the ghosts that the rest of the movie wants to conjure never
come into focus, in these beautifully chosen musical moments, you
can hear their sad, eerie call.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``Waking the Dead is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations
and some strong language.

&HT;     LONE VOTE, HIS OWN, COSTS TEXAS POLITICIAN HIS SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It took only one vote to unseat Edwards County
Commissioner James Epperson.
</P>
<P>
   His own.
</P>
<P>
   Epperson faced no opposition in the March 14 Republican primary
in his bid for a second term. Unaware of the consequences, he
decided to vote in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really have any contested races in our Republican
primary, but we did in the Democratic primary, so I asked an
election judge if I was allowed to vote Democrat without
jeopardizing my status on the Republican ballot,'' he said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer was yes, it wouldn't have any effect, so I voted.
But it did,'' Epperson said from his ranch outside the county seat
of Rocksprings, about 150 miles west of San Antonio
</P>
<P>
   The price of bad advice, Epperson learned this week, is stiff.
According to state election law, because he voted in the Democratic
primary, he cannot run for his own seat as a Republican in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well informed of the law now. I just made a stupid
mistake. That's all it boils down to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Presley Hatley, the Democratic candidate for
Precinct 3 commissioner who made Epperson's vote public, faces no
Republican opposition in November.
</P>
<P>
   State law gives the county Republican Party the right to name a
candidate to replace Epperson on the Nov. 7 general election
ballot, but Jodie Greene, the Edwards County GOP chairwoman,
declined to comment on the party's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party Chairwoman Connie Lees, however, said Greene
has told her that Hatley will likely not get a free ride in the
fall election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like a good idea. I like a race where there is a
choice,'' said Lees.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Hatley said she and her husband debated reporting
Epperson after they discovered his signature on the voter roster
for the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends with Mr. Epperson, and he's a good commissioner.
We're sorry he didn't' check it out, but politics is politics,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I talked it over, and we decided that if the
situation was reversed, Mr. Epperson would have done the same
thing. If you're running for office, and you can disqualify your
opponent, most of the time you do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatley notified the Republican and Democratic chairwomen of his
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Secretary of State's election division confirmed
Hatley's contention that Epperson had disqualified himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was just a slipup that he made. Mr. Epperson was a
friend; I don't know if he is now or not,'' said Hatley, who once
worked under Epperson as the county road superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Him being a candidate, I think, he should have checked into
the law a little more before he crossed over to vote. I hope the
friendship survives, but I imagine it will be a sore spot for some
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Politics in Edwards County, population 2,900, is a low-key
affair where partisan lines are not drawn too darkly and where most
political debate is about state or national issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one takes politics too seriously up here. This is a county
where you cross lines to vote, depending on which primary is the
most interesting,'' Lees said.

`BUDDY BOY': HE'S TWITCHY AND SHY; SHE'S ASKING FOR TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Hanlon's ``Buddy Boy'' begins with some grimy
black-and-white images of a plaster Christ suspended on a cross and
then introduces its no less tortured protagonist. Francis (Aidan
Gillen) is a shy stutterer and compulsive self-abuser who lives in
a filth-encrusted apartment in a nameless big city.
</P>
<P>
   His one human connection is Sal (Susan Tyrrell), a one-legged
alcoholic with an unconvincing wig who may or may not be Francis'
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Francis devotes his unhappy life to caring for Sal, lugging her
unconscious body back to the La-Z-Boy when she's had too much to
drink, and preparing her daily meals from the dozens of cans of
processed meat that fill the kitchen cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   But an angel has moved in across the street in the form of an
attractive Frenchwoman, Gloria (Emmanuelle Seigner), who loves to
linger in front of her picture window in various degrees of
undress. Francis studies her intently through a hole he has cut in
his wall _ an image that seems meant to evoke Anthony Perkins'
watching Janet Leigh in the room next door in ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Hitchcock's film, sexual tension leads to violence, though
``Buddy Boy'' takes a more meandering, metaphorical route. Holding
out the prospect of grace and redemption, Gloria falls improbably
in love with Francis and takes him to bed.
</P>
<P>
   But this development only seems to increase Francis' twitchy
desperation, and soon he has added hallucinations to his collection
of hysterical symptoms. He imagines seeing Gloria, an avowed
vegetarian, feeding on a secret cache of raw, red beef.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon, who both wrote and directed ``Buddy Boy,'' is working
the curious vein of the sentimental grotesque. As unattractive as
Francis may be, he has been designed as a repository for all of the
viewer's feelings of self-consciousness and self-pity; we are meant
to identify with his status as God's all-purpose, undeserving
victim, and to shed a tear for Francis and ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his victimhood is couched in such absurdly extreme,
cartoonish terms that identification is impossible. Tyrrell, a camp
icon since her boozy turn in John Huston's 1972 ``Fat City,'' plays
Sal in a spray of sloppy laughter and angry outbursts; her
character has no more of a reality component than does her
apartment, a symphony in brown and beige littered with cigarette
butts, empty bottles and half-eaten meals. Even the walls seem to
be sweating something viscous and unpleasant.
</P>
<P>
   Hidden as he is behind scraggly hair, a moon-shape birthmark and
a downcast, mumbling manner, it is almost impossible to recognize
Gillen as the swaggering sexual predator of the cult British
television series ``Queer as Folk.'' It's the kind of performance
that calls on all of an actor's technical skills and none of his
personality, whereas it's usually the opposite that's most
effective in movies.
</P>
<P>
   Seigner, who can currently be seen as a supernatural being in
``The Ninth Gate,'' has magnificent cheekbones and a look of
perpetual distraction. &QL;

CANDIDATES FIGHTING BATTLE OVER BILLS IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Democrats are pushing to include
Texas Governor George W. Bush's five-year, $483 billion tax cut
plan as part of the 2001 budget, an idea Democrats have repeatedly
criticized as ``risky'' and too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   It's not expected to pass. And that's just fine with Capitol
Hill Democrats, who don't want the Republican presidential
candidate's tax cut to become law.
</P>
<P>
   What Democrats hope to do is to embarrass Bush and his
congressional supporters. Since most Republicans are pushing a much
smaller tax cut _ in the neigborhood of $150 billion to $200
billion _ Bush's own party faithful would have to vote the idea
down.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about seeing any ground-breaking legislation passed on
Capitol Hill this year, with Congress still bitterly partisan and
mutually suspicious following the impeachment and trial of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Hill has instead become a political playground and
shadow debate stage for the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns of Vice President Al Gore and Bush have begun
meeting with their allies in Congress, making sure their respective
messages are in sync.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign manager Joe Allbaugh was wandering the halls of
Congress Wednesday morning, meeting with party leaders and the
campaign's point people, Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia and
Representative Roy Blunt of Missouri, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chatted with House Democrats Wednesday, and Gore campaign
director Tony Coelho is set to confer with Senate Democrats
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is ``mainly to keep them in the loop,'' said Coverdell
aide Linda Cox. ``We're also keeping the campaign alerted to
`bumps,' issues that pop up that they might not have been aware
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is enjoying a second honeymoon with congressional
Democrats, members say. After the impeachment debate, there was a
somewhat strained relationship between the White House and Capitol
Hill, but Democrats are now unified behind Gore and are ready to
work hard to make him president, said Representative Richard Neal,
Democrat of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the issues expected to come up in Congress this year are
central themes of the presidential campaign, and both parties are
hoping to use those debates to their respective advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Floor fights over gun control, education, tobacco control, the
environment, the budget, taxes, minimum wage and the so-called
patient's bill of rights are not expected to produce substantial
changes in the law this year. But they do allow both Democrats and
Republicans to shore up the campaign agendas of their parties'
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what's happening in Congress is going to play out on
the presidential trail,'' said Jenny Backus, a spokeswoman for th
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress takes up campaign finance legislation, for
example, Democrats will do their best to coordinate with Gore, so
the vice president can appear to be a leader on the issue, said
Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   And where issues fail, there's always politics. Representative
Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, fought the House Rules
Committee Wednesday to allow him to offer Bush's tax cut plan as an
amendment to a budget priorities bill the House is soon to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans in Congress should be given an opportunity
to vote in favor of a $1.2 trillion tax cut,'' Markey said
sardonically, referring to the 10-year cost of the Bush plan.
Markey intends to make a fuss on the House floor Thursday to force
a vote on the tax plan.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats are planning a similar political strategy and
will soon propose the Bush tax cut to the Senate Budget Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have one clear advantage _ the ability to set the
legislative calendar. Republicans can schedule debates to coincide
with a Bush annoucement, should they wish to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, plan to use well-timed news conferences
and congressional hearings as forums aimed to highlight Gore's
agenda. Wednesday, a half-dozen Latino members of Congress held a
news conference on education, an issue both Gore and Bush say is a
central theme. The members also served to remind Bush, who is
popular among Texas Hispanics, that Bush does not have a lock on
that voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are expected bring up conservative social
issues, such as bans on flag-burning and late-term abortions.
Congress has debated the issues many times and has yet to produce
compromise legislation, but the debates themselves would help Bush
appease the Christian right wing of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of things they can do,'' Meehan said. But
``there's no interest in reaching an agreement on some of these
things.''

INTERNET DELIVERER KOZMO DROPS LIQUOR FROM MENU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An instant-gratification Internet delivery company,
Kozmo.com, has abruptly withdrawn its applicaton to include liquor
on its products menu following pressure from college officials and
police.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University, Boston University, Boston College, and the
Boston Police Department raised concerns about the company's plans
to deliver everything from six-packs of beer to bottles of Dom
Perignon at no charge to its growing base of customers throughout
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is they expressed concern, and we're not
trying to rush this,'' said Will Weddleton, general manager of the
Boston branch of Kozmo.com, a free Internet service that promises
delivery of everything from CDs to Twinkies in less than an hour.
``We're delaying this process to make sure there's plenty of time
to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But university officials and police say they're not interested
in a dialogue. The bottom line for them: Kozmo.com can deliver as
much junk food as it wants, but it can't peddle alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have zero tolerance to underage drinking in this city,''
said Captain William B. Evans, commander of the police department's
Allston-Brighton Precinct, who helped organize local universities
to oppose the Boston Licensing Board's approval of a liquor license
for Kozmo.com. ``We just see this as a way of putting alcohol in
the hands of underage drinking. Who's going to be at that door to
see who's checking their IDs? We have a hard enough time now. We
don't want to open any doors. Really, it's crazy.''

<P>
   The protests against Kozmo's expansion come at a crucial time
for the New York-based upstart.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of reversing last year's losses of $26.4 million, the
company filed Wednesday to raise as much as $150 million through an
initial public sale of stock. Kozmo.com, which has more than
100,000 customers in six US cities, plans to offer its menu of
snacks, videos, and brand products such as Starbucks coffee in at
least 10 additional markets by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But the online delivery service could lose a sizable market if
officials in Boston and other cities block the company from getting
an alcohol license. Kozmo.com is seeking liquor licenses in other
cities, but has yet to win approval anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The company's local branch in Allston has another problem: The
landlord of its large warehouse on McDonald Avenue is Harvard
University. And school officials have already told Weddleton that
the company would be violating the terms of its lease if it starts
delivering alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sat down with them last week, we said we appreciated
that they had postponed their application,'' said Kevin McCluskey,
director of community relations at Harvard. ``But we said it would
be better if they withdrew it permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Kozmo officials, however, say they hope they can work out a deal
with Boston, which is home to some 100,000 college students, many
of whom are well-acquainted with the free service. The company
might ban all alcohol deliveries to college campuses, restrict beer
runs in certain zip codes, and limit the amount of alcohol and the
number of deliveries it would make to certain addresses, Weddleton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that wouldn't be enough for many local university
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would fly in the face of everything we've been working on
to control students' access to alcohol,'' said Jack Dunn, spokesman
for Boston College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made it clear we're going to oppose this,'' said Colin
Riley, spokesman for Boston University, where about 88 percent of
students are under age 21. ``We can't envision any way that this
would work.''

`HERE ON EARTH': STILL NEVER HAVING TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(jt) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Here on Earth,'' with its shameless sob story on teen loss, is
the Best Movie of 1961, lacking only the beautiful and vacant
visages of Troy Donahue and Suzanne Pleshette to make it complete.
A pair of teens finally find each other and fall in love, only to
learn _ sob _ that she's dying of cancer: It could be called ``Love
Story, Too.''
</P>
<P>
   The film is part of a genre so moribund _ suffering young lovers
kept apart by class and, inevitably, tragedy _ that the Pop artist
Roy Lichtenstein, vamping on the Young Romance comics covers of
that period (a perfect pearly tear gliding from the rosy cheek of a
heroine), sent it up before the parents of this movie's young leads
were of consenting age. John Waters, who parodied such fare in
``Hairspray,'' is bored with this brand of filmmaking by now.
</P>
<P>
   The winsome Leelee Sobieski, who looks like Helen Hunt
reincarnated as a Valkyrie, is the down-to-earth Sam, who seems to
live in a small farm town so near in spirit to Lake Woebegon, where
all the women are pleasant and all the men are good-looking, that
Garrison Keillor should get a royalty check.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Klein, who has the swagger of a spoiled young god, is the
rich boy from the other, wealthier side of the tracks. His name is
Kelley, and maybe someone thought it would be funny if the first
names of the protagonists were interchangeable _ as everything else
about them is. Oh, the townies call him Richie _ y'know, after
Richie Rich. Little do they know that behind his bored insouciance
is a poor little rich boy. Only Sam can see through him, though he,
like everyone else in the movie, is transparent.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably canny marketing to remake ``Love Story'' and other
films of its ilk for a generation who didn't grow up fighting to
change the radio station every time that picture-haunting theme
came on. ``Here on Earth'' eliminates that problem by grafting on a
clutch of alt-rock favorites, though the Foo Fighters' band leader,
Dave Grohl, probably won't be too happy at the thought of a whole
generation saying, ``I'll never be able to hear Foo Fighters
again'' after sitting through this film.
</P>
<P>
   Staring thoughtfully into the middle distance, Sobieski looks as
if she is already contemplating better scripts. There's more of a
danger for Klein and his open-faced, blank handsomeness. So far
he's been very well used in films _ particularly when his unformed,
top-of-the-world demeanor is made part of the joke, as it was in
``Election'' and ``American Pie'' _ and he's not closed off as an
actor. But in this movie, he's alternately smug and pouting. The
rest of the actors, including the always welcome Annette O'Toole,
are skilled enough to well up with tears on cue. But their efforts
fail to compensate for the film's many deficits.

   IRVING, Texas _ Mi-T-Fine Car Wash employee Jason Shields
stopped for doughnuts Monday morning and noticed three of his
co-workers ambling across a parking lot on their way to work.
Minutes later, Shields pushed open the front door of the carwash to
absorb a chilling scene: the same three co-workers sprawled in
puddles of blood, and a fired employee, Robert Wayne Harris,
blurting an equally terrifying remark. ``There's three more back
here in the office,'' Harris said, according to police affidavits.

   The Nominees' Next Life
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, two days after it will have either won or lost the
Oscar, M. Night Shyamalan's ``Sixth Sense'' will become the first
of the five best-picture nominees to land on video racks. Next will
be Michael Mann's ``Insider,'' to be released on April 11, then Sam
Mendes' ``American Beauty,'' available on May 9 (but don't expect
the DVD until fall). Warner plans Frank Darabont's ``Green Mile''
for early summer. Lasse Hallstrom's ``Cider House Rules'' is to
arrive in June or July. All but Darabont are nominees for best
director.
</P>
<P>
   April 11 is designated for ``Tumbleweeds,'' with Janet McTeer, a
nominee for best actress; April 18 for ``Boys Don't Cry,'' with
Hilary Swank, one of McTeer's competitors; April 25 for ``Music of
the Heart,'' with Meryl Streep, once again a best-actress nominee.
Spike Jonze's ``Being John Malkovich'' (he's the fifth nominee for
best director) is scheduled for May 2; ``The Straight Story,'' with
Richard Farnsworth, a nominee for best actor, for May 9; ``The End
of the Affair,'' with Julianne Moore, another best-actress nominee,
for May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Skimming other categories, one finds few nominees already on
tape and disc. But down in the documentary feature field lies a
very notable exception: ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' Wim Wenders'
acclaimed celebration of Cuban music as rendered by the
prerevolutionary old guard, which was released by Artisan in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong documentary contender, Nanette Burstein and Brett
Morgen's engrossing ``On the Ropes,'' follows three young boxers
who aspire, stumble and rise again in Brooklyn. The film will be
released on tape and DVD by Winstar on April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Burstein, 29, found her subjects at the New Bed-Stuy Boxing
Center. ``I wanted to learn how to box, actually, so I went out to
this gym because they train women,'' she said. There she found a
social environment. ``It was as much a community center as a boxing
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bed-Stuy's proprietor, chief trainer and father confessor is
Harry Keitt, a former sparring partner of Muhammad Ali. At times in
the film Keitt seems literally to pick up his three fighters _ and
himself _ and carry everybody through very tough times. His
fighters include George Walton, a smiling, soft-spoken young man
who looks and punches like a small Mike Tyson. Walton turns
professional during the film. Noel Santiago, the second fighter, is
an engaging high school boy more in need of discipline and
self-esteem than the thumpings he often gets in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The third boxer is a diminutive, ferociously resilient young
woman named Tyrene Manson. Rocked but not defeated by a dangerous
domestic situation, Manson at one point asks a judge for permission
to leave a courtroom and race to Madison Square Garden for her
Golden Gloves bout at the exact moment he is sentencing her to 4{
to 9 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said no on that occasion, but permission has been
granted for Manson, out of jail on a work-release program, to leave
the state and go to the Oscar ceremony Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW RELEASES &LR;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1965, a madcap woman named Lucille (Melanie Griffith) cuts
off her husband's head and departs for what she hopes will be an
acting career in Hollywood. In the town she has left there is an
attempt to integrate the whites-only municipal swimming pool, but
that's not of paramount interest to Lucille as she rolls west.
Trying to link her liberation to the civil rights struggle as a
similar expression of freedom, Antonio Banderas' directorial debut
is a stretch, but, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, he
manages ``capably enough to keep the film lively.''

<P>
   &UR; Marcello Mastroianni: I Remember &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``A crazy, stupid idea,'' says Mastroianni about always being
regarded as the archetypal Latin lover. Revealing an irrepressibly
comic outlook, the actor, who died at 72 in 1996, looks back on his
life and career. Yes, there were the films of Fellini and De Sica,
but he would also like to play an elderly Tarzan. Part travelogue,
part biography, part philosophical rumination on cinema and the
actor's art, Anna Maria Tato's documentary about Mastroianni, her
companion for the last 22 years of his life, ``preserves his charm,
his intellect and his splendid body of work'' (Lawrence Van
Gelder).

   -1997. Winstar. $89.99; DVD, $29.98. 199 minutes. Italian with
English subtitles. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Last Night &LR;
</P>
<P>
   We never learn the nature of the impending disaster, but tonight
is everybody's last night on earth. That could start riots and
summon macho superstars, but in Toronto people gather as if it were
New Year's Eve. With her car vandalized, Rita (Sandra Oh) is trying
to contact her husband (David Cronenberg), a gas company executive
who has spent the day leaving reassuring messages on people's
answering machines. Patrick (Don McKellar) is too despondent over a
woman's death to care very much what happens, but he reluctantly
gives Rita a ride and the two try to establish rapport by pouring
out their secrets. As it methodically links up other quirky
Canadians, McKellar's film ``offers itself as a smart,
stiff-upper-lip alternative to a movie like `Armageddon''' (Stephen
Holden).

   Dozens of the popular pocket monsters rally to one another's

all, but make him 10 times as large and 50 times as mean. Demanding
to know what his purpose is, the big cat decides he is meant to
rule the world with the help of a cloned Pokemon army in a tale
that is fun to watch at times but whose lure ``is still a secret of
the grammar school set'' (Anita Gates).

`A PORNOGRAPHIC AFFAIR': SEX OUT OF SIGHT, BUT NOT MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``A Pornographic Affair,'' one of the two movies that
open the New Directors/New Films festival at the Museum of Modern
Art in Manhattan Friday night, may shock you, but not necessarily
for the expected reasons. It concerns the relationship of two
anonymous, respectable people (Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez) who
spend each Thursday afternoon in a Paris hotel room doing something
that dare not speak its name.
</P>
<P>
   If you're anticipating the next ``Last Tango in Paris,'' think
again. ``A Pornographic Affair'' is more like ``When Harry Met
Sally'' remade as a panel discussion on the highfalutin French talk
show ``Apostrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry and Sally were best pals who discovered, almost too late,
a sexual attraction. This made their story a romantic comedy. Elle
and Lui (Her and Him), as our dutiful pornographers are known,
start out as sex partners and then fall in love, which makes ``A
Pornographic Affair'' _ well, what exactly? A movie that takes
itself, and its subject, very seriously indeed.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its earnest intellectualism, this film tells you
everything you already knew about sex but wouldn't have bothered to
ask in the first place, including that, if presented in just the
right way, it can be just as boring as anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Baye's character, finding herself single and at loose ends,
places an advertisement in an adult magazine soliciting a man
willing to fulfill a long-standing fantasy of hers. Lopez's
character _ can't they at least have silly dirty-minded pseudonyms,
like real porn stars? _ finds her request compatible with his
tastes, so they meet at a cafe, have a drink and then repair to a
hotel. We never see what happens behind the door.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will either one, in the otherwise candid postmortem
interviews, identify the special practice that binds them together.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this reticence is supposed to make our imaginations run
wild, or expose us for the crass voyeurs we are. Perhaps Elle and
Lui are playing pinochle, or doing the crossword puzzle in Le
Monde. Whatever it is, their esoteric hanky-panky never ruffles the
air of pleasant, faintly melancholy sincerity that they display on
the other side of the door.
</P>
<P>
   Only when they decide to get really crazy and have normal sexual
intercourse (which we are allowed to see, and which is tastefully
cinematic) do they discover any real, risky emotion.
</P>
<P>
   But not, in the end, all that much. ``A Pornographic Affair,''
directed by Frederic Fonteyne, posits an eroticism without heat and
discovers a romantic passion without intensity. Lui and Elle
present themselves to each other and to us entirely without
context.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to chat quite amiably in their cafe (and, for all we
know, in bed), but they never mention their jobs, their friends,
their life histories, or anything else that might make them
recognizable as people. The film operates on the premise that to
suppress such detail is to strip characters to their emotional
essence. But with so little information, it's hard to see what
would draw these people to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, it's impossible to figure out why we should be interested
in them. When the film reaches its, uh, climax, we don't feel the
vicarious longing that would make us care whether they stayed
together or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Pornographic Affair'' is too busy congratulating itself for
its restraint, good taste and edifying absence of prurience to
bother with such mundane concerns. Baye and Lopez are good-humored
and pleasant to watch, but their characters are unable to remember
how long their dalliance lasted, or how many times they did
whatever it was they were doing. Do they even recall what it was?
Clearly, this is an affair to forget. &QL;

   THOMPSON-COLUMN (Washington) _ The Directors Guild of America
made a terrible mistake when it removed the name of D.W. Griffith
from an award it gave filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Griffith was a
racist but he was one of the greatest pioneers in motion pictures,
and the removal of his name was an extreme example of political
correctness. The directors' action would be like judging the
presidencies of Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton only
by their mistakes. By ROBERT E. THOMPSON.

 &HT;    Meld of mind, machine may transform our lives
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The future has many birthplaces. Part of it is
taking shape in the cramped and cluttered laboratory of John
Chapin.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin and his team wired the brains of lab rats directly to a
computer, giving the animals an ability unknown to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   When the rats got thirsty, they would use a robotic arm to bring
them water. That kind of task has become almost second nature to
lab rats, but these particular animals did it with flair. They
operated the device with their minds alone, moving it merely by
thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people first heard about this work, I'd get e-mails
wondering whether people could use a mind-controlled robot to mow
their lawns,'' jokes Chapin, a neurobiologist. ``But my mind worked
differently. I was thinking about a robot that could bring me a
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   By physically linking a living brain to a computer and then
allowing the two to communicate, Chapin has broken down an
important barrier between the animate and inanimate worlds. In a
step that sounds like something out of science fiction, he also has
given a living mind the power to directly affect the outside world
without having to use the body in which it is housed.
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly a lone researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of scientists around the world, working quietly in
fields as varied as linguistics, biology, chaos and robotics, are
in their own ways blurring the boundaries that once separated
``wetware'' _ the living brain _ from the hardware of silicon-based
computers. At the furthest frontier, some scientists are even
building computers out of living brain cells, literally fusing
silicon with life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Their research represents a looming revolution, the next
world-changing generation in computer science. It promises to
produce computers that seem much more human and lifelike, and less
like machines. It also will transform the relationship between
human beings and computers. They won't be tools that we operate
with our hands, as we do a hammer or a car. Instead they will
become almost a part of us, intimately linked to our minds and
bodies and greatly augmenting human abilities to think and
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   At Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, for example, the
military's Alternative Control Technology Laboratory has
experimented with systems that allow pilots to ``fly by thought.''
By controlling their brain waves, human subjects at the laboratory
can steer a flight simulator left or right, up or down, a skill
that most people at the lab master in only an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Kevin Warwick, a cybernetics professor at the
University of Reading, had a computer chip surgically implanted in
his left arm two years ago. The chip communicated by radio waves
with the computer that runs Warwick's office building and in
essence made Warwick a living node in the computer's network. The
computer monitored the professor's passage into and around the
building, opening doors for him, turning on his computer as he
approached, even greeting him by name as he walked through the
front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (experience) changed my mind-set quite a bit,'' Warwick
says. ``I felt as if the computer became a part of me, and I became
a part of the computer. And I was quite comfortable with that.
There was an affinity there.''
</P>
<P>
   When the implant was removed after nine days, Warwick recalls
feeling an odd sense of disappointment at being disconnected from
the network. He is planning to repeat the experiment next year,
this time with a more sophisticated implant capable of a wider
range of communications. Among other things, he plans to use the
device to give himself a sixth sense, in addition to the five given
him by nature.
</P>
<P>
   With a computer chip in his arm, Warwick refers to himself as a
cyborg. The term was coined in the '60s by NASA scientists and has
since become a staple of science fiction novels and movies. In a
cyborg, computer hardware has become so much a part of a human
being that it creates a new species _ part machine, part human _
with impressive new powers. The title character of the movie
``RoboCop''would fit that definition, as would the Borgs in the
``Star Trek'' TV series.
</P>
<P>
   However, some theorists in computer science argue that cyborgs
are not some sci-fi fantasy and already walk among us by the
millions. They believe that a person with a cell phone and beeper
on his belt and a Palm Pilot in his hand has attained cyborg
status.
</P>
<P>
   To many others, that's still a stretch. They see their
electronic gizmos as tools, not as an integral part of themselves.
But the cyborg description will become far less strained if
researchers in the growing field of wearable computing are proven
right. They are trying to tear down the second major barrier
between human beings and their electronic assistants: the size and
weight of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first modern computer _ ENIAC, for the Electronic
Numerical Integrator and Computer _ was built in 1946 just a few
miles south of Chapin's lab in Philadelphia. ENIAC consisted of
almost 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 30 tons and took up 1,800
square feet. Since then, computers have gotten a lot smaller,
lighter and more powerful. IBM's Thinkpad laptop is 30,000 times
faster than ENIAC; at barely 6 pounds, it is also 10,000 times
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   As that trend continues, computers will become extremely
portable and powerful. Human beings won't need a computer chip
implanted in their body to experience the intimate relationship
with computers described by Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, every morning they would don a lightweight, unobtrusive
computer just as they now slip on a wristwatch or tuck a wallet in
their pocket. That computer would give them full-time wireless
access to the Internet and to other human beings equipped with
wearables, as well as to e-mail, cell phone and other services. At
no waking moment would they be disconnected. Like Warwick in his
office building, they would become individual nodes connected full
time to a vast computer network, but in this case the network would
be shared by millions of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Wearables are already used in the military and industry. Through
its high-tech Land Warrior program, the U.S. Army will equip a
platoon of soldiers with wearable systems for war-fighting
exercises this summer. It plans to deploy 34,000 units in the field
within the next few years. Businesses are buying wearables to let
employees who are out of the office or on the factory floor have
fast, easy access to a computer database or the Internet. As the
wearable product is refined through research and experience,
companies hope to eventually produce the units for sale and use as
a consumer product.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mann, a pioneer in wearable computing and a professor at
the University of Toronto, has been building and using his own
wearable computers since he was a high school student in Canada.
Like Warwick, he calls himself a cyborg. In fact, Mann says that in
the 20 years he has worn computers, he has experienced a powerful
synergy between human being and silicon, which he calls
``humanistic intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, the human being and computer become elements
of each other's feedback loop,'' Mann explains. ``They support and
extend each other and create something new.''
</P>
<P>
   If cyborgs such as Mann represent the human being augmented with
machinelike powers, they have a close counterpart in the inanimate
world _ the machine equipped with humanlike powers. That's the
third major barrier now under attack: making computers more like
people.
</P>
<P>
   To some researchers, giving computers a more human ``feel'' is a
way to make the computers friendlier and less intimidating to
users. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are
working on ``affective computing'' _ computing that uses human
emotion as a tool. If the computer senses its human user getting
exasperated or angry, for example, it might employ the same
frustration-reducing tactics that a human co-worker would use. It
might apologize or suggest that the user take a break for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, software engineers are creating humanlike characters
that are capable of interacting with human beings, asking and
answering questions, commenting on the weather, even flirting. They
are like robots, but without physical bodies. Instead of operating
in the physical world, they will live and work on the Internet,
serving as guides and hosts on commercial Web sites. The characters
are programmed to have personal histories and individual quirks,
just like human beings, and according to their creators are
``emotionally and socially intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, that illusion of humanity is still crude. Steer
the conversation away from a software creature's programming and
its artificial nature quickly becomes apparent. The irony is, it
probably doesn't matter. The human subconscious turns out to be
easily fooled by anything that seems the slightest bit human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that people relate with the computer is fundamentally
social,'' says Clifford Nass of Stanford University, who has
conducted considerable research in human-computer interaction. ``We
treat computers as if they were people. Everyone knows it's a
machine. No one thinks a computer is a person. But subconsciously
they can't help treating the computer as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Nass says even computer experts who know better fall prey to the
illusion that the computer is human. It seems that millions of
years of evolution did not equip us to distinguish between what's
human and what isn't, at least on a subconscious level. It just
wasn't a necessary skill because, until now, anything that seemed
human actually was. As a result, our subconscious is easily fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to project human thoughts and emotions onto
inanimate objects will become even more pronounced as scientists
move closer to building a computer with humanlike intelligence.
That task has long been the Holy Grail of computer science, and
many experts still believe it's unattainable, at least by
traditional means.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of that task may be hard to accept in an era when
computers are unlocking the secrets of the human genetic code and
trouncing Garry Kasparov, acclaimed as the greatest human chess
player in history. So aren't computers already smarter than human
beings?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, not even close. Although a computer can
multiply 427 by 62 far faster than any human, even the most
powerful supercomputers have a hard time with mundane tasks that
human beings perform instinctively, without struggle. The classic
example is pattern recognition, the ability to pick out an object
from a crowded visual field.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, my desk right now is very cluttered,'' explains
Joel Davis of the U.S. Office of Naval Research, based in
Arlington, Va. ``I could take this pencil here in my hand, lay it
on my desk and mix things up a bit, so that it's partially hidden
under some papers. Now, a Cray (supercomputer) couldn't find that
pencil, but my 4-year-old daughter, she could find it easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that the key to human intelligence _ the
difference between Davis' daughter and the Cray _ lies in
architecture. The human brain is a network of as many as 100
billion neurons, with any single neuron connected to as many as
10,000 other neurons, and with each connection varying in
intensity. The number of possible combinations within that tangled
neural network is immense, which makes the human mind very
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   A Cray supercomputer, on the other hand, has a far simpler
architecture. It solves a problem by a rigid step-by-step process
that precludes creativity and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So Davis and others at the frontiers of computer science are
trying to use nature as a model. That approach has many
subspecialties and many names: bioengineering, biomimicry,
biomechanics. They all assume that the way to make computers and
other machines more powerful is to make them more lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that you can make an airplane fly faster
by gluing feathers on its wings,'' Davis says. ``But I do believe
that biology can do things that we can't do yet electronically, and
that's where the answer lies.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of that approach, scientists are building artificial
neural networks and teaching them to operate as real neural
networks do in the human brain. A few scientists are even taking
that approach to its most far out and literal extension: Instead of
building computers that act like living brain cells, they are
building computers out of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ditto, a Georgia Tech researcher in neurosilicon computing,
leads a team that has built a simple adding machine out of the
neurons of a leech. In five years, he predicts, his team will have
built a much more complex machine out of living rat neurons grown
on a sheet of silicon. Such a computer might be taught to think as
living brains do.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like something out of Mary Shelley's
``Frankenstein,'' but Ditto rushes to reject the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're building something out of living body
parts,'' Ditto says. ``Well, OK, actually it is. It is a little
Frankensteiny, I admit. But we're not trying to create a new life
form that's going to go out and do evil. We just want to build a
living computer.''

 &HT;    Yearning to become one with a computer
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin Warwick wants to connect with his computer. And
he thinks that other people will want that connection as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sort of feel it in this century,'' says Warwick, a
professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading in England.
``There's a buzz about it and a willingness to accept this kind of
thing that you wouldn't have seen if people had read about it 10
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection that Warwick yearns for is physical. Sometime
next year, surgeons will implant a glass-enclosed, 1-inch computer
circuit in Warwick's upper left arm. The circuit will be tied
directly into the nerve bundle that runs from Warwick's brain into
his arm and down to his left hand. In effect, the implanted circuit
will act as a wiretap, monitoring his body's electric signals and
transmitting them wirelessly to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The new implant will be a more sophisticated version of a chip
that was implanted in Warwick's arm for nine days in 1998. Warwick
expects to keep the second implant for as long as two weeks, and he
has ambitious research plans to pursue. For example, he wants to
give himself a sixth sense: sonar, the navigational system employed
by bats, porpoises and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Warwick, 46, plans to carry a portable sonar system on his chest
and allow the system to send electric signals to the chip implanted
in his arm. The chip will in turn relay those sonar signals to
Warwick's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll feel that electronic signal in my body somewhere,
although I'm not sure how,'' he predicts. ``So when I look around
and see something in front of me, I will also be feeling the data
input from the sonar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I will train myself how to interpret that data, so
that when I have my eyes closed, people will be able to put things
in front of me and I'll be able to tell if anything is there, just
as a bat can. It will be like adding an extra sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Warwick's wife, Irena, may also be equipped with a wireless
implant, allowing the two to exchange bodily data via the Internet.
Since emotions also are expressed in electric currents in the body,
Warwick expects the implants to pick up pain, boredom, joy, sexual
arousal and other feelings and to communicate that data from one
spouse to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can change who you are and who you think you are,'' he says
of the implants. ``We will not be merely human, but something
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic implants are finding other applications, with
apparently willing human subjects. Gen-Etics, an Italian company,
offers to implant a special computer chip in the bodies of
celebrities, business people and others who might be targets of
kidnapping. When activated, the chip becomes a human version of the
Lojack system for recovery of stolen cars. The kidnap victim's
location can be pinpointed by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   According to company spokesmen, the technology was developed by
Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. They claim that more than
40 people have been equipped with the chip, although they decline
for security reasons to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers, meanwhile, are implanting special monitors
in patients who are prone to congestive heart failure. Once the
system is operational, information about the heart's performance
will be sent daily from the patient's body through the Internet to
a doctor's office, where the data will be monitored for
abnormalities. Other researchers are implanting a form of
electronic pacemaker in human brains to help treat epilepsy.
Similar brain implants also are being tested as a way to treat
severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such scenarios have raised concerns about
privacy and about the eventual use of implanted chips by
governments and others to monitor individuals. For example, law
enforcement officials could use implanted chips to monitor sexual
arousal in those previously convicted of sex crimes. Warwick
himself has warned that a direct link between brain and computer
could lead to computer control of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that concern, Warwick plans an experiment that would
give a computer temporary control over his fingers
</P>
<P>
   ``When I move my hand or finger, the implant will pick up those
electric signals and send them straight away to the computer,''
where they'll be recorded, Warwick notes. Later, he plans to see
what happens when the computer replays that recorded signal into
his central nervous system. He expects that the signal sent by the
computer will cause his hand or fingers to move involuntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we link up more and more closely with technology,'' Warwick
says, ``we will see a conflict between those who are human and
those who have become superhuman. Some of us will have extra
senses, a superior ability to communicate, access to far greater
processing power, the ability to think part machine, part human.
Your power will come with being a node in a computer network,
rather than the individual that we are.''

 &HT;    Wired rodents trek where no man has gone before
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The creation of robotic devices controlled directly by
the brain raises all kinds of science-fiction possibilities. But
John Chapin, a pioneer in such research, has a more practical goal
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin and his team hope someday to give paralyzed human beings
a mind-controlled device that they can use to feed and tend
themselves. In research at MCP Hahnemann University in
Philadelphia, they already have given rats the ability to move a
robotic arm with their minds, and in June, Chapin will begin a new
round of research at the Downstate Health Science Center in
Brooklyn, N.Y. This time, he hopes to give monkeys mind control
over more sophisticated robotic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Similar research is taking place at several other universities
around the country, and Chapin says that success in human beings
may be only a decade or so away.
</P>
<P>
   At Emory University in Atlanta, for example, Dr. Philip Kennedy
and his team have connected computers directly to the brains of
three human patients who were completely paralyzed by stroke,
accident or disease and unable to speak. Through electrodes
implanted in their skulls, the ``locked-in'' patients have used
brain signals to move a cursor on a computer screen, spelling out
words and communicating once again.
</P>
<P>
   The project is considered so promising by the National
Institutes of Health that Kennedy recently received a $1 million
NIH grant to expand the program to serve six more paralyzed
patients. ``Communications is just the beginning; eventually we
hope to help paralyzed patients or quadriplegics regain control of
a limb,'' Kennedy says. ``People are really making a lot of
progress in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching humans how to use their minds in a different way is
difficult but relatively straightforward. But rats posed a daunting
challenge: How do you teach animals to perform a task with their
minds? The process Chapin designed was ingenious in its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Six rats were trained in a standard lab task. To get a reward of
water, they had to push down a lever.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers installed 24 wires _ each about the width of a human
hair _ into the part of the rat's brain that controlled movement in
its right front paw.
</P>
<P>
   A computer then monitored the rat's brain activity every time it
reached out to push the lever. Over time, the computer established
a pattern; every time a rat pushed the lever, certain neurons in
its brain would fire in a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with that brain pattern decoded, Chapin disconnected
the lever and gave control to the computer. Whenever the computer
detected the unique brain pattern indicating that a rat was about
to push the lever, it would deliver water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the first time we switched over to computer control,''
Chapin says, pointing to a video playing in slow motion on a
television screen. ``You can see here the rat is starting to push
the lever down, but the robotic arm has already gotten the message
and is delivering the water. And look ...''
</P>
<P>
   Chapin backs up the video and freezes it on one frame. The rat
has started to reach for the lever, but the computer, monitoring
its brain signal, has anticipated the rat's wishes. The robotic arm
is already bringing water to the rat, and the rat's eyes have
widened noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say that's a look of surprise,'' Chapin says
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   The rats had a surprise of their own for Chapin. Some of them
quickly ceased trying to operate the robotic arm physically,
contenting themselves with operating the mechanism by brain power
alone. They would simply think about moving the arm, and the arm
would bring them water.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I had never expected,'' Chapin says.
</P>
<P>
   That preference for brain control over physical control
apparently translates across species. For example, researchers at
the U.S. Air Force's Alternative Control Technology Laboratory in
Ohio would not have been surprised by Chapin's discovery. Gloria
Calhoun, an engineering research psychologist at the lab, is a
veteran of a special flight simulator that allows human beings to
``fly'' with their brain waves alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt more natural than using the joystick,'' Calhoun
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like driving a car. You think about turning the car, and
it turns. You don't really think about how you do it. But using
your brain is easier and more fun, too, because you're physically
more relaxed. Your hands and arms are free to do whatever you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chapin's work with rats, the Air Force's ``fly by
thought'' research does not require electrodes implanted in the
brain. It monitors brain waves with sensors placed on the pilot's
skull.
</P>
<P>
   However, the work is still a long way from making its way into
the cockpit, Calhoun says. While the mind control approach has been
proved feasible, the program has been put on the shelf until an
application can be found. Even then, mind control would probably be
used to operate secondary functions in a jet, such as instrument
panels, instead of primary functions such as steering or weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a direct electronic connection between brains and
computers clearly raises suspicion in many people. In an article
for the British Broadcasting Corp., Kevin Warwick of the University
of Reading in England warned that ``if Chapin's experiment shows us
anything, it is that the remote control of humans is eminently
possible.'' Warwick, a cybernetics professor who has done his own
groundbreaking research in the field, argues that if the brain can
send an order directly to a computer, the reverse is true as well:
A computer can send an order directly to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin downplays that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while you get people who fantasize about
getting an Internet connection directly to the brain,'' Chapin
says. ``I do think that to a certain extent, you can send thoughts
or concepts out of the brain. That's largely what we've
accomplished here. But when you get to putting a thought or a
concept from the Internet into your brain, I think you're getting
into a very, very difficult thing. A thought is spread all around
the whole brain. There's no one neuron or even a column of neurons
that is that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with that. I like the fact that our brains are very,
very difficult to get in and manipulate.''

 &HT;    AIDS FIGHT SHOULD FOCUS ON PREVENTION, CONGRESSMAN SAYS
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prevention is ``dead last'' in the nation's fight
against AIDS, Rep. Tom Coburn said Thursday as he released a
congressional audit of federal HIV and AIDS programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must ask ourselves, why are we failing to halt or even slow
down this epidemic?'' said the Oklahoma Republican, who asked the
General Accounting Office to find whether racial, gender and
geographic funding disparities existed within the Ryan White CARE
Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is obvious,'' Coburn continued. ``Our prevention
strategy has failed. It has failed primarily because it has ignored
successful interventions that have historically been utilized to
curtail other contagious diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Congress and the executive branch must strengthen laws
to require HIV-positive people to notify their partners that they
are infected. ``We also must empower individuals to make the right
choices rather than enabling them to engage in activities that are
guaranteed to put them at risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any epidemic, the most important thing is to prevent the
next person from being infected,'' Coburn said at a Capitol Hill
news conference. ``Until we develop an effective HIV prevention
system, we are going to continue to increase the dollars needed
each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $10 billion meted out by the government last year for
AIDS spending, less than 10 percent was used for HIV prevention,
Coburn said. He said more money needs to be spent on prevention
because 40,000 HIV infections occur each year, a number that has
remained steady over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report examined three federal programs that fund
prevention, health care and other assistance for HIV and AIDS
victims: the Ryan White Care Act, grants from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and grants by the Housing
Opportunities for Persons Living with AIDS (HOPWA) program.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that Ryan White Care Act was serving blacks,
Hispanics and women in higher proportions than their share of the
AIDS population. The act funds health clinics treating low-income
AIDS patients and to train people caring for HIV-infected
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   However, the audit also cited a recent national study showing
that blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to receive
appropriate medical attention and drug treatment for the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that the CDC funds supported a wide range of
state and local HIV prevention activities. It said that two-thirds
of the HOPWA funds were used for housing assistance for AIDS and
HIV victims.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that while the vast majority of people with AIDS
live in urban areas, the number of cases is growing in rural areas.
Treatment funds under the Care Act are reaching rural victims in
proportion to the number of victims living in those areas, it
found.
</P>
<P>
   But Coburn said rural HIV and AIDS victims are being
shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the built-in funding disparities, those living with
HIV and AIDS in rural America have limited medical and social
services and oftentimes may have to travel to urban areas to
receive proper care,'' said Coburn, a practicing physician who has
treated AIDS patients.

 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Boxing and Hollywood have been happy sparring partners for more
than half a century.
 &HT;    In fact, movieland's relationship with pugilism has been long
and fruitful. More than 400 movies have focused on ``the sweet
science'' of fisticuffs, many of them now classics.
 &HT;    And still Hollywood can't seem to get enough. After a down
period for most of the 1990s, these days boxing movies are back in
force.
 &HT;    Last year's ``The Hurricane,'' based on the story of real-life
contender Ruben ``Hurricane'' Carter and his struggle against
unjust imprisonment, drew its share of uppercuts for its
still-in-dispute accuracy. But few challenged the title performance
by Denzel Washington, who has been nominated for an Oscar as Best
Actor for his efforts.
 &HT;    In January, ``Play It to the Bone'' cast Woody Harrelson and
Antonio Banderas as a couple of bush-league fighters who somehow
get a chance at a big-time payday. Although generally well
reviewed, the film had only a short theatrical life and is headed
for the video-store shelves.
 &HT;    Boxing is again at center ring in ``Price of Glory,'' which will
open March 31. Starring former ``NYPD Blue'' mainstay Jimmy Smits,
this one differs from past fight movies in focusing on a Hispanic
family of pugilists.
 &HT;    Smits plays Arturo Ortega, a former fighter who never made it to
the top. Instead, he pours his passion for the ring into his three
sons, obsessively shaping them into fighting machines in a quest
for the title he wasn't able to win himself.
 &HT;    Written by Phil Berger, former boxing writer for The New York
Times and author of biographies of Joe Frazier, Larry Holmes and
Mike Tyson, ``Price of Glory'' began as a play that was never
produced. Its story line derives from Berger's experience covering
boxing, however, and he claims that it's closely grounded in
reality.
 &HT;    ``The tale of a fighter who tries valiantly, with mixed results,
to micromanage his sons' future careers is all too familiar,''
Berger says. ``It happened when former heavyweight champion Joe
Frazier tried without success to turn his son Marvis into a mirror
image of himself.''
 &HT;    Current super-featherweight champion Floyd Mayweather is
embroiled in a dispute with his manager/trainer/father, Berger
adds, and the antagonism between light-heavyweight champion Roy
Jones Jr. and his manager/father reached dangerous proportions.
 &HT;    ``Roy began carrying a gun in fear of his father, who had gone
so far as to shoot his son's dog,'' Berger says. ``When you're
dealing with families, there's a lot of emotion invested and the
relationships are very complex.''
 &HT;    The situation may be familiar, but few boxing films have
previously featured Hispanic fighters _ a situation bound to
change, Berger says, because Latin fighters are increasingly
dominant at nearly every level of boxing.
 &HT;    ``The decision to make them Latin was made because they are the
latest line of immigrants to try to win the lottery in the fight
game,'' he says.
 &HT;    Moctesuma Esparza, producer of the $10 million ``Price of
Glory,'' hastens to add that the film isn't about Hispanic boxing
as such.
 &HT;    ``It's not so much a boxing film or a Latino movie,'' Esparza
says. ``It's an American story, like `Rocky.'''
 &HT;    Smits agrees, and argues that the movie should appeal to any
audience.
 &HT;    ``Our story has a universal theme,'' he says. ``It's about
dreams being frustrated and not being achieved. The family's name
happens to be Ortega.
 &HT;    ``How's that different from the Irish in the United States in
the 1940s, or the Rocky Graziano or Rocky Balboa stories in the
movies?'' Smits continues. ``They're all looking for the American
dream, which can be captured inside the confines of the ring.''
 &HT;    It's boxing as metaphor, Smits says, and it's been remarkably
durable.
 &HT;    ``That's why America loves boxing movies,'' he says. ``It's the
conquest, the guy grappling for a leg up. It's the immigrants'
story. And all those elements are there in our picture.''
 &HT;    Director Carlos Avila, making his movie debut, says the film is
right on the cutting edge, given how many young Hispanic fighters
are seeking to punch their way out of the ghetto these days.
 &HT;    ``The father's obsession is the most tragic,'' he says. ``He
walks a fine line. He wants to give them a future by giving them
boxing expertise _ for him it's a gift of love. So our story is the
father's journey as he finally learns to let his sons make their
own decision.''
 &HT;    Both Smits and Berger say they grew up on classic boxing
pictures such as ``Body and Soul'' (l947), with John Garfield as a
Jewish fighter whose mother wants him to get a decent job,
``Champion'' (l949), starring Kirk Douglas, and ``Somebody Up There
Likes Me'' (l956), in which a youthful Paul Newman played the
real-life Italian fighter Rocky Graziano.
 &HT;    But two more recent films provide the context for ``Price of
Glory'' and all the other recent boxing films: ``Rocky'' (l976),
written by and starring Sylvester Stallone, resurrected the genre
with its romantic, inspirational story of a Philadelphia pug who
has big dreams, while Martin Scorsese's ``Raging Bull'' (l980)
provided a grim, almost pathological look at the real-life champion
Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro).
 &HT;    And more are to come _ even now, actor/rapper Will Smith is
using his star power to try to win his dream role in a biopic
focused on the legendary Muhammad Ali.
 &HT;    That's not surprising, Smits says, since boxing movies offer
actors a chance to play dynamic characters in a naturally dramatic
context. Boxers are often seriously flawed characters, too, which
appeals to actors such as Smits, who has previously played more
than his share of too-good-to-be-true heroes, most notably in the
television series ``L.A. Law'' and ``NYPD Blue.''
 &HT;    ``It's not always about playing the knight in shining armor,''
the actor says. ``TV audiences have seen me in this idealistic
lawyer/cop genre. Ortega is more like an antihero _ he believes
what he's doing is right, and it's all for the love of his kids.''
 &HT;    In short, Smits finds in ``Price of Glory'' what actors,
directors and screenwriters have always found in the boxing ring:
pride, pain and, above all, humanity.

 &HT;    Meld of mind, machine may transform our lives
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The future has many birthplaces. Part of it is
taking shape in the cramped and cluttered laboratory of John
Chapin.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin and his team wired the brains of lab rats directly to a
computer, giving the animals an ability unknown to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   When the rats got thirsty, they would use a robotic arm to bring
them water. That kind of task has become almost second nature to
lab rats, but these particular animals did it with flair. They
operated the device with their minds alone, moving it merely by
thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people first heard about this work, I'd get e-mails
wondering whether people could use a mind-controlled robot to mow
their lawns,'' jokes Chapin, a neurobiologist. ``But my mind worked
differently. I was thinking about a robot that could bring me a
beer.''
</P>
<P>
   By physically linking a living brain to a computer and then
allowing the two to communicate, Chapin has broken down an
important barrier between the animate and inanimate worlds. In a
step that sounds like something out of science fiction, he also has
given a living mind the power to directly affect the outside world
without having to use the body in which it is housed.
</P>
<P>
   He's hardly a lone researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of scientists around the world, working quietly in
fields as varied as linguistics, biology, chaos and robotics, are
in their own ways blurring the boundaries that once separated
``wetware'' _ the living brain _ from the hardware of silicon-based
computers. At the furthest frontier, some scientists are even
building computers out of living brain cells, literally fusing
silicon with life itself.
</P>
<P>
   Their research represents a looming revolution, the next
world-changing generation in computer science. It promises to
produce computers that seem much more human and lifelike, and less
like machines. It also will transform the relationship between
human beings and computers. They won't be tools that we operate
with our hands, as we do a hammer or a car. Instead they will
become almost a part of us, intimately linked to our minds and
bodies and greatly augmenting human abilities to think and
communicate.
</P>
<P>
   At Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, for example, the
military's Alternative Control Technology Laboratory has
experimented with systems that allow pilots to ``fly by thought.''
By controlling their brain waves, human subjects at the laboratory
can steer a flight simulator left or right, up or down, a skill
that most people at the lab master in only an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In England, Kevin Warwick, a cybernetics professor at the
University of Reading, had a computer chip surgically implanted in
his left arm two years ago. The chip communicated by radio waves
with the computer that runs Warwick's office building and in
essence made Warwick a living node in the computer's network. The
computer monitored the professor's passage into and around the
building, opening doors for him, turning on his computer as he
approached, even greeting him by name as he walked through the
front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (experience) changed my mind-set quite a bit,'' Warwick
says. ``I felt as if the computer became a part of me, and I became
a part of the computer. And I was quite comfortable with that.
There was an affinity there.''
</P>
<P>
   When the implant was removed after nine days, Warwick recalls
feeling an odd sense of disappointment at being disconnected from
the network. He is planning to repeat the experiment next year,
this time with a more sophisticated implant capable of a wider
range of communications. Among other things, he plans to use the
device to give himself a sixth sense, in addition to the five given
him by nature.
</P>
<P>
   With a computer chip in his arm, Warwick refers to himself as a
cyborg. The term was coined in the '60s by NASA scientists and has
since become a staple of science fiction novels and movies. In a
cyborg, computer hardware has become so much a part of a human
being that it creates a new species _ part machine, part human _
with impressive new powers. The title character of the movie
``RoboCop''would fit that definition, as would the Borgs in the
``Star Trek'' TV series.
</P>
<P>
   However, some theorists in computer science argue that cyborgs
are not some sci-fi fantasy and already walk among us by the
millions. They believe that a person with a cell phone and beeper
on his belt and a Palm Pilot in his hand has attained cyborg
status.
</P>
<P>
   To many others, that's still a stretch. They see their
electronic gizmos as tools, not as an integral part of themselves.
But the cyborg description will become far less strained if
researchers in the growing field of wearable computing are proven
right. They are trying to tear down the second major barrier
between human beings and their electronic assistants: the size and
weight of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first modern computer _ ENIAC, for the Electronic
Numerical Integrator and Computer _ was built in 1946 just a few
miles south of Chapin's lab in Philadelphia. ENIAC consisted of
almost 18,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 30 tons and took up 1,800
square feet. Since then, computers have gotten a lot smaller,
lighter and more powerful. IBM's Thinkpad laptop is 30,000 times
faster than ENIAC; at barely 6 pounds, it is also 10,000 times
lighter.
</P>
<P>
   As that trend continues, computers will become extremely
portable and powerful. Human beings won't need a computer chip
implanted in their body to experience the intimate relationship
with computers described by Warwick.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, every morning they would don a lightweight, unobtrusive
computer just as they now slip on a wristwatch or tuck a wallet in
their pocket. That computer would give them full-time wireless
access to the Internet and to other human beings equipped with
wearables, as well as to e-mail, cell phone and other services. At
no waking moment would they be disconnected. Like Warwick in his
office building, they would become individual nodes connected full
time to a vast computer network, but in this case the network would
be shared by millions of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Wearables are already used in the military and industry. Through
its high-tech Land Warrior program, the U.S. Army will equip a
platoon of soldiers with wearable systems for war-fighting
exercises this summer. It plans to deploy 34,000 units in the field
within the next few years. Businesses are buying wearables to let
employees who are out of the office or on the factory floor have
fast, easy access to a computer database or the Internet. As the
wearable product is refined through research and experience,
companies hope to eventually produce the units for sale and use as
a consumer product.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mann, a pioneer in wearable computing and a professor at
the University of Toronto, has been building and using his own
wearable computers since he was a high school student in Canada.
Like Warwick, he calls himself a cyborg. In fact, Mann says that in
the 20 years he has worn computers, he has experienced a powerful
synergy between human being and silicon, which he calls
``humanistic intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In my experience, the human being and computer become elements
of each other's feedback loop,'' Mann explains. ``They support and
extend each other and create something new.''
</P>
<P>
   If cyborgs such as Mann represent the human being augmented with
machinelike powers, they have a close counterpart in the inanimate
world _ the machine equipped with humanlike powers. That's the
third major barrier now under attack: making computers more like
people.
</P>
<P>
   To some researchers, giving computers a more human ``feel'' is a
way to make the computers friendlier and less intimidating to
users. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology are
working on ``affective computing'' _ computing that uses human
emotion as a tool. If the computer senses its human user getting
exasperated or angry, for example, it might employ the same
frustration-reducing tactics that a human co-worker would use. It
might apologize or suggest that the user take a break for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, software engineers are creating humanlike characters
that are capable of interacting with human beings, asking and
answering questions, commenting on the weather, even flirting. They
are like robots, but without physical bodies. Instead of operating
in the physical world, they will live and work on the Internet,
serving as guides and hosts on commercial Web sites. The characters
are programmed to have personal histories and individual quirks,
just like human beings, and according to their creators are
``emotionally and socially intelligent.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, that illusion of humanity is still crude. Steer
the conversation away from a software creature's programming and
its artificial nature quickly becomes apparent. The irony is, it
probably doesn't matter. The human subconscious turns out to be
easily fooled by anything that seems the slightest bit human.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that people relate with the computer is fundamentally
social,'' says Clifford Nass of Stanford University, who has
conducted considerable research in human-computer interaction. ``We
treat computers as if they were people. Everyone knows it's a
machine. No one thinks a computer is a person. But subconsciously
they can't help treating the computer as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Nass says even computer experts who know better fall prey to the
illusion that the computer is human. It seems that millions of
years of evolution did not equip us to distinguish between what's
human and what isn't, at least on a subconscious level. It just
wasn't a necessary skill because, until now, anything that seemed
human actually was. As a result, our subconscious is easily fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The tendency to project human thoughts and emotions onto
inanimate objects will become even more pronounced as scientists
move closer to building a computer with humanlike intelligence.
That task has long been the Holy Grail of computer science, and
many experts still believe it's unattainable, at least by
traditional means.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of that task may be hard to accept in an era when
computers are unlocking the secrets of the human genetic code and
trouncing Garry Kasparov, acclaimed as the greatest human chess
player in history. So aren't computers already smarter than human
beings?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is no, not even close. Although a computer can
multiply 427 by 62 far faster than any human, even the most
powerful supercomputers have a hard time with mundane tasks that
human beings perform instinctively, without struggle. The classic
example is pattern recognition, the ability to pick out an object
from a crowded visual field.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, my desk right now is very cluttered,'' explains
Joel Davis of the U.S. Office of Naval Research, based in
Arlington, Va. ``I could take this pencil here in my hand, lay it
on my desk and mix things up a bit, so that it's partially hidden
under some papers. Now, a Cray (supercomputer) couldn't find that
pencil, but my 4-year-old daughter, she could find it easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that the key to human intelligence _ the
difference between Davis' daughter and the Cray _ lies in
architecture. The human brain is a network of as many as 100
billion neurons, with any single neuron connected to as many as
10,000 other neurons, and with each connection varying in
intensity. The number of possible combinations within that tangled
neural network is immense, which makes the human mind very
flexible.
</P>
<P>
   A Cray supercomputer, on the other hand, has a far simpler
architecture. It solves a problem by a rigid step-by-step process
that precludes creativity and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   So Davis and others at the frontiers of computer science are
trying to use nature as a model. That approach has many
subspecialties and many names: bioengineering, biomimicry,
biomechanics. They all assume that the way to make computers and
other machines more powerful is to make them more lifelike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say that you can make an airplane fly faster
by gluing feathers on its wings,'' Davis says. ``But I do believe
that biology can do things that we can't do yet electronically, and
that's where the answer lies.''
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of that approach, scientists are building artificial
neural networks and teaching them to operate as real neural
networks do in the human brain. A few scientists are even taking
that approach to its most far out and literal extension: Instead of
building computers that act like living brain cells, they are
building computers out of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ditto, a Georgia Tech researcher in neurosilicon computing,
leads a team that has built a simple adding machine out of the
neurons of a leech. In five years, he predicts, his team will have
built a much more complex machine out of living rat neurons grown
on a sheet of silicon. Such a computer might be taught to think as
living brains do.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like something out of Mary Shelley's
``Frankenstein,'' but Ditto rushes to reject the comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we're building something out of living body
parts,'' Ditto says. ``Well, OK, actually it is. It is a little
Frankensteiny, I admit. But we're not trying to create a new life
form that's going to go out and do evil. We just want to build a
living computer.''

WANNA BET? OSCAR ODDS A TANGLE OF FAME, MONEY AND BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the nominations for the 72nd annual Academy Awards were
announced in mid-February, they were generally thought to
constitute the levelest Oscar playing field in a generation _ with
four of the five best picture nominees having an equal shot at
winning.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the vast establishment of movie pundits,
analysts and soothsayers that spends six weeks every year
handicapping Hollywood's great race has dramatically changed its
tune.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is directly related to the commodity that Hollywood
holds sacred above all else: money.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entertainment Weekly, both ``The Insider'' and
``The Sixth Sense'' have virtually dropped out of the best picture
sweepstakes: ``The Insider'' because its nomination has done
nothing for its moribund box-office; ``The Sixth Sense'' because it
has continued to spin money like it's going out of style since its
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The wisdom here is that Oscar voters have no respect for a movie
that's perceived to be a flop, no matter how good it may be; and
they believe that their highest honor has no business going to a
genre picture (a horror movie at that) that's such an ongoing
audience phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miramax has spent so much money advertising ``The
Cider House Rules'' _ which won none of the earlier pre-Oscar
awards and seemed a surprise nominee in this category _ that it has
steadily moved to the front of the pack right next to ``American
Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   And since the lightweight ``The Green Mile'' has no chance, the
best-picture Oscar race now looks like a photo-finish between
``Cider House'' and ``American Beauty,'' with their studios _
Miramax and DreamWorks _ trying to outspend each other in a flood
of last-minute trade ads. (It's a repeat of their competition last
year with ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Saving Private Ryan.'')
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you're right. It's crazy _ and something of an insult to
the 6,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences who vote on this thing. Are they really so shallow that
they're influenced by such considerations? Would an intelligent
professional filmmaker not vote for what he considered the best
picture because it was a box-office disappointment? Would he vote
for one movie over another simply because he'd seen more
self-congratulatory trade ads for it?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, apparently, is yes. It's what makes the Oscars such
a poor judge of long-term motion-picture quality _ and so much
tawdry fun for office pools across the country and around the
world. And the task is not to pick what should win, but what will
win _ based on a zillion influences acting on the small band of
Southern Californians who have access to a ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Blowing off the 12 months of accumulated dust from my crystal
ball, here is how I think the vote will go:
</P>
<P>
   Best picture: ``The Insider,'' with its riveting drama and
devastating warning of the dangers of a corporate-run world, still
strikes me as the most important film of the year. But it failed to
capture the Zeitgeist of the time, and ``American Beauty'' did.
Something about this portrait of suburban angst speaks to the
collective unconsciousness in a way that defies analysis. Since
``American Beauty'' also captured the largest number of nominations
(a feat matched by 15 of the last 16 best picture winners), it is
sure to edge ahead of ``The Cider House Rules'' to become the first
non-period best picture since 1991's ``Silence of the Lambs.'' The
winner: ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Best director: Since best picture and best director invariably
match up except for once a decade or so, and since they split last
year between ``Shakespeare'' and ``Ryan's'' director Steven
Spielberg, it's not likely to happen again this soon. Especially
since ``Cider House'' director Lasse Hallstrom has been getting
less credit for the film's success than John Irving's screenplay
and his tenacity in getting the film made. And, rightly or wrongly,
the success of ``American Beauty'' is regarded as the triumph of a
directorial vision. The winner: Sam Mendes for ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Best actor: The front-runner had been Denzel Washington for
``The Hurricane.'' But that film has been getting bad buzz lately,
mainly because it has been reported that its ``true'' story was
wildly fictionalized to make its character a martyr, with all the
complexities of his character and background filtered out. So now,
except for Sean Penn's cad of a jazz musician in ``Sweet and
Lowdown'' (which London oddsmakers rate a 33-1 long shot),
Washington has competition from Kevin Spacey (``American Beauty''),
Russell Crowe (``The Insider'') and even 79-year-old Richard
Farnsworth (``The Straight Story''). I think Spacey deserves it,
but since Crowe has the most pre-award wins, and this could be the
only place to honor ``The Insider,'' he would seem to be the
stronger of the alternatives. The winner: Russell Crowe for ``The
Insider.''
</P>
<P>
   Best actress: This category is regarded as the only sure thing
in the acting races. Hilary Swank's inspired male-impersonation in
``Boy's Don't Cry'' has swept most of the important pre-awards, and
she's the only nominee that Vegas oddsmakers have rated at even
money. Still, the magical Annette Bening of ``American Beauty'' is
nine months pregnant, she's half of Hollywood's foremost power
couple, and her husband, Warren Beatty, is getting the prestigious
Irving Thalberg Award at the ceremony. So my suicidal impulse is to
believe the voters will go for a huge upset here, and make it a
banner evening for the couple. Janet McTeer of ``Tumbleweeds,''
Julianne Moore of ``The End of the Affair'' and Meryl Streep of
``Music of the Heart'' won't figure. The winner: Annette Bening for
``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Best supporting actor: If ever an actor deserved to take home
this prize, it's 11-year-old Haley Joel Osment of ``The Sixth
Sense.'' This extraordinary film works solely off the eerie
believability of his performance. Not since ``The Miracle Worker''
has a child actor been this impressive, or this crucial to the
success of a big film. But my guess is that the voters will not be
able to resist rewarding the spectacle of Hollywood's biggest star,
Tom Cruise, slumming as a supporting player in the arty
``Magnolia,'' even though he's the weakest link in the film's
ensemble and his male-chauvinist character is not a bit believable.
Michael Caine (``The Cider House Rules''), Michael Clarke Duncan
(``The Green Mile'') and Jude Law (``The Talented Mr. Ripley'')
haven't a prayer. The winner: Tom Cruise for ``Magnolia.''
</P>
<P>
   Best supporting actress: Like Osment, Chloe Sevigny of ``Boys
Don't Cry'' deserves to win in this category, simply because her
movie completely rests on the believability of her performance _
and she pulls it off. But the competition is unusually stiff from
Toni Collette (``The Sixth Sense''), Angelina Jolie (``Girl,
Interrupted''), Samantha Morton (``Sweet and Lowdown'') and
Catherine Keener (``Being John Malkovich'') playing, respectively,
a devoted mother, a mental patient, a deaf-mute and a temptress _
all Oscar-favorite roles. Still, I'm feeling optimistic. The
winner: Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the Oscar races, France's ``East-West'' is exactly
the kind of epic period love story that Oscar traditionally finds
irresistible; ``Buena Vista Social Club'' was by far the year's
highest profile and most popular documentary feature; and the
year's biggest hit, ``Star Wars _ Episode 1: the Phantom Menace,''
should pick up status for best sound, sound-effects editing and
visual effects (unless the Academy is in the mood to snub perpetual
outsider George Lucas, and gives these prizes to the
slightly-less-deserving ``The Matrix'').
</P>
<P>
   The best original screenplay award will go to ``Being John
Malkovich,'' since, whatever you may think of it, it was definitely
original, and this seems the appropriate place to honor that fact.
The best adapted screenplay and best score will likely go to ``The
Cider House Rules,'' as consolation prizes for missing best picture
and director.
</P>
<P>
   The cinematography statue will go to 73-year-old legend Conrad
L. Hall for ``American Beauty''; editing will go to that same
film's Tariq Anwar; costume design and makeup to ``Topsy-Turvy'';
art direction to ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''; and song to ``You'll
Be in My Heart'' from Disney's animated ``Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   Already confirmed for lifetime achievement awards are Poland's
master director Andrzej Wajda; and producer-director-writer-star
Beatty, from whom the assembly is expecting, if not the
announcement of a presidential candidacy, at least some profound
and possibly emotional utterance on the artistic responsibility of
their business.
</P>
<P>
   Moving things along this year on Oscar night will be host Billy
Crystal, who is regarded as the best Oscar master of ceremonies
since Johnny Carson retired. Thus, we hope the show will be a big
improvement over last year's stiff, tedious and often tasteless
affair.

 &HT;    Yearning to become one with a computer
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kevin Warwick wants to connect with his computer. And
he thinks that other people will want that connection as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sort of feel it in this century,'' says Warwick, a
professor of cybernetics at the University of Reading in England.
``There's a buzz about it and a willingness to accept this kind of
thing that you wouldn't have seen if people had read about it 10
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection that Warwick yearns for is physical. Sometime
next year, surgeons will implant a glass-enclosed, 1-inch computer
circuit in Warwick's upper left arm. The circuit will be tied
directly into the nerve bundle that runs from Warwick's brain into
his arm and down to his left hand. In effect, the implanted circuit
will act as a wiretap, monitoring his body's electric signals and
transmitting them wirelessly to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The new implant will be a more sophisticated version of a chip
that was implanted in Warwick's arm for nine days in 1998. Warwick
expects to keep the second implant for as long as two weeks, and he
has ambitious research plans to pursue. For example, he wants to
give himself a sixth sense: sonar, the navigational system employed
by bats, porpoises and submarines.
</P>
<P>
   Warwick, 46, plans to carry a portable sonar system on his chest
and allow the system to send electric signals to the chip implanted
in his arm. The chip will in turn relay those sonar signals to
Warwick's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll feel that electronic signal in my body somewhere,
although I'm not sure how,'' he predicts. ``So when I look around
and see something in front of me, I will also be feeling the data
input from the sonar system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, I will train myself how to interpret that data, so
that when I have my eyes closed, people will be able to put things
in front of me and I'll be able to tell if anything is there, just
as a bat can. It will be like adding an extra sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Warwick's wife, Irena, may also be equipped with a wireless
implant, allowing the two to exchange bodily data via the Internet.
Since emotions also are expressed in electric currents in the body,
Warwick expects the implants to pick up pain, boredom, joy, sexual
arousal and other feelings and to communicate that data from one
spouse to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can change who you are and who you think you are,'' he says
of the implants. ``We will not be merely human, but something
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic implants are finding other applications, with
apparently willing human subjects. Gen-Etics, an Italian company,
offers to implant a special computer chip in the bodies of
celebrities, business people and others who might be targets of
kidnapping. When activated, the chip becomes a human version of the
Lojack system for recovery of stolen cars. The kidnap victim's
location can be pinpointed by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   According to company spokesmen, the technology was developed by
Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. They claim that more than
40 people have been equipped with the chip, although they decline
for security reasons to identify them.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers, meanwhile, are implanting special monitors
in patients who are prone to congestive heart failure. Once the
system is operational, information about the heart's performance
will be sent daily from the patient's body through the Internet to
a doctor's office, where the data will be monitored for
abnormalities. Other researchers are implanting a form of
electronic pacemaker in human brains to help treat epilepsy.
Similar brain implants also are being tested as a way to treat
severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, such scenarios have raised concerns about
privacy and about the eventual use of implanted chips by
governments and others to monitor individuals. For example, law
enforcement officials could use implanted chips to monitor sexual
arousal in those previously convicted of sex crimes. Warwick
himself has warned that a direct link between brain and computer
could lead to computer control of human beings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that concern, Warwick plans an experiment that would
give a computer temporary control over his fingers
</P>
<P>
   ``When I move my hand or finger, the implant will pick up those
electric signals and send them straight away to the computer,''
where they'll be recorded, Warwick notes. Later, he plans to see
what happens when the computer replays that recorded signal into
his central nervous system. He expects that the signal sent by the
computer will cause his hand or fingers to move involuntarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we link up more and more closely with technology,'' Warwick
says, ``we will see a conflict between those who are human and
those who have become superhuman. Some of us will have extra
senses, a superior ability to communicate, access to far greater
processing power, the ability to think part machine, part human.
Your power will come with being a node in a computer network,
rather than the individual that we are.''

 &HT;    Wired rodents trek where no man has gone before
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The creation of robotic devices controlled directly by
the brain raises all kinds of science-fiction possibilities. But
John Chapin, a pioneer in such research, has a more practical goal
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin and his team hope someday to give paralyzed human beings
a mind-controlled device that they can use to feed and tend
themselves. In research at MCP Hahnemann University in
Philadelphia, they already have given rats the ability to move a
robotic arm with their minds, and in June, Chapin will begin a new
round of research at the Downstate Health Science Center in
Brooklyn, N.Y. This time, he hopes to give monkeys mind control
over more sophisticated robotic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Similar research is taking place at several other universities
around the country, and Chapin says that success in human beings
may be only a decade or so away.
</P>
<P>
   At Emory University in Atlanta, for example, Dr. Philip Kennedy
and his team have connected computers directly to the brains of
three human patients who were completely paralyzed by stroke,
accident or disease and unable to speak. Through electrodes
implanted in their skulls, the ``locked-in'' patients have used
brain signals to move a cursor on a computer screen, spelling out
words and communicating once again.
</P>
<P>
   The project is considered so promising by the National
Institutes of Health that Kennedy recently received a $1 million
NIH grant to expand the program to serve six more paralyzed
patients. ``Communications is just the beginning; eventually we
hope to help paralyzed patients or quadriplegics regain control of
a limb,'' Kennedy says. ``People are really making a lot of
progress in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching humans how to use their minds in a different way is
difficult but relatively straightforward. But rats posed a daunting
challenge: How do you teach animals to perform a task with their
minds? The process Chapin designed was ingenious in its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Six rats were trained in a standard lab task. To get a reward of
water, they had to push down a lever.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers installed 24 wires _ each about the width of a human
hair _ into the part of the rat's brain that controlled movement in
its right front paw.
</P>
<P>
   A computer then monitored the rat's brain activity every time it
reached out to push the lever. Over time, the computer established
a pattern; every time a rat pushed the lever, certain neurons in
its brain would fire in a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with that brain pattern decoded, Chapin disconnected
the lever and gave control to the computer. Whenever the computer
detected the unique brain pattern indicating that a rat was about
to push the lever, it would deliver water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the first time we switched over to computer control,''
Chapin says, pointing to a video playing in slow motion on a
television screen. ``You can see here the rat is starting to push
the lever down, but the robotic arm has already gotten the message
and is delivering the water. And look ...''
</P>
<P>
   Chapin backs up the video and freezes it on one frame. The rat
has started to reach for the lever, but the computer, monitoring
its brain signal, has anticipated the rat's wishes. The robotic arm
is already bringing water to the rat, and the rat's eyes have
widened noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to say that's a look of surprise,'' Chapin says
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   The rats had a surprise of their own for Chapin. Some of them
quickly ceased trying to operate the robotic arm physically,
contenting themselves with operating the mechanism by brain power
alone. They would simply think about moving the arm, and the arm
would bring them water.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I had never expected,'' Chapin says.
</P>
<P>
   That preference for brain control over physical control
apparently translates across species. For example, researchers at
the U.S. Air Force's Alternative Control Technology Laboratory in
Ohio would not have been surprised by Chapin's discovery. Gloria
Calhoun, an engineering research psychologist at the lab, is a
veteran of a special flight simulator that allows human beings to
``fly'' with their brain waves alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt more natural than using the joystick,'' Calhoun
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like driving a car. You think about turning the car, and
it turns. You don't really think about how you do it. But using
your brain is easier and more fun, too, because you're physically
more relaxed. Your hands and arms are free to do whatever you
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Chapin's work with rats, the Air Force's ``fly by
thought'' research does not require electrodes implanted in the
brain. It monitors brain waves with sensors placed on the pilot's
skull.
</P>
<P>
   However, the work is still a long way from making its way into
the cockpit, Calhoun says. While the mind control approach has been
proved feasible, the program has been put on the shelf until an
application can be found. Even then, mind control would probably be
used to operate secondary functions in a jet, such as instrument
panels, instead of primary functions such as steering or weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a direct electronic connection between brains and
computers clearly raises suspicion in many people. In an article
for the British Broadcasting Corp., Kevin Warwick of the University
of Reading in England warned that ``if Chapin's experiment shows us
anything, it is that the remote control of humans is eminently
possible.'' Warwick, a cybernetics professor who has done his own
groundbreaking research in the field, argues that if the brain can
send an order directly to a computer, the reverse is true as well:
A computer can send an order directly to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Chapin downplays that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while you get people who fantasize about
getting an Internet connection directly to the brain,'' Chapin
says. ``I do think that to a certain extent, you can send thoughts
or concepts out of the brain. That's largely what we've
accomplished here. But when you get to putting a thought or a
concept from the Internet into your brain, I think you're getting
into a very, very difficult thing. A thought is spread all around
the whole brain. There's no one neuron or even a column of neurons
that is that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with that. I like the fact that our brains are very,
very difficult to get in and manipulate.''

   COMPUTERS THAT WILL TRANSFORM OUR LIVES/A four-part series
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of scientists around the world are working quietly in
fields as varied as linguistics, biology, chaos and robotics and in
their own ways are blurring the boundaries that once separated
``wetware'' _ the living brain _ from the hardware of silicon-based
computers. Their research represents a looming revolution, the next
world-changing generation in computer science. Computers of the
future will become almost a part of us, intimately linked to our
minds and bodies and greatly augmenting human abilities to think
and communicate. Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Jay
Bookman explores the evolution of these new computers in a
four-part series. Here is an outline of the series. Each part will

   COMPUTERS THAT WILL TRANSFORM OUR LIVES/A four-part series

   Thousands of scientists around the world are working quietly in
fields as varied as linguistics, biology, chaos and robotics and in
their own ways are blurring the boundaries that once separated
``wetware'' _ the living brain _ from the hardware of silicon-based
computers. Their research represents a looming revolution, the next
world-changing generation in computer science. Computers of the
future will become almost a part of us, intimately linked to our
minds and bodies and greatly augmenting human abilities to think
and communicate. Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Jay
Bookman explores the evolution of these new computers in a
four-part series. Here is an outline of the series. Each part will
move in the Business and Lifestyle wires. If you have questions or

NOW, `VOYAGER': LEVAR BURTON STEPS BACK BEHIND THE CAMERA

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of LeVar Burton
in a scene from ``Star Trek: Insurrection.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    The universe can be a strange place so far as coincidence is
concerned.
 &HT;    Just ask LeVar Burton, who returns to the ``Star Trek: Voyager''
director's chair with the April 26 episode ``Live Fast and
Prosper.''
 &HT;    ``Robin Burger, who wrote the episode, used to be my next-door
neighbor,'' Burton says, laughing. ``That's a fun fact to know and
tell.
 &HT;    ``Also, one of the actors in the episode is named Guinan,'' says
Burton, whose close pal Whoopi Goldberg played the sage barkeep
Guinan on ``Star Trek: The Next Generation.'' ``It's not the first
time that I worked with Francis Guinan _ in `Ex Post Facto,' which
was the very first `Voyager' I directed, Francis played (Minister
Kray), one of the bird people.
 &HT;    ``The synchronicities abound, don't they?''
 &HT;    Synchronicity aside, ``Live Fast and Prosper'' finds three wily
and conniving aliens (Kaitlin Hopkins, Greg Daniel and Guinan)
impersonating Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Tuvok (Tim Russ) and
Chakotay (Robert Beltran) in order to sell phony Federation
memberships to other species in the Alpha Quadrant. When the
impostors' actions engender tremendous ill will among those
deceived, Janeway and company race to correct the situation.
 &HT;    ``The challenge on this one was finding the humor and walking
that fine line between having the humor come out of the situation
and the characters, and having it be setup-setup-joke,'' Burton
says by telephone from his Los Angeles home. ``I wanted to find a
way to explore and exploit the humorous aspects of the situation
without it going over the top.
 &HT;    ``It was also an opportunity to cast really terrific guest
stars,'' he adds. ``We were lucky to get Kaitlin Hopkins, who is
Shirley Knight's daughter and a star in her own right. She has
spent most of her career on Broadway, and she is just a terrific
talent.
 &HT;    ``It was a fun one to do,'' Burton says. ``Plus that crew _ I've
known most of these people for 11 or 12 years. Directing `Voyager'
is always like going home for me.
 &HT;    ``I haven't actually started to edit yet,'' he says, ``but I was
extremely happy with the dailies. I think it will be an
entertaining, fun episode.''
 &HT;    On other ``Trek'' fronts, Burton has nothing newsworthy to offer
about either the fourth ``Next Generation'' feature or the
top-secret, now-in-the-works new ``Star Trek'' series.
 &HT;    He would, however, like it known that he'd happily make himself
available to direct either project.
 &HT;    ``I'd be interested in that,'' he says succinctly and playfully.
``Absolutely.''
 &HT;    That's not to say that Burton is sitting around waiting for
future ``Trek'' ventures to come together. On the contrary, he's
generating numerous enterprises of his own.
 &HT;    He directed ``Camp P,'' a pilot for MTV that centers on a boot
camp for juvenile delinquents who are one step away from prison.
He's developing ``At Water's Edge,'' a television movie for James
Earl Jones. And he intends to direct ``Trek'' veterans Whoopi
Goldberg and Alfre Woodard in a CBS presentation, ``The Watsons Go
to Birmingham.''
 &HT;    At some point, Burton _ who's currently hosting and producing
the 18th season of the PBS children's educational series, ``Reading
Rainbow'' _ also hopes to ``pull a Michael Landon'' and create a
one-hour dramatic series that he'd produce, star in and frequently
direct.
 &HT;    Most of Burton's endeavors are shaped at the offices of Eagle
Nation Films, his production company, which is based on the
Paramount Pictures lot in Hollywood. The Eagle Nation offices are a
parsec away from Goepp Circle Productions, Jonathan Frakes'
company, and it's not unusual for the mini-moguls to bump into one
another as they race to and from meetings and sound stages.
 &HT;    ``Jonathan and I run into each other all the time,'' Burton
says. ``We're pretty lucky, pretty fortunate to be doing what we're
doing.
 &HT;    ``We both work hard at being successful at what we do, at being
producers and directors as well as actors,'' he says. ``It's nice
to have that brotherly support.
 &HT;    ``Things are very nice right now, very nice.''

GENTLING THE TRENCHES IN THE MIXED-SEX ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
 (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994 the aircraft carrier Eisenhower set off on its maiden
voyage with a crew that was 10 percent female, a remarkably high
proportion and therefore a test of the armed forces' more
woman-friendly policies. ``The Eisenhower's mission was a
resounding success,'' Time magazine concluded, reflecting the
typically favorable reviews given the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Stephanie Gutmann, in her new book, ``The Kinder,
Gentler Military,'' uses the Eisenhower to illustrate her main
point: that the effort to reach ever higher levels of sexual
integration is weakening the armed forces. To Gutman, the
Eisenhower did not show that sexually integrated ships are good but
that the military's public affairs effort was a triumph of politics
over naval reality. ``We called it the `Emperor's New Clothes'
cruise,'' John Gadzinski, a pilot temporarily seconded to public
affairs at the time, told Gutmann. ``This is a boat where our job
is to put bombs on target, missiles on target and make sure that
things get done.''
</P>
<P>
   This cruise, Gadzinski continued, was set up for appearances, so
that, for example, female sailors who worked in data processing
were sent up to the control tower and the flight deck ``to make a
pretty picture for the VIPs on their walk-throughs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann has written a highly charged polemic that rips through
public relations cant like a tank breaking telephone poles. ``The
Kinder, Gentler Military'' is not the best book one could imagine
on this important subject. A less aggressively partisan, more
neutrally reported essay might have been more persuasive, an essay
that included, for example, at least one sustained interview with a
Pentagon official seriously addressing the question of sexual
neutrality and military preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gutmann presents a largely anecdotal case, written with
a kind of jaundiced hipness (``This is one area where we absolutely
have to cleave to a certain bottom line''), that often seems aimed
at scoring debating points rather than judiciously balancing policy
alternatives. Nonetheless, Gutmann has done her research
thoroughly, and she raises questions that demand to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   The basic attitude of policy makers and the press is keyed to
three assumptions:
</P>
<P>
   _ That sexual neutrality is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   _ That it entails changing the male-dominant, sexist culture
that has prevailed until now.
</P>
<P>
   _ That this can be accomplished without reducing fighting
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann, in examining that attitude, tours boot camps and
aircraft carriers; haunts the hearing rooms of the military's
gender advisory boards; and talks to soldiers, sailors and airmen
(male and female). She comes up with a very different conclusion.
She says the country's leaders, submitting to political pressure,
have allowed military preparedness to be gravely compromised for
the sake of an unworkable sex-neutral principle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gutmann's contention that the recruitment and training of
women has led to a conscious effort to change the old warrior
culture _ the one in which the drill sergeant stuck his head into
the arriving recruits' bus and announced that he was their worst
nightmare _ is not seriously disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your father's Army anymore,'' Gen. Claudia
Kennedy, the first female three-star general in the American armed
forces, told West Point cadets in 1997. Gutmann visits Camp Jackson
in South Carolina, where 70 percent of the women going into the
Army get their training, and she agrees with General Kennedy's
assessment. But she describes Camp Jackson as a kind of Girl Scouts
for grown-ups, a place where self-esteem therapy prevails over
hard, physical tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because training regulations note that `many new soldiers are
not physically fit or capable of strenuous activity,''' she writes,
``they no longer do a required number of push-ups to a count, the
drill sergeant exercises along with them as a sort of `role model'
and they drop out when they feel like it.''.
</P>
<P>
   At the Great Lakes Naval Training Center, she finds that the old
obstacle course is now called the confidence course and has been
moved indoors. For a while, Gutmann reports, trainees got ``blues
cards'' that they could hold up to get a break in the middle of an
activity, but, while those were eliminated after being ridiculed in
the press, ``recruits can still avail themselves of something
called a `training timeout.''' ``Ability groups'' have also been
created to handle weaker trainees. The Army, Gutmann says, found
that many women could not pass the standard grenade-throwing test
of 35 meters (115 feet). So women only have to ``pick up a live
grenade and essentially dump it over the wall of a deep cement
enclosure, where it could burst to its little heart's content.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann provides a history called ``How Did We Get Here?'' in
which such highly publicized sexual scandals as the 1991 Tailhook
incident and the 1998 Aberdeen Proving Grounds rape cases play a
major role. She delves thoroughly into both incidents _ one
involving mass sexual harassment, the other sexual assault charges
against drill sergeants _ and comes up with many signs that
hysteria in the press and political panic inflamed public opinion
and turned the investigations of these incidents into witch hunts.
She suggests the distressing possibility that in the Aberdeen
incident, where a drill sergeant was sentenced to 25 years in
prison for rape, political correctness rose to the level of a
human-rights violation.
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann has so much reverence for the old warrior culture that
it becomes a vicarious nostalgia for the old days, when men were
men and things were tough. But plenty of old warriors have stories
about the stupidity and sadism of the old culture and how it drove
good men as well as good women away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gutmann is no extremist in these matters. She offers a
set of policy recommendations _ one of which would be to eliminate
sexual recruitment quotas _ that would keep the armed forces open
to any and all who meet the necessary high standards.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latest phase of the integration of women began, the
armed forces have not had to fight a long, tough war against a
strong foe. If such a war comes and the gentler military does not
do well, Gutmann's hard-headed book will have provided an
early-warning signal.

   Spring Tulips From Picasso
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the important spring and summer auctions
approaching, Sotheby's and Christie's have begun crowing about the
big-ticket works they have to offer. And with all the negative
publicity from the continuing federal antitrust investigation into
their practices, both companies are more determined than ever to
put out the word that business is going on as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's says it will have the season's most important work:
``Still Life With Tulips,'' a 1932 portrait by Picasso of his
mistress Marie-Therese Walter. Estimated at $25 million to $30
million, the painting is to be auctioned in New York on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   The composition, reminiscent of a Spanish old master work, is
particularly unusual because it is both a portrait and a still
life. Picasso placed Walter's head on a white sculptural pedestal
with a delicate garland of greens in her hair. The figure is posed
on a black armchair, her legs swathed in a blue cloth, with a
basket of tulips in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was painted on March 2, 1932, and on the back of the
painting, not only is the date recorded but the hours Picasso
painted it _ 9 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. _ which is very unusual,'' said
Franck Giraud, head of 19th- and 20th-century art for Christie's
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's has sold several 1932 portraits of Walter that have
brought big prices. Last year it sold ``Nude on a Black Armchair''
for $45.1 million; in 1997 ``The Dream,'' for $48.4 million; and in
1995 ``The Mirror,'' for $20 million.
</P>

   Giraud said that ``Tulips'' was being sold by a European
collector, whom he would not identify. It has not been on the
market since 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo With Pen
</P>
<P>
   Great old masters have traditionally been sold in London, and
while sales of such paintings and drawings by Christie's and
Sotheby's in New York have been growing stronger, often eclipsing
auctions in London, Christie's is still saving a few jewels for its
major old master drawings sale in London on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   The star will be a Michelangelo drawing, ``Study for the Risen
Christ,'' in pen, and red and black chalk, a study for a marble
statue commissioned for the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The drawing, which dates from 1514-16, is estimated at $7.2
million. It comes from the well-known collection of Sir Brinsley
Ford, an authority on 18th-century art, who died in 1998. Ford
bought the drawing at Christie's in 1936 when he was in his early
20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those amazing drawings,'' said Noel Annesley,
deputy chairman of Christie's and an expert on old master paintings
and drawings. ``There are only a handful of drawings by
Michelangelo left in private hands, and this is an incredibly rare
example of the artist's mature work.''
</P>
<P>
   The drawing depicts the male abdomen and the rounded form of the
left leg. The artist sketched the figure in black chalk and then
retraced the contours in pen, using crosshatching to make it seem
as if light was streaming through the work.
</P>
<P>
   Annesley said Ford's estate was selling the drawing to raise
money to preserve the rest of his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Art and a Slurpee
</P>
<P>
   For years Sotheby's has sold works from some of the great
corporate art collections in the United States, including those of
IBM and Reader's Digest. On April 5 and 6, it will offer a rare
group of photographs from 7-Eleven Inc. that is expected to sell
for $1.6 million to $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photography market is red-hot right now,'' said Denise
Bethel, director of Sotheby's photography department in New York.
``There are things in this collection that people have been looking
for for years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s 7-Eleven began buying photographs to furnish a new
42-floor, 1.5-million-square-foot corporate headquarters in Dallas.
But since then the company has drastically cut back its operations,
and much of the collection has been in storage, Bethel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1980s, before the big photography boom, they
began buying blue-chip images by blue-chip photographers,'' she
said. Many of the images for sale exist in only one or two vintage
prints.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stars are a range of masterworks by Paul Strand,
including two rare early images: ``Shadows, Twin Lakes,
Connecticut'' (1916), one of four Strand porch shadow studies
included in the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Strand exhibition two
years ago, which is estimated at $200,000 to $300,000; and
``Rebecca, New York'' (1921), a portrait of Strand's wife that is
expected to bring $150,000 to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sale also includes works of lesser-known photographers,
among them four rare images by the California photographer Alma
Lavenson. Her 1931 ``Standard Oil Company'' and 1932 ``Calaveras
Dam II'' are both estimated at $15,000 to $25,000 each. Only two or
three prints of each image are known.
</P>
<P>
   Aural Appreciation
</P>
<P>
   This year's Whitney Biennial has several firsts, among them the
group of outside curators who assembled the exhibition, its section
of Internet art and its audio guide. This is no academic, highly
curatorial audio guide. It has voices of more than 60 of the
artists represented in this survey of contemporary art. Some
describe their creative processes; others discuss their
inspirations; and some have substituted commentary with music or
sound effects. ``It is a way of making the experience of
contemporary art not so off-putting, more accessible,'' said
Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum of American
Art.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Antenna Audio, a California-based company that has
developed audio guides for museums worldwide, the guide is free and
uses a hand-held player smaller than a cellular phone that operates
with headphones or can be held up to the ear and heard through a
small speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went around the country and interviewed some 70 artists
over a four-month period,'' said Chris Tellis, founder and chief
executive of Antenna Audio. ``The whole point was to connect the
voice of the artist with the work.'' &QL;

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``TRUE NORTH'' &QL; 
 &UR; By Kimberly Kafka (Dutton, $23.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of Kafka's first novel is Bailey Lockhart, a
35-year-old woman who has fled a troubled past to find solace as a
medic and bush pilot in the remote wilderness of Alaska. She lives
alone in a cabin 80 miles upriver from the nearest community, a
Native village with which she stays in touch by radio. The book
opens when she agrees to fly two tourists _ they claim to be
looking for a ``wilderness adventure'' but are really searching
illegally for Alaskan gold _ from Anchorage to a deserted lodge
five miles upriver from her camp. Add to this the romantic
attentions of Kash, a Native leader and realistic man who is trying
to look after the interests of his people, as well as the despair
and animosity felt toward Whites by many residents in the village,
and you have a pretty interesting look at major issues in Alaska
today. The plot lags a bit during the characters' seemingly endless
travels up and down the river, but Kash is appealing, Bailey is
strong and utterly capable, and their wilderness lives make for
good reading. Kafka, who is a wilderness emergency medical
technician, lives in Alaska and Wisconsin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``THE PENGUIN BOOK OF IRISH FICTION'' &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Colm Toibin (Viking, $40) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toibin begins this anthology with a challenge: ``If you want to
read about the vagaries of the human heart,'' he says, ``or the
fleeting nature of love or time, read Goethe's lyrics; but if you
want to know about the unreliable nature of narrative in a time of
landlords, read Maria Edgeworth. If you want to know how love can
lead to marriage, read Jane Austen; but if you want to delve into
the secret and dark unconscious of an embattled ruling class, read
Bram Stoker, Charles Maturin and Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.'' Such is
Irish fiction, a territory in which, to paraphrase Maria Edgeworth,
reality is too strong, passion too violent, the world too feverish
to look upon without the disguising balm of language. Toibin has
assembled fiction from the time of Jonathan Swift to that of Emma
Donoghue, who was born a mere 31 years ago. Included are broad
selections from James Joyce, as well as excerpts from Roddy Doyle's
``The Snapper,'' Edna O'Brien's ``The Country Girls,'' Oscar
Wilde's ``The Picture of Dorian Gray,'' John Banville's ``The Book
of Evidence,'' Iris Murdoch's ``The Red and the Green'' and many
others.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER'' &QL; 
 &UR; By David Liss (Random House, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Weaver is a man who performs work of a ``delicate
nature'' on behalf of rich and illustrious men, clients who are
driven to insult him but whose barbs Weaver shrugs off ``as a bear
tosses off the dogs sent to bait it in Hockley-in-the-Hole.''
Weaver is the consummate outsider: He is a former boxer who now
works as a private investigator, of sorts; a brainy, brawling
thug-for-hire. He is also a Jew, which distances him further from
the men he serves. More important, he is the tremendously appealing
narrator of this first novel, one of the best to come along in
years. Set in 18th-century London, ``Conspiracy'' takes Weaver into
a complex case that begins when he learns that the seemingly
accidental death of his father, a stock-jobber to whom Weaver had
not spoken in 10 years, was really a murder. Weaver's work becomes
personal then, and he throws himself into an investigation that
goes deep into the world of British finance and into the dark
territory of the city's criminal elite. It's great entertainment,
which Liss serves up with intelligence, historical accuracy and
rip-roaring ambition. Enjoy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``JANE GOODALL: 40 YEARS AT GOMBE'' &QL; 
 &UR; (ST&AMP;C, $29.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We had a conversation recently with a man of a certain age, who
told us that the consensus among men of his generation is that Jane
Goodall was, as he put it, ``a babe.'' We confess we had never
heard that word applied to Goodall (and we imagine that she would
be amused to know of it), but we were reminded of the sentiment as
we looked at the early photographs in this book. They are personal
memories for so many people, these images of a barefoot, slender
young woman in shorts, long hair tied back, her attention given
over wholly to the intelligent animals that she would study all her
life. Her first article on the chimpanzees of the Gombe Stream Game
Reserve in Tanzania appeared in ``National Geographic''in 1963, and
it was not long before everyone knew who Goodall was. Today, she is
66 and travels constantly on a public relations mission to preserve
and enhance the lives of the creatures she came to love. This book
is a reminder of what a great combination youth, daring and
commitment can be. And he's right: She was something to see.  &QL;

 IT; ALSO MOVING IN THE ``L'' CATEGORY) 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Muller's quick looks at some current magazine issues and a
popular website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CONSUMER REPORTS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! It's time for this
magazine's most-stolen issue _ rating the cars. This one is kept
locked in the public library's hermetically sealed bunker, only to
be checked out with three forms of ID, a blood sample and a
security deposit including, but not limited to, your first born. Of
course, this issue is well worth the trouble, rating every vehicle
from the Audi TT (isn't that cute?) to the Volvo S80 (less boxier
than ever!). Arizona drivers, of course, will skip straight to the
Sports Utility Vehicle section (we counted 45 SUV models alone),
even if the most rugged terrain they ever traverse is the ABCO
parking lot. The magazine goes high-tech this time around, rating
the car Web sites, from CarsDirect (www.carsdirect.com), which
allows you to ``build your own car'' (actually, just add extras),
to Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), which pegs resale prices for
used cars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely Science Lite, but the April issue includes a
couple of interesting pieces. The cover story details the discovery
of ancient Roman ships near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in the
Tuscany region of Italy. Researchers have found the remnants of at
least 17 ships dating from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 500 and yielding
a number of artifacts, including incense burners, oil lamps, fish
hooks, sewing needles and numerous amphorae _ large earthen jars
used to transport goods around the Mediterranean. There's also an
interesting story on the world's ``deadliest carnivore'' a
half-mongoose, half-cloud leopard called a fossa, which lives in
Madagascar and apparently spends much of its food budget on Lemur
Helper. Our intrepid explorers actually manage to catch one of
these slick dudes, and then pass the tranquilized cat around for
polaroids. Way to be ecosensitive, dude.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``GOLF'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong message emanating from this magazine, and that
message is: ``We want to sell you some really expensive golf
clubs!'' Or a luxury car. Or both. Still, this issue includes some
interesting features, including an 18-hole ``course'' on everything
from repairing divots to teaching your kids to play. Of course,
like most articles in the magazine, some of these helpful hints
double as ads _ many of the ``solutions'' involve buying cool stuff
or going to a ritzy resort. If you really want to ruin your swing,
consult some of the technical-sounding instructions in the back,
with lines like ``the upper spine is farther from the target than
the lower spine.'' Uh huh. And the ball is rolling through the
desert. There is also a fun feature that names the nation's 10 best
public courses. Arizona made the list, with Apache Stronghold in
San Carlos. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE NEW YORKER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Includes one of those great articles that keep you coming back
for more _ a feature story on the top writer for ``The Simpsons,''
a former ``Harvard Lampoon'' staffer named George Meyer. It is
Meyer who writes many of the lines that are quoted from the wildly
successful series. Even his fellow writers stand pretty much in awe
of him. ``I would rather make George Meyer laugh than win an
Emmy,'' a colleague notes. Meyer, who traces his comedic roots back
to ``Mad'' magazine, culled his craft working for David Letterman
and Lorne Michaels. Writer David Owen does a nice job drawing Meyer
out, getting him to describe a less-than-idyllic childhood filled
with way too much television. There is also a well-done piece by
political correspondent Joe Klein which notes that John McCain
spent much more time adopting a posture of indignance than actually
explaining his positions. He says McCain plowed his jet into the
George W. Bush aircraft carrier, crippling both campaigns. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE REVIEW: www.yesterland.com  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are things that just work better on the Web.
Yesterland is one of them. With an astounding commitment to detail,
the site chronicles Disneyland attractions that have closed over
the years, complete with pictures and narrative histories.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about nostalgia. All those rides that you remember from
childhood are here: the campy Submarine Voyage (``helmsman, steer
clear of the teetering columns!''), the Old Matterhorn (pre-1978)
and the Skyway to Tomorrowland/Fantasyland
</P>
<P>
   (those old buckets that hang on the wire, closed in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   There is a piece on the old PeopleMover (presented by Goodyear,
closed in 1995), which pushed guests around with motors installed
in the track, taking them through Tomorrowland's indoor attractions
and above its outdoor attractions. And don't forget Rocket to the
Moon, a ``D'' ticket that later became Mission to Mars, until it
closed in 1992. Today, it's a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   How deep does this site go? It even includes a long feature on
the old parking lot, which has been closed to make way for a new
slate of rides and other attractions. The article notes that those
who arrived early could park in the ``convenient Bambi section,''
but those who came late ``could be way back in Thumper or Winnie
the Pooh.'' &QL;

 &HT;    An entertaining love, politics, ghost story
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Great loves endure beyond the grave. Oh,
OK, so that's a sentimental literary and cinematic conceit, but it
is not without dramatic impact in the movie ``Waking the Dead.''
Call it a political romance and ghost story, a hybrid genre picture
at best, but written and performed well enough to be diverting for
a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Scott Spencer's novel, it is grounded in an interesting
character study of attracting opposites. Fielding Pierce (Billy
Crudup) is an ambitious lad, groomed for politics ever since he was
given his patrician name. His understanding of the art of
compromise is typified by his serving in the Coast Guard during the
Vietnam War, protecting New York Harbor instead of the politically
detrimental alternatives of fleeing to Canada or landing in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, as the movie begins, he meets and falls quickly in love
with the politically committed and unable-to-compromise
humanitarian radical Sarah Williams (Jennifer Connelly). As he
ignores his pride in the name of diplomacy, smiling and kowtowing
to the political hierarchy, Sarah becomes his needling conscience,
his ``Jiminy Cricket.'' While he is introduced to fat-cat donors by
his mentor (Hal Holbrook), Sarah snaps back at them and
increasingly becomes a liability to Fielding. Then abruptly she is
killed by a car bomb retaliating for her leftist activities in
support of Chilean rebels.
</P>
<P>
   A devastated Fielding continues to see Sarah wherever he looks,
not unlike Jimmy Stewart and his obsessional spottings of Kim Novak
in ``Vertigo.'' But is Sarah alive, a ghost or a mere delusion?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question on which the second half of ``Waking the
Dead'' hinges, as Fielding keeps encountering her while running a
punishing, close race for Congress. At one point, he leaps up from
a restaurant table to rush outside and chase what he perceives to
be Sarah through the snowy Chicago streets. By the movie's
conclusion, suffice it to say that this ghost story is
significantly less satisfying than ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   As Fielding, Crudup makes a worthy bid for recognition above the
crowded field of capable young actors. He chews up with relish a
few scenes where he is wracked with remorse and regret over Sarah,
culminating in a too-loud public pronouncement that he has lost
touch with reality.
</P>
<P>
   Connelly is also persuasive and appealing as the strident Sarah.
Together, they definitely send out sparks, particularly in their
numerous bedroom trysts.
</P>
<P>
   Janet McTeer delivers another letter-perfect American accent,
completely different from the Southern drawl of her Oscar-nominated
turn in ``Tumbleweeds.'' But the role of Fielding's supportive
sister hardly allows her to demonstrate other acting skills. Paul
Hipp keeps popping up in a curiously conceived part as Fielding's
hippie-dippy brother. And if you blink, you might miss a cameo by
Ed Harris as a congressman resigning under a cloud of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Director Keith Gordon (``Mother Night'') handles the story's
emotional terrain with relative restraint, perhaps too much so for
more action-oriented moviegoers. He also navigates the numerous
time shifts of Robert Dillon's screenplay with clarity, enhanced by
subtle wardrobe and hair-length changes.
</P>
<P>
   Is it something about the millennial Zeitgeist that brings us
several ghost stories now, or is it mere coincidence? In any event,
it would help your enjoyment of ``Waking the Dead'' if you were
predisposed toward spectral beings or at least undying love.

turn tonight's Oscars into a real horse race by pushing former long
shot ``The Cider House Rules'' as the rival to DreamWorks'
``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   If you accept the horse-race notion, let's just say it's likely
to be a run for the roses _ those ``American Beauty'' roses.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some thoughts and predictions for the top six
categories that may or may not prove helpful in your own Oscar
pool. Just remember: The only thing anyone was sure about last year
was that ``Saving Private Ryan'' would win best picture.
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   BEST PICTURE
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'': Still the favorite and deservedly so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'': It's making a mighty come-from-behind
run, but when supporting contender Michael Caine is off-screen, the
movie sort of disappears, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Mile'': It does it all and it does it right, but it
still doesn't feel like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'': The ringer in the group. Knocked askew by star
ego (Al Pacino's).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'': They say blockbusters don't win, but does
anyone remember ``Titanic''? It's the only movie in the same class
as ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's choice: ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My choice: ``American Beauty,'' with ``The Sixth Sense'' a
close second.
</P>
<P>
   BEST DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   Lasse Halstrom, ``The Cider House Rules'': Should've won for
1985's ``My Life as a Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Spike Jonze, ``Being John Malkovich'': The hipness is in the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Mann, ``The Insider'': Should've won for 1981's
``Thief'' (now we're getting obscure).
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mendes, ``American Beauty'': Beginner's luck or
bred-in-the-bones brilliance? Either way, he's the man.
</P>
<P>
   M. Night Shyamalan, ``The Sixth Sense'': If anyone can pull an
upset ...
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's choice: Mendes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My choice: Mendes, with Shyamalan a close second.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Russell Crowe, ``The Insider'': It's the best performance, but
it lacks glamour. And co-star Pacino takes away a lot of screen
time.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Farnsworth, ``The Straight Story'': Has a chance if the
flashier candidates cancel each other out, but it doesn't feel like
a ``Harry and Tonto'' year (Art Carney in 1974).
</P>
<P>
   Sean Penn, ``Sweet and Lowdown'': The nomination keeps him
bankable.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Spacey, ``American Beauty'': About as good as Crowe and in
a better movie. Plus he recently won a Screen Actors Guild Award.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington, ``The Hurricane'': A terrific performance
that could succeed simply on star presence.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's choice: Spacey, with Washington as a possible upset.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My choice: A dead heat between Spacey and Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Annette Bening, ``American Beauty'': She's got the Hollywood
establishment on her side, and winning a SAG Award didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Janet McTeer, ``Tumbleweeds'': Not her year, but you can bet
she'll be back if she gets the right role.
</P>
<P>
   Julianne Moore, ``The End of the Affair'': Won't somebody please
give this woman an Oscar? She can handle anything from ``Safe'' to
``The Lost World: Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Meryl Streep, ``Music of the Heart'': She's the best, but this
isn't her best work.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank, ``Boys Don't Cry'': The early favorite, but she
seems to be losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's choice: Bening.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My choice: Moore.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Michael Caine, ``The Cider House Rules'': It's the best work,
and his surprise SAG win makes him a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cruise, ``Magnolia'': He was perceived as a shoo-in. May
still be. Or he could be this year's Lauren Bacall.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Clarke Duncan, ``The Green Mile'': A lovely performance
that was harder to pull off than it looked. But the movie just
doesn't have that winner's aura.
</P>
<P>
   Jude Law, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'': Unless something really
weird happens, he's the designated also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   Haley Joel Osment, ``The Sixth Sense'': A truly wonderful
portrayal, but I'm not sure Oscar is in a kiddie mood this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's choice: Cruise, unless Caine pulls an upset.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My choice: Caine.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Toni Collette, ``The Sixth Sense'': She was much better in
``Muriel's Wedding,'' but the nomination won't hurt her career.
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie, ``Girl, Interrupted'': Those lips. Those eyes.
That talent. That role.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Keener, ``Being John Malkovich'': Her time will come.
Right now, she's splitting the hip vote with Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   Samantha Morton, ``Sweet and Lowdown'': A poignant but feisty
mute, straight out of a Chaplin film. How old are the academy
members?
</P>
<P>
   Chloe Sevigny, ``Boys Don't Cry'': Like Swank, she seems to have
lost her early momentum. Plus, there's the Keener factor.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oscar's choice: Jolie.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  My choice: Jolie.

<P>
   &QR;  His first movie script: ``American Beauty,'' up for eight
Oscars at tonight's 72nd annual Academy Awards, including best
original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The bottom line: ``American Beauty'' was made on a budget of
$15 million. To date it's earned more than $225 million at the box
office worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Among his plays: ``Five Women Wearing the Same Dress,'' ``My
Mother's Butt.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Among his TV shows: ``Grace Under Fire,'' ``Cybill,'' ``Oh
Grow Up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  His next project: He's finalizing a deal with HBO to write and
direct a pilot about a family-run funeral home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  O, holy night: Ball caught the stage bug in elementary school
in Marietta, Ga., during the Christmas pageant. ``I was a shepherd.
I just sort of sat there and stared at the baby Jesus while the
class sang a carol. I was very nervous. But it was a thrilling
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Religion and his family: ``I grew up in the Methodist church.
We went on Christmas and Easter. And then when my sister died,
everybody suddenly got religion in that weird Gothic kind of (way)
that focuses on the Rapture and the end of the world and the whole
punishing side of God. It really helped my parents deal with my
sister's death because they were both just devastated and lost. But
it wasn't doing anything for me. Since then my religious stuff has
veered toward Eastern philosophy and Buddhism.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For love of humor: ``Life is just funny. It's so absurd. And
I'm a person whose sense of humor is so intrinsic and so basic that
I can't write anything that doesn't have humor in it or I get
bored. Every time I go see a movie that doesn't have any humor in
it or takes itself too seriously or see a play that is ponderous, I
just go, `Snooze.'''

`X': EVEN ANIMATED, POOR TOKYO CAN'T GET A MOMENT'S PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of anime _ the visually detailed and often doom-oriented
Japanese animation features that include ``Princess Mononoke,''
``Ghost in the Shell'' and ``Akira'' _ are bound to be delighted by
``X,'' the director Rintaro's adaptation of the Clamp collective's
graphic novels (or manga) of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a not-too-distant future _ 1999 _ that's now a
not-too-distant past, ``X'' has to cram in enough exposition to
float several books of the New Testament, or the first few issues
of the manga series.
</P>
<P>
   As a comic book, ``X,'' like a number of other comics, started
as a mood piece, setting the stage by introducing the characters
through action. ``X'' the movie has an entirely different mandate.
It is better at developing the gloomy world of cybermagic in a few
strokes than the comic was.
</P>
<P>
   The story: Kamui (the voice of Alan Marriot), whose name means
God's power, is the key to preventing the destruction of Tokyo,
both the destruction and its prevention being longstanding
traditions. And he is determined to protect his love, Kotari
(Larissa Murray).
</P>
<P>
   His best friend and Kotari's brother, Fuma (Adam Henderson), is
enchanted into becoming Kamui's enemy. Dual goddesses, Kanoe
(Denica Fairman) and Hinoto (Stacey Jefferson), tell of a battle
for the world's future that moves from dreamscapes to bloody
struggles on the city's streets. The film's motley band of world
protectors include a stripper and a 14-year-girl and her magic
wolf.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the power of ``X,'' which opens Friday in Manhattan,
derives from the potency of the adult imagery. It begins with
Kamui's mother plunging a hand into her stomach and withdrawing a
sword, a weapon for her son to use in his travails. Showers of
flower petals cascade over the picture _ a lovely motif.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the constant rivers of explanation _ narration dusty
with portent _ ``X'' requires a great deal of concentration. And if
you know the material, the breakdown of the story for the first
third may become exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   Once the summarizing is done, ``X'' has the sleepy feel of an
urban fairy tale, but getting there is a long trip. &QL;

Middle America isn't aimed at his hometown (backslash)

   ``My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood. This is my
street. This ... is my life. I'm 42 years old. In less than a year,
I'll be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With eloquent simplicity, these words begin
``American Beauty,'' the dark comedy about a modern-day American
family on the skids that's up for eight Oscars at tonight's 72nd
annual Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   They are words, like the provocative narration in Billy Wilder's
classic ``Sunset Boulevard,'' spoken by a dead man. And they were
written by one of Hollywood's newest cinematic talents, a
42-year-old first-time big-screen movie writer born at Emory
Hospital in Atlanta and raised in Marietta, Ga. He's an
off-Broadway playwright, a TV sitcom writer and one-time Six Flags
Over Georgia employee whose job one summer included guessing the
ages and weights of theme park visitors.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   This is his neighborhood: the narrow, ever-twisting roads of
Hollywood Hills where monied Southern Californians race its riskier
curves in gleaming Mercedes and hulking Range Rovers.
</P>
<P>
   This is his street: a line of pricey, small, flat-roofed homes
built in the '60s near the top of the Hollywood Hills. The street's
petite, manicured gardens are dotted not with beautiful, red-red
American roses, but with exotic green cacti and orange-flamed birds
of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 24 hours, Ball could be holding an Oscar. This
one-time Marietta High drum major and school newspaper editor is
nominated for best original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an early-on and uncanny ability to see what he wanted
to accomplish,'' says longtime friend Donna Arrants, 42, of
Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have great ideas but can't get it done. He gets it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the anticipated victories tonight for fellow ``American
Beauty'' nominees _ including director Sam Mendes; producers Bruce
Cohen and Dan Jinks, who could win best picture for Steven
Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG; and maybe even Kevin Spacey and Annette
Bening, both contenders in the top acting categories _ it's a good
bet among Hollywood insiders that Ball will win.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things about this screenplay that was so compelling
and rare _ I didn't think there was a single scene that was
repetitive,'' says Spacey (an Oscar winner for 1995's ``The Usual
Suspects''), who played ``Beauty's'' central, tragic figure. ``What
I felt was so startling was that this screenplay kept moving
forward. It was a page turner.''
</P>
<P>
   Spacey and Bening portray Lester and Carolyn Burnham, the
parents of a family that, behind its rosy veneer, is wilting. He's
burned out, a cynic's demigod. She's the ultimate ice princess.
Together, they wig out in a biting screenplay that marches toward a
profound sense of hope.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Ball won the Writers Guild Award for
``American Beauty,'' beating out his main Oscar competitors,
Charlie Kaufman (``Being John Malkovich''), Paul Thomas Anderson
(``Magnolia'') and M. Night Shyamalan (``The Sixth Sense''). Ball
also won this year's Golden Globe. (That shiny trophy is upstairs
in his home behind a stack of papers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to keep my head about this and not take it too
seriously,'' Ball says of tonight's Oscars. ``At least not overly
seriously. You know, I wrote this off-Broadway play _ `Five Women
Wearing the Same Dress.' Everybody kept saying, `It's guaranteed to
move to Broadway.' And it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole Oscar thing, he says, is ``incredibly stressful. I'm
not used to this attention. My whole perspective as an artist has
been as an outsider so I'm sort of nervous about losing that
because I think that's very beneficial as a writer. And you see
success spoil a lot of people, a lot of great actors and a lot of
great directors. And I don't want that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm also really enjoying this,'' he says. ``It's fun.
Would I love to have an Oscar on the shelf? Yeah. But it's not why
you do the work. It's incredibly ...'' He pauses briefly until he
finds just the right words. ``It's kind of like being voted prom
queen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn: ``This is a $4,000 sofa upholstered in Italian silk.
This is not just a couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Lester: ``It's just a couch!
</P>
<P>
   (Gesturing around the room.) This isn't life. This is just
stuff. And it's becoming more important to you than living. Well,
honey, that's just nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Ball's house doesn't look anything like the interiors in
``American Beauty.'' There's not a single $4,000 sofa upholstered
in Italian silk.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, his California modern home is much more casual.
There's a small entrance area marked by an oversize bronze foot. A
large black-and-white painting, done in 1992 by his friend Marc
Ashmore, a New York artist, hangs at the front door. A lacquered
piano dominates the narrow living room, which includes a vintage
lowback sectional sofa in front of a concrete fireplace. Small
Asian statuary, symbols of Ball's interest in Eastern religions,
rest on the hardwood floors. An ironing board is up in his messy
kitchen, which is strewn with water bottles, glassware and used
cups.
</P>
<P>
   He remains, say friends in L.A. and Cobb County, modest to a
fault. ``You're never aware he's the writer of this brilliant
script,'' says ``American Beauty'' co-producer Cohen. ``He's
unassuming and delightfully down-to-earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my L.A. home. I've got my hot tub,'' Ball says,
lounging with his feet up on his sofa. ``I'm so embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' skewers this country's preoccupation with
designer labels and supermodels. Our marketing mania. Dressing for
success. Homophobia. And corporate greed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's instilled in us that wealth and success and materials
stir people's happiness. That is just an out-and-out lie,'' Ball
says.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent news articles have suggested Ball is aiming his
criticisms at Marietta, especially in regard to homophobia. He's
been quoted as saying it's a town he ``had to get out of'' because
it's ``not exactly the most friendly place for gay people.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not quotes he recalls, but he doesn't deny them; he
just thinks they were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   When he left Georgia in the late '70s, he says, ``I didn't even
know I was gay at the time. That was such a taboo I couldn't even
acknowledge that about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It was later, while he was studying theater at Florida State
University, that he told his mother he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't believe that everyone who lives in Marietta
is shut down and living in denial,'' he says. ``There are people
like that everywhere. There are tons of people here in L.A. living
that way. I remember reading the quotes and being horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I left Marietta is very practical. I think if you
are going to pursue a career in entertainment you have to live in
New York or L.A. And that's really my only reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, he says, is ``not about Marietta at all. It's about
Middle American values.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Lester: ``Brad, for 14 years I've been a whore for the
advertising industry. The only way I could save myself now is if I
start firebombing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   A lot of ``American Beauty'' is about the misunderstandings that
plague us, the tragedies that befall us.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it is also about Alan Ball.
</P>
<P>
   He began writing his movie two years ago, late at night after
12- and 14-hour days hammering out scripts for Cybill Shepherd's
CBS sitcom ``Cybill.'' ``American Beauty'' was his sanity.
``Cybill'' was his hell on earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was writing for `Cybill' at the time, but my experience in
writing for both `Grace Under Fire' (the old sitcom starring former
Mariettan Brett Butler) and `Cybill' was an eye-opening experience
because it was just deeply, deeply dysfunctional,'' Ball says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love actors and both of those women _ they're not actors,
they're stars _ were terribly, terribly self-indulgent.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Beauty,'' when Spacey's Lester Burnham hands over
his management-ordered job description to Brad, the freshly hired
consultant, the venom in Lester's document is merely Ball purging
his own real-life frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was used to situations on `Cybill' where we'd written a
great script,'' Ball says, ``and the night before the table read,
I'd get a phone call (from Shepherd) and she'd go, `Well, I think
this character who comes from Italy to be with (her TV daughter)
Zoey after she lost her virginity two years ago should meet me and
fall in love with me. And then I think I should sing opera in this
episode.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ball drops his jaw to exaggerate the gall of Shepherd's
``suggestions.'' He says she viewed the show as public relations
for her life and resented any other actor in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   So he turned to his own script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me really felt I have to write something that means
something or I'm just going to go crazy,'' he says. ``Otherwise I
would have had to accept the fact that I had become a total whore
and was just doing it for the money. And I didn't just ever want to
be one of those people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn (in bed with real
</P>
<P>
   estate king Buddy Kane,
</P>
<P>
   post-sex): ``I was so stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy: ``Know what I do when I feel like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn: ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy: ``I fire a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the front door of Ball's childhood home in Marietta,
leaning against the wall behind an umbrella stand, is a gun. It's
loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the BB gun Alan bought me for my birthday,'' says his
mother, Mary, 86. ``The neighbor used to have 17 cats. It doesn't
kill them. It just stings them a little.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ball and her husband, Frank, a one-time Lockheed employee,
moved into this tiny, wood-sided home in 1955, two years before
Alan came along. He was the youngest of four children, born when
his mother was 44. One brother was a senior in high school. His
only sister, Mary Ann, was 8.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ball says she always knew Alan would be successful. ``He
was a smart little boy. He's always written a lot. And he was very
active in high school.'' Senior class president. A drum major who
choreographed at least one halftime show. He played piano and
trombone and wrote music. There didn't seem to be a club he didn't
join.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Ball says he had created ``this persona for myself
of really being an overachiever, kind of an All-American guy that
really wasn't me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's how he coped.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 10, Ga. 120 was built around Marietta, gutting the
Balls' street. Their home now sits at a dead-end next to the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hated that,'' he says. ``When I was a kid, we spent a
lot of time playing in the woods, and those just got removed and
replaced by a highway. That was probably my first experience with a
profound sense of loss. You know, of something being really
important that was suddenly gone. And it was weird and never the
same after that.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13, he saw his sister die. On her 22nd birthday, Mary Ann was
killed in a car accident while driving Alan to a piano lesson.
About six years later, his father died at home from lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone close to you dies, it's like a part of you
dies,'' Ball says. So he distracted himself by being active in high
school and college. It wasn't until years later _ after Columbia
Pictures optioned his off-Broadway play and he was able to quit his
day job _ that he became deeply depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all this unexpressed grief and trauma because I was in
the car with my sister and I had never dealt with it,'' he says. He
began therapy. ``It was a really ugly six months of my life, but
I'm really glad I went through it. Those experiences really deepen
you. They make you stronger, and you're kind of forced to come out
on the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   He also told his mother that he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty bad about it, and Alan felt bad about it, too,''
she says. ``He didn't know if I was going to kick him out of the
house or what. But we both cried a little bit. It took a little
getting used to, but he gave me some books to read and I understand
that God made him like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it,'' she says, sitting on her living room couch and
stopping to stare out her open front door. ``I wish he wasn't gay.
But he seems to be happy. And I'm very pleased for him about
everything. Whatever he's done, he's done well.''
</P>
<P>
   His brothers are crazy about him, she says _ but some of the
extended family is less supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think he's going to hell,'' she says. And some who have
seen ``American Beauty,'' got up and walked out of the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what? I don't care,'' Alan Ball says. ``Everybody is
capable of making their own decisions and if people make different
decisions than me, it doesn't mean my decisions aren't right _ and
it doesn't mean those people's decisions aren't right for them. But
that's a worldview of tolerance and acceptance that certain members
of my family do not have.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   Ricky: ``It was one of those days when it's a minute away from
snowing. And there's this electricity in the air, you can almost
hear it, right? And this bag was just ... dancing with me. Like a
little kid begging me to play with it. For 15 minutes. That's the
day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and
this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was
no reason to be afraid. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;   &QR;
</P>
<P>
   The little white bag in ``American Beauty'' _ the movie's
centerpiece image of grace, peace and beauty _ is one memory Ball
carries with him every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in New York walking to a subway stop after brunch, and I
was actually in front of the World Trade Center, and this white
plastic bag appeared out of nowhere. It was just blowing around,
and then I noticed it was circling me. And it continued to do that
for a weirdly long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure certain people would look at that and go, `It's just
wind.' But it was this very bizarre zen moment out of nowhere. And
I suddenly felt this completely unexpected sense of peace and
wonder. That moment has always stayed with me. And when I started
writing the movie, it just was sort of organic and found its way
into the script.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-producer Jinks says he'll never forget the first time he read
Ball's screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was unique to find a script that was unbelievably
funny on one hand and quite moving on another. I thought there were
so many characters of various ages that were relatable. It told us
something about their world that made me think about my life and
about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball's agent began shopping the screenplay in 1998. Steven
Spielberg read it and was so impressed he told Ball in a chance
meeting, ``You should only write movies, and you should only write
your own movies.'' Spielberg's DreamWorks SKG bought ``American
Beauty'' for $400,000. Jinks and Cohen signed on as producers.
Mendes, the English stage director of the gigantic hit ``Cabaret,''
lobbied personally to direct.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, only two big changes were made to Ball's screenplay.
One involved the main character's relationship with his daughter's
classmate; the other was a courtroom scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little upset (over the cutting of the trial scene) for
about 24 hours,'' Ball says. ``But then I saw Sam's cut ... with
all that removed, and I could tell that it worked and I said, `OK,
you're right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others were moved by the final cut, too. Bening cried.
Spielberg, who watched the film alone at DreamWorks while a nervous
Mendes waited outside, emerged to tell the director, ``You have
created a classic.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ball does win tonight, he'll have a prepared speech. ``My big
fear is that I will forget somebody, and then I will be really,
really mortified.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will he thank?
</P>
<P>
   Probably the same group he thanked after winning the Writers
Guild honor.
</P>
<P>
   Mendes. For ``always being interested in what I had to say and
what I thought.'' His producing buddies Cohen and Jinks. For
``promising me in the beginning to always keep me involved. They
kept that promise.'' DreamWorks, of course. His various therapists.
For ``obviously not doing their job.'' And one more thank you for a
little item that needs no explanation. ``That plastic bag in front
of the World Trade Center.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chinart, one Chinese antiques gallery in Manhattan
that is not giving a fancy cocktail party during the current round
of auctions and shows known as Asian Art Week, doesn't need to.
Everyone shows up anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Well known to the trade and to museum curators _ and unknown by
nearly everyone else _ Ruby Chan's shop, Chinart, is a secret
source of Ming (1368 to 1644) and Qing (1644 to 1912) dynasty
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find any advertisements for Chinart's simple
storefront at 273 Fifth Avenue, at 29th Street. ``I depend on word
of mouth,'' Chan said.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't seem to spend much on decorating either. Her
crowded, street-level shop has rows of 17th- and 18th-century
huanghuali and jumu altar tables arranged like pews in a church.
Haphazardly interspersed among them are a pair of 18th-century
walnut horseshoe back chairs, a 16th-century huanghuali wine table
with its original patina, a 17th-century tapered cabinet made of
jumu wood, a 17th-century small huanghuali side table with a burl
wood square inset in its top, and a rare 18th-century
burgundy-lacquered jumu sedan chair with its own footrest.
</P>
<P>
   The sedan chair retains its metal loops, through which poles
could be threaded to allow bearers to carry their master through
the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I sell is classical, not country furniture,'' Chan said.
Old-fashioned glass cabinets display a Han dynasty bronze tripod
food container that once belonged to the Chicago collector James
Alsdorf; an 18th-century porcelain vessel for wine that is glazed a
striking tea-dust green; a 19th-century carved ivory hairpin; a
late-18th-century blanc de chine goddess of Mercy; and a
17th-century wooden brush pot.
</P>
<P>
   The brush pot has holes where knots would have been. ``Scholars
or painters would have used this to meditate upon,'' Chan said.
``The holes look like clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   A pair of salmon-colored late-18th-century embroidered silk
panels hang on the wall. In a Chinese home, they would be displayed
to celebrate a birthday. They depict the eight immortal Taoist gods
in animated poses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so joyful,'' Chan said. ``They are for good health
and luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jacobsen, curator of Chinese art at the Minneapolis
Museum of Art, had an appointment with Chan last Sunday to see her
new items.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to look at her museum-quality softwood furniture,'' he
said. ``She looks for pieces with the same proportions as the
earlier, classic hardwoods. In the 18th century, when the Chinese
ran out of hard woods like huanghuali, they copied them in elm,
walnut, burl and other indigenous softwoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan's prices are considered very fair. ``My rent is low
compared to uptown,'' she said. ``I buy directly from China.
There's no middleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Chan is a second-generation dealer. Her father left mainland
China to set up shop in Hong Kong in 1943. ``In the 1950's he began
to buy things from Westerners who were leaving China,'' she said.
``Missionaries and people working for Western companies moved south
when the Communists took over in 1949. He snapped up a lot of good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s when she was a girl, Chan accompanied her father
and mother to Beijing on shopping trips. ``The government wanted
cash so they invited my father to government warehouses where the
pieces were stored,'' she said. ``I helped him look at things and
carry them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government closed the market in the late 1960s.
``Everything stopped,'' she said. ``No one dared to bring things
out.'' Chan came to America in 1974, married and set up shop. Her
brother Albert stayed in Hong Kong, where he has his own operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese still don't respect this furniture as much as
Westerners do,'' Jacobsen said. ``Only a few museums in China are
serious about collecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXAN'S CHINA SET
</P>
<P>
   Sam Bernstein, a Texan who has specialized in Chinese
antiquities since 1976, is celebrating the 10th anniversary of his
San Francisco gallery with an exhibition in Manhattan Friday
through Sunday. ``It's my coming-of-age show,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken him six years to assemble the 33 pieces of ancient
Chinese art he is offering for sale at the Four Seasons Hotel. He
has titled the show ``Within Reach,'' because the jade, bone, glass
and bronze artifacts are meant to be touched and appreciated by
both eye and hand.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces range from the Neolithic _ a Huan disc, an adze blade
in jade and a mottled green stone disc _ to a Tang period bone
hairpin and a white Qing imperial seal.
</P>
<P>
   He has a mythical beast in translucent white glass from the Han
dynasty (206 B.C. to 220 A.D.) that fits into your hand. Bernstein
says it is a bixie, a tomb guardian that wards off evil spirits.
Normally, a bixie is a composite animal, with attributes like wings
or hooves or horns. This one looks like a horse, though it has
wings. Its four legs are tucked under it and its head is raised.
The mouth is wide open in what Bernstein said was a typical Han
stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this beast is a metaphor for the entire Han period in
its power, aliveness and naturalistic carving,'' he said. It is the
only known example of a Han horse in glass imitating jade that is
more than three inches long, said Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   He said the glass horse was buried for hundreds of years.
Portions of it have a cloudy, purplish discoloration. ``The glass
has devitrified,'' he said. ``There is an alteration to the surface
when it interacts with its environment, whether it's soil or
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Discoloration does not disqualify a piece of jade or glass for
serious collectors, who expect it, but the lack of original surface
might.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said glass was an exotic material during the Han. ``It
was considered even more exotic than jade because it came from
outside China, probably from the Middle East, beginning in the
seventh century B.C.,'' he said. ``There was a great demand for
prestige objects by the elite. They were the Patek Philippe watches
of their day.''
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with his show, Bernstein organized a seminar on
collecting Chinese Art, from 9 a.m. to noon Saturday at the hotel.
It is geared to collectors, and costs $55.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have reserved places, he said, are collectors
from China. ``I acquire Chinese jade and early metalwork in the
United States and Europe,'' Bernstein said. ``But about a third of
my business is selling to collectors in Taiwan, Hong Kong and
mainland China. The Chinese have a new interest in collecting their
own history. That's where the great collections are being formed
today.''

<P>
   BBO-SELIG _ It was only a short time ago when Bud Selig was
serving in the role as acting baseball commissioner. Entering the
2000 season, he's now the full-time commissioner with wide-ranging
power that could have a huge impact on the sport. A look at Selig
and his possible impact on the game. (Stinson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30.

   BBA-YANKEES _ Can anyone stop the New York Yankees from winning
another World Series title? The team with the highest payroll and
lived up to expectations in recent years, winning two consecutive
and three of the last four world championships. The team returns
virtually intact from last year and appears to be the favorite in
2000. What makes the Yankees so strong? (Stinson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 40.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-NLPREVIEW _ Previewing the National League heading into the
2000 season. Will the Braves continue to dominate? Will the
addition of Ken Griffey, Jr. help the Reds? (Stinson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-SCHUEROLZ _ The life and times of Braves' General Manager
John Schuerholz, who has turned the Braves into a perennial power.
(Stinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 80. WITH chart his major
moves.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-PITCHING _ The Braves' vaunted Big Three _ Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz _ is getting old. John Smoltz
has already broken down, being forced to miss the entire season
after elbow surgery. How much longer can Maddux and Glavine keep
going without missing starts? Age catches up with all pitchers, no
matter what they do to fool Father Time. (Rogers, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 40-50.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-BULLPEN _ The Braves' bullpen will have a different
look this year, even after John Rocker serves his two-week
suspension. The biggest change will be the return of Kerry
Ligtenberg, who missed all of last season with elbow surgery.
(Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15-20.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-ANDRUW _ At 22, Andruw Jones is already being billed
as one of the best outfielders in baseball. But most of that praise
has come from his defensive work. Is this the year that his
offensive play catches up to the defense and he becomes the
complete player that everyone expects? (Rogers, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 35-40.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-CHIPPER _ What has the last year been like for
Chipper Jones? After his well-publicized marital problems, Jones
bounced back to have an MVP season in 1999. After a somewhat
peaceful off-season, is Chipper ready to retun to MVP form in 2000?
(Rogers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-FURCAL_ He's the top prospect in the Braves' minor
league system and it appears that it's only a matter of time before
he joins the big team. He's Rafael Furcal, the 19-year-old
infielder who could be the team's shortstop of the future. (Rogers,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-METS_ The Braves-Mets rivalry has turned into one of
the most fierce rivalries in baseball. Reliever John Rocker added
fuel to the fire with his comments about Mets' fans during the
playoffs last season, but the seeds of the rivalry had already been
planted earlier. The Mets accused Chipper Jones of cheating after a
key three-game series last season and Mets manager Bobby Valentine
has taken his shots at the Braves in the past. A look at what has
made this rivalry so intense. (Wilkinson, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 60-70.

   BBO-MELTINGPOT _ Baseball, more than ever, has become much more
than America's pastime. It's increasingly becoming a melting pot of
whites, blacks, Latins, Asians, etc., and with that has come
issues/problems regarding racism (John Rocker), marketing (Sammy
Sosa vs. Mark McGwire) and coaching and playing together (language
barriers). (Capozzi/Gutierrez, Palm Beach Post).

   BBN-GRIFFEY-IMPACT _ What does having Griffey really mean to the
Reds on the field? Cincinnati Reds fans are excited about the
coming season the way an 8-year-old kid is excited a couple of days
before Christmas. The Reds have baseball's best position player.
And they got him for a song. Their lineup is intact. Optimism
hasn't run this high since the Big Red Machine days. But in
reality, what impact will Junior Griffey have on this team, which
looks strong on offense, strong up the middle, weak at the corners.
And, oh, then there's the part of the game called pitching, a huge
question mark. (McCoy, Dayton Daily News). 25. WITH PHOTOS. WITH
</P>
<P>
   BBN-GRIFFEY-TRADE _ How might this trade compare to the one that
brought Joe Morgan, Jack Billingham and Caesar Geronimo to the
Reds, solidifying the Big Red Machine. (McCoy, Dayton Daily News).
15-18. MCKEON-GRIFFEY-MCKEON _ Now that Trader Jack has had Junior
Griffey on his team for a month, what's his take on this player?
What's their relationship? And what's Griffey's take on Ol' Trader?
Also, what's this heir apparent stuff with Griffey Sr.? (McCoy,
Dayton Daily News). 18.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-REDS-LINEUP _ This is one of the most potent lineups in
baseball. It has Larkin, Casey, Griffey and Bichette back to back
to back to back. And jack
</P>
<P>
   rabbit Pokey Reese in front of them. What will opposing pitchers
do? Fans should love the run production. (McCoy, Dayton Daily
News). 15-18.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-REDS-BOWDEN _ Reds General Manager Jim Bowden is one of the
brightest in baseball. And the story has been told before, right?
Wrong. We want to know
</P>
<P>
   exactly why fate smiles on him so often and if he's in
Cincinnati to stay. (McCoy or McClelland, Dayton Daily News). 15.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In these first days of spring, Asia Week has blown
into town like a lion and like a lamb. It brings the roar of
big-deal auctions and a big-guns art fair. It also offers a chance
to linger quietly over a fantastic array of Asian art.
</P>
<P>
   The real news, though, is that the festivities are in some ways
just a deluxe version of business as usual. Asian art in Manhattan
is not what it was a few years ago, an exotic subspecies confined
to the remoter quarters of museums. At some point in the 1990s, it
broke through the silence barrier and assumed a position of
prominence from which it is not likely to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   New York still doesn't create the kind of hoopla that London
does for  &UR; its &LR;  Asia week in November, with a schedule of lectures,
scholarly symposiums and special exhibitions linking the worlds of
museums, academia and commerce. Christie's, in its new Rockefeller
Center digs, is heading in that direction with its show titled
``Treasures From Ancient Beijing,'' but there's a lot more that
could be done in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the situation is impressive. The Metropolitan Museum of
Art, with its pan-Asian master plan complete, is mounting superb
exhibitions. One, ``The World of Scholars' Rocks: Gardens, Studios
and Paintings,'' fills the Chinese painting galleries; a choice
gathering from the famed Mary Griggs Burke collection of Japanese
art opens next week.
</P>
<P>
   Asia Society, which really picked up steam in the 1990s, is in
the process of expanding its headquarters but has organized two
off-site shows. A selection from its John D. Rockefeller
collection, ``Spiritual Perfection: Religious Sculpture of South
and Southeast Asia,'' is installed at Christie's former home on
Park Avenue. And Grey Art Gallery downtown is the host for ``Sheer
Realities: Clothing and Power in 19th-Century Philippines.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Manhattan's best Asian galleries _ among them the
Chinese Porcelain Co., Kaikodo, J.J. Lally, M.D. Flacks and China
2000 Fine Art _ are being joined by energetic newcomers
specializing in contemporary work.
</P>
<P>
   And it says much for the health of the local scene that many
young Asian artists have settled in New York or have settled in the
way that artists settle anywhere these days: with one foot here,
the other there and much time spent in transit.
</P>
<P>
   International Asian Art Fair
</P>
<P>
   If a single event can be said to have sparked the Asian fires,
it was probably the first International Asian Art Fair in 1996. The
fair, which opens Friday at the 7th Regiment Armory, is a shrewd
mix of promotion and education. Top dealers from around the world
rustle up top-notch things, and many of those things have no
equivalent in the city's public collections.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for any fair, especially one that came out of the
gate with such force, to sustain momentum. Fresh material is always
scarce; audiences get spoiled. The strain is showing a bit in the
2000 edition. The show looks both more subdued and more cluttered
than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But item for item, it's still the best game in town. If the
Armory were housing Western-style old master work of quality
comparable to some of the Asian art on view, Park Avenue would be a
logjam of double-parked limos.
</P>
<P>
   Several familiar galleries are making return visits. Gisele
Croes from Brussels is on hand with her dark, bank vault-style
booth of early Chinese bronzes, and Chinese Porcelain Co. weighs in
with a spectacular life-size pottery figure of a supercilious court
official. Intended as a tomb guardian, he apparently kept evil at
bay just by giving attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Japanese culture will want to visit Hiroshi Yanagi
Oriental Art from Kyoto and Judith Dowling from Boston, first-time
exhibitors. Work at Yanagi ranges from a cinematic Edo period
screen to a little wood-carved Shinto goddess. Another Edo screen,
at Dowling, depicts a kind of neo-Confucian day-care center, with
small children engaged in edifying pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Art by living Chinese artists, of variable interest, seems to be
at an all-time high this year, which makes practical sense. The
supply is pretty much limitless, and authenticity is rarely an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goedhuis, a dealer in classical art who has led the pack
in the contemporary area, is offering recent ink paintings by Gu
Gan. The Chinese Porcelain Co. has a single flower painting, at
once pinpoint fine and flamboyant, by Liu Dan. (The artist is also
seen in a solo show at the gallery's Park Avenue shop).
</P>
<P>
   China 2000 has hand-painted, high-color Mao-era posters. (``Read
the Red Book to strengthen your will,'' says one.) Ethan Cohen Fine
Arts, in a debut appearance, presents a contingent of Chinese
conceptual artists who appeared in the Asia Society's ``Inside Out:
New Chinese Art'' two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   What pushes the Asian Fair into the must-see category, though,
is its wealth of South Asian art. On the whole, New York gets a
healthy diet of Chinese and Japanese work these days. But even a
subsistence helping of Indian art is rare, and this is what the
fair provides.
</P>
<P>
   Just go to the booth shared by Doris and Nancy Wiener, where you
will see a heart-stopping 10th-century sculpture of a divine maiden
carved from West Indian marble and a small, shapely figure of the
goddess of music, Sarasvati, her finger poised on the string of her
vina. Their voluptuousness is tempered by the figure of a seated
nude Jain deity as light and cool as a rain cloud.
</P>
<P>
   John Eskenazi also has amazing Indian things, ranging from a
serene Gandharan Buddha to a dynamic bronze icon of the goddess
Durga. Bristling with karmic vibes and perched on the back of a
yelping lion (his face almost all mouth), she is a ``folk'' image
of a kind that has only recently received museum recognition.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At Spink, you will find a concentration of hot-red sandstone
Mughal carving, and at Alexander Goetz a near life-size standing
Buddha from the first or second century, his face incandescent with
peculiar spiritual verve and eagerness that marked the early phases
of this religious art.
</P>
<P>
   And there is painting. An illuminated Sikh holy book and an
action-packed Kangra miniature, unusually large, of Krishna and
Radha head the starry list at Sam Fogg. Terence McInerney has a
panoramic painting of a royal procession, with a lush, humid forest
backdrop, from the Deccan. And at Art of the Past, look for a
dashing Kalighat image of Durga that Matisse would have flipped
over.
</P>
<P>
   If you are in the market for an art of glamour, humor,
sensuality, profound devotion, conceptual daring and formal
perfection, Indian art is for you, and the International Asian Art
Fair, even in a relatively sleepy year, is a great place to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Society
</P>
<P>
   Certain institutional shows are timed to coincide with Asia
Week, and two stand out. One is ``For the New Century: Japanese
Treasures From the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco'' at the Japan
Society. It's just the right size, installed with plenty of air,
and for a total immersion in sheer beauty it's hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 or so objects have been chosen by Yoko Woodson, a curator
at the Asian Art Museum, which is currently awaiting a new Gae
Aulenti-designed home, scheduled for completion in 2002. The
objects here are arranged chronologically, beginning with one of
the museum's best-known images, an exceptionally personable Haniwa
warrior, wearing balloonlike trousers and a hi-there smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Buddhist sampling that follows pairs two wonderful
12th-century figures, a seated Amida Buddha and a svelte Kannon.
Facing them is a 14th- to 15th-century painted scroll of a cosmic
mandala, its packed, Collier brothers heaven framed by narrative
panels as complex as those in any Renaissance altarpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Farther along, a famed 15th-century Shigaraki jar seems to
embody an abstract landscape of its own within a drift of snowy
glaze. (Don't miss the astute wall text comment on such ceramics by
the film director Akira Kurosawa, who was himself a painter.)
Monumental vistas in the form of screen paintings round out the
selection.
</P>
<P>
   It's a vaulting leap from 12th-century Buddhas to the gritty
contemporary photographs of Daido Moriyama that filled the same
gallery just last fall. But these are the kinds of interesting
moves Japan Society Gallery, under its director Alexandra Munroe,
is making these days.
</P>
<P>
   China Institute
</P>
<P>
   A very different kind of exhibition, but one no less entrancing,
is ``Dawn of the Yellow Earth: Ancient Chinese Ceramics From the
Meiyintang Collection'' at China Institute, that pot of cultural
gold gleaming away on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   The compact show, organized by Regina Krahl, focuses on early
Neolithic work, the study of which is still at the baby-steps
stage. Recent archaeology has moved the Neolithic in China back
much further than suspected, lining up its cultures timewise with
the civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Krahl offers her theories on the subject with wise
circumspection. Not in doubt at all, however, is the urbane
stylishness of the art itself. A plump pottery pigeon looks
Brancusian; a pantaloon-shaped tripod jug is ur-Louise Bourgeois.
And that Majiayao bowl with the zippy brushed-on curves might have
been done by Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation is straightforward but with lots of nice
touches. A lineup of five black ``egg shell'' goblets, with slitted
hollow stems so that light shows through, is an inspired stroke.
The good-looking catalog, of a kind regularly produced by China
Institute, is a valuable addition to a little-explored field.
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Lally
</P>
<P>
   J.J. Lally also includes appealing examples of Neolithic pottery
vessels in its Asia Week show titled ``Ancient Chinese Ceramics and
Tomb Sculptures.''
</P>
<P>
   A stout oval tripod vessel with a ruddy patina and pointy legs
has the heft of monumental sculpture. But a squat cup-size bowl,
with a painted fishnet design and a belt of bouncy white dots, is
pure old-fashioned fun. You just want to hold this little item in
your hand, as some lucky person did millenniums ago.
</P>
<P>
   The same lyrical spirit turns elegant in a set of gray pottery
figures of female dancers from the Han period (206 B.C.-220 A.D.).
Each, in her long-sleeve robe, is differently posed, and if one
looks quickly from one to the next, they seem to turn, flip-book
fashion, into a single figure, a dancer in action, changing
positions and gestures. Who could ever think of Chinese art as
static? It's bursting with kinetic life.
</P>
<P>
   Guiseppe Eskenazi
</P>
<P>
   Guiseppe Eskenazi, cousin of John Eskenazi at the Asian Fair, is
in town at PaceWildenstein with his fourth annual New York show,
``Masterpieces From Ancient China: Millennium Exhibition.'' The
London-based Eskenazi Gallery is 40 years old, and it's celebrating
its anniversary with fireworks in the form of 10 dazzling Chinese
bronzes.
</P>
<P>
   They are all high-end luxury objects, or parts of objects, with
jewel-like workmanship, from an archaic bronze ritual wine vessel
in the shape of an owl and a drum base entwined with a serpentine
dragon, to a pair of chariot fittings depicting dragons chasing
phoenixes in inlaid gold and silver.
</P>
<P>
   The most touch-inviting object, though, as at Lally, is a cup.
Dated from the Early Western Han period, it is made from thin
plaques of jade fixed in place by a fine, gold-inlaid bronze frame,
and it is supported by feisty pint-size phoenixes that seem to be
chirping, or whatever phoenixes do.

&HT;     JUDGING PUBLIC FIGURES: DO SINS OUTWEIGH ACHIEVEMENTS? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, March 26)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Few individuals today recognize the name of David
Wark Griffith or know of his achievements and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet anyone who enjoys motion pictures owes a debt of gratitude
to D.W. Griffith, who was, in the words of three-time Oscar winner
Frank Capra, ``the giant of all filmmakers ... the Leonardo (da
Vinci) of the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiography, Capra wrote that everything added to
filmmaking _ ``sound, color, technique'' _ since Griffith released
``The Birth of a Nation'' in 1915, is just ``embellishment.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Griffith who pioneered the conversion of powerful
panoramic stories to the screen, thus moving the art of movie
making from the era of jumpy, nickelodeon fare to sweeping dramatic
productions.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standards, his silent-screen productions appear
primitive affairs. But they are classics that were unequaled in
their day. Certainly, he was a motion picture genius.
</P>
<P>
   It was shocking, therefore, to read that the Directors Guild of
America has stripped Griffith's name from the prestigious annual
award it has been presenting for many years because the great movie
pioneer was a racist.
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in the post-Civil War South, Griffith reflected
the disdain that millions of southerners felt toward African
Americans whose fathers and mothers had been their parents' slaves.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Birth of a Nation,'' which opened a whole new and
exciting horizon for movie makers, the villains were northern
carpetbaggers and freed slaves, as they had been in the novel from
which it was adapted. The heroes were members of the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   All my adult life I have opposed racial prejudice and cannot
defend Griffith's attitude toward blacks. Yet, I believe the
Directors Guild erred badly in removing the name of a great motion
picture pioneer from its award. African Americans have suffered
badly in our country, but demeaning Griffith does not help them or
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   The Guild's action raises a pertinent question as to whether we
should judge individuals by their achievements or their sins _ or
try to balance one against the other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, a colleague of mine became irate when he heard that the
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was going to award a
special Oscar to Charlie Chaplin, who was seen by millions of
Americans as a communist sympathizer.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to explain to him that Chaplin was being honored for his
tremendous contribution to motion pictures and not because of his
political beliefs and activities. But my friend refused to accept
such reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   A similar problem exists with three presidents of recent
vintage: Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. Is Johnson
to be judged solely on the tragedy of Vietnam, or is that disaster
balanced by his monumental legislative achievements, including
Medicare, Medicaid, federal aid to education, protection of the
environment and an end to legal racial segregation?
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Nixon was dishonorable. But are we not now mature
enough to recognize that he had a distinguished record in foreign
policy and a good one in domestic policy before the horrors of
Watergate destroyed his presidency?
</P>
<P>
   What results await us when we try to weigh Clinton's tenure,
which includes his amoral personal conduct as well as the longest
period of economic prosperity in American history?
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 anti-Vietnam War liberals clamored for the Democratic
Party presidential nomination of Robert F. Kennedy with Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman J. William Fulbright for vice
president because both opposed the war. What the war critics
conveniently overlooked was the fact that Fulbright, as a senator
from Arkansas, had opposed every effort to extend civil rights to
African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-war critics had blinded themselves to the man's dark
side while illuminating his bright side. Little did many of them
realize that earlier, President John F. Kennedy had to forego his
desire to name Fulbright as secretary of state because his
anti-civil-rights record would have made him anathema in a number
of places, including Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The drive for a Kennedy-Fulbright ticket ended, of course, with
Robert Kennedy's assassination.
</P>
<P>
   We do not strip the names from memorials to George Washington,
Thomas Jefferson, James Madison or Andrew Jackson because those
great leaders owned slaves. So why do it with an award honoring
Griffith?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently in an effort to make amends for the racial bigotry of
``The Birth of a Nation,'' Griffith in 1916 produced
``Intolerance,'' a gigantic spectacle in which he wove together
four stories of prejudice from Biblical times to the beginning of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have called ``Intolerance'' the greatest movie ever
made, although it became a costly box-office flop that almost
bankrupted Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting this year's DGA award, the talented Steven Spielberg
took note of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to ask myself a very tough question when I heard the DGA
was making this change,'' he said in his acceptance speech on March
11. ``Would I have agreed with changing the name of one of the
highest awards of our profession, if it was widely known that that
award had been named after a director whose portrayal of Jewish
people fostered negative stereotyping? ... I would have had to
agree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   But the National Society of Film Critics said the decision was a
``depressing example of political correctness as an erasure and
rewriting of American history.''
</P>
<P>
   That is true. The DGA did not condone Griffith's racial bigotry
when, in his name, it honored great motion picture directorial
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Revision of history, which has become popular in recent years,
is a dangerous game to play.

 NEW YORK: phoenixes do.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This object was probably meant for ritual use. But whoever drank
from it would discover a glorious pattern of flowerlike dragons
unfurling on the bottom, and held up to the light just so, the cup
would glow like a lamp. Once again, Eskenazi leaves New Yorkers
with an image to treasure. Kaikodo
</P>
<P>
   Kaikodo also delivers stimulating sights in a dramatically
staged exhibition titled ``Realms of Faith.'' Some of the work is
specifically religious, as in a 13th- or 14th-century painting of
the formidable Japanese Buddhist poet-saint Kukai, known as Kobo
Daishi, who wears a monk's robe and holds tantric instruments, and
in a colossal polychrome stucco head of a crowned bodhisattva,
protectively flanked by painted screens.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual, with its mingling of certainty and doubt, is the
substance of Chinese and Japanese landscape paintings, of which
there are some fine examples here. Among the commercial venues for
Asian art in the city, Kaikodo, with its scholarly foundations and
an expansive program that includes new art, is exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   Museum of Chinese in the Americas
</P>
<P>
   It's always a moving experience to visit the Museum of Chinese
in the Americas, in an old building in Chinatown that serves as a
neighborhood cultural center. The museum's lantern-shaped central
display is filled with relics of immigrant life. A second gallery
holds new art.
</P>
<P>
   On view now is work of the artist and filmmaker Brenda Joy Lem,
a third-generation Chinese-Canadian living in Toronto. Her spare
installation is the visual equivalent of oral history. She has
silkscreened blowups of old family photographs onto bannerlike
vertical strips of cloth and added brief quotations from the people
depicted to form an impressionistic chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are accordion-style books in which she looks back
on her own childhood. In one, based on the metaphor of nourishment,
she records meals her mother prepared for her as a child and
includes remembered recipes. Lem's resonant art exactly complements
a vibrant memory bank of a museum that exists very much in the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Asian-American Arts Center
</P>
<P>
   The Asian-American Arts Center, founded and run by Robert Lee in
Chinatown, has had a full-time gallery since 1984. Many notable
artists, young and old, have exhibited here, sharing their space
with the center's community educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   On at the moment is an inventive three-woman show organized by
Mihee Ahn and titled ``Apt. No. 3 F.'' Two of the artists work
entirely with discarded materials. Jean Shin fills the bedroom
section of the exhibition with sculptures made of lost socks from
laundromats, which she stuffs with lint.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese-born Niizeki Hiromi, in charge of the living room,
has stitched a curtain from junk mail envelopes, with hundreds of
small plastic windows. Yangah Ham, from Korea, shows videos of
herself showering and projects films of flickering landscape onto
the bottom of a cratelike box that serves as the apartment's
bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   The show points in several directions. It may be seen as a
version of the ``apartment art'' popular in China, where artists
exhibit at home to avoid the hassles of officialdom. It is also a
reminder of the difficulty of finding living quarters in New York
with ever-escalating rents: you literally have to make your own
home. Finally, it speaks of the intimacy of shared space and
sensibilities, an old story for artists and immigrants alike.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Cohen Fine Arts
</P>
<P>
   Farther west in Tribeca, the young dealer Ethan Cohen has opened
a street-level gallery concentrating on new work by Asian artists.
As its present exhibition, ``Conceptual Ink,'' demonstrates,
exciting things are happening here.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen provides an up-to-the-minute look at the role of
ink-and-brush painting in China, as a formal and intellectual
medium, and he has assembled some terrific work as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Gu Wenda and Xu Bing, two artists familiar in New York, come
through with first-rate pieces. Huang Chih Yang from Taipei
contributes three huge hanging scrolls of fantastic, whipped-up
figures. Xing Fei moves calligraphy into the third dimension with
her knitted ``strokes.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the eminent painter and collector C.C. Wang is
represented by calligraphy brushed on pages of New York City phone
books, joining the hand-wrought, individualist mark-making of one
culture with printed evidence of the cultural diversity of another.
</P>
<P>
   Wang is now in his 90s, which gives some idea of the age range
covered by ``contemporary'' in this fascinatingly varied gathering.
But his painted books, with their generous conceptual gesture, look
fresh, youthful, poetic and springy. These are qualities inherent
in much of the art of Asia. No wonder New Yorkers have taken it to
heart.

EERIE `WAKING' WORKS AS GHOST STORY AS WELL AS ROMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 OUR GRADE: B  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hero of the eerie romantic ghost story ``Waking the Dead''
is Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup), a law student who, in the winter
of 1974, suddenly learns his fiancee, Sarah (Jennifer Connolly),
has been killed by a bomb set off by agents of the Chilean
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back two years to 1972. Fielding is a right-leaning young
Coast Guard officer intent on a big political career who meets the
idealistic and left-leaning Sarah in his brother's office, falls
madly in love with her, and begins a relationship that defies their
ideological differences.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward 10 years to 1982, and Fielding _ a cocky, shoo-in
candidate put up by the local Democratic Party machine to fill a
recently vacated seat in the U.S. Congress _ abruptly, out of
nowhere, starts seeing the image of the dead Sarah virtually
everywhere he goes. But when he looks again, the image has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   From this intriguing setup, the movie flashes back and forth
between the two decades, tracing the course of the love affair and
the events leading to Sarah's death in the '70s, and the emotional
crisis that arises in Fielding in the '80s as he realizes he is
facing either the ghost or the reality of the love whose loss he
never got over.
</P>
<P>
   It's a likably odd little riff on the basic ``Vertigo'' premise,
nicely adapted from a novel by Scott Spencer (``Endless Love'').
The film was directed by Keith Gordon (``The Chocolate War,''
``Mother Night''), who has a keen eye for period detail and a
pleasing penchant for letting his actors develop their characters
in long, somewhat static, dialogue scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Intentional or not (and, given the timing, probably not), the
film apes the tone and visual style of ``The Sixth Sense,'' with
its slow fades to black between scenes, its resolutely somber mood,
its refreshing lack of tricky special effects, its minimalist urban
locations and its bleak, wintry setting.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also very much its own thing, a film with a real depth,
resonance and texture, and room for an ensemble of supporting
characters. Among them are Hal Holbrook as an old-line machine pol,
Janet McTeer as Fielding's artist sister, Paul Hipp as Fielding's
reprehensible publisher brother, and Molly Parker as the
long-suffering new love in Fielding's life.
</P>
<P>
   It's not quite as successful as Gordon's last film _ the
underrated 1996 Kurt Vonnegut adaptation ``Mother Night'' _ but
``Waking the Dead'' definitely works. Crudup and Connolly are both
unusual and unusually appealing young stars, the chemistry between
them is potent, and their teaming creates a palpable sense of
haunting, breathless romance.
</P>
<P>
   Waking the Dead. Directed by Keith Gordon. Written by Robert
Dillon and Keith Gordon. Cast: Billy Crudup, Jennifer Connolly, Hal
Holbrook, Janet McTeer. USA Films. 103 minutes. Rated R for
language, sexuality and brief nudity.

(DW) 
 By JOHN RUSSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the more disconcerting shows of the season
consists of drawings by James Castle, who was born in 1900 in
Garden Valley, Idaho. The youngest of seven children, he grew up in
the family house, which doubled as a dry goods store and the local
post office. His mother was a midwife who went about her duties on
horseback.
</P>
<P>
   The family house was a busy place. If James Castle took little
or no part in its activities, it was because he was born deaf and
mute. He made no attempt to mitigate these handicaps. (Sent to a
special school when he was 12, he refused to take any part in its
activities and was eventually sent home.)
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that interested him was drawing. It was in
drawing that he could record and structure his existence. His
parents did their best to foster this activity and would have
gladly provided him with conventional drawing materials. But he
insisted that he could draw only with materials provided (and often
invented) by himself.
</P>
<P>
   He made his own substitutes for pencils and pens. He also made
his own colors and worked with found papers, soot, string, colored
pulp and cardboard. He used sharpened sticks instead of brushes.
</P>
<P>
   Disregarding the very notion of ordinary ink, he used _ so the
catalog tells us _ ``a composite of spit mixed with soot taken from
wood-burning and, later, oil-burning stoves.'' When color was
called for, he made a pulp from water and ground colored paper that
he mashed into the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Put like that, these methods may sound messy almost to the point
of perversity. But to see a large room full of Castle's mostly
quite small drawings is, on the contrary, a remarkable experience.
His lifelong subject matter was his own surroundings, sometimes
drawn from memory and at other times directly. They were never
``improved'' or prettified, although sometimes a patch of bright
color might sing out from the matchboxes or scraps of found paper
from the post office. (Mail order catalogs, left over from the post
office, were useful but not flaunted.)
</P>
<P>
   As he had never been taught drawing, he clearly went his own
way, but with a sureness of touch and an intensity of concentration
that have a cumulative effect as our tour proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   What emerges in the end is an autobiography in which scene after
scene is set, but nothing is ever seen to happen. Clothes are hung
but never worn. Dishes are laid out on a shelf, as if in readiness
for a little party, but no guest ever comes. There is an ``interior
with friends,'' but the friends are not brought to life. We even
see the interior of the general store in some detail, but nobody is
at home.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that all the interiors we see are ones that Castle
had lived in and knew in their every detail. The same applies to
the much smaller number of farm exteriors. But whether the scenes
are indoors or out, James Castle's is the predominant presence. He
does not need to show us what he looks like. ``I draw, therefore I
am'' was his lifelong attitude.
</P>
<P>
   It is important that these are not examples of what is sometimes
called ``other art.'' They are everyday art, often at a remarkably
high level of sureness, stage setting and inner conviction. The
more you see of it, the more you want to see. There is no generic
Castle. ``Seen one, seen them all'' would be a totally mistaken
response.
</P>
<P>
   They are not naive, either. Castle drew only what he knew and
not what he guessed at. To the actual execution of each drawing _
the choice of materials, the mixing and making of their physical
substances, and sometimes their wrapping or tying up _ he proved
himself the master of a craft of which he is the only known
practitioner.
</P>
<P>
   Never to have spoken a normal word and never to have heard a
human voice are terrible deprivations. It does not seem that Castle
ever learned to write. His drawings were his conversation, his
autobiography, his report from a world of silence and
speechlessness.
</P>
<P>
   It is in his drawings that he talked, in his own way. He knew
what to stress, when to leave off and when to spring a little
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   He also did the work of a social historian in an area and at a
time that has not often been recorded with such subtlety and so
detailed an appreciation. For that, thanks are due to Jay Tobler, a
longtime student of Castle's work. His catalog notes are required
reading.

<P>
   If he ever escapes the interminable backyard barbecue that
begins this movie, Luke (Cheadle) will lead a manned flight to the
red planet. During the party, though, he and the NASA gang all
agree that Jim McConnell (Sinise) should be commanding the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since McConnell's wife, also an astronaut, became ill and
died, McConnell has been too depressed for space work. Now he can
only smile wistfully while everybody makes it more than clear what
a shame it is that he (like the Sinise character in ``Apollo 13'')
will stay behind.
</P>
<P>
   Just as well. Cut to Cydonia, Mars, where Luke and crew spot a
white nose-shaped thing jutting from the red hilltops. Approaching
the area cautiously, they send what must be the wrong signals
because a giant whirlwind arises, destroying them and revealing a
huge human face.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Earth there is nothing to do but mount an investigatory
mission. This time the commander is the jaunty Woody Blake
(Robbins), but he insists that McConnell be included. Also along
are Terri (Nielsen), who seems mainly interested in getting her
hands on Woody, and Phil (O'Connell), an excitable techie who cries
``Please work!'' in tight situations.
</P>
<P>
   Many hazards and one calamity mar the approach to the Martian
surface. On the ground we learn why gardening is a good skill to
have on other planets. But it is left to McConnell to figure out
the face and what it wants. Buckle up for a celestial crescendo. &QL;

   VIOLENCE People implode and fly apart, and while this isn't
extremely graphic, it is real enough to upset some young viewers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX No actual sex, but Woody and Terri float around cooing,
smooching and growling at each other to the point where one thinks
this mission is about to sail off on another tangent altogether. &QL;

<P>
   Too stunning by half for the fix she's in, Erin Brockovich
(Roberts) finds herself dropped from the sky with three children,
no prospects and no money. Two ex-husbands and plenty of attitude
indicate that Erin isn't that easy to be around on occasion, but it
remains all but impossible to pin destitution on Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   But on with the story, which is a true one. After discovering
her life experiences count for little on the job market, Erin
manages to talk her way into the employ of a rumpled
ambulance-chasing lawyer named Ed (Finney). Assigning her to filing
and sorting, Ed hands her a box of stuff pertaining to a pro bono
real estate matter. Taking the material home with her, Erin notices
something odd. Mixed in with papers about a house sale are the
homeowner's medical records.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping into her battered flivver, Erin drives deep into the
desertlike Los Angeles exurbs to interview the woman named in the
file. Here begins a movielong expose of a power company's efforts
to avoid the fact that chromium from its plants is spreading
illness and death.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty abrasive around the office, Erin talks Ed into letting
her investigate and soon is crawling around wells, collecting dead
polliwogs and running into scores of folks with histories of
cancer, miscarriages and hysterectomies.
</P>
<P>
   On the romantic front she comes up with George (Eckhart), a kind
of Heck's Angels motorcyclist and sweet guy who is content to
baby-sit in return for being Erin's new boyfriend. Meanwhile, the
power company turns threatening, Ed begins to realize he has lucked
into one of the biggest damage cases in United States history and
Erin, bursting with righteous indignation, shows she's up for a
court battle. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Erin uses her cleavage to help the case, and there is other
talk about sex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY The dialogue is set up for Brockovich retorts and
wisecracks, many of them loaded with obscenities. &QL;

<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-14 Language earns the R rating. If that isn't too much
of a problem, parents wouldn't be entirely remiss in letting
children attend a film that, for all its stacking of the emotional
deck in favor of Roberts/Brockovich, is entertaining and relatively
harmless.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP They'll go if they like. &QL;

<P>
   FINAL DESTINATION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Kerr Smith. Kristen Cloke, Seann William
Scott, Tony Todd &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by James Wong &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R 110 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rustling curtains and lightning streaks signal a hex on the
Mount Abraham High School senior trip to Paris, but it takes a
premonition of disaster to make Alex Browning (Sawa) rear out of
his seat and frantically want off the plane shortly before takeoff.
In the ensuing commotion he and six others from the group end up
back in the terminal, where they watch the ascending plane explode
and sprinkle the ocean with flaming debris.
</P>
<P>
   What starts as another Hollywood salute to commercial aviation
then settles down to a story of teen-age horror. Those victims on
the flight were meant to die, and by leaving the plane beforehand
the survivors defied Death's plan. But that doesn't excuse them
from the process. Just home from the airport, one shaken student
manages to not so accidentally strangle himself in his bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a truly unusual mishap, a teacher who also left the
plane spills some vodka into her computer, whereupon it detonates
and slashes her throat with a piece of metal and sets off other
bizarre incidents that culminate in her entire house blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   Since Alex seems to have foreknowledge, he is of primary
interest to the FBI. On the run, he and another survivor named
Clear (Larter) must figure out who's next on Death's list, not that
it matters much. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE This is a blood bath _ not a pretty sight in the
least. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Maybe later, but for now there are other matters to attend
to. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Obscenity to match. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14-17 Reaching for the satiric flavor of other ``Scream''
knockoffs with a supernatural twist, the film will be a hoot to
many teen-agers. &QL;

FIENNES SIBLINGS TEAM UP FOR CHILLY `ONEGIN' ADAPTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is an aloofness to director Martha Fiennes' adaptation of
Aleksandr Pushkin's 150-year-old tragedy about infatuation and
loss, but it's hard to fault her for the chilliness that permeates
her stunning movie.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly its main character, Evgeny Onegin (Ralph Fiennes, the
director's brother), is no hearth of warmth. He's a disaffected
Russian dilettante who regretfully, but out of necessity, leaves a
dissolute life of gambling and romance in St. Petersburg after he
inherits a country estate from his late uncle.
</P>
<P>
   In the bleak and cold rural place, Onegin has little to do but
look for ways to fill his idle time. So the bored womanizer begins
to flirt with Olga (Lena Headey), fiancee of the passionate,
insecure Vladimir (Toby Stephens). But it is really Tatyana (Liv
Tyler), Olga's younger sister, who catches his eye.
</P>
<P>
   In a quest for her love that begets disappointment, Onegin must
muster the courage to understand his own heart _ even if it
perpetuates the loss of that which he purports to love most.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Fienne's adaptation of Pushkin's novel is eerily
beautiful, stark and wintry, with an exceptional and haunting
visual scheme. The film is so full of atmosphere that ``Onegin''
might be a completely chilly trip if not for the performances of
Headey and Stephens (son of Dame Maggie Smith) as impassioned
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Fiennes is so appropriately iceberglike that he could sink
the Titanic. While his icy persona works in the context of the
story, we can never warm up to him. His Onegin is clueless to
anything other than the sensual world, and is finally more
repellent than sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Onegin. Directed by Martha Fiennes. Written by Michael
Ignatieff, Peter Itedgui. Cast: Ralph Fiennes, Liv Tyler, Lena
Headey, Martin Donovan, Toby Stephens. Samuel Goldwyn. 106 minutes.
Not rated.

COBBLING TOGETHER THIS REALLY CUTE YOUNG BAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area; check local listings.)  
 (af)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a scientific formula behind the hottest boy bands like
'N Sync. You need the cute blonde guy, the sensitive dark-eyed guy
and the guy who looks like he's really 34.
</P>
<P>
   If the outer age limit of the group in ``Making the Band'' seems
lower, more like 27, that's because this series is ``The Real
World'' for 10-year-olds. The show constructs from scratch a new
group called O-Town, with cameras capturing auditions that pare
down the applicants to the eight chosen at the end of Frinight's
premiere. Over the next weeks they will compete for the five slots
in the band, and O-Town will be ready to record, make money and
appear on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, grown-ups can mull over a philosophical issue: even
more than MTV's ``Real World,'' which throws strangers together in
one house, even more than CBS' summer ``Survivor,'' which will
throw strangers together on one tropical island, this kiddie
version of a reality show depicts a purely manufactured
``reality.'' O-Town is a shrewdly devised commercial product, as
artificial as real people can be.
</P>
<P>
   That cynical view exists well beneath the engaging surface,
though. The band members' personalities are appealing, and among
the 25 semifinalists (ages 18 to 25) a few stand out right away.
There is Ikaika from Honolulu, cute and brown-eyed, with a passing
resemblance to Billy Crudup.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob, with curly blonde hair, vaguely brings to mind 'N Sync's
heartthrob Justin Timberlake, though he looks more like an earlier
teen-age idol, Mark Wahlberg. Echoing established stars may be more
at a premium here than being a fresh face.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor, a tall Californian, looks mature but as the cameras find
him in his family's kitchen, he cries when saying that if he makes
the band he'll use the money to help his parents. He is biracial,
and though the show (at least in its first episodes) does not
discuss the group's need for ethnic balance, it is clearly a factor
in the package. And Erik can really sing, which is a help but not
anyone's first priority.
</P>
<P>
   A stylish mix of candid documentary film and
talking-to-the-camera interviews, the show looks like ``The Real
World'' for a reason; it has the same producers. Musical scenes of
the auditions and of dance and vocal practices become sharply
edited mini-music videos; another producer is MTV.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a good reason why O-Town's slick choreographed
look and syrupy, homogenized sound is familiar. On and off camera,
the figure behind the group is Lou Pearlman, who was manager of 'N
Sync and the Backstreet Boys until lawsuits by those groups,
settled out of court, freed them from what sounds like the musical
version of indentured servitude. (Don't expect any mention of
lawsuits on this show.)
</P>
<P>
   On screen, the portly Pearlman resembles an older version of the
actor Philip Seymour Hoffman, so good in creepy roles; this is not
exactly the image of the benevolent father.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is happily on the boys, though. The eight finalists
move into a house together in Orlando, the home base that gives the
band its name. The cameras trail along as the boys phone their old
girlfriends and try to be true, though there are groupies in the
wings. Everything is perfectly calculated to play to
pre-adolescents' obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   And though ``Making the Band'' is not meant to offer an overt
lesson in evolution, the eight finalists have entered a Darwinian
world. Three will be eliminated, but no sooner than episode 10.
There is plenty of time for friendly bonding and fierce
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's episode ends with a vocal coach reprimanding the
boys for arriving at a practice session late. ``You already know
how many talented people are out there,'' he says. ``You
(italics)can(end italics) be replaced. Quickly.'' Apparently it's
never too soon to learn about cutthroat careerism, even in the
guise of a wholesome boy band's saga. There's reality for you. &QL;

 &HT;    Show creates interest in that junk in the attic
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Betty Carr has three items in a bag by
her side.
</P>
<P>
   She pulls them out, one by one, and tells their stories. Or what
she knows of them, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a ``very old porcelain doll,'' with a simple, flowing
dress. It was once her godmother's. Here's a figurine of a black
child eating a slice of watermelon. He's perched atop a pincushion,
an item that falls into a collector's category of ``black
memorabilia.''
</P>
<P>
   And here's a toy dog, a spooky-looking, mangy thing with wooden
wheels on its feet and holes in its face. She bought it, in a
boxful of stuff, for $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, you see his stuffing is coming out,'' Carr
says, as she points to the toy's two gnarled spots. ``I had a real
dog that was jealous of it, and he chewed it. I don't know anything
about it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's why she _ and more than 500 others _ are at the
Appraisal Fair 2000, which was held earlier this month. In its
second year, the Appraisal Fair is a free service provided by
Interior Marketplace, an upscale consignment shop in Tequesta.
Seven professional appraisers came from as far away as New York to
look at everything from oil paintings to comic books.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons so many people came out today is because of
the popularity of the public television program, ``Antiques
Roadshow.'' At least, that's what most of folks here are saying.
The show documents free antique appraisals ... and collectors'
reactions when they find out that old lamp is actually a $10,000
Tiffany. (A recent episode of the popular sitcom ``Frasier''
revolved around the upscale Crane brothers' fascination with
``Roadshow.'')
</P>
<P>
   Basically, ``Roadshow'' is making people reevaluate the stuff
that once would've gone in the box labeled, ``For Yard Sale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``See, people are really interested in what's in their attic,''
says Rusty LaScala, organizer of the Appraisal Fair. ``They really
want to know about their old possessions, and if they're valuable.
It's definitely worth investigating.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the news came at the fair. And for most folks, it was
good. Bob and Beverly Cowan were ``elated'' when their gold
bracelet was appraised for more than $2,000. Susan and Eddie Rieck
of Jupiter were surprised to hear that a reproduction of a Rodin
sculpture they bought for $100 was actually worth about $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow had items dating back to the Civil War:
Confederate bonds, letters, report cards ... all signed by Robert
E. Lee. The appraisers were a little overwhelmed, trying to make an
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   They said they'd get back to him.
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a day of heartbreak. There were a few fake
paintings, and ``antique'' dolls that were actually made only a few
years ago. And there was stuff that looked valuable but would fetch
only $100, at best. One woman was told there wasn't much of a
market for old, German-made accordions these days. Another woman
complained that her ivory business-card holder _ which was carved
in mind-boggling detail _ was worth $500 less than a simpler
carving owned by her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, there isn't much a market for that, either.
</P>
<P>
   David Hochstetler had a good day, though. He brought in a framed
original 1896 presidential campaign poster: ``McKinley and Hobart:
Republican nominees.'' The Palm Beach Gardens resident got it at a
flea market for $50 in 1988. With a little restoration, it could go
for $500.
</P>
<P>
   And Betty Carr? At first, it was bad news. Her porcelain doll,
which she thought could be at least 90 years old, was only about
50.
</P>
<P>
   The black memorabilia is worth about $75, she was told.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that creepy dog toy. At the fair, appraiser Tim
Luke examines it gingerly, and looks at Carr.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Steiff,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Carr gasps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is? Oh my GOD!'' she cries, recognizing the German name _
and its legacy in the toy business. ``I didn't know! I had no
idea!''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the condition, it could sell for $200 to $300, Luke
tells her. Not a bad return on a $10 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if it were in better shape, it could have fetched
$800 to $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh well. I can't punish the dog,'' Carr says, after the
appraisal. ``He died a long time ago.''

GERMAN WINS UNANIMOUS APPROVAL TO HEAD IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (js) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Horst Koehler of Germany became the International
Monetary Fund's managing director Thursday just as the Clinton
administration and members of Congress were discussing how the
agency might be improved.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, 57, the president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, was unanimously endorsed by the 24
members of the IMF board of directors, putting an end to an awkward
episode in which Koehler became Germany's second choice for the job
after its first candidate failed to garner broad international
support. Koehler succeeds Michel Camdessus of France.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Koehler had become a virtual certainty in recent
days. Last week, he said his goals for the 182-nation organization
included making it ``a cornerstone for promoting growth and
stability'' around the world and having a better relationship with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers talked about those very
things Thursday before the House Banking Committee, where he
defended the core missions of the IMF and its sister institution,
the World Bank. While conceding that they had made mistakes,
Summers said that the IMF and World Bank were vital, for reasons
both humanitarian and practical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Countries that are helped to succeed economically are much
more likely to become democratic, and their people more likely to
avoid debilitating disease, to learn to read and to work with human
dignity,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the experience of Germany in the 1930s to Bosnia and
Africa in more recent times, history teaches us that conflicts are
most likely in situations of economic distress, when populations
turn their frustration to nationalist leaders because of a lack of
a sense of economic opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and World Bank were created in the mid 1940s to promote
economic stability around the world and lend money to developing
countries. Congressional critics say the institutions have
sometimes doled out money unwisely to try to bring about social
change, or lent it to recipients with unclean hands. A
congressional panel headed by Allan Meltzer, an economics professor
at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, recommended recently
that the roles of the IMF and World Bank be sharply curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   Recent IMF loans to Ukraine proved embarrassing after it was
revealed that officials there might have manipulated foreign
exchange reserves to create false optimism about the country's
financial condition. Summers said the administration had found that
affair troubling and had pressed the IMF to put new lending
safeguards in place.
</P>
<P>
   Summers also used the hearings to promote his own proposals to
introduce changes in how the IMF and the World Bank work. He has
suggested that the IMF focus more on making short-term loans to
countries that have financial crises and less on long-term lending
and development assistance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The secretary also outlined a program of changes for the World
Bank, a plan first introduced in a speech earlier this week. He
said the bank should take steps to make sure that its loans do not
crowd out money that could be provided by the private sector. It
should also limit its assistance to countries that do not have a
good track record for using development loans effectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said he was troubled with the Meltzer panel's most
drastic recommendations, which the secretary said would hobble the
IMF. and World Bank to the point where they ``would no longer be
able to advance America's core values and interests around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who heads the banking
committee, said Thursday that he backed Koehler, but that the way
he was chosen ``lacked diplomatic sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States opposed the first candidate to head the IMF,
Caio Koch-Weser of Germany. Stanley Fischer of the United States,
the IMF deputy managing director, and Eisuke Sakakibara, a former
Finance Ministry official in Japan, then emerged as candidates
before Koehler won out.

`MAKING THE BAND' GOOD FOR THE DREAMER IN US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's not about being famous. This is about music.''
</P>
<P>
   With these words forming our TGIF mantra, we wade happily,
warily into the latest selective-reality series from Bunim/Murray
Productions, packagers of ``The Real World'' and ``Road Rules'' for
MTV.
</P>
<P>
   This one, called ``Making the Band,'' starts Friday night on
ABC, allowing millions more the voyeuristic thrills cable audiences
have cherished for years. Bunim/Murray Productions does this sort
of thing so often that anyone who has seen their other work will
know what's coming in Friday's one-hour setup: the teary goodbyes
at the airport, the hopeful expressions of confidence, the
immediate bonding when the gang is assembled. The big difference
this time: The selection process isn't over yet. Well, it is in
real life, but for the purposes of ``reality'' TV, it's not.
Friday, in short order, we see a thousand hopefuls whittled to 25,
and then to eight. Over the next 13 episodes, that group is further
reduced to five lucky guys who will become the hot new boy band,
O-Town, if Lou Pearlman has anything to say about it.
</P>
<P>
   Pearlman, who helped launch such pop-culture phenomena as
Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync, is assembling what he and ABC hope
will be the next pop group to send teens scurrying to the record
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The hook for TV viewers? They get to look in as the final cuts
are made. Think of it as the next best thing to having a camera in
the room the day Pete Best was told he was out as drummer of the
Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think for a minute that this is some lame-o lip-sync
agglomeration. It may not be Lennon, McCartney et al., but it's not
Milli Vanilli, either. Last November's eight-city tryouts, in
addition to gauging poise, personality and potential for making
young girls swoon, made sure that our O-Town candidates could carry
a tune, or at least pick it up and bounce it off their uvulas a few
times.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing was another matter. Some couldn't trip the light
fantastic without getting black and blue, but with a few lessons
and the knowledge that stardom is waiting in the wings, it's
amazing how even the stiffest hoofer can summon his terpsichorean
muse.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the spoken word, the one-hour premiere of
``Making the Band'' borders on tiresome. Expressions like the one
at the beginning of this piece, along with ``I can only do what I
can do,'' and ``I gave it my best,'' and ``Everybody's a winner in
this situation,'' and ``Everything happens for a reason,'' make a
baseball manager's post-game quotes sound like Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   But, if ``The Real World'' and ``Road Rules'' can be used as
benchmarks, the subsequent half-hour episodes should peel back the
layers of our eight finalists and reveal some authentic
personalities. And even if all eight continue to be as
fresh-scrubbed and downright agreeable as they seem tonight,
``Making the Band'' already promises to capture a thrill of
victory/agony of defeat ethos that's irresistible to the average
dreamer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, even if the music makes you wince, watching a bunch of
young guys have the run of a luxury pad in Orlando _ O-Town, get
it? _ as they chase their dreams is like having a backstage pass
every week.
</P>
<P>

male pop band. One-hour series premiere is Friday on ABC. Parental

 &HT;    Appraise-worthy item was right in plain sight
 &HT;    By Chris Hutchins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The plan: Go to the Appraisal Fair 2000,
talk to some folks, come back with a story.
</P>
<P>
   And while you're at it, the boss said, take something of your
own to be appraised.
</P>
<P>
   Cool.
</P>
<P>
   So I went home and started thinking. The synapses fired for a
good half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Should I take in some of my vintage ``Star Wars'' toys? How
about my Lego collection, complete with two very hard-to-find
``viewscreen'' pieces thatappeared in only one set from the late
1970s? I couldn't forget my growing collection of DC superhero
action figures, or my comic books.
</P>
<P>
   I grinned. Decisions, decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But the smile faltered. I'm right out of college. I'm really not
old enough _ or wealthy enough _ to have acquired anything truly
antique-y. Anything I consider ``valuable'' is low-quality,
mass-produced, and less than 20 years old. I realized I had no
one-of-a-kind treasures in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I don't even have an attic.
</P>
<P>
   But the synapses kept firing: What about ``Superman 75,'' the
issue where the Man of Steel is killed by a supervillain? Nah, too
common. My bootleg Beatles CDs? Nope. Too illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket stubs from a B-52s concert?
</P>
<P>
   Old college textbooks?
</P>
<P>
   My high school ID card?
</P>
<P>
   I shuddered. Was there anything I owned _ anything at all _ that
was valuable?
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, Beethoven's ``Ode To Joy'' blared in my ears. I
looked at the walls in my apartment and saw the answer: Two framed
magazine stories, personality profiles I had written two years ago,
signed by the folks I had interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably never heard of Devin Grayson and Bernie
Wrightson, but that doesn't matter. Devin writes comic books.
Bernie draws them. Devin's been in the comic-book business for
about three years; Bernie, about 30. I went to their homes and
interviewed them back in '97, for Wizard magazine.
</P>
<P>
   And this is what I'd take to the Appraisal Fair. Bernie, with
his blue-inked invitation: ``Hey Chris! Come on out to L.A.! Cold
beer's on me!'' And Devin, with her polite compliments: ``It was
nice getting to know you as you got to know me.'' Truly unique
items. Probably not worth $20 between them, but unique nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   When I got to the fair, I was pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wrote the story. It's your byline there, on the page. And
you had these artists sign it to you. Collectors go crazy for that
stuff,'' appraiser Tim Luke told me. ``But because they signed it
to you, it limits the interested parties. In essence, you've
limited this to all the 'Chrises' of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   I could live with that.
</P>
<P>
   If I were to sell Devin's autograph, Luke said, it'd go for
anywhere from $75 to $125. See, appraising for the comic-book
market is tricky: The fan base is ferocious, but fickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have a fan say, 'Wow. I gotta have this' and another
might say, 'I don't want that,''' Luke explained. ``This is
difficult to say. You've got the signature, but there's not a whole
lot of value right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernie's autograph was a different story. He's been drawing
horror comics for the past three decades. He's worked with Stephen
King. He's considered the father of the modern horror comic. His
original artwork has sold for thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great piece, because Bernie is such a fantastic
artist,'' Luke said. ``And his signature is known by most comic
fans. Some say, 'Oh my gosh, I'd buy anything signed by Bernie
Wrightson.' ... If you were to sell it now, it could go for $125 to
$200.''
</P>
<P>
   Wow. Two hundred clams for a hastily written invitation to get
soused. God, I love this country.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Luke what would increase the value of my framed
autographs. ``The future success of the artists,'' he replied. Or
the future success of the magazine the stories were published in.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I win a Pulitzer Prize?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   Luke laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could make all the difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah. I'm sitting on a gold mine.

 &HT;    Combining Celtic spirituality with traditional theology
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ John O'Donohue found himself in California on St.
Patrick's Day this year, where he did not drink green beer or wear
a shamrock. Americans, it seems, have gotten a bit carried away. It
was almost enough to send him running back to his native County
Clare, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But he stuck around for his national book tour, to promote his
latest spiritual effort, ``Eternal Echoes: Celtic Reflections on
Our Yearning to Belong'' (Cliff Street Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Like his first book, ``Anam Cara,'' (''Soul Friend,'') ``Eternal
Echoes'' plumbs Celtic wisdom to seek answers to contemporary
spiritual ills. O'Donohue, who has a doctorate in philosophical
theology, draws upon his own background in Catholic theology, but
also draws from Zen Buddhism, Jewish mysticism, Nietzsche and Jorge
Luis Borges. This time out, O'Donohue's focus is the deep sense of
loneliness that is fostered by modern life. ``On the surface, we've
never been more connected (to one another),'' he says, referring to
the Internet and other technology. ``But at the deeper level of the
heart and mind and spirit, there is such a haunting loneliness. ...
Where do I belong? Who do I belong with?''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks his books sell so well in the United States because so
many Americans have Irish roots. ``America is a young country. A
young country always has trouble with its (sense of) roots. There
have been a lot of fashions in spirituality: the Orient, Native
American. But Celtic mysticism ``is a return of something that is
our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he understands the study of comparative religion. ``It's
as if one mountain were the search for the divine, and each (faith)
tradition takes a different path to the top. You come away with a
sense of the individuality of each tradition, as well as a sharper
eye to the blindnesses of each tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donohue doesn't shy away from claiming his own Roman
Catholicism: ``The Catholic tradition is lovely, the sacraments are
beautiful, the intellectual substance is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he calls his own tradition to task for its authoritarianism
and its ``huge difficulty with the feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   He has hopes, though, that the church can continue to serve the
function it has always served: Through its tradition, it is ``the
great memory bank of a community.''
</P>
<P>
   The modern church, though, ``has syncopated the tradition into
an ideological mechanism.... The notion of Jesus (for example) has
become so simplified, so reductionist. He was hugely complex, an
outsider in his own tradition. (The church) has started off from a
living flame ... but it has become a cage of the flame, rather than
a source.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't write the book so that people would agree with him.
``I invite people to engage in conversation with their own
questions. That's what a good book should be.''

 &HT;    Beauty combines bone structure, skin
 &HT;    _ and a great personality doesn't hurt
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Despite what your mother told you,
beauty is more than skin deep.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of bones, muscles and proportion. At least that's
how plastic surgeons judge attractiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we think about what constitutes an attractive face,
without exception, there are two things that make that face
attractive,'' says Devinder Mangat, a Cincinnati surgeon and
president of the American Academy of Facial Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery. ``One is the bone structure, and the other
is the quality of the skin covering that bony framework.''
</P>
<P>
   The academy recently asked its members to name their ideal faces
of beauty. Elizabeth Hurley and George Clooney topped the list,
which included Halle Berry and Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even among surgeons, we acquire our aesthetic concepts in a
variety of ways,'' Mangat says. Those concepts could be drawn from
movie stars, fashion models or people encountered in day-to-day
life. ``But ultimately, when a cosmetic surgeon looks at a face and
says whether it's attractive, he's really thinking more
analytically.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bones _ Strong jawbone, chin, cheekbones, nasal bone and the
bones around the eyes. ``If those bones aren't prominent enough,
the face doesn't acquire a chiseled or sculpted look,'' Mangat
says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Skin _ Skin that isn't oily, scarred or dotted with blemishes,
``thin skin'' with small pores. ``You can have good bone structure,
but if you don't have healthy skin on top of that, it takes away
from the good looks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Muscles _ For example, the way a smile can light up someone's
face _ or make it look positively creepy. ``How muscles contract
causes changes in the face that could be attractive or not so
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Balance _ Vertically, a well-proportioned face can be divided
into three parts of equal size: from the hairline to the eyebrows,
from the eyebrows to the bottom of the nose, and from the bottom of
the nose to the bottom of the chin. Horizontally, a balanced face
is five eyes wide.
</P>
<P>
   Michelangelo devised those formulas when he attempted to draw
the perfect face, Mangat says. ``We're still using some of those
parameters as facial plastic surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   For the vast majority of us not blessed with physiological or
mathematical perfection, personality can be a saving grace.
Mangat's prime example: Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, Cameron Diaz. She's beyond hideous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to tell you she does not have what we consider an
ideal nose for a female,'' he says. ``But gosh, she's beautiful.
She's got the other ingredients.''

 &HT;    Our idea of beauty relies on structure, balance, skin
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The patrician looks of Elizabeth Hurley.
The brooding handsomeness of George Clooney. The exotic allure of
Halle Berry and the formal countenance of Pierce Brosnan.
</P>
<P>
   These famous folks' features won nods from the American Academy
of Facial Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery as ``the ideal faces
of beauty'' in a recent survey of its members.
</P>
<P>
   Here are academy President Davinder Mangat's comments on who the
academy chose as fairest of them all.
</P>
<P>
   PIERCE BROSNAN
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not anything like George Clooney. George Clooney has a
masculine face that is well-proportioned. Pierce Brosnan has a
gentler, perfect face. He doesn't have masculine features in terms
of having that real strong nose, but he has softer features that
are still male features. He's got that `pretty boy' look.''
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE CLOONEY
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women think he's a hunk. That's because he has about as
masculine a face as you can find, but it's perfectly proportioned.
A strong nose. Big eyes. Good, strong eyebrows. And that's what
makes him attractive. On top of that, his personality comes through
in interviews and on screen.''
</P>
<P>
   BRAD PITT
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, when you look at Brad Pitt and Pierce Brosnan, they
have very similar features. But the big difference is that smile.
When Brad Pitt smiles, it's more than his lips. His eyes smile with
him. And Brad Pitt has the bluest eyes out there.''
</P>
<P>
   SHARON STONE
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate feminine face of gentleness, the classic beauty.
She has the best skin you've ever seen that's covering bone
structures that couldn't be any more perfect. And she has the most
expressive eyes.'' Scientifically the most perfect of the group?
``I would say so.''
</P>
<P>
   HALLE BERRY
</P>
<P>
   ``She's beautiful because she has that skin that everybody
strives to achieve, which looks naturally tanned. But the biggest
thing is that she has facial features that are so commonly present
in individuals that are biracial. It's a mixture of races that so
often brings out very unique features, features that are not
commonplace.''
</P>
<P>
   GWYNETH PALTROW
</P>
<P>
   ``If she didn't have the personality and the smile and the
charisma that she has in the movies, Gwyneth Paltrow might be an
ordinary beauty. But she has so much life behind that face. And
remember that people acquire their opinions about a beautiful face
based not just on how a person looks, but what they know about
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ELIZABETH HURLEY
</P>
<P>
   A case of everything working in harmony. ``She's got an
interesting face, but at the same time she has very soft features.
She doesn't have any part of her face that's overwhelming. It's
just well-balanced. It projects very well.''

 &HT;    All quiet in the kitchen! Here's how to direct a winning Oscar
party
 &HT;    By Jan Norris

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   American Beauty Rose Petal Sorbet: In ``American Beauty,''
nominated for eight awards, Kevin Spacey fantasizes about his teen
daughter's seductive friend in a visually stunning naked pose on a
bed of rose petals. We're dreaming about this luscious rose petal
sorbet. It's simple and best of all, can be made days ahead.
(Remember to use pesticide-free flowers.) Tumbleweeds Chili Melt:
This updated version of the patty melt is our nod to road food, to
go along with ``Tumbleweeds.'' In this '90s road picture, Janet
McTeer was nominated for her portrayal of an immature mother in the
story of a mother-daughter romp across the United States. Kimberly
J. Brown plays the astute teen. For just a small party, these
sandwiches, tipped toward spicy with chili powder and jalapeno
cheese, are easy to make on a sandwich grill.
</P>
<P>
   Cider House Rules Apple Salad: Nominated for seven awards, this
movie features Michael Caine as head of a Maine orphanage. Scenes
of apple-picking inspired our crisp apple-potato salad nestled on a
bed of greens. The crumbled goat cheese and red-currant jelly
vinaigrette offer unusual taste contrasts as well. Have ingredients
ready for assembling this dish just before serving, to keep it
technicolor pretty.

 &HT;    A night to remember
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here are some tips on making your Oscars
party a winner. Roll 'em!
</P>
<P>
   _ The theme has to be films, but that's a broad category. If you
don't like this year's nominees, make a menu from the all-time
favorite flick of your choice. Best food picture award, if there
were one, would almost always go to the foreign films (``Babette's
Feast,'' ``Tampopo'' and ``Eat, Drink, Man, Woman'') and you can
take inspiration from them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timing is everything. Since the awards show runs late on TV,
have enough nibbles to last through the night, especially if liquor
is on the menu. Two ways to serve liquor safely: Don't offer it
until food is served, then cut off service and switch to
after-dinner teas and coffees for the remainder of the party.
</P>
<P>
   _ Schedule dinner early to avoid missing any of the ceremony.
Alternately, win the award for ``most casual'' party, and have
guests eat at TV trays placed around the set.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dress up the mundane: Popcorn and chocolate-covered raisins
are tried-and-true movie party nibbles. But elevate the ideas, and
make tiny herbed popcorn balls or chocolate-dipped strawberries
instead.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Oscar party lends itself to potluck. Pick your starring
cooks carefully, though, for best results. As host, provide one
course and keep a list of the guest food, so you don't get
multiples of the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have ballots for voting along with the awards. Creative award
goes to the host who makes up new categories (and answers) for
voting _ the sillier, the better. Another game: Alternate casting
among friends. (Whom do you know who could have starred in place of
the actors in the nominated movies?) Award movie candy, books on
the movies or theater tickets to the winners.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Here are recipes to go with some of the
movies nominated for this year's Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   This is simple, and best of all, can be made in advance. Use
home-grown, pesticide-free roses for food safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE PETAL SORBET
</P>
<P>
   2 egg whites, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cream of tartar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed red rose petals, rinsed and patted dry
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons rose syrup _ see note
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Candied rose petals, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites with the cream of tartar until
stiff peaks form. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, combine the water and rose petals.
</P>
<P>
   Bring to a rolling boil.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from heat, and let steep, covered, for 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With a slotted spoon, remove and discard rose petals. (Or shred
them, if desired, to fold back into the sorbet for color.)
</P>
<P>
   Add the sugar and rose syrup, and return to boil for 2 to 3
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, pour the boiling mixture in a slow stream into the
egg whites, beating continuously.
</P>
<P>
   Add the half-and-half and lemon juice, and beat the mixture for
1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze until set, stirring several times during the freezing
process to prevent the mixture from separating.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, spoon sorbet into individual bowls, and garnish with
candied rose petals.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Rose syrup is available in shops that sell Middle Eastern
foods.

 &HT;    'N Synthetic: Casting the boy band
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ You see them on MTV. Buy their CDs,
watch their videos.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync. The Backstreet Boys. 98 Degrees. Yes, boy pop bands are
all the rage. They make giggly girls swoon, pimply faced boys strut
and cash-starved record companies rich. But, ever wonder what it's
really like hoofin' and sweatin' with the same guys all the time?
</P>
<P>
   We never see close-up the grueling rehearsals,
confidence-draining insecurities and petty jealousies that make
being in a band an exhilarating, yet maddeningly frustrating
experience. Well, if you watch ``Behind the Music,'' you do see all
that juicy stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Making The Band,'' ABC's new ``Real World''-like series,
lets you see those real-life dramas while they're happening. The
promising reality series, produced by the same ``Real World'' of
MTV team, goes behind-the-scenes for the making of O-Town, a new
Orlando-based band. In tonight's opener, 25 finalists are chosen
from a nationwide talent search that took place in eight cities,
including New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Hawaiian kid who can sing, but can't dance. ``If I
were only singing, I'd be kickin' a--, you know,'' he says. There's
the chick-obsessed guy who can't get screaming girl fans out of his
head. ``I wonder if there's going to be, like, teen-age girls in
the audience?'' he wonders. ``If there is, I'm going to try, like,
flirt a little bit and get them to make some noise.'' Then there's
the brooding guy who looks like he might give up on life if he's
doesn't become an O-Town member. ``I can't see myself going back to
school,'' he says almost despondently.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five finalists are narrowed down to eight tonight. The
five winners, however, won't be revealed until the 10th episode. In
the meantime, cameras will shadow the eight O-Town wannabes at
their rented Orlando pad. You'll see them practice five-part
harmony. Work on dance steps, and get chastised by their vocal
coach for showing up late for rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   They also brush their teeth and look nervous a lot.
</P>
<P>
   As the producers say, ``Making the Band,'' sort of ``The
Monkees'' meet The Backstreet Boys, will give you the ``whole''
story. But ``Making the Band,'' filmed in Orlando, isn't your
typical TGIF fare. It doesn't star annoyingly cute sitcom kids.
There's no laugh track or wacky next-door neighbors. That means the
series might actually boost ABC's once thriving Friday night
franchise. Teen girls will no doubt enjoy watching these baby doll
cute boys do their thing.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``Making the Band'' was hatched when Ken Mok
couldn't get into his MTV office in Times Square last August. There
were 5,000 kids jammed into the area to see 'N Sync on ``Total
Request Live.'' It dawned on Mok, an MTV vice president and
``Making the Band'' executive producer, that it would be
interesting to see how 'N Sync became a Beatles-like phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   But what about ``The Real World'' comparisons?
</P>
<P>
   ``This has a broader appeal than `The Real World','' says Jon
Murray, another executive producer. ``These boy bands are huge.
There's a whole soap opera aspect, the girls they leave behind and
how band members vie for leadership. It'll be more gritty than what
people are used to seeing on TGIF.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Young guys on the road. Tension. Stress. Girls. Should
be a lot of foul language, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these kids come from church choirs, so they're
well-spoken and use very little profanity,'' Murray says. ``We were
really shocked. There's very little bleeping we had to do.''

 &HT;    Moby: Electronica wiz after stints as DJ, punker
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Whatever you do, don't call him a DJ.
</P>
<P>
   That's the first lesson learned in a brief phone conversation
with Moby (real name Richard Melville Hall), the electronic artist
who has gone from a career on the club circuit to mainstream
success, replete with radio play, a couple of Grammy nominations
and a spot on the current ``MTV Campus Invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Moby, whose moniker derives from the fact he's a
direct descendant of ``Moby Dick'' author Herman Melville, can't
spin records with the best of them. It's that he chooses to define
his artistic life in broader terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DJ thing was a way to pay the rent, but my background is
as a musician,'' he says by phone from his New York apartment.
``I'm 34 years old, but I started playing guitar when I was 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Those years of training are starting to pay off. Next to
Santana's ``Supernatural,'' Moby's ``Play'' was probably the most
critically acclaimed album of 1999, landing on numerous top-10
lists (Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly, USA Today) as well as
Spin magazine's collection of the 90 best albums of the '90s. It's
vintage Moby, mixing hip-hop grooves, rock licks, hyperkinetic
rhythms and unfettered lyricism. In other words, pop music taken to
classical heights _ and yet, you can still dance to it.
</P>
<P>
   Moby, however, begs to differ. ``I don't see this as being a
dance record at all. I love dance music, but if I was DJ-ing
somewhere, I would never play this.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's artistic thread is a series of vocal samples, taken
from the legendary field recordings of American folk musicians made
by Alan Lomax. This is the blues stripped bare, only to be
repackaged in a context suited for the 21st century. Listen to a
cut like ``Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?'' in which Moby takes a
few fragments sung by members of a gospel choir and turns them into
a shimmering techno opus: It's music that's old and new at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found those vocals, I fell in love with them,'' Moby
explains of the Lomax material. But he insists they are just a part
of the sonic canvas, not the predominant element. And he points out
that he plays all the instruments on the album, including
keyboards, guitars, bass and drums. (For his concerts, he brings
along a three-piece band.)
</P>
<P>
   The album's classical underpinnings _ these are pieces of music,
not mere songs _ shouldn't come as a surprise, given that the New
York-born, Connecticut-raised Moby studied with a classical
guitarist as a child. But even he admits his ``classical education
was quite idiosyncratic. My teacher was also into heavy metal.''
</P>
<P>
   During his teen years, Moby discovered punk rock. But he
eventually gravitated to dance music, making his mark first in
England, where his ``Go'' became a million-seller in the early '90s
and his style became associated with the burgeoning rave scene. In
a way, he was the first true electronica star, not William Orbit or
Prodigy. But because he chose to follow a less traditional path,
his career never exploded in the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of the 1997 release ``Animal Rights,'' his second
album for a major label. It was more punk than techno, throwing his
then-fledgling fan base for a curve. But Moby insists it was the
only record in him at the time. ``There's something really
satisfying about playing guitar and screaming at the top of your
lungs,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That road-less-traveled point of view extends into Moby's
personal life. Among other things, he's a devout Christian and a
strict vegan (he refuses to use animal products of any kind) _ not
traits usually associated with an artist who's made it to the top
of trendy New York's party-guest list.
</P>
<P>
   Moby is as amazed at his sudden success as anyone else. ``I
assumed my record would suffer the same fate as a lot of
idiosyncratic records,'' he says. And though ``Play'' didn't win in
the two Grammy categories it was nominated _ best alternative music
performance and best rock instrumental performance _ Moby was
pleased to find all the famous fans he had. Among those who
complimented him were Barry Manilow, Elton John, Melissa Etheridge
and Kid Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being out there for three days, I became kind of
jaded,'' Moby recalls. ``It's like, `Oh well, Stevie Wonder likes
my record.'''

 &HT;    With INDIA-HIGHTECH-0324.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAIPUR, India _ Worried about the ``potential failure'' of
Pakistan and the dangers that could pose to South Asia, President
Clinton will lay out some ``hard realities'' when he meets with the
country's military government on Saturday, a senior White House
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will express U.S. support for Pakistan, a key American
ally during the Cold War. He'll also urge the country's junta
leaders to end support for paramilitary attacks in Kashmir,
however, and to focus on returning their deeply beleaguered country
to civilian rule, said National Security Adviser Samuel Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are worried about the future of Pakistan,'' Berger told
reporters traveling with Clinton in India.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has economic problems, it has political problems, it has
terrorist groups that are operating out of Pakistan, and I think
that, in some ways, one of the great dangers in this region is the
potential failure of Pakistan,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message the president will give to Pakistan is 'You've got
to decide what's important here, in terms of your own future.'''
</P>
<P>
   Winding up a week-long swing through the Indian subcontinent,
Clinton stops for several hours Saturday in Islamabad, the
Pakistani capital, to meet with Chief Army Gen. Pervez Musharraf,
who seized control of the government in a coup last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans to deliver an address, live and unedited,
directly to the people of Pakistan over its state-controlled
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective,'' Berger said, ``is to reaffirm to the
Pakistani people that we care about their future, that we don't
want Pakistan to fail, to convey some hard realities to Musharraf
and to talk directly to the Pakistani people about the hard choices
they face.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton faced a hard choice himself in deciding whether to go to
Pakistan. He's been criticized by human rights advocates and others
who worry that the visit lends the stamp of presidential legitimacy
to what is, essentially, a military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf overthrew the deeply flawed but democratically elected
government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Far from endorsing the coup, Clinton will tell Musharraf that
the sooner he lays out a plan for returning the country to
democratic rule, the better. In Islamabad on Thursday, Musharraf
announced a schedule for local elections sometime between December
2000 and May 2001, but said a public vote on a new national
government would only come ``step-by-step,'' and ``in due course of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a positive step but what we are looking for is a road map
to national elections and a restoration of democratic rule in
Pakistan,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will stress that such ambiguity won't help Musharraf in
gaining the support and confidence, inside Pakistan and outside of
it, needed to address the long list of ills in a country of 130
million people with an average annual income of just $480 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in the nature of persuasion,'' Berger said, ``to say
to him that you'll have a stronger basis generally on which to
address these problems if people can see a clear road map back to a
democratic government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, White House officials fear that to snub
Musharraf would leave Pakistan deeply isolated.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove dangerous given the country's vulnerability to
economic collapse _ its economy is stagnant and it narrowly averted
default last year on foreign debt approaching $30 billion _ its
constitutional crisis and Pakistan's long simmering conflict with
its giant rival, India, over the future of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has urged Musharraf from afar to end Pakistan's support
for the paramilitaries waging a campaign of violence against Indian
authorities in Kashmir, saying that an end to the tactics is
essential to engaging in peace talks with India. Saturday will be
Clinton's first opportunity to deliver that message in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should turn our back on the Pakistani people,
with whom we've had a very strong relationship,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a country that is in trouble and really needs to put
all of it's energy into self-renewal and not territorial
conflicts,'' Berger said. ``They don't have the luxury of that.''
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan _ the world's two newest possessors of
nuclear capability _ have fought three wars over Kashmir in the
past 50 years. Analysts regard it as one of the most volatile
flashpoints in the world, and Pakistan's deepening troubles have
only added to the regional instability.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   When the British partitioned the Indian subcontinent into Muslim
Pakistan and secular-Hindu India in 1947, the Hindu ruler of
Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim state, chose to become part of
India.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan never accepted that outcome. It has fought, on-and-off,
ever since to pull Kashmir into its own territory and has actively
supported the paramilitary groups _ Pakistan regards them as
freedom fighters, but to India they're terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Just Monday night, such groups killed 40 Sikhs in Kashmir.
India's government blamed Pakistan for the killings. The U.S.
position is that too little is known about the details to hold
Musharraf directly responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was a key U.S. ally during the Cold War. It served as
the launchpad for billions of dollars in U.S. military aid to
Afghan guerillas fighting against Soviet troops. The Soviet defeat
in Afghanistan in 1989 was central to the collapse of the Soviet
Union two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has also assisted in the arrest of several radical
Muslims who have targeted U.S. officials in the past and the
country has contributed peacekeeping troops to a number of
Clinton's foreign policy initiatives, including the restoration of
democratic rule to Haiti and the effort to bring peace to Bosnia.

government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Far from endorsing the coup, Clinton will tell Musharraf that
the sooner he lays out a plan for returning the country to
democratic rule, the better. In Islamabad on Thursday, Musharraf
announced a schedule for local elections sometime between December
2000 and May 2001, but said a public vote on a new national
government would only come ``step-by-step,'' and ``in due course of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a positive step but what we are looking for is a road map
to national elections and a restoration of democratic rule in
Pakistan,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will stress that such ambiguity won't help Musharraf in
gaining the support and confidence, inside Pakistan and outside of
it, needed to address the long list of ills in a country of 130
million people with an average annual income of just $480 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in the nature of persuasion,'' Berger said, ``to say
to him that you'll have a stronger basis generally on which to
address these problems if people can see a clear road map back to a
democratic government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, White House officials fear that to snub
Musharraf would leave Pakistan deeply isolated.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove dangerous given the country's vulnerability to
economic collapse _ its economy is stagnant and it narrowly averted
default last year on foreign debt approaching $30 billion _ its
constitutional crisis and Pakistan's long simmering conflict with
its giant rival, India, over the future of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has urged Musharraf from afar to end Pakistan's support
for the paramilitaries waging a campaign of violence against Indian
authorities in Kashmir, saying that an end to the tactics is
essential to engaging in peace talks with India. Saturday will be
Clinton's first opportunity to deliver that message in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should turn our back on the Pakistani people,
with whom we've had a very strong relationship,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's a country that is in trouble and really needs to put
all of it's energy into self-renewal and not territorial
conflicts,'' Berger said. ``They don't have the luxury of that.''
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan _ the world's two newest possessors of
nuclear capability _ have fought three wars over Kashmir in the
past 50 years. Analysts regard it as one of the most volatile
flashpoints in the world, and Pakistan's deepening troubles have
only added to the regional instability.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   When the British partitioned the Indian subcontinent into Muslim
Pakistan and secular-Hindu India in 1947, the Hindu ruler of
Kashmir, a predominantly Muslim state, chose to become part of
India.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan never accepted that outcome. It has fought, on-and-off,
ever since to pull Kashmir into its own territory and has actively
supported the paramilitary groups _ Pakistan regards them as
freedom fighters, but to India they're terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Just Monday night, such groups killed 40 Sikhs in Kashmir.
India's government blamed Pakistan for the killings. The U.S.
position is that too little is known about the details to hold
Musharraf directly responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan was a key U.S. ally during the Cold War. It served as
the launchpad for billions of dollars in U.S. military aid to
Afghan guerillas fighting against Soviet troops. The Soviet defeat
in Afghanistan in 1989 was central to the collapse of the Soviet
Union two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has also assisted in the arrest of several radical
Muslims who have targeted U.S. officials in the past and the
country has contributed peacekeeping troops to a number of
Clinton's foreign policy initiatives, including the restoration of
democratic rule to Haiti and the effort to bring peace to Bosnia.

MOTHER OF KIDNAPPED GIRL WANTS TO REGAIN A NORMAL LIFE

   TRENTON, Fla. _ Jennifer Graham went to bed on March 5 thinking
about the same details most moms worry about at the beginning of
the week. Were the school clothes washed? Had all the homework been
done? Was there milk for breakfast?
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, she was on several national television news
programs pleading for the safe return of her oldest child,
10-year-old Jessica Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this really makes you understand what is
important and what doesn't mean all that much,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica was taken from her family's driveway as she and her
sisters walked home from the school bus stop on March 6.
Investigators believe she was held at a Gainesville home until she
was released in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart in Gainesville on
March 9.
</P>
<P>
   After a medical exam and interviews with investigators, Jessica
and her family went into seclusion for a few days. Jessica and her
sisters are now back in school.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what could have happened to her daughter is something
that Graham tries not to dwell on, but it is seldom far from her
thoughts. She said that law enforcement officials had told her that
kidnapped children were usually found in shallow graves, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how rare it happens that a child gets to go back home
after they are taken,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham said that it seemed as if her children were doing a
better job of recovering than she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessica runs around here like nothing ever happened, but I am
living in fear,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has begun locking her doors when she is home alone during
the day, and her fiance, Thomas Keeley, tries not to leave the
family if he can avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder for us, me and Tom, to get back to normal because
I think we know what could have happened and the girls don't know
that,'' Graham said. ``I try not to let Jessica know I'm afraid.
She's amazing and I'm so proud of her for being able to just move
on, but I worry all the time now about if they are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham credited investigators and the media for quickly
distributing a sketch of the suspected kidnapper.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica's sister, Jerrica Rodriguez, 8, provided a police artist
with much detail about the man's appearance despite only seeing his
face for a few seconds during the kidnapping. Then, as Jessica was
being forced into the man's Jeep, Jerrica and a third sister,
Serenity Shumake, 4, did what their mother told them to do in an
emergency _ run toward an adult they know and scream to attract
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The sketch of the suspect, along with details provided by
Jessica following her release, led investigators to James Paul
Johnson, 38, of Gainesville, who was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Now that her child has been returned and a suspect arrested,
Graham said she was ``really, really angry about what happened, but
I don't hate him for this. I just want to know why. Why do people
do things like this to children?''
</P>
<P>
   Graham had some advice for parents of a kidnapped child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pray as hard as you can and go to the media for help and don't
ever, ever give up faith that your child will be returned,'' Graham
said. ``You may want to sit there and think bad things, but make
yourself pray and keep your faith.''
</P>
<P>
   While Graham and Keeley acknowledged the help they received from
the media, they were upset about some of the questions and
treatment they have received from a few television outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one television reporter ask me how it felt to be a
celebrity, and I told him flat out that I never wanted to be on
television and I wouldn't be on television except that I needed to
get my daughter back,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   She still gets calls from talk show employees trying to cajole
or bully her into appearing on a specific program. Immediately
after her daughter was found, Graham said she was shocked by the
behavior of one network employee who gave her a tongue lashing for
not appearing on a certain morning news program first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we could have done _ if we could have gotten
Jessica back _ without all the newspaper stories and television and
all, so I don't want to sound ungrateful, but some of them were
rude,'' Graham said. ``When we found Jessica, I wanted to thank
them, but now they just don't stop and they keep on and keep on and
keep on.''
</P>
<P>
   While her daughters aren't dwelling on the kidnapping, it does
come up. Before going back to school, Serenity asked Graham, ``Is
the bad guy who took Jessica away in jail?'' Graham said she tried
to keep the answer short, specific and reassuring, telling Serenity
that a man was in jail and he probably shouldn't be getting out for
a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   Among Jessica's questions was one about why Graham was crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her they were happy tears because I was so glad she was
back with us,'' Graham said. ``I feel like God has a special plan
for Jessica and that is why she is back here with us.

DEADLY RAMPAGE AT CARWASH DESCRIBED

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Mi-T-Fine Car Wash employee Jason Shields
stopped for doughnuts Monday morning and noticed three of his
co-workers ambling across a parking lot on their way to work.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Shields pushed open the front door of the carwash
to absorb a chilling scene: the same three co-workers sprawled in
puddles of blood, and a fired employee, Robert Wayne Harris,
blurting an equally terrifying remark.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's three more back here in the office,'' Harris said,
according to police affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims were shot in the head, authorities said
Wednesday. Harris' family members said they believe that the
shootings flared during an argument, but crime scene specialists
contend that the head wounds are consistent with a calculated
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Shields' encounter triggered a massive police search that led to
Harris' arrest the next day in the shooting deaths of five carwash
employees and the wounding of another.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described the hours before Harris' arrest at an
acquaintance's Dallas home, and police turned over documents that
lay bare details about the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Harris had been free for months after being targeted as a
suspect in the disappearance of Irving resident Sandra Estes Scott,
who has been missing since November, documents show.
</P>
<P>
   After a police interview with Harris on Tuesday night,
investigators on Wednesday found what is believed to be Scott's
body.
</P>
<P>
   According to affidavits, police concluded as early as January
that Harris was the last person to have seen Scott alive. In police
interviews, he gave ``deceptive'' responses during polygraph tests,
according to records. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Harris was fired from the carwash Friday after a female customer
reported March 15 that he was performing a sexual act in a restroom
with the door open.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested Friday at the carwash on suspicion of indecent
exposure. Employees said they heard yelling and commotion in the
lobby where Harris was being handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something was going on, because everyone was quiet,'' said one
worker who wouldn't give her name.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, after Harris was released from Lew Sterrett Justice
Center in Dallas on $500 bail, he returned to his former workplace
to ask for a free carwash, making employees and a supervisor
nervous, an employee said.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, sometime before 7:30 a.m., Harris returned to the
carwash, this time wearing work clothes _ faded gray pants, a
maroon jacket and a dark baseball cap, _ according to witnesses and
affidavits.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, Shields had stopped at The Donut King while other
employees trickled into the carwash.
</P>
<P>
   About 7:40 a.m., Shields, entering from the merchandise area,
encountered the bloody scene and saw Harris standing amid three
bodies. ``Numerous shell casings'' littered the floor, the police
report states.
</P>
<P>
   Harris stood at the counter and motioned to the three other
bodies, according to affidavits, prompting Shields to look. He
recognized the bodies of assistant manager Dennis Lee and cashier
Rhoda Wheeler. Shields fled in shock, returning to the doughnut
shop, where he asked an employee for a telephone so he could dial
911.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted the door locked,'' a doughnut store employee told
the Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   At the crime scene, three people were dead from gunshot wounds.
Two more died later at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. The
victims: Agustin Villasenor, 36, of Arlington; and Benjamin
Villasenor, 32; Roberto Jimenez Jr., 15; Wheeler, 45; and Lee, 48,
all of Irving. Lee's neck was slit, police documents state.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Ramos, 36, of Irving was listed in critical condition
last night at Parkland Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   All five slaying victims died of gunshot wounds to the head,
according to autopsy reports released yesterday by the Dallas
County Medical Examiner's Office. The report does not specify the
exact locations of the wounds. A friend of Lee's who saw his body
said he was shot in the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Shields, through his girlfriend, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still not over this,'' Stacie Douthitt said.
``Physically, he's OK, but not emotionally.'' ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   After taking Shields' report, police launched a search, staking
out Harris' Irving apartment along Rock Island Road and residences
of his acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   About 10:30 p.m. Monday, Marie Noble, 29, a longtime friend of
Harris' who lives in east Dallas, heard a knock at her door.
</P>
<P>
   It was Harris, who initially appeared calm, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But later, she said, ``The way Robert was talking, I knew
something was wrong, the way he was smoking cigarettes, smoking one
right after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Noble talked awhile, but Noble said she had no idea
that Harris was a murder suspect. Then her 8-year-old daughter saw
Harris' photograph on television between 11 and 11:30 p.m. and
said, `Mom, look at this ... look at him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Noble confronted Harris, but he did not admit guilt, she said.
He told her later that night that he should talk to police, and he
asked her to take him to the police station in Garland. She
declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I wouldn't take him in my car because they were
saying he was armed and dangerous, and I didn't want to jeopardize
my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she told him, ``Bobby it's like this, if you did it,
you've got to turn yourself in.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris stayed up all night talking to Noble and her brother, she
said. Sometime before 10 a.m. Tuesday, Noble said, she got a call
from a police officer saying he had learned that Harris was at her
house and that officers were at her back door.
</P>
<P>
   She said she tried to avoid letting Harris know about the police
because she feared he might cause a commotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert asked me what was going on. I said, `I have to open the
door. The police are here.' He said, `No, please don't.' I told
him, `I have to,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Noble said Harris cooperated with police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we'll never see him again,'' she said. ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Harris' brother told a television station Tuesday evening that
Harris admitted the slayings. He is in Irving Jail and has been
arraigned on suspicion of capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, police said, they recovered ``clothing and papers''
during a search of his Irving apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Because all the victims were shot in the head, crime scene
analysts characterized the killings as premeditated. Harris'
brother said Harris snapped during an argument with co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't sound like a frenzy shooting,'' said Max Courtney
of Forensic Consultant Services in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, if a gunman is shooting randomly at a group of
people, victims would have more wounds, Courtney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With five people shot in the head and there are no missed
shots, it certainly would suggest that there were no wild shots,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Jason, a crime scene analyst in Pinole, Calif., and a
former San Francisco police officer, agreed that the shootings
probably did not happen during a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``His statement that he shot all the people in a very brief
period of anger appears to be inconsistent with the facts as I know
them,'' Jason said.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would have tried to run or defend themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After one or two shots were fired, generally it draws their
attention and they would take defensive action. They wouldn't stay
in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``To shoot five different people in different rooms goes beyond
a fit of anger.''

SUSPECT IN CAR WASH SLAYINGS BELIEVED LINKED TO DISAPPEARANCE
</HEADLINE>

And SUSAN GILL VARDON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Already accused of killing five co-workers,
Robert Wayne Harris had something else he needed to tell police:
where to find a body.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, acting on Harris' information, police found a
body believed to be that of an Irving woman missing since November.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Sandra Estes Scott, who disappeared Nov. 29,
said they were told by police that the decomposed body found in
another Dallas suburb is almost certainly hers. A positive
identification will be made using dental records, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's her,'' said Charles Gaylor, a field agent for
the Dallas County Medical Examiner's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 28, who is accused of capital murder in connection with
the slayings of five people Monday at a Mi-T-Fine Car Wash in
Irving, had been a suspect in Scott's disappearance since early
December, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's family members and friends said police told them that
Harris gave officers the location of a body but would not claim
responsibility for Scott's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tell them it was Sandy, he just gave the location,''
said Barbara Bonome, Scott's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Scott's relatives cried and hugged one
another outside Irving police headquarters after officers briefed
them about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame five other people had to die so I can find out
what happened to my daughter,'' said Scott's father, Charles Estes
of Irving. ``My heart goes out to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is believed to be the last person to see Scott alive. On
Jan. 14, he failed a polygraph test when questioned about her
disappearance, records state. Until the carwash shooting renewed
investigators' interest in the Scott case, police said, they did
not have enough evidence to arrest Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Scott's loved ones stopped short of saying that Irving
police did not push hard enough to determine what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could have linked him to Sandy's disappearance, he
would have been in jail. These people wouldn't have been killed,''
Bonome said. ``I think the police did what they could. They just
didn't find evidence to arrest him.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Scott's friends, Sharon Summers, was more critical of
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let him go and he killed these other people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving police acknowledged that the investigation of Scott's
disappearance started slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors complicated the case, police spokesman David
Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 48 hours passed between Scott's disappearance the
night of Nov. 29 and her family's first call to police about 10
p.m. Dec. 1, according to police records.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's case probably was not placed on a national missing
persons database until the morning of Dec. 2 because of a shift
change at the Police Department, Tull said. At that time, the case
would have been assigned to a detective in the youth investigations
division, which investigates all missing persons reports, Tull
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, the possibility surfaced that this woman left on
her own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A week into the investigation, Harris was interviewed by police.
He told them that Scott, 37, came to his apartment Nov. 29 to sell
a bag of marijuana, according to a police affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned that about 9:45 p.m. Nov. 29, Scott placed a call
from Harris' apartment to a friend, Christina West, the affidavit
states. The Caller ID on West's telephone displayed Harris' number.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's abandoned pickup was found nearly five hours later, and
the gap between the phone call and the discovery of the pickup made
it difficult to connect Harris to any foul play, Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got several hours when she may have seen someone else,''
he said. ``In that time frame, she could have seen other people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, police searched Harris' apartment but found nothing
connecting him to Scott, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got off to a sluggish start,'' Tull said. ``If we erred in
some way, it may have been that we didn't start interviewing right
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish we could do more, too,'' he said. ``We work with what
we've got. We're getting better, but even with technology and
manpower, this one did not work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott was divorced. Her children, Michael Wright, 13, and
Tiffinee Williams, 17, live with relatives in Irving, family
members said.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread that Scott's body may have been found, her
friends and relatives swarmed to the Irving police station and to a
remote area near where the body was found on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Scott's family members, including her father,
stepmother and grandfather, live a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in horror,'' said Jessie Estes, Scott's stepmother.
``She was so close to our home.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives said they had searched that area shortly
after Scott disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought my horse out here and checked this area myself,''
said her ex-husband, Michael Wright, who lives about one mile from
where the body was located. ``Every time I drove down this road I
wondered if Sandy could have been out here somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Family friend Barry Preston, 16, of Irving said, ``We were out
here about a week after Sandy disappeared. We walked along this
road barefoot. I mean, we were all right here searching.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's son expressed anger at the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to pay for what he did,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he had been pulled out of class by a
counselor who told him that his father wanted to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling it was about my mom,'' he said. ``It's been
too long. I've been missing her a lot. Every day, I wanted to pick
up the phone and call her.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Yet another White House investigation
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department has launched a criminal inquiry into
White House computer breakdowns that made it impossible to search
thousands of incoming e-mails in response to congressional
subpoenas. The investigation, to be handled through the Justice's
campaign finance task force, focuses on whether the subpoenas
issued to the White House went unanswered because of the
breakdowns. The e-mails involved campaign fund-raising and other
matters.
</P>
<P>
   IF SHE WERE A NEW YORKER, WOULD SHE HAVE TO TRAVEL AS MUCH?
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans released White House data Thursday
showing Hillary Rodham Clinton reimbursed taxpayers for only about
18 percent of the cost of her New York Senate campaign trips on
government aircraft. The documents showed Clinton's trips to and
from New York cost $182,471, but that she reimbursed taxpayers only
$32,878. Still, the figure was far below the $905,406 the
Republican National Committee estimated as recently as Wednesday.
The first lady flies on government aircraft on the advice of Secret
Service, and reimburses the government the same way presidential
candidates do: at the rate of a first-class commercial ticket.
</P>
<P>
   TRIAL LAWYERS' WORST NIGHTMARE
</P>
<P>
   While trial lawyers have long been heavy donors to Democrats,
the prospect of a George W. Bush presidency, along with the
possibility that like-minded Republicans will retain control of
Congress, has ratcheted up the stakes, and the donations. Trial
lawyers are spending huge amounts of money from the tobacco
settlement to keep him and other Republicans from being elected.
Bush has made attacks on lawyers a campaign centerpiece, pointing
with pride to his record in Texas of curbing civil litigation,
capping legal fees and limiting jury awards. It all comes under the
banner of tort reform, or what Bush claims are efforts to rid the
legal system of ``junk'' lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   X'S AND O'S OF GORE GAME PLAN
</P>
<P>
   The presidential election is 229 days away, and Al Gore and the
Democrats have settled on their initial line of attack. Paint
George W. Bush as a phony education reformer. Explain away the
glowing test scores posted in recent years by Texas students.
Depict Bush as an insensitive penny-pincher. Put out the word that
he is no friend to young Latinos. In short, leave the impression
that Bush is a garden-variety Republican, and therefore no match
for the vice president on the issue of boosting the quality of
America's public schools. Such were the messages when top Democrats
huddled in the wind and rain in Washington to brief journalists
from several news organizations on the downside of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH SCORES POINTS WITH THIS DEMOCRAT
</P>
<P>
   Democratic national Chairman Joe Andrew charged that George W.
Bush merely ``talks a good game'' on education. But in an interview
with Knight Ridder, Will Marshall, a 1992 Clinton-Gore adviser who
runs the Progressive Policy Institute, a moderate Democratic think
tank, countered: ``Test scores have been rising, and the
achievements of low-income and minority students have been rising.
Campaign hyperbole aside, Texas has one of the best accountability
systems in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   CREDIBILITY, WITH EMPHASIS ON TAXES
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says Al Gore is an ``obstacle to reform'' who is
too partisan to be president and build consensus on fixing Social
Security or making meaningful changes to the campaign finance
system. In an interview in Thursday's Washington Post, Bush pledged
to continue pushing his plans for a tax cut despite polls showing
little interest in one and said he would make saving Social
Security a focus of the campaign. He said Gore has a ``major
credibility problem'' that goes beyond the campaign finance matter,
and that he plans to make it a central campaign issue as well.
</P>
<P>
   NOT JUST SHOOTING FROM THE HIP
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has repeatedly said about Al Gore: ``This is a
man who will say anything to get elected.'' What wasn't known is
that line of attack had been tested, and proven effective in a
Republican ``push poll'' conducted in early February. The results
of the poll, obtained by ABC News, provide a road map for Bush's
strategy going into the fall campaign: Go after Gore on
trustworthiness and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   GAYS IN MILITARY: ALL DELIBERATE SPEED
</P>
<P>
   Although Al Gore pledged that if elected president he would end
the ban on gays serving openly in the military, he would not issue
an immediate, sweeping order to achieve that goal, a key aide says.
Leon Fuerth, Gore's national security adviser, said Gore would move
more deliberately. Said Fuerth: ``We are not really talking about
an executive order; we are talking about a presidential action to
enter into a dialogue with people who are concerned about this.''
Fuerth said Gore ``fully understands'' the military's arguments for
not allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly, namely that it
could erode morale and disrupt ``unit cohesion.''
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN STILL PUSHING BUSH ON ISSUES
</P>
<P>
   Juggling party loyalty with political independence, John McCain
promised House Republicans he'll campaign vigorously for them, then
prodded his victorious rival, George W. Bush, to support federal
regulation of tobacco. ``I hope the governor will take that
position,'' he told The Associated Press in an interview. Bush has
declined to say whether he favors federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE CHAPLAIN SOUL SEARCHING
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Charles Wright, whose selection as House chaplain
triggered charges of religious bias in Congress, offered to
withdraw this week in a private meeting with House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, Cox's Rebecca Carr reported. With his nomination in limbo
for months, Wright, a Presbyterian minister, made his offer amid
signs that Hastert was moving quickly to find a replacement.
Republicans are eager to quell a controversy in which some
Democrats accused them of anti-Catholic bias for passing over a
Catholic priest last fall when Wright was tapped.
</P>
<P>
   BAD THINGS CAN REALLY PILE UP
</P>
<P>
   The Senate candidate who began his campaign to unseat Sen. Ted
Kennedy by issuing an embarrassing report detailing his own
personal failures has steered himself into a new mess. Jack E.
Robinson III was involved in a three-car accident Tuesday and is
accused of trying to leave the scene _ just hours after releasing
an 11-page personal history that included allegations of drinking
and driving, sexual misconduct, plagiarism and carrying an illegal
weapon. The Republican businessman was talking on his cell phone at
the time of the accident, giving an interview to WBUR-FM in Boston
about Gov. Paul Cellucci's decision to withdraw his support because
of the revelations. The accident was blamed on a 17-year-old who
lost control of his car and crossed into oncoming traffic.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JOB FOR DAN QUAYLE
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, an early dropout from the presidential race, has
joined Denver-based investment banking firm JD Ford and Co. as a
principal. The company ``specializes in arranging merger and
acquisition transactions for middle market companies,'' according
to their press release. Quayle ``will assume a senior level role in
the firm's activities'' and will be based in Phoenix to assist
clients ``in closing transactions with the goal of maximizing their
objectives.'' Quayle offers the firm's clients access to national
and international decision-makers.
</P>
<P>
   POLICE SHOOTING ISSUE FESTERING . . .
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton accused Rudy Giuliani of essentially
ignoring New York City's black residents. Reacting to the mayor's
statement that he felt no responsibility to reach out to the black
community after the latest police shooting of an unarmed black man,
Clinton said: ``He's basically written off whole communities in the
city that he's supposed to lead. What does that say about how
people would be represented by him?'' The mayor's campaign
spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, shot back: ``It sounds like Mrs.
Clinton is still reading off the same script prepared by Al
Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND SOME IN GOP WORRY
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani's attacks this week on an unarmed black man who
was fatally shot by the police are causing bewilderment among
members of his own party, who say they are concerned about
Giuliani's temperament and the tenor of his Senate campaign against
Hillary Rodham Clinton. ``I don't think she can beat him, but he
can beat himself,'' said Rich Bond, former chairman of the
Republican National Committee, who once worked for Giuliani. Bond
added that Giuliani's strong defense of the police in this case
``could bleed into the overall electorate and become a modest
negative instead of a huge positive.''
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS SENATE RUNOFF SET
</P>
<P>
   An ex-state legislator and a retired Air Force lawyer have
advanced to a runoff in the Democratic primary for Republican Kay
Bailey Hutchison's Senate seat in Texas. Unofficial returns had
determined that Charles Gandy, who served one term in the Texas
house in the mid-1980s, finished second in the March 14 primary to
lawyer Gene Kelly. But Gandy's margin over the third-place finisher
was so close that officials waited to make the formal announcement.
Kelly had 35.7 percent of the vote, Gandy 22.7 percent, and the
third candidate, Don Clark, had 22.5 percent. The runoff will be
April 11.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN BEAUTY,' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris
Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed
by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse Spacey plays
a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a
teen-age cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife
crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings
terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the
bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing,
especially Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the
story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces
for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BOILER ROOM,' starring Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and Ben
Affleck. Written and directed by Ben Younger (R, 110 minutes).
Ribisi portrays a young stockbroker in training at a fly-by-night
company called J.T. Marlin. Like Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street,''
``Boiler Room'' tells the story of an ambitious young man's rise,
fall and redemption. And like Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox, Ribisi's
Seth carries some heavy Oedipal baggage _ a troubled relationship
with his demanding, disapproving father _ onto the trading floor.
But at its best, which is awfully good, ``Boiler Room'' avoids the
thumping moralism that has made Stone the least misunderstood
director in Hollywood. It's less about selling your soul than about
feeling your oats (A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `BOYS DON'T CRY,' starring Hilary Swank and Chloe Sevigny.
Directed by Kimberly Peirce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut
feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who
despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic
identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may
sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's
idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and
even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make
it work. One of last year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CIDER HOUSE RULES,' starring Tobey Maguire, Charlize Theron
and Delroy Lindo. Directed by Lasse Hallstrom (PG-13, 125 minutes).
Radically downsized in scope, and its examination of the issue of
abortion greatly softened, John Irving's sixth novel (with a
Dickensian screenplay by the author) has been turned into a lovely
World War II-era fable about a young man venturing out into the
world. Maguire is Homer Wells, a doleful innocent raised in an
orphanage by Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine), who performs
abortions. Fleeing the institution with a golden young couple
(Theron and Paul Rudd), he becomes an apple picker. Sentimental but
smart, the movie has the sweetness and narrative drive of a 1940s
``David Copperfield'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `ERIN BROCKOVICH,' starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 127 minutes). After a promising,
effective beginning, in which Roberts proves what a fine actress
she can be, and Soderbergh demonstrates yet again that he is one of
the most thoughtful and original directors in Hollywood, ``Erin
Brockovich'' becomes a doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice
Hollywood melodrama, a smooth secondhand amalgam of ``Norma Rae''
and ``Silkwood,'' with vigorous nods to ``The Rainmaker'' and ``A
Civil Action.'' Roberts, playing a working-class single mother who
spearheads an effort to win justice for victims of corporate
negligence, aggressively solicits an Oscar nomination. After acting
for about 40 minutes, Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a
movie star. As the movie drags on, her performance swells to
bursting with moral vanity and phony populism. It's as though she
had a clause in her contract strictly limiting anyone else's right
to be attractive or appealing on screen. Who could have foreseen
that Soderbergh, the most brilliantly unpredictable of filmmakers,
could have made a movie so utterly hokey and conventional? (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `GHOST DOG: THE WAY OF THE SAMURAI,' starring Forest Whitaker.
Directed by Jim Jarmusch (R, 116 minutes). In his new film Jarmusch
does for the samurai epic and the gangster movie what he did for
the western in ``Dead Man,'' his dreamy, elegiac deconstruction of
cowboys-and-Indians mythology. Here he has composed a ruminative,
bittersweet visual essay on brutality, honor and tribalism, which
may frustrate audiences expecting more visceral thrills. ``Ghost
Dog'' is worth seeing for Whitaker's witty, moving performance as a
modern-day samurai caught up in a Mafia vendetta, for Jarmusch's
offbeat sense of cinematic style and for hip-hop artist the RZA's
brilliant musical effects (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE HURRICANE,' starring Denzel Washington. Directed by Norman
Jewison (R, 120 minutes). The life story of Hurricane Carter, a
middleweight contender who spent nearly 20 years in prison for a
triple murder he denied committing, is a big, schmaltzy ballad of a
movie redeemed by Washington's moving, bone-deep portrayal of the
boxer. But the movie plays fast and loose with the facts, giving
far too much credit to the members of a Canadian commune who took
up Carter's cause and all but eliminating his courageous
co-defendant, John Artis, from the story. And the minor characters
are either saints or monsters. Yet the story of a man heroically
fighting his demons and winning his freedom is still inspiring
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `MISSION TO MARS,' starring Gary Sinise and Tim Robbins.
Directed by Brian De Palma (PG, 113 minutes). This film's visual
design is spectacular, and the scenes on the Martian surface look
so real that the picture could have been made on location. But the
movie is undermined by De Palma's uncharacteristic wet-eyed awe.
All this addled sincerity comes from trying to create wonderment
for adults out of a morose astronaut's rediscovery of his humanity
on Mars. Sinise plays the depressed astronaut, and his thoughtful
patience makes him appear to be a little sluggish, though not as
sluggish as the movie: narratively it seems to be taking place in
zero gravity, where each minute seems to last an additional 30
seconds. In space no one can hear you snore (Elvis Mitchell).

 UNDATED: (Elvis Mitchell). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE NEXT BEST THING,' starring Rupert Everett and Madonna.
Directed by John Schlesinger (PG-13, 107 minutes). A contemporary
screwball comedy about a Los Angeles yoga teacher (Madonna) and her
gay best friend (Everett) who have a baby together, ``The Next Best
Thing'' intermittently fizzes in its early scenes. But once it gets
serious, the movie turns into a stumbling, poor man's ``Kramer vs.
Kramer.'' Madonna is a curt, cool cookie whose painfully flat
performance is all but devoid of feeling. Everett has a few bright
comic moments as a man who discovers the joys of fatherhood
(Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE NINTH GATE,' starring Johnny Depp and Frank Langella.
Directed by Roman Polanski (R, 133 minutes). For those with an
interest in seeing a dinner-theater version of ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
then look no further. This film, with its wizened decadence and its
tired stabs at comedy, is calling your name. Langella is Boris
Balkan, a wealthy and therefore evil collector of Devil-inspired
antiquities, who hires Dean Corso (Depp), a weedy rogue book
dealer, to locate a volume called ``The Nine Gates.'' Will Balkan
get Satan's powers in his clutches through mastery of the book?
Polanski is out to cross ``Rosemary's Baby'' with his saucy spoof
``The Fearless Vampire Killers,'' but this movie is about as scary
as a sock-puppet re-enactment of ``The Blair Witch Project,'' and
not nearly as funny (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `NOT ONE LESS,' starring Wei Minzhi and Zhang Huike. Directed by
Zhang Yimou (not rated, 106 minutes). Zhang Yimou's new drama
enlarges the possibilities of filmmaking even as it grounds itself
in one of cinema's oldest, most basic principles: the camera's
ability to document reality. At the center of the film is Wei (Wei
Minzhi), a 13-year-old primary school graduate who has been pressed
into service as a substitute teacher in the Shuiquan Primary
School. When one of her students is sent to the city to work off
his parents' debts, Wei, who has been promised a bonus if she can
keep her class intact (this is the source of the film's title),
sets out to bring him home. And the movie, which has so far been a
slow, touching study of village life, becomes something else: a
work of lyrical realism that has some of the shattering, redemptive
power of Vittorio De Sica's ``Bicycle Thief'' (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `REINDEER GAMES,' starring Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise and Charlize
Theron. Directed by John Frankenheimer (R, 99 minutes). This is a
wheel-within-a-wheel thriller that's a lot of fun until, near the
end, it becomes a Xerox copy of a blueprint of a hit. Affleck, who
suggests one of the Kennedys playing Clark Kent _ he wants to keep
his light under a bushel, but he's not quite up to it _ plays Rudy,
an ex-con who gets dragged into a casino heist planned for the
Christmas season. Theron is the girl who lures him into the job.
The seamy kicks of one double-cross after another keep the movie in
motion, and Frankenheimer's ruthless precision keeps it on track
(Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `SCREAM 3,' starring David Arquette, Neve Campbell and Courteney
Cox Arquette. Directed by Wes Craven (R, 116 minutes). At this
point it goes without saying that the ``Scream'' movies are like
episodes of ``Scooby Doo.'' Like the others, ``Scream 3'' belongs
on the Cartoon Network, but this time for a better reason: The film
is funny and brisk, with enough good lines to make the comedy more
satisfying than the somewhat routine but still unsettling jolts to
the spine. Craven and his group recognize that the franchise's real
competition is not the recent hit films ``The Blair Witch Project''
and ``The Sixth Sense'' but rather ``Scream'' itself. ``Scream 3''
doesn't skimp on jacked-up scares, but it's as much a personality
show as it is a slasher film (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `TOPSY-TURVY,' starring Allan Corduner and Jim Broadbent.
Directed by Mike Leigh (R, 161 minutes). Leigh's grandly
entertaining ``Topsy-Turvy'' is one of those films that create a
mix of erudition, pageantry and delectable acting opportunities,
much as ``Shakespeare in Love'' did. Instead of a love-struck young
playwright, it presents the curiously matched personalities of the
librettist William Schwenk Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan
in the midst of a robust, knowing, frequently hilarious look at the
musical theater over which they held sway (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE WHOLE NINE YARDS,' starring Matthew Perry and Bruce Willis.
Directed by Jonathan Lynn (R, 100 minutes). Oz (Perry) is a
nice-guy dentist beaten down by his bored wife. When the confident
Jimmy (Willis) breezes into the house next door, Oz's anxieties are
ratcheted up several points on the Richter scale. It turns out that
Jimmy is a former Chicago organized-crime figure who ratted out his
associates. The movie has an intricate plot, with hit men, love
interests, large sums of money and allegiances constantly in
motion. But it is missing the verve of someone who can take a
simple idea to the extreme; it must have been directed by a
sleepwalker. Despite Perry's plucky slapstick and the treacherous
gunplay that account for the second half of the movie, ``Yards'' is
underwhelming, amusing only in fits and starts (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `WINTER SLEEPERS,' starring Ulrich Matthes, Marie-Lou Sellem,
Floriane Daniel and Heino Ferch. Directed by Tom Tykwer (not rated,
124 minutes). Thrillingly virtuosic cinematic flourishes lend a
steady charge of adrenaline to this drama about the tangled
destinies of well-to-do German slackers in a picture-perfect skiing
village. Made just before the jet-propelled pop fantasy ``Run Lola
Run'' put Tykwer on the short list of major international
filmmakers, ``Winter Sleepers'' conveys the spiritual malaise
afflicting the generation now in its late 20s and 30s. But like
``Run Lola Run,'' the movie is also about how human destiny has
everything to do with split-second timing (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `WONDER BOYS,' starring Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand and
Tobey Maguire. Directed by Curtis Hanson (R, 112 minutes). This
film boasts a first-rate cast, a credible literary source and a
director whose last film, ``L.A. Confidential,'' showed a
prodigious ability to capture the headlong rhythms of a complex
plot and the particularities of a motley assortment of characters.
But even with so much going for it, this adaptation of Michael
Chabon's novel about a pot-smoking middle-aged novelist burdened by
romantic and creative problems is flat and unconvincing. There's no
shortage of screwball material: a dead dog, an errant tuba and a
very tall drag queen, for starters. But Hanson, perhaps aiming for
wry understatement, has smothered whatever antic rhythm the story
might have had. Despite a brilliant supporting turn by Robert
Downey Jr. as a gay book editor, ``Wonder Boys'' is like a George
Cukor movie with a bad head cold: slow, muffled and vague (Scott).

CHINA OPENS ITS MARKET TO FLORIDA CITRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., Ariz., Texas)  (js) 
 By LLOYD DUNKELBERGER   
 (New York Times Regional Newspapers)   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida Agriculture Commissioner Bob
Crawford will be in a Beijing market on Monday, selling oranges and
grapefruit to Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
   That simple act represents a sweeping economic development:
China, with its 1.2 billion potential consumers, has agreed to let
Florida growers sell fresh citrus in the world's most populous
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' Crawford said Wednesday. ``People have been
talking about this for years. We saw the opportunity. We just went
to work on it and may have helped play a role in making it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's first commercial shipment of citrus to China is the
result of an agreement last April between China and the United
States that allows the sale of citrus, wheat and beef to the Asian
country. The citrus sales, which will also benefit California,
Texas and Arizona growers, were delayed until Chinese officials
were convinced that importing the fruit would not expose their
native crops to new pests or plant diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The approval came after a team of Chinese inspectors toured
groves and packing houses in the United States in January. Although
Florida is currently battling an outbreak of citrus canker,
Crawford said Chinese officials were less concerned about canker,
which is a problem in China, than about a fruit-fly infestation.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement is the first step in the wider opening
of the Chinese market to Florida growers.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford and citrus growers will lobby Congress to approve
China's entry into the World Trade Organization. When China joins
the WTO, it will begin reducing tariffs on U.S. citrus from 40
percent to 12 percent over a five-year period as the result of a
previous agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeb Bush said citrus sales in China are a historic
opportunity for the state and the citrus industry. ``Florida
farmers are going to benefit from this and so are a whole lot of
other people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture is Florida's second leading industry, trailing
tourism. And citrus is the state's top agricultural product.
</P>
<P>
   The potential economic benefits of the Chinese market are
sizable. Crawford's marketing experts predict that about 300
million Chinese have the economic means to become regular consumers
of citrus.
</P>
<P>
   By 2005, the U.S. Department of Agriculture projects that this
country will sell more than $500 million worth of citrus to China.
Florida, as the nation's largest citrus producer, should have the
largest share of that business, Crawford said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Florida's sales will start more modestly. Crawford will fly to
Beijing this weekend with ten boxes of fruit, including ruby red
and white grapefruit as well as oranges. Then, next month, a
two-container shipment from an Indian River packer will arrive in
China.
</P>
<P>
   China is the fifth leading producer of oranges in the world and
the leader in tangerines. Crawford said, however, that Florida
offers a higher quality of fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Using phrases like ``abundant opportunities'' and ``boundless
promise,'' Crawford repeatedly emphasized the staggering potential
for the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, half-jokingly, the new sales could reverse the
trend of selling Florida citrus groves to make way for subdivisions
and other development.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always predicted that if we got into China, we'd be pushing
down condominiums and planting citrus trees,'' he said. ``So we'll
see.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE SOFT UNDERBELLY OF 'SOFT MONEY'
 &HT;    Eds: Restores open quotes in last sentence of 5th graf.
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release
 &HT;    Sunday, March 26.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Who knows? Perhaps we'll wake up between now and
Election Day to find that George W. Bush and Al Gore have renounced
soft money, the unlimited contributions they busily solicit from
just about every possible source.
</P>
<P>
   After having all but ignored soft money in the previous race for
the White House, the press has now decided to make a very big deal
out of it. (The soft money issue did make a late splash in the 1996
contest, but that's only because of a sizzling Chinese angle.)
</P>
<P>
   Since then, John McCain has pursued the need to ban soft money
as his political Holy Grail. On his return from Bora Bora, the
senator called on both presidential candidates to eschew soft
money. And Gore has issued his own separate challenge to Bush along
those lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, Bush could wind up as a martyr on the stake of
media vengeance and McCain's wrath. But, thus far, he's chosen to
hold fast to his faith in the power of money to win elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is to be able to encourage individuals to
participate in the process so I can get my message out, so I can
fight through the (media) filter,'' Bush said in explaining his
refusal. ``Well, viva 'soft money' if it can do the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to bear in mind that after this summer's
political conventions, it'll be illegal for either candidate to
spend so much as a dime that hasn't come from the taxpayers'
pockets. That's because they will opt to fund their general
election campaigns out a special $3-a-head contribution _ it's not
a surtax _ that income tax filers can check off on their federal
returns.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``hard money'' outlays will be off limits to Bush and
Gore as well.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a bit of history: Since 1907, it has been illegal for
corporations to spend any money in a federal election. Since 1947,
it has been illegal for labor unions to spend any money in federal
elections. And since 1974, it has been illegal for anybody to
contribute more than $1,000 to a federal candidate, or more than
$20,000 a year to a political party to use in any way the party
chooses, including directly supporting its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   So all that's left for Bush and Gore to renounce is soft money,
which they can't use directly.
</P>
<P>
   One major school of thought argues that soft money donations
unfairly tilt the political playing field. ``Money is property;
money is not speech,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a recent
Supreme Court opinion that upheld the right of a state to limit
soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has also come close to passing such a federal statute:
at one time, 58 of the needed 60 senators voted for an outright
ban. But until two more come along, soft money remains protected by
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   So, try as they might to get the press hounds unleashed by
McCain off their flanks, Bush and Gore remain powerless to keep any
rich person from saying what he or she will about them.
</P>
<P>
   Were they to collude with those rich guys in mounting an ad
campaign, then all involved could conceivably go to jail. In point
of fact, Bush says that's just what Gore did four years ago, aided
and abetted by his boss in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's known as having your issue and spending it too.

 &HT;    DESPITE DEADLOCK, INTERNET TAX PANEL ADVANCED THE DEBATE
 &HT;    With INTERNET-VOTE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, March 26.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the final meeting of a federal commission on
Internet sales taxes stumbled to an acrimonious close last week,
its work was widely described as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   But in the days since the Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce disbanded, apparently unable to make a formal
recommendation to Congress, a new assessment has been developing.
</P>
<P>
   Now observers say the panel may have succeeded in killing
Congress's option to declare the Internet free of sales taxes
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it sounds good to say 'No taxes, now and forever,' ``
said Richard Prem, a sales tax expert with Deloitte &AMP; Touche, a
nationwide accounting firm. ``But when you really look at what that
would do to state tax revenues, you start to realize the losses
could be staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes account for about a third of all state revenues. As
more business shifts to online merchants who do not collect taxes
from out-of-state customers, states could begin losing $10.8
billion annually within three years, according to a study by the
University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's debates revealed that the need to collect sales
taxes for schools, roads, police and other basic services is too
compelling to grant Internet-based businesses a permanent break
from tax collection duties, Prem said.
</P>
<P>
   So now as the debate moves to Congress, the arguments will
likely focus on how to move the nation toward a tax system in which
all merchants will have to collect and remit state sales taxes,
whether they operate out of storefronts, through the Internet, by
telephone or by mail.
</P>
<P>
   But it's far from clear how long that transition will last, or
how Congress and the states will shape the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not even clear which committees in Congress will
spearhead the debates. The Senate Finance Committee last week
announced it soon will hold hearings on Internet sales taxes, but
the Senate Commerce Committee also plans to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to controlling the tax debate, ``it's the top of
the first inning,'' said Mike Waterman, press secretary for Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., ranking minority member of the
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's two-day session in Dallas brought out a full
range of passionate arguments from anti-tax ideologues,
Internet-based businesses, traditional retailers, and tax-dependent
state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it forced Congress _ which already has blocked new
Internet taxes temporarily _ to take notice of just how complex and
important the tax issue is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the outcome, the commission has raised the level
of awareness on this issue, and that's going to make it tough for
Congress to ignore it,'' said Prem.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member advisory commission deadlocked because no tax
option could garner 13 votes, the number required for a
``supermajority'' recommendation. By a vote of 11-8, the group did
back a plan to extend the moratorium on new Internet taxes until
October 2006, eliminate telephone excise taxes and permanently ban
taxes on Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected the commission to deliver such a mixed message
when it was was created as part of a bill sponsored by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz. Then, most experts thought the group would fall
into line behind McCain, who declared the Internet should not
``become a tax collection machine for politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   But now even McCain has softened. He introduced a bill last week
to extend the moratorium for five years, rather than permanently
ban sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he has ``become convinced that we need more time to
determine ... how to ensure a level playing field for all venues of
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   His use of the phrase ``level playing field'' was music to the
ears of traditional retailers, who use the phrase often as they
argue it would be unfair to make them continue to collect sales
taxes while their online competitors largely escape those
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ``levelers'' are gaining ground, anything can happen
amid election-year politics. No one in Congress or on the
presidential campaign trail seems eager to take a firm position on
such a charged issue.
</P>
<P>
   That means lobbyists and campaign contributors will be busy
during the coming months, trying to make sure that the new
president and Congress arriving in the capital next January will be
inclined to help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looking at next year,'' said Lisa Cowell,
spokeswoman for the E-Fairness Coalition, a lobbying group
representing traditional retailers. ``We're putting our efforts
into high gear to educate the members of Congress.''

 &HT;    DESPITE DEADLOCK, INTERNET TAX PANEL ADVANCED THE DEBATE
 &HT;    With INTERNET-VOTE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, March 26.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the final meeting of a federal commission on
Internet sales taxes stumbled to an acrimonious close last week,
its work was widely described as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   But in the days since the Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce disbanded, apparently unable to make a formal
recommendation to Congress, a new assessment has been developing.
</P>
<P>
   Now observers say the panel may have succeeded in killing
Congress's option to declare the Internet free of sales taxes
forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it sounds good to say 'No taxes, now and forever,' ``
said Richard Prem, a sales tax expert with Deloitte &AMP; Touche, a
nationwide accounting firm. ``But when you really look at what that
would do to state tax revenues, you start to realize the losses
could be staggering.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales taxes account for about a third of all state revenues. As
more business shifts to online merchants who do not collect taxes
from out-of-state customers, states could begin losing $10.8
billion annually within three years, according to a study by the
University of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's debates revealed that the need to collect sales
taxes for schools, roads, police and other basic services is too
compelling to grant Internet-based businesses a permanent break
from tax collection duties, Prem said.
</P>
<P>
   So now as the debate moves to Congress, the arguments will
likely focus on how to move the nation toward a tax system in which
all merchants will have to collect and remit state sales taxes,
whether they operate out of storefronts, through the Internet, by
telephone or by mail.
</P>
<P>
   But it's far from clear how long that transition will last, or
how Congress and the states will shape the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not even clear which committees in Congress will
spearhead the debates. The Senate Finance Committee last week
announced it soon will hold hearings on Internet sales taxes, but
the Senate Commerce Committee also plans to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to controlling the tax debate, ``it's the top of
the first inning,'' said Mike Waterman, press secretary for Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., ranking minority member of the
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's two-day session in Dallas brought out a full
range of passionate arguments from anti-tax ideologues,
Internet-based businesses, traditional retailers, and tax-dependent
state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it forced Congress _ which already has blocked new
Internet taxes temporarily _ to take notice of just how complex and
important the tax issue is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the outcome, the commission has raised the level
of awareness on this issue, and that's going to make it tough for
Congress to ignore it,'' said Prem.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member advisory commission deadlocked because no tax
option could garner 13 votes, the number required for a
``supermajority'' recommendation. By a vote of 11-8, the group did
back a plan to extend the moratorium on new Internet taxes until
October 2006, eliminate telephone excise taxes and permanently ban
taxes on Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   No one expected the commission to deliver such a mixed message
when it was was created as part of a bill sponsored by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz. Then, most experts thought the group would fall
into line behind McCain, who declared the Internet should not
``become a tax collection machine for politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   But now even McCain has softened. He introduced a bill last week
to extend the moratorium for five years, rather than permanently
ban sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he has ``become convinced that we need more time to
determine ... how to ensure a level playing field for all venues of
commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   His use of the phrase ``level playing field'' was music to the
ears of traditional retailers, who use the phrase often as they
argue it would be unfair to make them continue to collect sales
taxes while their online competitors largely escape those
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Though the ``levelers'' are gaining ground, anything can happen
amid election-year politics. No one in Congress or on the
presidential campaign trail seems eager to take a firm position on
such a charged issue.
</P>
<P>
   That means lobbyists and campaign contributors will be busy
during the coming months, trying to make sure that the new
president and Congress arriving in the capital next January will be
inclined to help them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really looking at next year,'' said Lisa Cowell,
spokeswoman for the E-Fairness Coalition, a lobbying group
representing traditional retailers. ``We're putting our efforts
into high gear to educate the members of Congress.''

   The Oscars are on Sunday, which means only one thing: It's just
about time for Tony guessing to begin.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of critical reaction alone, there seem to be
several curious _ and competitive _ races for Tony Awards shaping
up. And with 12 openings in the next five weeks, things can only
get better.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks alone, two productions, ``A Moon for the
Misbegotten'' and ``True West,'' have garnered glorious notices,
have had torrid sales and have become near-certainties for
nominations in the revival category _ unless, of course, the
producers of ``True West'' can convince Tony pooh-bahs that the
1980 play is a new one. (Their logic: it has never before been
produced on Broadway.)
</P>
<P>
   All this before April, which has an acclaimed revival of ``The
Real Thing'' and a promising ``Uncle Vanya'' in the offing. One of
last year's entries, like ``The Rainmaker,'' ``Amadeus'' or ``The
Price,'' could fill out the category.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, for all the talk of revivals' dominating Broadway,
the musical revival category may be short a candidate, as only
three shows look to be in the mix, including the early favorite,
``Kiss Me Kate.'' April supplies the other two: ``Jesus Christ
Superstar'' and ``The Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Of new musicals, one is a shoo-in for a nod: ``Contact,'' which
started at Lincoln Center's Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater and reopens
at the Vivian Beaumont Theater on Thursday. ``James Joyce's `The
Dead,''' which received some of the season's best reviews, also
looks strong.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically _ and this is all theoretical _ that leaves two
nominations up for grabs. Industry types seem to think that the
season's two remaining new musicals, ``Aida,'' which opened
Thursday night , and ``The Wild Party,'' which is to open on April
13 (more on this later), are strong possibilities. Earlier
productions, including ``Marie Christine,'' ``Swing'' and
``Saturday Night Fever,'' are seen as more distant candidates,
having suffered some rough reviews.
</P>
<P>
   On the new-play front, after a barren fall, next month should
bring the openings of three or maybe all four nominees. One early
favorite is likely to be ``Copenhagen,'' which comes to New York
with the vestigial glow of its award-laden London run; it opens on
April 11. The next day, another prospect from London, ``Rose,''
opens at the Lyceum.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only one nominee for best new play, ``Side Man,'' was
written by an American with a pulse, but this year conventional
wisdom is that more living Americans will be represented.
Candidates include Arthur Miller's ``Ride Down Mount Morgan''
(April 9) and Elaine May's ``Taller Than a Dwarf'' (April 24).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``True West,'' two older entries may be
considered ``new'' plays, including a new adaptation of ``The Green
Bird,'' an 18th-century fable directed by Julie Taymor, and
``Waiting in the Wings,'' Noel Coward's 1960 play, which is
receiving its first Broadway run.
</P>
<P>
   The last potential nominee is the last to announce an opening:
``Dirty Blonde,'' Claudia Shear's meditation on the divine Mae
West, opening _ when else? _ on May 1 (May Day), at the Helen Hayes
Theater. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Show girls' Comeback &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Details are slow in coming, but a planned revival of Stephen
Sondheim's ``Follies'' is penciled into the schedule of the
Roundabout Theater Company for next season. No casting or design
team is set, but the director will likely be Matthew Warchus
(``True West''), and the target opening is spring of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Specifics about another Roundabout show are closer at hand.
``Design for Living,'' by Noel Coward, is to open next February,
with Joe Mantello directing. Mantello said he can't confirm any
casting, but Alan Cumming, Julianne Moore and Rupert Everett have
been mentioned. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not a Party Pooper &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mandy Patinkin watch continues. The star, who has been
battling a vocal inflammation, has been out of his lead role in
``The Wild Party'' since March 16. But Thursday a spokesman said
that he was improving and was likely to return to the show early
next week. Patinkin's absence has aroused speculation about a delay
in the show's opening, but producers said it was still set for
April 13. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No Rest for the Busy &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Sullivan has little of the bluster often associated with
directors, and no booming baritone, either. With a salt-and-pepper
beard and guarded gray eyes, he looks a bit like an Irish shepherd
and smiles about as often.
</P>
<P>
   His appearance notwithstanding, Sullivan is currently the
best-represented director in New York, with three plays running,
including ``Dinner With Friends,'' ``Ancestral Voices'' and the
most recent to open, ``A Moon for the Misbegotten.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which elicits a sort of embarrassed shrug from the
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see something besides my own work,'' Sullivan said
recently over a cup of coffee. ``And I'm sure New York would,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, buddy, a vacation doesn't seem in the cards. Sullivan is
already lending his talents to his next project: ``Proof,'' David
Auburn's mathematical drama opening in May at the Manhattan Theater
Club. Then he'll tackle ``Spinning Into Butter,'' a play about race
by Rebecca Gilman; Hope Davis is to star.
</P>
<P>
   And Sullivan is to be the director of ``10 Unknowns'' by Jon
Robin Baitz, a play that starred Julianna Margulies in its last
reading and is to open at Lincoln Center early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, 59, said the plays all shared a sense of ambiguity, a
quality he likes and displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm much more interested in the idea that you can't really
know people,'' he said. ``But you can attempt to get as close as
you can.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From the Dept. of very limited runs: Karen Finley will work the
kinks out of her new piece, ``Shut Up and Love Me,'' at the
Westbeth Theater Center, April 14-15. Another Westbeth alumna,
Margaret Cho, will play Town Hall on June 17. And Eddie Izzard, who
plays Westbeth in early April, will return as promised to New York,
performing on June 22-24, at Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Murphy is to star in ``Wonderful Town,'' at the Encores!
Concert Series at City Center, May 4-7.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE SOFT UNDERBELLY OF 'SOFT MONEY'
 &HT;    Eds: Restores open quotes in last sentence of 5th graf.
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (p) political categories for
release
 &HT;    Sunday, March 26.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Who knows? Perhaps we'll wake up between now and
Election Day to find that George W. Bush and Al Gore have renounced
soft money, the unlimited contributions they busily solicit from
just about every possible source.
</P>
<P>
   After having all but ignored soft money in the previous race for
the White House, the press has now decided to make a very big deal
out of it. (The soft money issue did make a late splash in the 1996
contest, but that's only because of a sizzling Chinese angle.)
</P>
<P>
   Since then, John McCain has pursued the need to ban soft money
as his political Holy Grail. On his return from Bora Bora, the
senator called on both presidential candidates to eschew soft
money. And Gore has issued his own separate challenge to Bush along
those lines.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day, Bush could wind up as a martyr on the stake of
media vengeance and McCain's wrath. But, thus far, he's chosen to
hold fast to his faith in the power of money to win elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is to be able to encourage individuals to
participate in the process so I can get my message out, so I can
fight through the (media) filter,'' Bush said in explaining his
refusal. ``Well, viva 'soft money' if it can do the trick.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also important to bear in mind that after this summer's
political conventions, it'll be illegal for either candidate to
spend so much as a dime that hasn't come from the taxpayers'
pockets. That's because they will opt to fund their general
election campaigns out a special $3-a-head contribution _ it's not
a surtax _ that income tax filers can check off on their federal
returns.
</P>
<P>
   So-called ``hard money'' outlays will be off limits to Bush and
Gore as well.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a bit of history: Since 1907, it has been illegal for
corporations to spend any money in a federal election. Since 1947,
it has been illegal for labor unions to spend any money in federal
elections. And since 1974, it has been illegal for anybody to
contribute more than $1,000 to a federal candidate, or more than
$20,000 a year to a political party to use in any way the party
chooses, including directly supporting its candidates.
</P>
<P>
   So all that's left for Bush and Gore to renounce is soft money,
which they can't use directly.
</P>
<P>
   One major school of thought argues that soft money donations
unfairly tilt the political playing field. ``Money is property;
money is not speech,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in a recent
Supreme Court opinion that upheld the right of a state to limit
soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has also come close to passing such a federal statute:
at one time, 58 of the needed 60 senators voted for an outright
ban. But until two more come along, soft money remains protected by
the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   So, try as they might to get the press hounds unleashed by
McCain off their flanks, Bush and Gore remain powerless to keep any
rich person from saying what he or she will about them.
</P>
<P>
   Were they to collude with those rich guys in mounting an ad
campaign, then all involved could conceivably go to jail. In point
of fact, Bush says that's just what Gore did four years ago, aided
and abetted by his boss in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   It's known as having your issue and spending it too.

<P>
   JAIPUR, India _ A high-tech revolution isn't the first thing
that comes to mind when Americans think of the impoverished
villages of India.
</P>
<P>
   In the hamlet of Nayla, though, just outside of Jaipur on
Thursday, President Clinton got an inspiring glimpse of the future
on Thursday, when he peered into a computer screen and saw
children's health records, downloaded from the Internet, staring
back.
</P>
<P>
   It got Clinton thinking about how the information revolution
could spawn an entire new approach to solving the problems of
health, education and grassroots development across the
impoverished villages of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really can make this work, and they get wired like
this, it'll take your breath away how much they'll grow and what
they'll do to attack poverty,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could change everything in a very, very short period of
time, and India is very well attuned to this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton will spotlight the contributions India is
making to the global information revolution, when he travels to
Hyderabad, one of three cities forming India's ``Silicon
Triangle,'' center of a burgeoning computer industry that has made
India one of the world's most important players in the global
information revolution.

   JAIPUR, India _ A high-tech revolution isn't the first thing
that comes to mind when Americans think of the impoverished
villages of India.
</P>
<P>
   In the hamlet of Nayla, though, just outside of Jaipur on
Thursday, President Clinton got an inspiring glimpse of the future
on Thursday, when he peered into a computer screen and saw
children's health records, downloaded from the Internet, staring
back.
</P>
<P>
   It got Clinton thinking about how the information revolution
could spawn an entire new approach to solving the problems of
health, education and grassroots development across the
impoverished villages of the world's poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really can make this work, and they get wired like
this, it'll take your breath away how much they'll grow and what
they'll do to attack poverty,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could change everything in a very, very short period of
time, and India is very well attuned to this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Clinton will spotlight the contributions India is
making to the global information revolution, when he travels to
Hyderabad, one of three cities forming India's ``Silicon
Triangle,'' center of a burgeoning computer industry that has made
India one of the world's most important players in the global
information revolution.

DIRECTOR'S SEAT IN CANNES?; WEST COAST STORY; PRIMAL IMAGES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE KEHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Paris they call him Le Dauphin. His real name is Olivier
Barrot, and he is the heir apparent to one of the most powerful and
prestigious positions in the world of film, director of the Cannes
International Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have heard that,'' chuckled Barrot, reedy and animated.
He was in New York to meet with members of the local film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is official yet, but in December, Barrot was named to
the newly created position of ``artistic counselor'' to the
festival by Gilles Jacob, who has been the ``delegue general''
(French for honcho) of Cannes since 1978. At the same time Jacob
announced that he would be stepping into the more ceremonial role
of president after this year's festival, leaving his position, it
is widely expected, to be filled by Barrot.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as a surprise to many members of the
French film establishment, who had assumed that the job would go to
one of the prominent critics, film magazine editors or arts
administrators who had been publicly jockeying for it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barrot comes from television, where since 1991 he has
been the host of ``Un Livre un Jour'' (``A Book a Day''), a
two-minute critique of a literary work that is broadcast six times
a week on the public network FR3.
</P>
<P>
   Barrot, whose impeccable English is tinged with a faint British
accent, acknowledges that his outsider status probably helped in
his appointment _ he arrives at the job free of favors owed _ but
points out that he has written several books about the movies,
including a study of the director Rene Clair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of people to meet and to listen to,'' Barrot
said. ``I want to be a good listener. I'm sure that Cannes, which
is No. 1, has to remain and will remain No. 1. Of course, we need
to think things over. If Gilles Jacob picked me, it's because he
thought I might have a few suggestions to make.''
</P>
<P>
   One priority for Barrot is to tighten the festival's
relationship with American producers and distributors. Because of
its placement at the middle of May, Cannes often misses out on the
more prestigious American productions, which tend to be released in
September (at which point they go to the Venice Film Festival) or
in December (when they are scooped up by Berlin). After his New
York visit, he was headed for Hollywood to meet with studio
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to know that 500, 600 films come in for
consideration. It's something else to actually screen those films,
which I've been doing. We have daily shows, we screen six, seven,
eight a day for our two committees, one for foreign films and one
for French films.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two committees never intermingle. It's all very secretive,
very confidential. It's night and day and weekends over three
months. And then, by tradition, Gilles Jacob has a press conference
on April 20 when he reveals the selection.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime Barrot is keeping his day job, which requires
him to read and review six books a week. ``After May,'' he said,
``we will see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   West Coast Story
</P>
<P>
   ``The audience always wants something fresh,'' said Jet Li, the
Asian martial-arts star who, with ``Romeo Must Die,'' has just
realized his first leading role in an American film. ``So every
year you need to create something new.''
</P>
<P>
   A hugely popular figure in Hong Kong since his first feature,
``Shaolin Temple,'' was released in 1979, Li is now hoping to
follow his friends and colleagues Jackie Chan, Chow Yun-Fat and
John Woo into Hollywood filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Li defines his style as ``a little bit different from Chan's, a
little bit cool, so it looks like dancing.'' He uses acrobatics to
create big, comedy movements. ``I am a little bit serious,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Why have Asian stars and Asian styles suddenly caught on with
the American public? ``Since 1990, the world has changed a lot,''
Li said by telephone from Los Angeles. ``Because of satellite TV
and the Internet, people get to know each other very well. Maybe 10
or 20 years ago, Americans could hardly understand what Chinese
people look like, what is their life, what kind of house or what
kind of bicycle they have. But now the audience has had a chance to
watch old Hong Kong movies, and Hong Kong people watch a lot of
American movies, so they know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Romeo Must Die,'' a very loose adaptation of
Shakespeare set among warring black and Asian gangs in San
Francisco, is a departure from Li's established style. In Hong Kong
films like ``Fong Sai Yuk'' (1993) and ``Once Upon a Time in
China'' (1991), the boyish-looking Li plays very pure, virtuous
heroes with powers just this side of the supernatural. In
``Romeo,'' which opened nationwide on Wednesday, his character, a
vengeance-seeking escaped convict, is darker and more morally
ambiguous than his standard character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cultural thing,'' he said. ``In Asia, from the
beginning the good guy is the good guy, and the bad guy is the bad
guy,'' he said. ``In America it is more complicated. In Chinese
films, the martial arts we can a little bit overdo. In America, in
this kind of story, we cannot do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he plan on commuting between Hong Kong and U.S.
productions? ``In America, productions are bigger and better than
in Hong Kong, so If I have a chance, I want to work here,'' he
said. ``Because you have more help and more money, you can tell a
story a little bit better than in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to dream!'' exclaimed Li. ``I think a movie is a dream.
I want to become a producer because you can bring some good ideas,
and then find a good, talented director and choreographer and
writer to finish your dream. To make your dream become truth! That
way is very interesting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Primal Images
</P>
<P>
   Stan Brakhage describes his work as ``independent personal
filmmaking,'' and he has been at it for nearly 50 years, producing
classics like ``Window Baby Water Moving'' and ``Scenes From Under
Childhood.'' His subject is light in all of its qualities; his
imagery is abstract and primal.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday Bard College will present Brakhage with an honorary
fine arts degree; in turn, Brakhage will present the college with
the world premiere of three new works, the 60-minute ``The God of
Day'' and the short films ``Persian Series No. 9'' and ``Water for
Maya.` The event, free and open to the public, begins at 6:30 p.m.
in Olin Hall on Bard's Annandale-on-Hudson campus; for more
information, call (914) 758-7512.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II made Edith Tzirer cry Thursday at
the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Tzirer, a Holocaust survivor, had been waiting 54 years to thank
him in person for saving her life, she said. Staring into his eyes,
her emotions got the better of her. The Roman Catholic leader
reached up with his white-robed arm and patted her gently, standing
on the cold stone floor that bore the etched names of Nazi
concentration camps in Germany and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope doesn't remember her,'' Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the
Vatican spokesman, said later. ``But her story is probably true
because the pope was there at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   It took place in a small town near Krakow, Poland, in 1945.
Liberation Day. Tzirer was 14 then, painfully thin, tubercular and
alone. She had just been released from the Skarzysko-Kamienna labor
camp. Wearing her camp uniform, she was riding a train to Krakow,
where she had lost contact with her family at the beginning of the
war in 1939. The train ran out of fuel and stopped in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   While the other passengers ate and drank, Tzirer said, she sat
off in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know to this day how he saw me,'' she said. ``He moved
the people aside and came to me and asked me why I was sitting
there like that.
</P>
<P>
   ```Did you eat? Did you drink?' he asked. I said that I hadn't
in a number of days already. He went and brought me my first cup of
tea, the first cup in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a seminary student, she said, young, tall and handsome
with blue eyes. ``To tell you the truth,'' she said, ``I thought
that it was God himself who had shown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tzirer said the man told her to come with him and board another
train, a cattle car bound for Krakow. She told him she was too weak
to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked me up and I fell back down again like a sack of
flour,'' she said. ``He took me on his back and carried me. We
walked for three, four kilometers _ I'm not sure _ through the
snow.''
</P>
<P>
   The man told her that his name was Karol Wojytla and that he was
from the town of Wadowice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the cattle car was a Jewish family, whose members whispered
to her that she should watch out that the ``priest'' didn't mean to
``lock her up in a convent,'' she said. This frightened her, she
said, and in Krakow she ran away from him. Years later, she said,
in 1978, her life established in Israel, she read in a newspaper
that Karol Wojytla had been named pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost fainted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's official biographer, Adam Bonieczi, said he was
skeptical about her story. ``I doubt she could remember him,'' he
said. ``He's told me a lot of similar stories, but I've never heard
him talk about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tzirer's story was recounted on Israeli radio and television
throughout the day Thursday. Israelis believed it because it
reaffirmed the warm feelings they have toward the pope as a
Catholic leader who grew up with Jews, helped them after the war
and then led the church to recognize the enormity of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Also, her presence at Yad Vashem seemed to validate Tzirer's
story when she was presented to the pope Thursday, one of six
Holocaust survivors whom he met there. The program was pre-arranged
with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The version of her story in the introduction to the Yad Vashem
ceremony, however, was slightly different than that told by Tzirer.
It said the young seminarian had found her lying by a fence and
took her to a train station, where she joined other survivors.
</P>
<P>
   When Tzirer came face to face with the pope Thursday, she
blurted out what she had wanted to tell him, an old Jewish saying:
``Whoever saves the life of a single Jew, it is as if he saved the
world in its entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she lost her composure.

 &HT;    Bold and sexy, `Aida' revels in magnificent metamorphosis
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Aida,'' in a word, soars.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets, even. Launched from the same biracial love story as
Verdi's opera, it's the passionate, stirring, thrilling Elton John
musical for which this Broadway season was gasping.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which opened Thursday night at the Palace Theatre,
needed every inch of its 3,000-mile runway, which started 18 months
ago with lots of promise and big problems at Atlanta's Alliance
Theatre, then hung a big right turn in Chicago. The development was
fueled by the bottomless coffers of Disney: a budget estimated at
$15 million, matching the Mouse's ``Lion King'' for the Broadway
record.
</P>
<P>
   The lucre yields a state-of-the-art spectacle in the Andrew
Lloyd Webber mode. New sets by Bob Crowley (good riddance to
Atlanta's electronic pyramid) and lighting by Natasha Katz
transport viewers to a dream world in which ancient Egypt and a
brave, new multicultural America intersect. It's as if the
Tony-winning Irish set designer (``Carousel'') took his cue from a
phrase by the poet Wallace Stevens, shaping eternity with the image
of palms at the end of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   More important are talents firmly on track since Atlanta:
composer John and lyricist Tim Rice, who honed their solid pop-rock
score; and Sherie Rene Scott, who, er, fills out the role of the
voluptuous, romantically wronged Amneris with a
clowning-through-tears vulnerability that recalls Marilyn Monroe.
Those mighty Verdi divas were never this much fun.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Heather Headley, even more electrifying than
she was in Atlanta. She plays Aida, the Nubian princess torn
between duty to her vanquished people and her love for Radames
(Adam Pascal of ``Rent''), the Egyptian captain who defeated them.
Raising the emotional stakes is the big fat coincidence (where
would opera be without it?) that Aida, hiding her royal lineage,
becomes the slave and confidante to Amneris, who's heartbroken at
Radames' lack of enthusisam over their betrothal.
</P>
<P>
   This love triangle is strikingly illustrated in the Act 2
opener, ``A Step Too Far,'' in which the three leads sing marooned
in separate pools of light inside a pyramid-shaped neon tube that
traps them like a deadly laser beam.
</P>
<P>
   It's not these high-tech trimmings, though, that lift ``Aida''
from the mixed condition it showed in Chicago three months ago to
the dazzler it is now. It was clearly sweat _ and strict attention
to musical theater traditions as old as ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, there's a number for Pascal alone (the most
improved player in the cast), ``Fortune Favors the Brave.'' It's
nothing special as a song, but it strongly establishes Radames'
swaggering, imperious character so that he can travel a full arc to
redemption as Aida's pacifist lover. It's in keeping with the more
sophisticated adult tone of the new book by David Henry Hwang and
director Robert Falls (with original author Linda Woolverton still
credited) that fleshes out Radames and balances the triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, there's a clear, moving moment when Aida and
Radames forge their spiritual bond (in ``Enchantment Passing
Through''), which kindles to passion in their fiery clinch during
``Elaborate Lives.'' By the time Aida runs her hands the length of
her body with fierce longing, we've officially jumped the fence of
standard, sexless Disney fare. No wonder the company is producing
the musical under the new banner, Hyperion Theatricals, and keeping
the squeaky-clean Disney brand off the program's title page.
</P>
<P>
   Now, finally, that slave boy Mereb (Damian Perkins), who holds
the secret of Aida's birth, is not just a walk-on but the brave,
funny sidekick _ a classic Disney type. His signature theme is one
of those heart-tugging throwbacks to the classic Broadway sound,
fitting nicely into the John mix of rock, pop and gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Now Headley, barely 25, appears to have crossed some magical
threshold of maturity, so that she has a regal authority to go with
her magnificent voice. Her show-stoppers, ``The Dance of the Robe''
and ``The Gods Love Nubia,'' nearly rival ``The Lion King's''
legendary opener on the goose-bump meter. In fact, Headley must
belt too much music, and it might take the elimination of a good
ballad, ``Easy as Life,'' to prevent overkill.
</P>
<P>
   The only other serious problem with the production is a
jarringly idiotic fashion show, a shameless pandering to the campy
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida'' is a watershed in several ways. It establishes director
Falls _ who conquered the dramatic end of the theatrical spectrum
with 1999's ``Death of a Salesman'' _ as the king of Broadway, for
it's his genius that steered ``Aida'' through stormy development.
It's a breakthrough for the Alliance as a national player to be
credited on the title page as the show's original venue (even
though the 1996 tour of ``Blues for an Alabama Sky'' was the
Atlanta theater's own, higher achievement).
</P>
<P>
   And the production should win Disney _ if not love _ at least
respect from the theater and media worlds. The company could have
chosen the safe route of ``Beauty and the Beast'' but instead kept
sweating the details, striving for a bolder, more original magic in
the tradition of ``Lion King.'' On Tony Award night in June, the
word ``Aida'' will surely be the most frequent refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida''
</P>
<P>
   Open-ended run. $25-$80. Palace Theatre, Broadway at 47th
Street, New York.
</P>
<P>
   1- 800-755-4000 or www.ticketmaster.com.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The rocking opera legend that started shakily in
Atlanta has been retooled into Broadway's hottest new musical.

 &HT;    Margaret Mitchell House host to literary happenings
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta's literary scene suffered a setback when Cliff Graubart
ended the champagne-and-chatter book parties at his Old New York
Book Shop in 1996. For years, the shop had been a gathering place
of the literati and literary groupies anytime an Atlanta author
such as Paul Hemphill, Anne Rivers Siddons or Terry Kay published a
book.
</P>
<P>
   The Margaret Mitchell House &AMP; Museum will try to fill the
cultural gap and become a center for Southern literature, says
spokeswoman Heather Hjetland. ``Working with members of our
literary advisory board, such as Tom Wolfe and Pat Conroy, we will
be hosting a series of literary events on an ongoing basis.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. Tuesday, Robert Morgan will read from his novel ``Gap
Creek,'' a recent pick for Oprah's Book Club. At 4 p.m. April 2,
three winners of the recent Southeast Booksellers Association Book
Award will be featured: Fred Chappell will read from his novel
``Look Back the Green Valley,'' Janisse Ray will talk about her
memoir, ``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood,'' and poet Rodney Jones
will read from his ``Elegy for the Southern Drawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Both events will be at the Margaret Mitchell House &AMP; Museum, 999
Peachtree St. N.E., 404-249-7012. ($5 donation requested.) More
programs will be announced in April.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Books on the Web: After the stunning success of Stephen King's
Internet-only novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' other authors are
looking at e-books more seriously. British author Jeffrey Archer
may tailor a short story for the Internet, says spokesman Stephan
Shakespeare. ``He has written one short story with four endings,''
Shakespeare told the London Independent. ``The Internet opens all
kinds of narrative possibilities.''

 &HT;    `I can be myself _ whatever incarnation that may be'
 &HT;    By T. Chante LaGon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the morning after a rave. My ears hadn't stopped ringing.
The smell of wet smoke lingered, and traces of purple eye shadow
and red mascara held on where sweat had erased everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, I felt connected. Drained _ I smiled at the thought of
dancing so hard _ yet somehow energized by a force stronger than
the brilliant lasers that flashed across the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   A rave is unforgettable. A good one changes your life.
</P>
<P>
   You start displaying PLUR _ peace, love, unity and respect _
every day. You are more open-minded. Giving strangers compliments
no longer seems strange.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that it takes a special person to be a raver. It takes
endurance. It takes a love for music that you won't hear on 99X or
Hot 97.5. Most of all, it requires a special mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   Ravers know there's something more than rush-hour traffic,
weekends in Buckhead or Sunday dinners: There's spirituality,
individuality, better living through music.
</P>
<P>
   When I walk into a party, the drums and bass remind me of my
hip-hop background. Eye candy is everywhere, from fairies and
``candy'' kids bejeweled in bright-colored necklaces and bracelets,
to dance circles surrounding breakers. Smiling faces sweep by,
almost all of them familiar, welcoming me to the community's latest
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Our community is accepting. At a rave, I can be myself _
whatever incarnation that may be.
</P>
<P>
   Our community also has its problems _ some ravers wake up
``crustified'' from Ecstacy.
</P>
<P>
   But at its essence, the spirit of the rave community is freedom.
When I close my eyes and dance like no one's watching, my soul is
rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   T. Chante LaGon, 23, is senior writer for Lunar Magazine and an
active member of the Atlanta Alliance. She has been raving for
about three years.

 &HT;    For 40 years, with wit and grace, Red Smith chronicled events of
`major insignificance'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, March 26.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Red Smith was in the middle of the ocean when news came by radio
dispatch that Babe Ruth had died. It was August 1948. Who knows
what the premier sportswriter of the day was doing in the middle of
the ocean in the middle of the baseball season _ the season he
liked best _ but in no sense was he out to sea. From the ship M.V.
Brittanic he filed a column that was vintage Red Smith:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Babe is gone, what's to be said that hasn't been
said? Nothing, when you come down to it. Just that he was Babe
Ruth. Which tells it all, for there never was another and never
will be. Probably he was the greatest ball player who ever lived,
Ty Cobb and Honus Wagner and the rest notwithstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   There is likewise a consensus that Walter W. (for Wellesley)
``Red'' Smith was the greatest sportswriter who ever lived. The
sports pages are the recycling center for superlatives, but when
Editor &AMP; Publisher magazine chose the 25 most influential newspaper
people of the 20th century last year, there was H.L. Mencken and
Ernie Pyle, Joseph Pulitzer and Adolph Ochs, and there was also Red
Smith. No other sportswriter. Donald Hall, poet and essayist,
thought Smith's columns as perfect as sonnets. Jacques Barzun
recommended him to students at Columbia University as a model of
colloquial prose style. And Ernest Hemingway, in ``Across the River
and Into the Trees,'' writes of a character who ``was reading Red
Smith, and he liked him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   When Smith died in 1982, he had been writing about events of
``major insignificance'' for four decades. He began on the
Milwaukee Sentinel and finished with The New York Times. In between
were stops in St. Louis and Philadelphia and, before it folded, at
the New York Herald-Tribune. He once wrote seven columns a week.
</P>
<P>
   An evolving prose
</P>
<P>
   Any retrospective of Smith's work invites iconoclasm, as Ira
Berkow, Smith's biographer and a fine sportswriter himself,
doubtless knows. If dues should be paid, so too should
reconsideration be uninfluenced by nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as ``Red Smith on Baseball'' amply shows, there was
none better, day after day, year after year. But how good was he?
Line by line, there have been better stylists. Roger Kahn _ who
writes of Smith in a dust-jacket blurb, ``He wreathed himself, as
he wreathed his writing, in wit and grace, courtesy and kindness''
_ had more reach. Robert Lipsyte and George Vecsey, sportswriters
for the Times, have more depth. And not many have matched John
Updike in The New Yorker, writing of Ted Williams' home run in his
last at-bat at Fenway Park, where Williams had heard so many boos
over his tempestuous career:
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran as he always ran out home runs _ hurriedly, unsmiling,
head down, as if our praise were a storm of rain to get out of. He
didn't tip his cap. Though we thumped, wept and chanted, `We Want
Ted,' for minutes after he hid in the dugout, he did not come back.
...,'' Updike wrote. ``Gods do not answer letters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Red Smith was doing it day after day, or close to it, some
days more felicitously than others. Reading him decade by decade,
from the 1940s until 1982, you see how his celebrated prose in fact
changed quite noticeably. He came of age in the day of Damon
Runyon, Heywood Hale Broun and Grantland Rice, and his early
columns have echoes of a style that does not wear well (``By
special arrangement with the Hudson Tubes,'' he began a column in
1946, ``an expedition to this model political community was made
today to get a look at Jackie Robinson, the model Negro infielder
of the Dodgers' model Montreal farm'').
</P>
<P>
   A captive of the sports page
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, when his syndicated column appeared in 250 papers,
his voice was losing the occasional mannerism; the turns of phrase
were lighter. He had come to admire the natural ease of E.B.
White's prose, and the emulation is evident. But he never quite
achieved a range and fluency that would be at home outside the
sports page. Easy and often enjoyable as he was to read, he was
seldom memorable.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, on its face, a criticism: He was paid only to write
a sports column, and in his prime he wrote the best one in the
land. But it's worth asking whether those events of ``major
insignificance'' he wrote about did not, now and then, bear closer
examination than he gave them. It never occurred to Smith that
baseball's color line, for example, was something to be challenged
in print. Or that women sportswriters should have the same right of
locker-room access that male reporters enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
   He was both a master of his craft and a captive of it.
``Looking,'' he wrote once of Babe Ruth, ``you would have seen a
barrel swaddled in a wrap-around camel-hair topcoat with a flat
camel-hair cap on the round head. Thus arrayed he was instantly
recognizable not only on Broadway in New York but also on the Ginza
in Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   In an age of ESPN, as Wilfrid Sheed once put it, sportswriters
are ``heralds without news, eyewitnesses in a world of
eyewitnesses.'' Smith, at his best, recalls a day when they were,
if not lords of the earth, at least of the late edition.

 &HT;    It's hard work making career of party scene
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Atlanta's party scene flourishes, some people are
raving for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Weil, 28, and Sabrina Sexton Weil, 25, have turned their
passion for raves into Lunar Magazine, an e-zine that features DJ
profiles, party reviews and a calendar of Atlanta parties.
Launching in February 1999, Lunar (www.lunarmagazine.com) now has
50,000 visitors a month. Although it hasn't turned a profit, it
carries ads from companies such as Microsoft, Priceline.com and
Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   The couple met in 1992 at the University of Georgia. They threw
parties that attracted as many as 700 to Athens, Ga., from all over
the Southeast. In Atlanta, they found computer industry jobs, but
they wanted to continue in the rave scene. ``There are times when
we've looked at each other and said, `Let's just quit,' because
it's so much work,'' Sabrina said. ``But if we did, I think people
would bomb our house.''
</P>
<P>
   Other area ravepreneurs include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Darren ``D-Funk'' Hart, 23, and his girlfriend, Jennifer
Horton, 24, of Lawrenceville, Ga., who have been throwing raves for
about a year under the name Charisma. They and their other
investors put up $30,000 for their first party. ``When you throw
your first party, you always lose your shirt,'' said Hart. For the
next party, Charisma is printing about 20,000 fliers for
distribution at record stores, under windshields and at an Atlanta
clothing store called Wish, which specializes in rave gear.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Gene Carbonell, 27, of Atlanta, who recently quit his day job
_ and his girlfriend _ to devote more time to his career. He's
hired an agent, landed his first foreign gig at a dance club in
Mexico and signed a recording contract with an Orlando record
label. ``This is my livelihood now,'' said Carbonell. ``But it's
not about the money. I've done this for free, and I will again. I
love this so much I will be doing it until the day I die.''

MICROSTRATEGY GETS CUTE AND PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS GETS CAUGHT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microstrategy's reputation may survive its accounting fiasco.
But what about its auditors?
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers is the accounting firm that first
certified and then rejected MicroStrategy's financial statements.
It is the firm that helped the company write a news release
explaining the changes, and then helped it to write another news
release explaining that the first release was completely wrong on a
crucial point.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of how that came to be raises questions about both the
firm's competence and its commitment to being an independent
auditor whose word can be trusted when it certifies that financial
statements comply with the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, here's what happened: MicroStrategy, a software and
Internet company, became a Wall Street darling thanks in part to
rapidly rising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   It now turns out that the company was, for at least two years,
not in compliance with the primary rule on revenue recognition for
software companies, Statement 97-2, which was issued by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in 1997. But to
know that you had to understand the rule and have access to the
company's contracts with its customers. There was no way to know
that from reading the public financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The PricewaterhouseCoopers' office in McLean, Va., certified the
1998 and 1999 financial statements. There is no indication that it
sought guidance from experts at the firm's national office who deal
with tricky accounting issues.
</P>
<P>
   Things might have continued as they were had MicroStrategy not
gotten a little cute. In October and again in January the company
announced unusual deals that increased revenues for the quarters
just ended. Each deal involved MicroStrategy selling to a customer
that simultaneously sold something else to MicroStrategy.
</P>
<P>
   That smelled funny to Howard Schilit, who runs the Center for
Financial Research and Analysis. He put out two reports critical of
the company. Forbes magazine followed with an article raising
similar questions.
</P>
<P>
   That is how one of the world's great auditing firms discovered
there was a problem. An accountant in the national office of
PricewaterhouseCoopers read the Forbes piece, according to one
person involved in the affair, and called the local office with
questions. Meetings followed, and MicroStrategy soon said its
accounting was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But MicroStrategy's mea culpa, which was approved in advance by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, cited the wrong accounting literature. It
pointed to a relatively new statement from the Securities and
Exchange Commission that had nothing to do with the issue. That
offended some people at the SEC, and soon MicroStrategy issued a
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls on MicroStrategy think the company can flourish without
dubious accounting. Time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   But for PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was embarrassed a few
months ago by the revelation that many of its partners ignored
rules barring them from having financial relationships with audit
clients, the questions are more pressing. Was the local office
unfamiliar with Statement 97-2? Why did the national office not get
involved before the audit was completed? After the accounting was
fixed, who signed off on the misleading explanation?
</P>
<P>
   David Nestor, a spokesman for the accounting firm, declined to
answer those questions, saying they related to confidential client
affairs. But he did say that concerns about offending a client or
losing an account played no role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't compromise on audit quality,'' he said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The jet stream disturbance that brought thunderstorms and some
tornadoes to the southern Plains in the last two days will weaken
as it moves to the northern Mississippi Valley on Friday. As a
result, thundershowers from southern Minnesota to the western Ohio
Valley should not be severe, although local downpours will occur.
Lighter showers will spread across the Great Lakes states Friday
night. In the wake of the showers, breezy, cooler conditions will
arrive in the northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and unseasonably mild weather will cover most of the East on
Friday. Sprawling high pressure will promote ample sunshine over
most areas near the Atlantic seaboard. Sun will mix with clouds
west of the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The West will be mainly dry, although scattered snow showers
will accompany a front in the southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DOPPLER RADAR
</P>
<P>
   Spring is when Doppler radar proves its worth. The radar can
detect twisting winds in a thunderstorm, a sign that a tornado
might be developing. The radar relies on a principle called the
Doppler effect. As a train approaches, its whistle seems to have a
higher pitch. When the train is moving away, the whistle has a
lower pitch. This is the Doppler effect. In essence, raindrops
caught in the rotating winds in a severe thunderstorm have
different ``pitches,'' depending on whether they move toward or
away from the radar. Forecasters can thus get an early clue of an
impending tornado. &QL;

`GOLDEN DOLLAR' ELUSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (attn: Bakersfield) 
 By KERRY FEHR-SNYDER 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Mint says there are 350 million in circulation, but the
new dollar coin is turning out to be as elusive as a vending
machine that accepts your crumpled currency.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that's about to change. The ``golden dollar''
should start showing up any week now, mint spokesman Michael White
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes awhile for them to get into the pipeline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first transaction nationally involving the new coin was at a
Wal-Mart Supercenter in north Scottsdale, when a cashier gave one
to a Mesa girl as change when she was buying a gift for her
grandparents. That was Jan. 27, a day after the coin was shipped
from the mint to the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   White predicts that the new dollar coin will be more successful
than the Susan B. Anthony dollar because it's easier to distinguish
from a quarter (a criticism on the Susan B.) and because it's being
distributed through major retailers, getting it into cash drawers
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The new coin, bearing the likeness of Sacagawea, the Shoshone
guide for explorers Lewis and Clark, has a plain edge, a wider
border and a golden color.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did extensive testing to see that you can pick it out from
other change and found people had no problem,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the mint sent 100 million coins to Wal-Mart stores
around the country and another 100 million to Federal Reserve
Banks, which sold them to commercial banks based on demand.
</P>
<P>
   This month, it shipped another 100 million to the Federal
Reserve and 50 million more to smaller financial institutions known
as correspondent banks.
</P>
<P>
   But finding the coin is difficult. Banks around the Phoenix area
have received very few.
</P>
<P>
   One place that still reports a stock is the same Wal-Mart that
made that first transaction. The store, near Hayden Road and Frank
Lloyd Wright Boulevard, routinely makes change with the coins, said
David Lamp, the store's co-manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stores are about out of them, so some people come
to our store specifically for the coin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think you're going to stock up on the coins, think
again. Wal-Mart has set a $10 limit per customer on the coins.
</P>
<P>
   Lamp, a coin collector, also warned customers not to consider
the dollar coins as a collector item.
</P>
<P>
   White, of the mint, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect by the 14th week of manufacturing, we'll hit 500
million coins,'' he said. ``It took 14 years for the Susan B. to
hit that amount.'' &QL;

POWER PLAY: HOT CARTOON TRIO STARTED IN THE CLASSROOM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It started as a Sherman Oaks animation student's class project.
Now ``The Powerpuff Girls,'' a cartoon series about three
superheroes with a twist, has become a pop-culture phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The program, the second-most-watched show on the Cartoon
Network, features sugarcoated dynamic divas who keep their city of
Townsville safe from a vast array of comically evil forces.
</P>
<P>
   The twist, however, is that our superheroes first must ask to be
excused from kindergarten for the day before they fly into action
to save the world.
</P>
<P>
   Episodes of the Emmy-nominated ``Powerpuff Girls'' are broadcast
four days a week on the cable channel, which is currently seen in
60.8 million homes. The witty series, which has the look of Japan's
distinctive animation style known as anime and often verges on
surrealism, is popular with male and female viewers of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls are basically a combination of cuteness and
toughness,'' says Craig McCracken, 28, creator, writer and director
of the Powerpuffs. ``It's got elements that appeal to boys and
girls, and the relationship between the girls is lifelike: They're
best friends, but they can also be rivals just like real sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken's inspiration for ``The Powerpuff Girls'' stems from
``The Whoopass Girls,'' a student film he created six years ago
while studying character animation at California Institute of the
Arts (CalArts) in Valencia. His unusual superhero film was selected
for the 1994 Festival of Animation.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, the film evolved into two seven-minute
``Powerpuff Girls'' episodes for Hanna-Barbera and Cartoon
Network's ``World Premiere Toons'' project, where the kindergarten
heroines quickly became viewer favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Powerpuff Girls'' debuted in fall 1998 as a separate
weekly series.
</P>
<P>
   As for merchandising, the colorful Powerpuff logo can be spotted
on T-shirts, backpacks, dolls and clocks, while stores including
Aahs and Target have special Powerpuff displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show looks different from other cartoons, and I think
that's because the creators are young enough to have been
influenced by anime, the humor of Monty Python and things like
Pokemon,'' says Mike Lazzo, senior vice president of programming
and production at the Cartoon Network. ``There isn't that heavy
Disney influence you see in previous generations. Powerpuff has a
modern sense of humor that's not so based on one-liners, so it can
be conceptual in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the story line, the girls Blossom, Bubbles and
Buttercup were developed by genetic engineer Professor Utonium, who
set his sights on creating the world's most ``perfect'' girls.
While preparing a concoction of ``sugar and spice and everything
nice,'' he accidentally adds a mysterious fourth ingredient,
Chemical X.
</P>
<P>
   This fateful addition leads to the creation of three toddlers
whose mission in life alternates between fighting crime and winning
at hopscotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's witty and girly and cute,'' says Powerpuff fan Nicole
Montgomery, 30, of Sherman Oaks. ``There's nothing else quite like
it. It's the first cartoon that features cute girls who kick ass.
There's tongue-in-cheek humor for adults, but kids can like it,
too. It's got appeal for all ages. And there's an added bonus:
People always tell me I look like Buttercup.''
</P>
<P>
   The series is produced by the same Sherman Oaks-based animation
team McCracken and Genndy Tartakovsky behind the four-time
Emmy-nominated series, ``Dexter's Laboratory.''
</P>
<P>
   With the success of ``The Simpsons,'' ``King of the Hill'' and
``South Park,'' animation has never been more mainstream on TV.
NBC, for example, debuted its new cartoon series, ``God, the Devil
and Bob,'' last Thursday while ABC will soon unveil the animated
``Clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Each ``Powerpuff Girls'' show is made up of two 11-minute
episodes. On Valentine's Day weekend, the network broadcast an
eight-hour ``Powerpuff'' marathon.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best elements of the program is the lineup of
villains, an array of evil that includes the Gangrene Gang, Mommy
Fearest, the Amoeba Boys, Fuzzy Lumpkins, Roach Coach and Mojo
Jojo. The last is a super-intelligent monkey who hates the human
race because he's low on the evolutionary ladder even though he's a
criminal genius.
</P>
<P>
   The show also sometimes spoofs pop culture, such as in a recent
episode where the girls had to destroy a disco ball in space that
resembled the Death Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something fits in a natural way, we'll bring it in,''
McCracken said. ``It's not like the Powerpuff Girls are going to
turn up in `Titanic.' But if you're gonna destroy a giant disco
ball in space, it's got to be the Death Star.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken said the influence of Japanese animation on
``Powerpuff'' is not pronounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the best design was done in the `50s, and some of the
best people who do action today are in anime,'' he explained.
``It's not a direct homage, but that element sticks out. I, myself,
really haven't seen that much anime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Cartoon Network views ``Powerpuff'' as a
valuable brand in terms of merchandising, said Tim Hall, executive
vice president of the network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real breakout show in terms of licensing,'' he said.
``It appeals to such a broad range of ages that there are lots of
opportunities. The trick is to manage it for the long term. We have
to be careful not to overexpose it and retain the cool flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Powerpuff'' line also includes a new book published by
Scholastic and a pair of home videos due May 30. The videos,
``Monkey See, Doggie Do'' and ``Bubblevicious,'' each feature five
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes will include a 16-page mini-magazine filled with
games, stickers, interviews and bios of the Powerpuff Girls and
their enemies. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the years after the Soviet Union's
disintegration, the United States has sent Russia more than $7
billion to safeguard its nuclear arsenal, feed its people, prop up
its space program and nourish the seedlings of a private enterprise
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been, by almost all accounts, less than
stellar.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economy has taken a nose-dive. Its space program fell
behind in building its components for the International Space
Station, creating delays for the project and cost overruns for U.S.
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a six-year effort and a half-billion dollars in U.S.
assistance, only a small amount of Russia's nuclear materials are
now stored in secure buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there are few signs that America is about to cut off
the aid spigot, now that acting President Vladimir Putin, the
former KGB officer, moves toward becoming Russia's second
democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already tolerated all kinds of shenanigans in Russia for
a very long time,'' said Dan Goure, a deputy director at the
Washington research group, Center for Strategic and International
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin would have to go almost out of his way to do something
so outrageous, so anti-American that it would cause either (the
United States or Russia) to ratchet back their relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Goure and others readily concede that direct American aid, plus
$22.6 billion in loans from the International Monetary Fund and $11
billion from the World Bank have not accomplished a great deal
toward solving Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he held that it is hard to see how any U.S. administration
would suspend aid to a country with the world's largest land mass
and a second largest stockpile of nuclear weaponry. ``If anything
goes wrong, the blame falls on the administration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one outspoken critic of aid to Russia predicted that
Putin may prove more successful in dealing with the United States
than his ailing predecessor Boris Yeltsin, whose U.S. relations
went from sweet to sour during his often-rocky tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putin is smarter, shrewder and more calculating,'' said David
Kramer, senior fellow at the Project for the New American Century,
a small conservative research group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Direct bilateral aid, in financial terms, is not very
significant for propping up Putin,'' Kramer said. But, he added
that it has symbolic power: ``It sends a political message: if
there is no change in (aid) policy, then it suggests that we are
continuing business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's strategy has been to talk tough and crack down on
Chechen rebels at home as he proposes more accommodation on nuclear
issues abroad. He has endorsed ratification for the long-delayed
START II missile treaty, and said he might be open to changing the
Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty to permit a U.S. missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   The new Russian leader also restored NATO ties which had been
frayed during the U.S.-led bombing of Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk could avert attention from Russian problems, ranging
from widespread corruption to the glacial pace of reforms and
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of friction in U.S.-Russian joint efforts
continues. Among recent examples, the U.S. General Accounting
Office warned earlier this month that Russia and the rest of the
old Soviet Union still have 650 metric tons of enriched uranium and
plutonium. That's enough to make about 40,000 nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those nuclear materials remain in unsecured buildings
and under increasing threat of theft, said the GAO, which is the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, after spending $481 million over six years, the United
States completed installation of security systems for just 7
percent of that material, the accounting office reported.
</P>
<P>
   The slow pace was traced largely to resistance from the Russian
government, which has locked U.S. officials out of the nuclear
weapons complex where much of the material is stored. Moreover, the
Russian government has soaked up some of the U.S. aid by taxing it.
</P>
<P>
   American costs for safeguarding and dismantling the nuclear
arsenal have reached $5 billion with no clear end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone recognizes that these are large amounts of money,''
said Jon B. Wolfsthal, an associate with the Carnegie Endowment for
Peace and a former special assistant and policy adviser for the
U.S. Department of Energy, which runs much of nuclear safeguard
efforts in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, there's no way to overstate the threat that
the United States now faces from the former of Soviet Union,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the nuclear material watched over by guards who had no
coats or boots in the winter and no pay in summer, and nuclear
weapons labs where Russian scientists, unpaid for months at a time,
could sell their expertise to Iran, Iraq or China.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. subsidies have not been completely successful, he
acknowledged, but he added, ``Half a loaf is better than no loaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems have also haunted the U.S.-Russian space projects.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's failure to complete its space station components on
time have been estimated by the House Science Committee to have
cost billions of dollars in extra expenses to NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, congressional investigators are currently looking into
safety problems with two Russian-built modules, including one that
has already been launched into orbit for the space station. Neither
module offers enough protection from space debris, neither can
operate after loss of cabin pressure and both have excessive noise
levels, Allen Li, a GAO official, told a House subcommittee on
March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Concern in Congress over whether the Russian space agency was
helping Iran develop long-range missiles prompted both houses to
pass resolutions threatening to cut off Russian space subsidies
unless the president can certify that no missile information was
passed along.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the policy of an ally, but that's not what we are,''
said Goure of CSIS. ``The notion of a strategic partnership which
the Clinton administration touted five years ago is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to be a difficult relationship. There's no doubt
about that.''

RWANDA PRESIDENT QUITS, UPSETTING POLITICAL BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Rwanda's president resigned Thursday, capping
months of growing tension in the government and casting uncertainty
over the central African country's pursuit of ethnic reconciliation
between Hutus and Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   Pasteur Bizimungu's departure follows the forced resignations
earlier this year of four Cabinet ministers who had been the
targets of parliamentary investigations into official corruption.
In what turned out to be his last major speech, Bizimungu lashed
out at the legislature Monday, accusing it of destabilizing the
country and contravening the constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in government comes during Rwanda's delicate healing
process six years after 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were
slain in a genocidal spree sponsored by the former Hutu leadership.
A prominent Hutu in a predominantly Tutsi government, Bizimungu
served as a symbol of national unity.
</P>
<P>
   It also coincides with rising anti-Tutsi sentiment throughout
the region as frustration grows with Rwanda's involvement in the
war in neighboring Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a reconciliation point of view, this will shake up the
show,'' said Jan van Eck, a specialist from the University of Cape
Town on conflict resolution in central Africa. ``The government has
been accused of being Tutsi. If they don't have a Hutu in there at
all, it will create a poor impression. The picture of a joint front
will be tarnished.''
</P>
<P>
   Bizimungu came to office after the 1994 genocide as part of a
government of national unity and reconciliation established by the
Rwandese Patriotic Front, the Tutsi-led rebel army that toppled the
murderous Hutu government and set about trying to reverse decades
of ethnic polarization. Compulsory identity cards, indicating
whether one was Hutu or Tutsi, were banned. The new parliament
included a careful mix of both ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the new president was never the fulcrum of power. Real
authority rested with the new vice president and defense minister,
Colonel Paul Kagame, a talented young military strategist who led
the rebellion. Kagame heads both the military and the ruling party
and is widely considered to be the driving force in government.
</P>
<P>
   Rising tensions in the government in recent months have
reflected that uneasy relationship, sources said. Numerous
corruption inquiries aimed against senior government officials
allied more with Bizimungu than Kagame have resulted in a wave of
resignations. Two of the four ministers recently forced out were
close friends of the president. Joseph Sebarenzi, a Tutsi from a
small opposition party who was speaker of the National Assembly,
resigned in January after being accused of graft.
</P>
<P>
   Bizimungu's speech Monday followed the announcement a day
earlier of a new Cabinet constructed by the ruling party over his
objections.
</P>
<P>
   But all sides were united Thursday during an emergency session
of the parliament to debate and accept Bizimungu's resignation,
according to one senior legislator. ``Hutus and Tutsis were all
together on the decision to condemn the president,'' said Tito
Rutaremara, a member of parliament from the ruling party, speaking
on the phone from Kigali, the capital. ``All the people who heard
his speech were scandalized.''
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic ramifications of Bizimungu's resignation both within
Rwanda and throughout central Africa may be determined in the next
few days as a successor is put in place. ``This is a most delicate
moment,'' said Tarsis Karugarama, a prosecutor general in Kigali.
``Let's see how it is handled constitutionally.''

&HT;     SEASONING VERSUS NEW BLOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are always two sides to politics: an inside
and an outside.
</P>
<P>
   The insiders are usually seasoned veterans of the party
establishment, and the outsiders usually younger versions eager to
shove aside their elders to make room for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This continuing job rotation pits seasoned, experienced heads
against those who can bring fresh energy and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the old-timers have outstayed their welcome and are
out of touch with the changing needs of their constituents. But
sometimes the newcomers are uninformed egotists who lack the
character and integrity of the incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   Old is not necessarily bad, and new is not necessarily good.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, thanks to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the
Republican congressional majority is about to find out whether a
massive turnover of powerful GOP House chairmanships next year
makes government more responsive or less.
</P>
<P>
   This assumes that the Republicans retain control of the House in
the fall election, which is far from a sure thing. If the Democrats
recapture the majority, they will control the chairmanships and set
their own House rules.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Gingrich's devotion to term limits, he imposed
mandatory caps of six years on every chairmanship in the flush of
the 1994 Republican capture of Congress. The action was meant to
help consolidate his own power as speaker, which failed
spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, congressional Republicans are stuck with the rule.
And the most important consequence is certain turmoil in the ranks
next year. Five current committee chairmen have chosen to retire
rather than be demoted from their powerful positions.
</P>
<P>
   The five departing Republican heavies are Ways and Means
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas; Commerce Chairman Tom Bliley,
R-Va.,; Education Chairman William Goodling, R-Pa; Budget Chairman
John Kasich, R-Ohio, and Appropriations Chairman John Edward
Porter, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, in his 15th term, is 72 years old. Bliley, in his 10th
term, is 68. Goodling, in his 13th term, is 72. Kasich, the baby of
the group at 48, is in his 9th term. Porter, in his 10th term, is
64.
</P>
<P>
   These men are not ancient by today's standards. They possess all
their marbles and have a wealth of experience. Archer and Kasich
are better-known nationally than the others and have often clashed
over their differing budget priorities.
</P>
<P>
   But only Kasich can be considered a major legislative influence,
credited with winning a balanced budget deal with President Clinton
in 1997. Kasich was tarred, however, by the 1995-1996 budget
stalemate that led to a government shutdown, for which the GOP took
most of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   Archer has had trouble dominating his own committee and for
years has promoted a tax on consumption to replace the income tax,
an idea for which he has been unable to garner any support.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley is best known for announcing when he took over the
Commerce Committee chairmanship that there would be no more
hearings into tobacco industry practices. It was before his
committee, under the previous Democratic chairman, Henry Waxman,
that five industry giants raised their hands and vowed they did not
know smoking was addictive. Despite the escalating political
struggle to contain smoking, the Commerce Committee under Bliley
has been missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Goodling is a strong conservative who initially tried to dump
the popular school lunch program in favor of unmonitored block
grants to the states. He backed away from that plan when it became
a public relations disaster but has since tried to do in other
domestic programs, undercutting the minimum wage and limiting
unions in various ways.
</P>
<P>
   Porter is the only moderate of the group on social issues. He
has departed from the party line often enough to arouse right-wing
opposition at home and in Congress. He was even briefly inclined to
oppose the impeachment of President Clinton although in the end he
joined his GOP colleagues in the official condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   No individual is indispensable. These men can be replaced, and
few voters will notice. But the internal dynamics will surely be
different. The personalities, political skills and ideology of
their successors will determine how these all-important committees
change.
</P>
<P>
   Congress used to operate strictly by seniority, but that too has
been transformed. Now the next-in-line must often withstand a
challenge from an aggressive colleague of less seniority, which can
make for a healthy policy dialogue or build fresh resentments.
</P>
<P>
   The basic term limits cause, which Republicans used to eagerly
embrace, has now fallen on bad times as members of Congress elected
on a pledge to limit their service face their own, unwanted
retirement. Some are keeping their word, but two prominent men are
not.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., chairman of the House Republican
Conference and the party's most visible elected black official,
said when he was elected in 1994 that he would serve only three
terms. But now that the deadline is here, he has changed his mind,
saying he no longer thinks limiting terms is a potent political
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger hypocrite, however, is George Nethercutt, R-Wash.,
who took House Speaker Thomas Foley's seat away largely on a pledge
to serve no more than three terms to avoid the ossification of long
service. Nethercutt says he made a mistake and has discovered that
seniority can be useful after all. What a mush-head.

ROBINSON REPLACES FTOREK AT HELM OF DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shaky ground that every coach treads crumbled unexpectedly
Thursday beneath the feet of Robbie Ftorek, who woke up as head
coach of the first-place Devils and soon found himself walking the
fault line of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek, whose Devils held the top spot in the NHL's Eastern
Conference with a 41-25-8 record, was replaced by Hall of Fame
defenseman Larry Robinson, who will be behind the bench when the
Devils face the Islanders Friday night in Uniondale, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned that his Devils were playing without ``ice
discipline'' of late, New Jersey general manager Lou Lamoriello
said the move was necessary because he ``did not see light at the
end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old Ftorek, a star with Needham High School in the
'60s, was not popular with the Devils' players, including veterans,
which ultimately led to his downfall. Widely considered to be
stubborn, strong-willed, and unwilling to coddle players _
essential for every coach here in the 21st century _ Ftorek was
dismissed after going 39 games over .500 in his nearly two years
behind the Exit 16W bench.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran defenseman Lyle Odelein, recently traded to Phoenix,
said upon leaving that the Devils, though successful, were
``playing for themselves and not for the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say the team is not as happy as it appears,''
Odelein added. An unrestricted free agent July 1, Odelein bluntly
said he would not consider re-signing with the Devils as long as
Ftorek remained coach.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Souray made similar comments upon being dealt to the
Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost respect for me,'' said Souray, referring to Ftorek,
``and I lost respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The move was reminiscent of Boston's firing of Fred Creighton
nearly 20 years to the day, March 22, 1980. With rookie Ray Bourque
in the lineup, Creighton's Bruins were an impressive 40-20-13 with
seven games left.
</P>
<P>
   But with the club in a 1-2-4 tailspin, and with veterans
grumbling that Creighton was a poor and unlikable replacement for
beloved coach Don Cherry, general manager Harry Sinden dumped
Creighton and moved behind the bench himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden, in his office Thursday, recalled that he made the move
after conferring with a number of players upon the club arriving in
Atlanta following a loss the night before in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say who they were,'' said Sinden. ``But from that
meeting, it became clear to me that the team had tuned out Fred. I
don't know if it was a matter of them not liking him, or what, but
from what they were telling me, they'd tuned him out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, with Sinden back there for the first time since
coaching them to the Stanley Cup in '70, went 6-1-0 in the final
seven games and dumped Pittsburgh in the opening round of the
playoffs before falling to the Islanders in Round 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are looking for the same kind of emotional jolt with
Robinson, their former assistant coach, now calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Winners of the Stanley Cup in '95, when Robinson assisted head
coach Jacques Lemaire, the Devils missed the playoffs the next
season and have won but one postseason round since. Last spring,
after going an impressive 47-24-11 under Ftorek in the regular
season, they got rubbed out by Pittsburgh in Round 1 of the
playoffs, able to score just 18 goals in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek was not available to the media following Lamoriello's
announcement, which was made via conference call from his office in
East Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to the Bruins of 20 years ago, the Devils had lost 10 of
their last 16 games, a fall that prompted Lamoriello last week to
deal for Alexander Mogilny at the trade deadline. Earlier they
picked up highly-regarded Russian defenseman Vladimir Malakhov from
the Canadiens in exchange for Souray.
</P>
<P>
   With little improvement following those deals, Lamoriello pulled
the trigger, opting to finish the season with Robinson, who was
dismissed as the Kings' head coach last spring after getting Los
Angeles into only one playoff round in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of people phoned me and asked, `How are you
feeling?'' Robinson said recently, reflecting on his four years as
the Kings head coach. ``And I'd say, `Fine, why are you asking?'
And they'd say, `Because you look like hell on TV.' Being a head
coach does age a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who will turn 49 in June, now gets to find out if he
has a team for the ages, or one that simply ages him.

PRESIDENT A TOURIST IN INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-INDIA) 
(rk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAIPUR, India _ President Clinton rode into the tall grass and
wild countryside of northern India Thursday afternoon, clouds of
dust trailing his open-air safari vehicle as he went in search of
the elusive Bengal tiger.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it _ or astute advance work by Indian
trackers _ the president came across not one, but two of his
quarry.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, like any wondrous tourist who had just seen one of
the sensations of the animal kingdom, Clinton was effusive about
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, there was a ``huge male'' yellow and black
striped tiger, known as Boomerang, lying imperiously under a tree.
``He's the biggest tiger out there, the biggest of the 16 on the
preserve,'' Clinton said, with some satisfaction, to a group of
reporters during an after-dinner conversation at his luxury hotel
here.
</P>
<P>
   To top the first sighting, Clinton's guide, Fateh Singh Rathore,
then steered the vehicle toward a female tiger stalking deer: ``She
missed getting the deer by a second,'' said Clinton, who then went
on to describe egrets, peacocks and storks.
</P>
<P>
   Before the president's departure for India, the White House was
upfront in saying that part of his purpose was to show off India,
in all its aspects, to the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Clinton visited a village in the morning, and then
went about enjoying the high-end tourist market and publicizing the
conservation movement that is trying to save the dwindling numbers
of Bengal tigers.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential entourage chose the Ranthambhore Tiger Reserve,
one of 27 such havens in India that try to protect the tigers
threatened by the destruction of their habitat, and most of all by
poaching. An illegal market for tiger parts used for traditional
medicines flourishes in India and Clinton said he had been told
during his drive that 20 tigers had been slaughtered in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,500 Bengal tigers remain in India, a dramatic reduction
from the estimated 40,000 that roamed the jungles as late as 1925,
according to local conservation groups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described his guide, Rathore, as a veteran
conservationist who had survived the wrath of his village neighbors
some years ago when he decided to try to set up the preserve here.
Some of the villagers' homes had to be moved when the preserve was
created more than 20 years ago, Clinton said, adding that Rathore
had done heroic work against the odds to save the endangered
animals.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with Clinton's safari, the White House said
Thursday the United States would give nine small grants totaling
$250,000 to wildlife groups working in tiger and elephant
conservation in India.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking off on his three-hour safari, Clinton toured a
16th-century palace-citadel known as Amber Fort, considered a
classic example of Mogul architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The president admired the walled compound, strolled through its
interior with his daughter, Chelsea, and had more encounters with
India's animal world.
</P>
<P>
   The fort serves as a habitat for monkeys, some of which seemed
fascinated with the presidential visitor, a fascination that
Clinton said he wasn't sure how to cope with.
</P>
<P>
   But, then he said, he realized that the monkeys were taken not
so much with him, but with the leis of flowers that were strung
around his neck when he arrived at the fort. Clinton threw a lei of
red blooms at the most curious monkey, a maneuver that solved the
situation. ``Once I was deflowered, they weren't interested in
me,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the advice of aides who accompanied him Thursday, the
president said, he forsook one of the traditions of the fort: an
elephant ride through the stone gate entrance. Other celebrity
visitors have made such rides, including Jacqueline Kennedy during
her 1962 tour of India as first lady, and Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Chelsea in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's large physique and presidential dignity were not
two concepts that went well together on the back of an elephant,
two of his top aides counseled, who then went off for a ride
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   After his foray into the outdoors, Clinton spent the night at
the Rajvilas, a luxury resort hotel of ersatz Mogul architecture
and handsome rooms decked out with sunken marble baths and canopied
four poster beds. White House staffers said the hotel was among the
fanciest the president and his advisers had stayed at during his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's two-bedroom suite, billed as the Royal Villa, usually
goes for $1,200 a night. His aides said that the hotel had offered
discounts for the White House party, a deal that is often arranged
with hotels abroad which garner publicity from a presidential
visit.
</P>
<P>
   But the prices at the gift shop, where fashionable pashmina
shawls _ made from the hair of goats grown in Kashmir _ were not
cut rate. One antique example of an outsized shawl, described by
the shop's sales woman as 120 years old, was tagged at $9,877.
</P>
<P>
   This probably far exceeded the cost of two carpets Clinton
bought at the Sheraton Hotel where he stayed in New Delhi. The
salesman later told the Indian papers that the price was a ``trade
secret.''

&HT;     JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE MISSING WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has launched a criminal
inquiry into why thousands of subpoenaed White House e-mail
messages were never turned over to a federal grand jury and three
congressional committees, according to court papers filed Thursday
by Justice officials.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry will focus on White House efforts to retrieve
correspondence that should have been stored and allegations that
White House officials threatened contract employees with
retaliation if they revealed the problem. The probe will be handled
by the Justice Department's campaign finance task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task force has begun an investigation into whether
subpoenas issued to (the White House) were fully complied with and
whether persons were threatened with retaliation in order to
prevent the existence of the affected e-mails from becoming known
to the task force,'' said a federal court affidavit by Robert J.
Conrad Jr., chief of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   The missing e-mails, which were sent between 1996 and 1999, were
sought in connection with a number of investigations of President
Clinton, including the scandal involving Monica Lewinsky, the
former White House intern with whom Clinton admitted having a
sexual relationship, and the White House's receipt of secret FBI
files.
</P>
<P>
   The president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were cleared
of any criminal wrongdoing in the FBI files case, in which White
House officials obtained hundreds of personnel files from the FBI
early in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic messages also are wanted in connection with the
investigation of whether Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
illegally solicited campaign contributions from government
property, as well as other issues related to their efforts to fund
their 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sheryl L. Hall, chief of White House computer
operations, said White House e-mails from August 1996 to November
1998 had not been turned over.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was first discovered in May 1998 when a computer
consulting company traced a programming error on one of four White
House computer servers back to August 1996. The company found that
one of the four White House Lotus Notes e-mail servers handling
mail for computer users was mislabeled and a search of e-mail under
subpoena was incomplete. The error involved e-mail to and from 464
White House computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who now works at the Treasury Department, said e-mail from
that server was not properly managed over a two-year period _
meaning it was not collected by the mainframe computer during the
subpoena-record search.
</P>
<P>
   Five employees of the consulting company have told lawyers for
the House Government Reform Committee that they were ordered not to
tell anyone _ including their bosses _ about the missing e-mail.
The House committee is investigating possible violations of
campaign finance laws by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at hearing Thursday, Betty Lambuth, a contractor who
was working on the White House e-mail system, told the committee
that after she advised her superiors of the problem, she was told
if she or any of her team mentioned the error to anyone, ``We would
lose our jobs, be arrested and put in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail had been sought under subpoena by a federal grand
jury, the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee and the House Government Reform Committee in
several investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the White House Counsel Beth Nolan blamed ``entirely
unintentional'' computer breakdowns for the problem. In a letter to
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of House Government Reform
Committee, she also said that reconstructing the e-mail from 1996
to 1999 would cost $3 million and take two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said two separate computer failures made it impossible for
document searches to find the e-mail messages. One problem affected
incoming mail to 526 White House users. Incoming mail for 200 other
accounts was affected by the second error, lasting from November
1998 to May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   She said that while researching the issue, a new problem was
discovered that could result in missing e-mails in Gore's office.
The scope of that problem was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The White House automated-records management system was designed
to scan e-mail ``in boxes'' of every user every several minutes and
transfer copies of incoming e-mail messages to a mainframe
computer, where they were stored for production in response to
subpoenas, Freedom of Information requests and other requests.

 &HT;    Sweeping `Beauty' likely to give Spacey second award
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It makes simple sense that 1999's onslaught of
the most bracing films since the '70s, Hollywood's last golden age,
has beget an Oscar race whose unwieldly mix of the offbeat and
squarely conservative is flummoxing the industry and bedeviling
odds-makers. Shoo-ins seemed to evaporate with the release of each
new and unusual film last year.
</P>
<P>
   Since its fall arrival, ``American Beauty'' has rightly been
polishing the champagne glasses for a victor's party. Until
December rolled around and ``The Cider House Rules'' and the
attendant Miramax hype-cyclone came crashing in, tearing down
streamers and flipping off the music. With a smirk to last year's
Oscar upset _ underdog ``Shakespeare in Love'' blindsiding
Dreamworks' ``Saving Private Ryan'' _ Miramax is rabidly
campaigning to steamroll Dreamworks again, by crushing ``Beauty''
with a big ``House.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Shakespeare'' shocker may have elated this critic, but I
don't want to see a repeat. ``Cider House'' is excellent;
``American Beauty'' is better. It should win. It will win. Watch it
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my take on who/what will _ and who/what should _ win in
an extraordinary year when ``Being John Malkovich'' is challenging
a dowdy costume drama (``Topsy-Turvy'') and a bilious dark-comedy
about a pot-puffing suburban Everyman (``American Beauty'') will
conquer a Tom Hanks weeper (``The Green Mile'').
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN BEAUTY'' (DREAMWORKS)
</P>
<P>
   The story: Suburban ennui _ the white man's burden _ blossoms
with acidic comic immediacy, as one guy's midlife crisis explodes
into corrosive self-emancipation that takes a wrecking ball to his
adrift family unit. Watching the walls crumble is perverse release.
A bittersweet bouquet that rarely wilts.
</P>
<P>
   Awards: Golden Globe (drama), National Board of Review.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations: 8
</P>
<P>
   Box office: $103 million
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 3-2
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CIDER HOUSE RULES'' (MIRAMAX)
</P>
<P>
   The story: John Irving's masterful adaptation of his novel
preserves the wondrous Irvingian sweep in a coming-of-age fable
that enfolds birth, life, love, death, loss and redemption with
affecting power. Epic elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Awards: None.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations: 7
</P>
<P>
   Box office: $45.8 million
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 4-1
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GREEN MILE'' (WARNER BROS.)
</P>
<P>
   The story: A monumental chunk of cloying Hollywood melodrama,
based on Stephen King's serial novel, shows how some sweet Death
Row guards are ennobled by a giant black inmate's supernatural CPR
on the sick and dying. It makes them better men, and makes chumps
of us all.
</P>
<P>
   Awards: None.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations: 4
</P>
<P>
   Box office: $134.4 million
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 10-1
</P>
<P>
   ``THE INSIDER'' (BUENA VISTA)
</P>
<P>
   The story: A fired Big Tobacco employee blows the whistle on his
ex-bosses. ``60 Minutes'' smells a cover-up, and its crusade
unleashes a maelstrom of moral crises, both personal and
journalistic. The resounding message: Big Tobacco is an evil
empire, but sometimes journalists can be ninnies, too.
</P>
<P>
   Awards: L.A. Film Critics.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations: 7
</P>
<P>
   Box office: $28.3 million
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 15-1
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTH SENSE'' (BUENA VISTA)
</P>
<P>
   The story: A precocious boy is tormented by grisly visions of
the dead. While Bruce Willis' psychiatrist helps relieve the boy of
phantoms, he finds he has a shocking issue of his own that needs
tending.
</P>
<P>
   Awards: None.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations: 6
</P>
<P>
   Box office: $288.5 million
</P>
<P>
   Odds: 8-1
</P>
<P>
   GARCIA'S RATING:
</P>
<P>
   What will win: ``American Beauty.'' Its shelf is already
drooping with trophies, everyone's seen it, it has the most
nominations and it carries the fewest equivocations about its
standing. But don't write-off ``Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   What should win: ``American Beauty.'' Crafted with hypnotic
precision and devilish elegance, it's the most roundly entertaining
and emotionally piercing film of the bunch.
</P>
<P>
   BEST DIRECTOR
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Lasse Hallstrom, ``The Cider House Rules''; Spike
Jonze, ``Being John Malkovich''; Michael Mann, ``The Insider''; Sam
Mendes, ``American Beauty''; M. Night Shyamalan, ``The Sixth
Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Sam Mendes.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Sam Mendes. Not tethered to Hollywood
conventions, the Broadway hit-maker (``Cabaret,'' ``The Blue
Room'') imbues his film debut with a silky, dreamy sheen that
poetically articulates Kevin Spacey's drifting between reality and
the id, life and death. He wrests a spectacular ensemble
performance from his cast.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Russell Crowe, ``The Insider''; Richard Farnsworth,
``The Straight Story''; Sean Penn, ``Sweet and Lowdown''; Kevin
Spacey, ``American Beauty''; Denzel Washington, ``The Hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Kevin Spacey. I wouldn't mind Farnsworth swiping
this one from the whippersnapper; his organic understatement in
``The Straight Story'' revealed a confident master wringing wizened
wonder from thin air. But more people saw the high-profile Spacey,
who, let's face it, was nothing less than exhilarating _ biting,
empathic, cathartic _ as a deadpan dead man.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Annette Bening, ``American Beauty''; Janet McTeer,
``Tumbleweeds''; Julianne Moore, ``The End of the Affair''; Meryl
Streep, ``Music of the Heart''; Hilary Swank ``Boys Don't Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Annette Bening. A Hollywood insider in a film no
one has missed. She could get it to assure that ``Beauty's'' sweep
is pure.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Hilary Swank. And it could happen if the Academy
swallows hard. Swank's Golden Globe-winning turn as a transgender
gal posing as a boy was the most daring, challenging and revelatory
performance of the year. It rattled.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Michael Caine, ``The Cider House Rules''; Tom Cruise,
``Magnolia''; Michael Clarke Duncan, ``The Green Mile''; Jude Law,
``The Talented Mr. Ripley''; Haley Joel Osment, ``The Sixth
Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Haley Joel Osment. Oscar loves that rare commodity
_ a truly talented child actor _ and rewards them eagerly. This
kid's got it. It doesn't hurt he's in the highest-grossing movie of
the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Jude Law. He lent sparkling dynamics to the
flaccid ``Talented Mr. Ripley'' in a performance rippling with
nuance that both charmed and curdled our regard.
</P>
<P>
   BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Toni Collette, ``The Sixth Sense''; Angelina Jolie,
``Girl, Interrupted''; Catherine Keener, ``Being John Malkovich'';
Samantha Morton, ``Sweet and Lowdown''; Chloe Sevigny, ``Boys Don't
Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Angelina Jolie. She got the Golden Globe for her
showy turn as a mental patient. She's a hot young actress riding a
meteor, which Oscar adores. (See recently: Marisa Tomei and Mira
Sorvino.)
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Samantha Morton. As a mute naif, Morton's
glowing sun-face became a flickering screen of emotional
telegraphy. She was a miraculous font of comic poignancy _ Buster
Keaton by way of Harpo Marx, with a dash of Lil-- ian Gish.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: Alan Ball, ``American Beauty''; Charlie Kaufman,
``Being John Malkovich''; Paul Thomas Anderson, ``Magnolia''; M.
Night Shyamalan, ``The Sixth Sense''; Mike Leigh, ``Topsy-Turvy.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: Alan Ball. Fresh, sharp, funny and coiled with
jack-in-the-box jolts, Ball's ``American Beauty'' script is
nevertheless a lazy choice considering the labyrinthine literary
pyrotechnics of ``Magnolia'' and ``Topsy-Turvy'' and the unfiltered
delirium of ``Being John Malkovich,'' which will take the trophy if
``Beauty'' doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Mike Leigh. A plush jungle of language, Leigh's
extravagantly detailed, gorgeously eloquent biographical aria to
Gilbert and Sullivan isn't just fine filmmaking. It traces the epic
contours of great literature, popping to life with time, place and
people, and waltzing to the lilting music of well-bred words.
</P>
<P>
   BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY
</P>
<P>
   Nominees: John Irving, ``The Cider House Rules''; Alexander
Payne and Jim Taylor, ``Election''; Frank Darabont, ``The Green
Mile''; Eric Roth and Michael Mann, ``The Insider''; Anthony
Minghella, ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will win: John Irving. The dark horse ``Cider House Rules''
will take this Oscar as a consolation prize after losing Best
Picture by a whisker.
</P>
<P>
   Who should win: Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor. The blueprint
for the year's zingiest comedy, the ``Election'' script is probably
too bitterly iconoclastic for the Academy's sugar-subsisting
palate. That makes us like it more.

   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ Acting President Vladimir Putin talks
with Ted Koppel of the ABC television program, ``Nightline.''
Filmed during his visit to Nizhny Novgorod, a picturesque city on
the Volga River, Putin's eight-minute interview is one of the few
the Russian leader has given to the Western press. And Putin seemed
to go out of his way to couch his responses in terms that the West
could find reassuring. By Michael R. Gordon.

   POPE-HOLYLAND (Jerusalem) _ Standing alone before a granite slab
symbolizing the graves of unidentified victims of the Holocaust,
Pope John Paul II bowed his head today in a long silence that
filled the cold, dark Hall of Remembrance of Yad Vashem, Israel's

   SCI-FRUITFLY-GENOME (Pittsburgh) _ Opening a new window into the
mysteries of animal design and the nature of life, biologists
described here Thursday how they had decoded almost the entire
genetic rulebook for making the fruit fly, an organism whose study
is deeply interwoven with the progress of modern biology. The
achievement marks a major milestone toward completing the sequence
of the human genome because it seems to validate the high-risk
decoding strategy chosen by Dr. J. Craig Venter of Celera Corp. By

   STUDENTS-DRUGS (Hartford, Conn.) _ Whether it's stimulants like
Ritalin, Aderol and Dexadrine; pain killers like Percocet, Percodan
and Vicodin; anti-depressants like Xanax and Valium; or
anti-psychotic drugs like Thorazine, mixing and matching the legal
drugs overflowing American's medicine cabinets is becoming today's
favored drug experience for many students. One preliminary study
found that one fifth of college students interviewed had taken
Ritalin at least once, and many had improperly used other
prescription drugs. It was a combination of Xanax, Valium,
butalbital and sleeping pills that was lethal for a Trinity College
student here last week. By Paul Zielbauer.

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Campaign
Countdown, a rotating campaign-commentary column written by former
Democratic vice-presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro and by
MSNBC host Laura Ingraham.) By GERALDINE FERRARO  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    What is it with these guys?
 &HT;    No, not Al Gore or George W. Bush. Now that Super Tuesday is but
a memory, and with it has vanished any interest in the primary
race, we have a little time off from them, the calm before the
storm that the conventions will kick off in August.
 &HT;    In short, it's silly season, when third-party candidates get
their 15 minutes of fame and, while the candidates lie low, rebuild
their campaign treasuries and plan their fall strategies, some of
each party's less appealing elements get let out of the attic for a
breath of air.
 &HT;    We Democrats have our share of those, but I'm thinking
specifically about a couple of Republican mainstays, Hollywood
star/National Rifle Association icon Charlton Heston and Republican
National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson.
 &HT;    What, to repeat myself, is it with these guys?
 &HT;    If I were George W. Bush, huddling with my top advisers in
Austin, Texas, two words would be at the top of my list of
problems: gender gap.
 &HT;    Since this race began, every national poll has shown women
favoring Gore by large numbers, just as men favor Bush. That's the
gender gap, and you can bet that Gore is devoting some serious
thought to how to improve his standing among men.
 &HT;    As far as I can tell, Bush is doing exactly the opposite _
either he has completely lost control of his own soldiers, or he's
actively trying to alienate what female supporters he does have.
 &HT;    Now, we all know that Heston favors gun rights, and while we may
disagree on the Second Amendment, I'd be the first to say that he
has a First Amendment right to speak his mind.
 &HT;    Still, while in his day Heston may have been a better actor than
Ronald Reagan, he has none of Reagan's ear for political timing.
He's backing Bush, and you'd think that right now he'd be playing
it cool, getting the N.R.A. off the front pages and letting Bush
work on broadening his appeal.
 &HT;    At the very least, you wouldn't expect him to be picking macho
fights on gun-safety locks _ the devices intended specifically to
protect children _ and 72-hour background checks, which are meant
to protect all of us. You wouldn't expect him to be trumpeting his
opposition to training and licensing of gun owners.
 &HT;    It doesn't make sense. At least not to women, who are the ones
who rush to the schools when we hear about the latest horrible
incident. We're the ones who wait nervously for our kids to get
home each day, the ones who, if we live in the inner cities, are
terrified every time our children go out to play that just one
bullet, one little bullet could do something unthinkable.
 &HT;    And, oh yes, we're 53 percent of the population, and we vote.
 &HT;    If Bush wants to convince us that he deserves our votes, having
Heston out ranting that trigger locks and background checks
infringe on a sportsman's right to hunt isn't a smart way to go
about it.
 &HT;    And then there's Jim Nicholson, who chose last week to attack
three members of the advisory board for a bipartisan, nonpolitical
organization known as Women on Line. He lashed out at Rep. Carolyn
Maloney (D.-N.Y.), Rep. Nita Lowey (D.-N.Y.) and yours truly,
denouncing our pro-choice position on abortion and accusing us of
being anti-Catholic.
 &HT;    Actually, to a retired politician like me, it's kind of
flattering to find that Nicholson still considers me a worthwhile
target. Personally, I'd have expected him to aim elsewhere _ for
example, at the several Republican women who also serve on that
board.
 &HT;    Or, more likely, I'd have expected him to keep his mouth shut,
if only in the interest of helping his boy George get elected.
 &HT;    A politician as supposedly canny as Nicholson surely knows that,
according to nearly every poll, a majority of Catholics are
pro-choice _ even Catholic Republicans. He ought to know that
calling women names isn't likely to win other women's support. And,
most of all, he ought to remember that it was a large turnout of
female voters that elected President Bill Clinton in 1992 and again
in 1996.
 &HT;    Which brings me back to George W. Despite what went on in the
1984 campaign, I like the Bush family. I don't like their politics,
but they are very decent people.
 &HT;    So, in that spirit, let me give young George a little political
advice.
 &HT;    First of all, governor, get Charlton Heston down off the
mountain. The men who think of AK47s as camping gear are going to
vote for you anyway, but Heston's level of rhetoric is not only
turning off women, it's also repelling the real sportsmen who make
up the majority of the N.R.A. Remember, the object of a campaign is
to increase your support, not erode it.
 &HT;    Second, muzzle Mr. Nicholson. If you look at the polls, which
I'm sure you do, you've noticed that you're trailing Gore on every
issue that is important to women. It's not only choice and gun
control, it's the environment, it's education, it's health care.
 &HT;    In other words, it's the future of our children. And resorting
to the kind of ideological posturing that makes women wonder
whether you've even really thought about that future is hardly the
way to convince female voters to look for your name on the ballot.
 &HT;    Abigail Adams wasn't a Republican, but she had some good advice
for her husband, the future President John Adams, when she warned
him, ``Remember the ladies.''
 &HT;    If you won't listen to me, governor, listen to her.

 &HT;    POPE SAYS CHURCH 'DEEPLY SADDENED' BY CATHOLIC ACTIONS TOWARD
JEWS
 &HT;    (650&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a flame-lit memorial amid teary Holocaust
survivors from his homeland, Pope John Paul II Thursday declared
that his church was ``deeply saddened'' by historic persecution of
Jews by Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope's speech came midway through the first official papal
trip to Israel. The pilgrimage is meant to highlight the year 2000,
declared a ``Holy Year'' for reconciliation between faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assure the Jewish people that the Catholic Church, motivated
by the Gospel law of truth and love and by no political
considerations, is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of
persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews
by Christians at any time and in any place,'' the Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   For some Jewish leaders, the Pope's comments still fell short of
what they had wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between Jews and Catholics ripples through the
centuries, back to accusations that Jews killed Jesus Christ, the
violence of the Catholic Church's Medieval crusades and the forced
conversions of the Spanish Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish leaders believe the church should outright apologize
for not speaking out strongly enough during the Nazi Holocaust. The
Pope, who has perhaps done more than any modern predecessor to heal
rifts between Jews and Catholics, did not offer such an apology
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But, the intensely emotional ceremony at the Yad Vashem
Holocaust memorial produced images many said were stronger than any
words.
</P>
<P>
   In the dim Hall of Remembrance, the Pope stood in his white
cassock and crucifix medallion. Around him on the sunken black
floor were the names of 20 Nazi death and labor camps. Several of
the camps were in his native Poland, where half the Holocaust's six
million Jewish victims met their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Near him were several Holocaust survivors from Poland, some of
whom knew the Pope in childhood.
</P>
<P>
   At the pontiff's side was Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
whose Polish maternal grandparents were killed by the Nazis.
Barak's voice cracked as he spoke, saying, ``This very moment holds
within it 2,000 years of history and their weight is almost too
much to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old Pope, speaking in a hoarse voice almost
inaudible at times, said he felt a ``need for silence, silence in
which to remember.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he came in ``homage to the millions of Jewish people
who, stripped of everything, especially of their human dignity,
were murdered in the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   A man whose life has tracked the upheavals of the last century _
from Nazism to Communism _ Pope John Paul seemed moved and somber.
He mentioned ``personal friends and neighbors'' killed in the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Then he made his declaration and added, ``I fervently pray that
our sorrow for the tragedy which the Jewish people suffered in the
20th Century will lead to a new relationship between Christians and
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pope, walking slowly and trembling with symptoms typical of
Parkinson's disease, greeted several Polish Holocaust survivors now
living in Israel _ of the more than 150,000 survivors here. He
spoke to them quietly in Polish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shook his hand and I told him who I am and he said he
remembered my father and his bakery,'' said survivor Bella
Ginzburg. ``Physically, he is a very old man, mentally he is
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Kryscher(cq), 80, who lost five siblings and his father in
the Holocaust, knew the Pope in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that I will have to the end of my life. I
was so excited,'' Kryscher said. ``He was so different. He was once
so young and an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he thought of the Pope's speech, Kryscher said
it was ``sufficient. He's already done so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pope has repeatedly condemned anti-Semitism, and earlier
this month asked God to forgive Catholics for sins against Jews and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the survivors wept upon meeting him. Vatican
Spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the Pope was ``moved'' but did
not cry during the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony came after the pontiff had met with the rabbinical
hierarchy in Israel and blessed the state of Israel in a meeting
with Israeli President Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
   He also met with a Jewish leader and a Muslim leader to discuss
religious reconciliation. But the discussion degenerated into
provocative political statements from both sides. The Muslim leader
left the stage after condemning Israel's occupation of Arab areas
of Jerusalem. It was the latest in a series of examples of how the
Pope's pilgrimage cannot be divorced from local politics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Jewish state has laid out its largest security
operation ever for the Roman Catholic leader. But there is scant
knowledge here about Christianity. Those factors combined to create
the bizarre spectacle of the Pope riding in his glassed popemobile
on mostly empty streets, with security ropes holding back no one.
</P>
<P>
   In some spots, he was greeted by local Arab Christians or
foreign pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
   It was his visit to Yad Vashem, shown live on Israeli
television, that caught the nation's attention.
</P>
<P>
   Those who approved of the Pope's speech, which was just 10 short
paragraphs, said it was important for its staunch declaration of
the Holocaust's immensity.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope spoke of ``millions'' of Jewish victims and said of the
Holocaust, ``No one can diminish its scale.'' That was hailed as a
stern rebuke for any so-called ``Holocaust deniers.''
</P>
<P>
   But, others said the Pope should have apologized for the
Catholic Church's actions during the war, especially the apparent
silence of wartime Pope Pius XII.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's statement offered no stronger acknowledgement of
Catholic wrong-doing than the Pope has made in the past _
considering that he has made many.
</P>
<P>
   Popes however, almost never criticize predecessors or the
Church. The Church is considered a perfect ``bride of Christ,'' and
Popes have the ability to rule with ``infallibility'' on certain
matters.
</P>
<P>
   But expectations were high with the first official trip of a
Pope to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was true that he raised himself, and sent an important
educational and morale message,'' said Israeli parliament member
Danny Naveh of the speech. ``But, there was here an additional
opportunity and that was missed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can argue if he should have said or shouldn't have said
that they are sorry for their actions. I'm sorry he didn't say
that,'' said parliament member Tommy Lapid, also a Holocaust
survivor. ``But, these are small details. I would say this was an
important declaration with enormous historical context.''

 &HT;    Turner U.N. grants focus on fighting AIDS in Africa
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ted Turner is taking on the problem that may pose the most
significant threat to economic and social development in Africa _
the terrifying spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations Foundation, the organization set up to
distribute the Atlanta businessman's $1 billion gift to United
Nations projects, announced its sixth round of grants Thursday. The
$17 million in new grants will go to projects ranging from
biodiversity to the empowerment of adolescent girls, but better
than a third of the money _ more than $6 million _ will go to fight
AIDS in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The new awards, made after a meeting last week in New York of
the foundation's board, bring the total distributed since the
foundation was formed in 1998 to more than $237 million. Turner has
set a goal of distributing $1 billion over 10 years, which means
awarding at least $100 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on fighting AIDS in southern Africa comes after the
board met in November in South Africa and Mozambique. The board
went at the invitation of one of its members, Graca Machel, who has
been first lady of both countries.
</P>
<P>
   During a presentation on AIDS in the Mozambican capital, Maputo,
Turner, who is chairman of the board, was alarmed to hear
projections that, by the year 2030, AIDS will kill half of all
Mozambicans who are now 15 years old. And he was appalled to learn
that condoms are not universally available.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, during a visit to a ward for premature
infants at Maputo Central Hospital, Turner's wife, Jane Fonda,
called him over to see a baby with AIDS. The baby weighed perhaps 2
pounds and lived in an incubator.
</P>
<P>
   Turner glanced at the baby, looked stricken and quickly left the
room. The horror remained on his face for some time afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Also present on that trip was Tim Wirth, the former Colorado
senator who is the president of the U.N. Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased to support the secretary-general and the U.N.'s
efforts to alleviate poverty and strengthen global cooperation in
the 21st century,'' Wirth said in announcing the latest round of
grants. ``We are particularly proud of the strong package of
projects aimed at reducing the incidence and impact of HIV/AIDS in
southern Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   The specific grants announced Thursday were:
</P>
<P>
   $2.3 million over three years to the U.N. Children's Fund to
``improve the social and economic situation'' of adolescent girls
in Bangladesh, in part by giving them job training and access to
credit and savings programs.
</P>
<P>
   $1.1 million over three years to the U.N. Population Fund, or
UNFPA, to improve the reproductive health of adolescent girls in
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   $2.5 million over 3 1/2 years to UNFPA to develop in Honduras
``a new model for nongovernmental delivery of quality reproductive
health services,'' and to offer a ``social license'' to
knowledgeable people who can run clinics offering family planning
services, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases and cervical
cancer, and other services to people regardless of age, income,
gender or marital status.
</P>
<P>
   $2.7 million over three years to the Joint U.N. Program on AIDS,
or UNAIDS, to fight the disease in Zambezia province in
north-central Mozambique. The program will offer, among other
services, sexual education, counseling, testing for HIV, help to
build youth leadership to address AIDS, and distribution of
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   $3.5 million over three years and 10 months to UNAIDS to fight
AIDS in Zimbabwe, where about 25 percent of the adult population is
infected. The program will offer peer education programs, try to
increase the commitment of political, religious and private
organizations to fighting AIDS, provide safe alternatives to
prostitution for women supporting themselves and their families,
and develop ways to meet the needs of the growing number of
children orphaned by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   $73,000 over three months to UNAIDS to develop a coordinated
plan of action for reducing the social and economic impact of AIDS
on ``families, communities and productive sectors in southern
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   $600,000 over two years to the U.N. Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization to help the organization identify the most
important places to be nominated for international environmental
protection as World Heritage sites.
</P>
<P>
   $1.5 million over three years to the U.N. Industrial Development
Organization to improve the efficiency of electric motor systems in
China, ``leading to economic and environmental benefits with a
focus on Shanghai and Shandong provinces.''
</P>
<P>
   $500,000 over one year to the U.N. Staff College to enable the
college to provide conflict resolution training for U.N. staff
members in eight field locations.
</P>
<P>
   $1.5 million to the Office of the High Commissioner for Human
Rights to support organization of the World Conference Against
Racism, to be held next year in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   $1 million to the Office for Coordination of Humanitarian
Affairs for emergency relief for flood victims in Mozambique.

 &HT;    Hastert named House chaplain
 &HT;    Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) appointed a Catholic
priest as the House chaplain Thursday in an effort to quell charges
of anti-Catholic bias within the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert unexpectedly interrupted floor debate on the nation's
budget to swear-in the Rev. Daniel Coughlin, vicar for priests in
the Chicago Archdiocese, as the next chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert did so only after delivering a somber speech from
the House floor in defense of his original choice for the chaplain
post--the Rev. Charles Wright, former senior pastor of the North
Avenue Presbyterian Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert said Wright withdrew his appointment Wednesday after
enduring four months of bitter political feuding over his
nomination. He accused Democrats of playing an ``unseemly political
game'' with religion by opposing Wright's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of bigotry were ``carelessly tossed'' at the GOP,
Hastert said. ``Where I come from such slander is an ugly
business,'' he said. Those making the charges, ``don't know me or
are maliciously seeking political advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats and a group of Catholic Republicans have a
different side of the story.
</P>
<P>
   They were upset because Hastert selected Wright over the Rev.
Timothy O'Brien, a Catholic priest and professor at Marquette
University, who had more votes on a bipartisan selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Wright said that his withdrawal was a
positive move. ``I am very positive about it and hopeful,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 22 letter to Hastert, Wright elaborated on his
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these weeks following my appointment, anti-religious
charges of the selection process caused dissension among the
members and wounds between Catholic and other people of faith
across our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the political fight, Wright wrote, ``Let us be
thankful that God is not an independent, not a Democrat and not a
Republican. He is for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The chaplain issue upset the ranks of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio), a long-time friend of Wright's, said he
was disappointed in members of his own party for turning the issue
into a political weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very ugly situation,'' Hall said. ``He got caught
between some Democrats who were trying to take advantage of this
and the Speaker who delayed the nomination for as long as he
could.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Democrats argue that the dispute arose because Hastert
ignored the wishes of a bipartisan selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed after all the work that we put into it to
see our choice ignored,'' said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a member of
the selection committee. ``I think we need to put this chapter
behind us.''

SUSPECT IN CAR WASH SLAYINGS BELIEVED LINKED TO DISAPPEARANCE

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Already accused of killing five co-workers,
Robert Wayne Harris had something else he needed to tell police:
where to find a body.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday morning, acting on Harris' information, police found a
body believed to be that of an Irving woman missing since November.
</P>
<P>
   Family members of Sandra Estes Scott, who disappeared Nov. 29,
said they were told by police that the decomposed body found in
another Dallas suburb is almost certainly hers. Authorities
confirmed on Thursday that it was Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, 28, who is accused of capital murder in connection with
the slayings of five people Monday at a Mi-T-Fine Car Wash in
Irving, had been a suspect in Scott's disappearance since early
December, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's family members and friends said police told them that
Harris gave officers the location of a body but would not claim
responsibility for Scott's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't tell them it was Sandy, he just gave the location,''
said Barbara Bonome, Scott's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Scott's relatives cried and hugged one
another outside Irving police headquarters after officers briefed
them about the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame five other people had to die so I can find out
what happened to my daughter,'' said Scott's father, Charles Estes
of Irving. ``My heart goes out to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is believed to be the last person to see Scott alive. On
Jan. 14, he failed a polygraph test when questioned about her
disappearance, records state. Until the carwash shooting renewed
investigators' interest in the Scott case, police said, they did
not have enough evidence to arrest Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Scott's loved ones stopped short of saying that Irving
police did not push hard enough to determine what happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could have linked him to Sandy's disappearance, he
would have been in jail. These people wouldn't have been killed,''
Bonome said. ``I think the police did what they could. They just
didn't find evidence to arrest him.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Scott's friends, Sharon Summers, was more critical of
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let him go and he killed these other people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Irving police acknowledged that the investigation of Scott's
disappearance started slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors complicated the case, police spokesman David
Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 48 hours passed between Scott's disappearance the
night of Nov. 29 and her family's first call to police about 10
p.m. Dec. 1, according to police records.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's case probably was not placed on a national missing
persons database until the morning of Dec. 2 because of a shift
change at the Police Department, Tull said. At that time, the case
would have been assigned to a detective in the youth investigations
division, which investigates all missing persons reports, Tull
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, the possibility surfaced that this woman left on
her own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A week into the investigation, Harris was interviewed by police.
He told them that Scott, 37, came to his apartment Nov. 29 to sell
a bag of marijuana, according to a police affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Police learned that about 9:45 p.m. Nov. 29, Scott placed a call
from Harris' apartment to a friend, Christina West, the affidavit
states. The Caller ID on West's telephone displayed Harris' number.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's abandoned pickup was found nearly five hours later, and
the gap between the phone call and the discovery of the pickup made
it difficult to connect Harris to any foul play, Tull said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got several hours when she may have seen someone else,''
he said. ``In that time frame, she could have seen other people.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, police searched Harris' apartment but found nothing
connecting him to Scott, according to the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got off to a sluggish start,'' Tull said. ``If we erred in
some way, it may have been that we didn't start interviewing right
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish we could do more, too,'' he said. ``We work with what
we've got. We're getting better, but even with technology and
manpower, this one did not work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott was divorced. Her children, Michael Wright, 13, and
Tiffinee Williams, 17, live with relatives in Irving, family
members said.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread that Scott's body may have been found, her
friends and relatives swarmed to the Irving police station and to a
remote area near where the body was found on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Scott's family members, including her father,
stepmother and grandfather, live a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in horror,'' said Jessie Estes, Scott's stepmother.
``She was so close to our home.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives said they had searched that area shortly
after Scott disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought my horse out here and checked this area myself,''
said her ex-husband, Michael Wright, who lives about one mile from
where the body was located. ``Every time I drove down this road I
wondered if Sandy could have been out here somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Family friend Barry Preston, 16, of Irving said, ``We were out
here about a week after Sandy disappeared. We walked along this
road barefoot. I mean, we were all right here searching.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott's son expressed anger at the suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to pay for what he did,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he had been pulled out of class by a
counselor who told him that his father wanted to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling it was about my mom,'' he said. ``It's been
too long. I've been missing her a lot. Every day, I wanted to pick
up the phone and call her.''

RUSSIAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IS UNIQUE, BUT STILL LOST IN THE
CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Marina Shurina, a 25-year-old underemployed lawyer, sat
in a small spare room with white walls and empty shelves, waiting
for voters to call the campaign of Ella Pamfilova, one of the 11
people, and the only woman, running in Russia's presidential
election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Shurina's phone was not exactly ringing off the hook. And with
no signs, posters or bumper stickers anywhere in sight _ not on the
street, not on the grubby stairwell, not on the door, not even
inside Shurina's second-floor office _ the chances of voters just
dropping by, looking for information, offering to lend a hand, were
virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
   But from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day this week, Shurina will
remain at her post at the Pamfilova campaign's only public office
in all of Moscow. On a bad day, she fields questions from about
four voters, usually referred by Russia's Central Election
Commission. On a good day, she will see maybe 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see that kind of flow, I try to spread it out so that
I can spend a good long time with each voter, and not just a few
minutes,'' she said cheerfully as a heavy wet snow splattered the
dusty window behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova, a former government minister, longtime member of
parliament and a rare voice for social justice in Russia, is the
no-frills candidate in a campaign that, in the minds of many
voters, never really was a campaign at all.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment former President Boris Yeltsin handed over power
to his chosen successor, Vladimir V. Putin, on New Year's Eve, most
everybody has assumed that victory will belong to Putin. The only
question is by what margin and when _ on the first vote next
Sunday, or in a second round on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And yet the other candidates have never stopped running, with
the single exception of Yevgeni Savostyanov, a former Kremlin aide
and liberal democrat who this week threw his support to Grigory
Yavlinksy, leader of the Yabloko party, on a late-night political
talk show, minutes before a midnight withdrawal deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Savostyanov's gesture was one of the few moments of drama in an
otherwise monotonous campaign. Just about everything else _ from
the long Russian winter to the early election date that threw all
contenders but Putin off guard _ has conspired to cool popular
participation in Russia's third presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Pamfilova's goal from the start was not to get elected. As
she keeps saying at every stop, she wanted to make the point that a
politician in Russia can be independent and that a woman can run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that in politics there were more women, smart, good
women,'' she said Thursday during a campaign stop at a
flower-arranging show at Moscow's cavernous Theater of the Russian
Army. ``Now, there are few, but tomorrow there should be more,
which is why I stepped forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova, 46, an engineer by training, was one of the most
visible members of Yeltsin's first reform government, serving as
minister of social affairs. But in 1994 she resigned, disgusted
with the government's neglect of Russia's growing number of poor
people and with the corruption that she said discredited Russia's
young liberal reformers.
</P>
<P>
   After her movement, Civic Dignity, failed to seat any candidates
in parliamentary elections in December, she decided to run for
president and to set an example by refusing to accept any private
contributions. Her entire campaign is financed by the 400,000
rubles _ about $14,000 _ allotted each qualifying candidate by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can safely say that her campaign headquarters are wherever
she happens to be,'' said her press aide, Maxim Leskov. According
to early spending reports, hers is the poorest of the campaigns:
Putin's is one of the richest, with reported spending of 9 million
rubles, about $300,000 _ a figure that does not include the
publicity he gets for performing his official duties as acting
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to get rid of corruption in Russia, then we have to
have more independent politicians,'' she said. ``I am not refusing
to spend money because no one has offered me any. People have
offered, but I have refused because I don't want to be indebted to
criminals or oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show that you can start from nothing,'' Pamfilova
said Thursday. ``I am fulfilling a minimum goal.''
</P>
<P>
   With a small budget and the little time allotted to the
truncated election campaign, Pamfilova has pitched most of her
campaign to television, taking advantage of all the free air time
offered by the competing channels. In the last week, she has filled
her days with talk shows, debates, interviews on foreign television
stations, even an appearance on the Russian version of ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire,'' where she astutely asked help from the
audience _ a move that one TV critic said showed both her wise use
of available resources and her ability to win the sympathy of
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, seems to have increased her popularity
ratings, which still hover between 1 and 2 percent. ``These are of
course relative, subject to the usual fluctuations,'' Leskov said.
</P>
<P>
   Being the sole woman has probably helped Pamfilova stand out in
the pack of candidates hovering at the bottom of the polls. She was
the only politician to show up at the flower-arranging exhibition,
where several women came up to her, practically with tears in their
eyes, promising support. The exhibition's director read her a poem
written in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch her, you can feel her lightness as a person,''
said Yelena Allakhverdova, an artist who had toyed with voting for
Putin until she met Pamfilova. ``I can feel things, and I can feel
that what she says is not a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova is determined to hang on to the end. As she posed for
television cameras Thursday, clutching a bunch of daffodils, her
blond hair tied back in a girlish ponytail, she scoffed at the
thought of abandoning her cause and deserting her supporters by
bowing out before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But she also hinted that if the race was to go another round,
she might join the long line of politicians who have jumped on the
Putin bandwagon. ``As someone who has long been in opposition to
the Kremlin, I was skeptical at first,'' she said, ``but now I have
hopes that he will be independent. I am hoping that a process of
consolidation is taking place.''

   JERUSALEM _ Standing alone before a granite slab symbolizing the
graves of unidentified victims of the Holocaust, Pope John Paul II
bowed his head Thursday in a long silence that filled the cold,
dark Hall of Remembrance of Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust
memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this place of memories, the mind and heart and soul feel an
extreme need for silence,'' the pope said later in a speech.
``Silence in which to remember. Silence in which to make some sense
of the memories which come flooding back. Silence because there are
no words strong enough to deplore the terrible tragedy of the
Shoah.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope is on a religious pilgrimage to the Holy Land, but his
visit to Yad Vashem, where he met with Holocaust survivors _
including several Jews from his Polish hometown of Wadowice _ was,
for Israel, the emotional highpoint of his trip. Blending regret
for the moral failures of many Catholics with a reminder of the
Jewish friends and neighbors he lost in the Holocaust, the pope
sought to heal the divisions between Catholics and Jews by
expressing his feelings inside the saddest, starkest memorial in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assure the Jewish people that the Catholic church, motivated
by the Gospel law of truth and love and by no political
considerations, is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of
persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews
by Christians at any time, and in any place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Yad Vashem was broadcast live on Israeli
television. The response of Israelis and Jewish leaders around the
world was mostly positive, though a few expressed disappointment
that the pope had not gone further in acknowledging the failure of
Catholic church leaders to condemn Nazi persecution of Jews during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But the sight of the frail pope speaking with such strong
feeling in the dark hall, where the names of concentration camps
are etched into the black floor, had its own resonance. So did the
symbolism of the moment when the pope, who usually sits in an
armchair while people file before him, shuffled humbly across the
darkened room alone, leaning on his cane, between the words
``Buchenwald'' and ``Auschwitz'' to shake the hands of six
Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your coming here today, to the Tent of Remembrance at Yad
Vashem, is a climax of this historic journey of healing,'' Prime
Minister Ehud Barak, said, his voice rough with emotion. ``Here,
right now, time itself has come to a standstill.This very moment
holds within it 2,000 years of history. And their weight is almost
too much to bear.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who during the ceremony listened to the reading of a
letter from a Polish Jew imploring her gentile friend to protect
her son, has made reconciliation between Catholics and Jews one of
the priorities of his papacy. It has been a long odyssey that began
during his 1979 visit to Auschwitz in his native Poland, and which
he hopes to conclude in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At a special Mass earlier this month, he delivered a sweeping
and unprecedented apology for the historic sins of the church,
including injustices toward the Jews. But in all of his many
statements of regret, the pope has never faulted the behavior of
Pope Pius XII, a figure whose silence during the Nazi era remains a
source of deep division between many Jewish groups and the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Holocaust survivors who attended the Yad Vashem
ceremony said that they too wanted the pope to acknowledge the
failings of his wartime predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very glad he is coming here, but I want him to recognize
the silence of that other pope,'' said Michael Goldmann-Gilead, 75,
who was a teenager in Katowice, Poland, when the war broke out in
1939, spent three years in Auschwitz and escaped in 1945 while
being transferred to another camp. ``I wanted that pope to say that
killing Jews is not allowed. That would have had an impact on
Hitler and his army.''
</P>
<P>
   But after John Paul spoke, Goldmann-Gilead said he was
``content'' with the pope's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope's very gesture of coming here,'' said Eli Zborowski,
one of seven survivors who shook hands with the pope, ``marks a
turning point for Jews and Christians. He will be well written in
the history of the human race, and of the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope is seen by many Israelis as not only the leader of 1
billion Roman Catholics but also as the spokesman for the entire
Christian world.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with President Ezer Weizman, the pope blessed
Israel _ an act seen by many Israelis as final church recognition
of their state. For centuries, until Pope John XXIII, the Catholic
Church taught that the Jews' exile was punishment for the death of
Jesus. Pope Paul VI, the last pope to visit the Holy Land, in 1964,
did not mention Israel by name and refused to address the Israeli
president by his title.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul also met Israel's two chief rabbis, Eliyahu Bakshi
Doron and Israel Meir Lau, at their office in west Jerusalem. The
pope's spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said that the pope and the
rabbis had a ``cordial and frank'' conversation. He said that the
pope had told his hosts that the time had come for Christians to
put an end to any lingering anti-Jewish sentiment, and also for
Jews to put an end to anti-Christian feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism, which had been vivid before the pope's arrival, was
muted after the pope's visit to Yad Vashem. Lau the Ashkenazic
chief rabbi, issued a statement about what he wished the pope had
mentioned. But his decidedly neutral comment made no explicit
expression of disappointment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I waited for statements that would speak about people from the
church who had committed crimes against the Jewish people,'' he
said. ``I also waited for statements that, for the sake of
generations to come, made it clear that the church itself on many
occasions had fed the flames of hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, a former grand rabbi of Ireland who is active
in interfaith relations, had a different view. ``People whose
expectations were too high, and who don't understand the workings
of the Vatican, may be disappointed, but this was a turning
point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's day was marked by other highs and also lows. He began
his morning by holding a private Mass in the Cenacle, the site
where tradition has it that Jesus presided over the Last Supper.
Navarro-Valls said the pope was the first priest to celebrate Mass
in that chapel since 1583, when it fell into the hands of the
Turks. He said the pope was so moved at being there that, after the
Mass ended, he dismissed his aides and entourage and knelt at the
alter and prayed alone there for 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But his hopes for a breakthrough encounter between Christians,
Muslims and Jews were dashed when the evening meeting intended to
promote interfaith discussion turned into an ugly dispute over the
fate of Jerusalem between Lau and Sheik Taysir Tamimi, who is the
newly appointed deputy chief justice of the Palestinian Islamic
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Tamimi participated in the meeting after the mufti of Jerusalem,
Ekrima Sabri, decided to boycott it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all aware of past misunderstandings and conflicts, and
these still weigh heavily upon relationships between Jews,
Christians and Muslims,'' the pope said after the two other
religious leaders delivered sharply antagonistic remarks. ``We must
do all we can to turn awareness of past offenses and sins into a
firm resolve to build a new future in which there will be nothing
but respectful and fruitful cooperation between us.''

&HT;     JUSTICE TO INVESTIGATE MISSING WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has launched a criminal
inquiry into why thousands of subpoenaed White House e-mail
messages were never turned over to a federal grand jury and three
congressional committees, according to court papers filed Thursday
by Justice officials.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry will focus on White House efforts to retrieve
correspondence that should have been stored and allegations that
White House officials threatened contract employees with
retaliation if they revealed the problem. The probe will be handled
by the Justice Department's campaign finance task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task force has begun an investigation into whether
subpoenas issued to (the White House) were fully complied with and
whether persons were threatened with retaliation in order to
prevent the existence of the affected e-mails from becoming known
to the task force,'' said a federal court affidavit by Robert J.
Conrad Jr., chief of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   The missing e-mails, which were sent between 1996 and 1999, were
sought in connection with a number of investigations of President
Clinton, including the scandal involving Monica Lewinsky, the
former White House intern with whom Clinton admitted having a
sexual relationship, and the White House's receipt of secret FBI
files.
</P>
<P>
   The president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were cleared
of any criminal wrongdoing in the FBI files case, in which White
House officials obtained hundreds of personnel files from the FBI
early in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic messages also are wanted in connection with the
investigation of whether Clinton and Vice President Al Gore
illegally solicited campaign contributions from government
property, as well as other issues related to their efforts to fund
their 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Sheryl L. Hall, chief of White House computer
operations, said White House e-mails from August 1996 to November
1998 had not been turned over.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was first discovered in May 1998 when a computer
consulting company traced a programming error on one of four White
House computer servers back to August 1996. The company found that
one of the four White House Lotus Notes e-mail servers handling
mail for computer users was mislabeled and a search of e-mail under
subpoena was incomplete. The error involved e-mail to and from 464
White House computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who now works at the Treasury Department, said e-mail from
that server was not properly managed over a two-year period _
meaning it was not collected by the mainframe computer during the
subpoena-record search.
</P>
<P>
   Five employees of the consulting company have told lawyers for
the House Government Reform Committee that they were ordered not to
tell anyone _ including their bosses _ about the missing e-mail.
The House committee is investigating possible violations of
campaign finance laws by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at hearing Thursday, Betty Lambuth, a contractor who
was working on the White House e-mail system, told the committee
that after she advised her superiors of the problem, she was told
if she or any of her team mentioned the error to anyone, ``We would
lose our jobs, be arrested and put in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail had been sought under subpoena by a federal grand
jury, the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee and the House Government Reform Committee in
several investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the White House Counsel Beth Nolan blamed ``entirely
unintentional'' computer breakdowns for the problem. In a letter to
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of House Government Reform
Committee, she also said that reconstructing the e-mail from 1996
to 1999 would cost $3 million and take two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said two separate computer failures made it impossible for
document searches to find the e-mail messages. One problem affected
incoming mail to 526 White House users. Incoming mail for 200 other
accounts was affected by the second error, lasting from November
1998 to May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   She said that while researching the issue, a new problem was
discovered that could result in missing e-mails in Gore's office.
The scope of that problem was unknown.
</P>
<P>

&HT;     CONGRESS CHALLENGES FIRST LADY'S TRAVEL BUT PLANS NO CHANGES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers said Thursday they have no plans to
overhaul laws governing White House reimbursement for campaign
travel despite election-year criticism of Hillary Rodham Clinton's
modest payments for using Air Force planes in connection with her
campaign for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' comments came amid a special congressional
inquiry ordered by Republicans to examine the first lady's
reimbursement for travel to New York state in her Senate race
against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents and vice presidents are required to reimburse the
Treasury for a share of the costs of political travel aboard
government planes. But the issue has drawn particular attention
this year because Clinton is breaking new ground by seeking
elective office while still the nation's first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee's panel on White House operations, conceded that Congress
has little inclination to overturn the reimbursement scheme that
effectively subsidizes political travel by Republicans and
Democrats when they serve in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are grumbling about the reimbursement formula
affecting White House officials this year just as Democrats
complained about the arrangement when the tables were turned and
Republicans held the White House in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the parties nor congressional leaders want to tamper
with an arrangement that benefits presidents and vice presidents of
both parties.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore are required by law and Federal Election Commission
regulations to reimburse the U.S. Treasury the equivalent of a
commercial first-class air fare for anyone who handles campaign
chores on political trips taken aboard government aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The required reimbursement falls far short of the actual costs
of operating the Air Force planes that the Secret Service
recommends for the first lady and the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made 26 trips to New York state aboard Air Force
aircraft in the last seven months of 1999 at an estimated cost of
$182,471, Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   But her campaign is only required to reimburse the U.S.
government $40,493 for that travel under a reimbursement formula
that has governed White House travel expenses dating back to Jimmy
Carter's presidency in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's obviously a pretty good deal considering the costs,''
Kolbe said. ``But that's the formula. That's the procedure and that
what's been used and I have no problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., the ranking Democrat on the panel,
echoed Kolbe's assessment. ``Everybody knows what the costs are and
everybody knows the reimbursement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John E. Sweeney, R-N.Y., won House approval last year on an
amendment to campaign finance reform legislation that would require
candidates to pay the full costs of flights aboard government
aircraft. But the House-passed measure remains tied up on the
Senate with little prospect for action this year, conceded Carey
Dearnley, Sweeney's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite little chance that the reimbursement formula will be
overhauled this year by the GOP-led Congress, Clinton's travel
aboard Air Force planes proved to be too rich a target for
Republicans to pass by on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney urged Clinton to abide by the spirit of his legislation
and pay the full costs of travel aboard Air Force planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to New Yorkers now, Mrs. Clinton, and pay your share,''
Sweeney said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe said his committee inquiry was warranted because the first
lady-lady-turned candidate is ``wearing a hat that we have never
seen before.'' He questioned tardy White House delivery of
requested documents on Clinton's travel and the slow pace of
charging her campaign for trips aboard Air Force planes.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe challenged the White House contention that Clinton needs
to travel aboard Air Force planes to guarantee her security. The
Secret Service ``prefers and recommends'' that the first lady use
Air Force planes, but ``it is by no means a requirement'' as
underscored by the first lady's travel aboard commercial aircraft
during her nationwide tour to promote her 1996 best selling book,
``It Takes A Village,'' Kolbe said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman, accused Giuliani's
Republican allies in Washington of ``playing politics with the
first lady's security'' by urging her to fly aboard commercial
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to compromise Mrs. Clinton's safety for
political purposes,'' Wolfson said, adding that the Clinton
campaign ``pays the same travel rate that the Bushes and Reagans
paid when they flew.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe relied solely upon documents provided by the White House
to compile his committee's list of the 26 flights to New York
aboard Air Force planes that Clinton took between June 9 and Dec.
14, 1999, at a bottom line cost to taxpayers of $141,978, after the
Clinton campaign's reimbursement.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson continued to press the
Republican National Committee's contention that Clinton had taken
72 trips aboard Air Force planes over the 13 month period ending
Jan. 31 at an estimated cost of $905,406. Nicholson aides attended
the hearing _ over the objections of Kolbe's staff _ to pass out a
flight-by-flight profile of Clinton's travel.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe denied that his committee was in cahoots with either the
RNC or the Giuliani campaign, saying that neither he nor his staff
had talked with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton's travel may be fodder for the Republicans and
Democrats to issue rival press releases, Kolbe said, ``the fact of
the matter is that this is a subject of legitimate investigation or
information gathering _ this is not an investigation.''

&HT;     '94 KILLING CASTS SHADOW OVER MEXICAN ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Six years after the murder of presidential
candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, many Mexicans believe the
government has not done enough to resolve the crime that is likened
here to the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Colosio's death is still shrouded in mystery and suspicion
despite a costly investigation.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Thursday by the Mexico City newspaper Reforma
showed that 68 percent of those interviewed think the
administration of President Ernesto Zedillo, who vowed to get to
the bottom of the killing, has done little or nothing to solve the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Another survey in the newspaper El Universal said 90 percent of
the respondents believe the murder was a plot, rather than the work
of the lone gunman charged with killing him. And 80 percent say
there is no government interest in clarifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Colosio, a popular candidate of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym as the PRI, was
killed in the poor, dusty Tijuana neighborhood of Lomas Taurinas in
Baja California during a crowded campaign rally on March 23, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Aburto, a day laborer, was charged with the killing.
Aburto has only admitted to shooting Colosio in the head, but
denied firing a second shot to the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   He has never said why he shot Colosio, who was a virtual shoo-in
for president, or given interviews. Many Mexicans do not believe
Aburto was the gunman.
</P>
<P>
   In a report a year ago, special prosecutor Luis Raul Gonzalez
said there was no evidence anyone other than Aburto was involved in
the crime. He said his office had investigated 20 different
theories and could not substantiate any.
</P>
<P>
   His report created a furor from opposition lawmakers, who said
the conclusions and various investigations were confusing and
erratic.
</P>
<P>
   The Colosio investigation remains open.
</P>
<P>
   As with President Kennedy, conspiracy theories and accusations
abound with little or no proof, much less official backing.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexicans, no person is more cloaked in suspicion than former
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the free-market reformer who
left Mexico during an economic crisis for self-imposed exile after
his term ended in 1994. Colosio was the PRI nominee to succeed
Salinas, but Zedillo became the nominee after Colosio was killed.
</P>
<P>
   In El Universal's poll, nearly 93 percent of respondents said
they believe Salinas, who has never been charged with any
wrongdoing and has denied any part in the case, played a role in
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   A special Senate commission overseeing the probe has demanded
that Salinas be questioned.
</P>
<P>
   As Zedillo nears the end of six-year term and the nation embarks
on a new presidential election on July 2, many candidates shroud
themselves in Colosio's name, promising to live up to his ideals of
a better and more just Mexico. They also promise to resolve the
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, the new PRI presidential candidate,
traveled Thursday to Magdalena de Kino, Colosio's birthplace in
Sonora, to visit Colosio's mausoleum and attend a Mass. Labastida,
57, has said he represents the ideals set forth by Colosio.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the anniversary of his death, residents of
Magdalena de Kino shut off their lights for two hours and lighted
candles in their windows to protest the lack of government clarity
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of Colosio's death also casts pallor on Mexican
politics and follows the candidates in 2000. Most of them now
travel with scores of bodyguards and in bulletproof cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years after the homicide, the case is reduced to a
campaign act in search of votes,'' Reforma said Thursday in an
editorial.

`AIDA' GETS DISNEYFIED ON BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN WINN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Every story is a love story,'' the opening number
of ``Aida'' declares. Unfortunately, in the glossy, cold Disney
musical that opened Thursday night at Broadway's Palace Theatre,
very little makes this amorous tale special or gripping.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney nameplate per se isn't stamped on ``Aida,'' a pop
retelling of the 1871 Verdi love-triangle opera set in ancient
Egypt, as it is on the stage versions of ``The Lion King'' and
``Beauty and the Beast.'' This show is the first venture of
Hyperion Theatricals, the company's new adult theater division. But
a Disney ethos permeates the show, from the intensely saturated
colors of Bob Crowley's sets and costumes and Natasha Katz's
lighting to the blunt simplicities of the collaboratively written
book and Tim Rice's banal lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Bathed in Elton John's loud but often listless pop songs,
``Aida'' is a cartoon love tragedy with heaving breasts, silvery
moonlight and interfering parents. The characters in ``Beauty and
the Beast,'' with the possible exception of the dancing spoons and
plates, are drawn with more dimension, wit and emotional depth than
those in ``Aida.'' Eye-catching as it is at times, Robert Falls'
staging supplies almost none of ``The Lion King's'' theatrical
charge.
</P>
<P>
   That the whole enterprise doesn't sink like a Nile barge is
largely due to Heather Headley, who gives an arresting performance
in the title role. From the moment the Nubian princess is captured
as a slave by the Egyptian warrior Radames (``Rent'' alumnus Adam
Pascal), Headley commands the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Seizing a sword and threatening to kill one of her Egyptian
captors unless her fellow Nubians are released, this Aida has a
fiery temperament balanced by a regal calling. Headley deploys a
penetrating gaze, grandly sinuous physical presence and a voice
that climbs to fearless, exposed heights.
</P>
<P>
   She also gets the sharpest lines in a leaden book (by Linda
Woolverton, director Falls and ``Golden Child'' playwright David
Henry Hwang). It's no wonder Radames falls for Aida. She's the only
character in sight, himself included, with any substance.
</P>
<P>
   The show opens in a modern-day gallery of Egyptian artifacts.
Stepping from a glass case, Amneris (Sherie Rene Scott) sings of
love and human failing in the grave opening number. The mobile
geometries of Crowley's stylized design transport the action back
to Egypt. Colored panels rotate and shuttle. Giant amulets,
abstract checkerboards and palm trees twinned by watery reflections
supply picture-book backing.
</P>
<P>
   The story unfolds in a plodding, deliberate way. Aida gets
captured, charming Radames with her feisty spirit, and turned over
to Amneris as a gift. Bored by Amneris, who's portrayed as a
shallow clotheshorse in the unfunny haute couture parody ``My
Strongest Suit,'' Radames is soon sneaking off to meet Aida and
hatch some wild travel plans with her.
</P>
<P>
   But duty calls. Radames' ambitious father Zoser (John Hickok) is
determined to have his son marry royalty. Aida, meanwhile, has
become the leader of the Nubian liberation movement, climaxed in an
exciting if baldly calculated gospel number that closes the first
act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida's'' operatic pedigree seems to have imposed a deadly high
seriousness on the librettists. The characters declaim their
feelings and motivations in wooden dialogue. Rice, the author of
supple lyrics dating back to ``Evita,'' is powerless to lift the
tide here.
</P>
<P>
   The music has a somewhat more varied texture. Between its
fervent pop-rock ballads and choruses, John achieves a certain
eloquent lyricism in the seductive love duet ``Enchantment Passing
Through'' and surging ensemble ``Not Me.'' But the score lacks
heart and personality. A song like the reprised ``Elaborate Lives''
rallies the listener while it's happening without lodging in the
memory.
</P>
<P>
   The voltage does switch on from time to time. Choreographer
Wayne Cilento (``The Who's Tommy'') gives Zoser's black-robed
ministers a pair of muscular dance numbers in a lean, techno-Fosse
style. The image of Radames and Aida entombed together at the end
is drawn with simple intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But Falls, who directed a brilliant ``Death of a Salesman'' on
Broadway last season, seems locked in the same front-and-center
delivery that mummifies the characters, book and songs. The single
pyramid in the production is a neon triangle, mounted like a road
sign over the principals' trio that opens the second act. OK, we
get it. ``Aida'' is a love triangle.
</P>
<P>
   Musicals, like pyramids, need a third dimension to stand up.
This one hasn't got it.

   The opening piece of advice from my supervisor was this: ``I
recommend that you don't use your real name.'' Next he gave us
packets of alcohol swabs to disinfect our equipment. ``It's so
unsanitary,'' he shuddered. Then he cautioned us: ``You will deal
with some of the nicest people in the world. You will also talk to
people for whom the darkest corner of hell isn't dark enough.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first night at my new job. I had just been hired to
do telephone surveys for a company I'll call Annoy America. I would
be making the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now negotiating a $1 raise to the $5.15-an-hour
minimum wage. Time magazine recently scoffed that such a move is
essentially symbolic since ``almost no one is working for minimum
wage these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not, we're all billionaires! Except for the 10 million
or so people who forgot to get their Time Warner stock package and
now work for $6.15 an hour or less. These aren't just teen-agers
flipping burgers so they can buy navel rings. According to the
Economic Policy Institute, 70 percent of these people are over 20
years old, and almost half work full-time.
</P>
<P>
   When I called the number listed in The Washington Post
employment ad (``Telephone Interviewers''), I was given an address
and told to show up at the office the following Thursday evening
for a group interview. The office was long and narrow, filled with
rows of cubicles, about 30 of them.
</P>
<P>
   In each sat a person wearing a headset hunched over a computer.
There was a murmuring of random, canned phrases: ``Would you say
that makes you more likely or less likely?'' ``Do you feel
extremely confident, very confident, somewhat confident?'' ``Do you
own a gun?'' ``Do you agree or disagree that creationism should be
taught in the schools?''
</P>
<P>
   I was directed to a room where there were about a dozen of us,
mostly young black people, professionally dressed as if they were
arriving from another job. We filled out standard applications
(education, work experience, references). To a question about the
references, the interviewer said, ``Don't worry. I don't think
we've ever called anyone's references.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer told us we would call all over the country doing
surveys on everything from the presidential race to what kind of
paper towels people used. She warned us about two kinds of people:
those who were ``rude, rude, rude'' (at Annoy America there was a
sort of corporate amnesia over the fact that most people consider
strangers who call them at home to be rude, rude, rude), and old
people who wouldn't let us off the phone.
</P>
<P>
   She handed out stapled employee manuals and then told us that
the work hours were evenings from 5:45 p.m. until 11 -- at 9:45 we
would start calling the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   We had to work at least one weekend shift, and the minimum
number of hours per week was 16. We would be paid $6.15 an hour
(the District of Columbia's minimum wage is $1 above federal
requirements). But if we made a graveyard shift -- a weekend
evening -- part of our permanent schedule, we would make an
additional 25 cents an hour. ``It's an incentive,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   We would get a 15-minute dinner break, but we were asked not to
leave the building except to smoke. One man, about 30, said he had
a day job and he couldn't work until 11. ``Oh come on, a big macho
guy like you,'' said our interviewer. The man put down his manual
and left.
</P>
<P>
   To screen applicants, the boss had us read aloud in turn from
the manual. ``You are about to embark on one of the most
interesting and important types of work in the world today: survey
research.'' ``Rapport is a French word that has no real English
equivalent.'' ``The respondent will lose track of time and enjoy
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   If I had brought a baked potato with me, it would have gotten
the job, too, because when we finished reading, we were all asked
how soon we could start. One young woman said she didn't want to
work the following Monday because she and her fiance had a special
evening planned. She was taking this job, she explained, to pay for
their wedding. One word immediately sprang to mind: Elope.
</P>
<P>
   I started two nights later. Instead of punching a time clock, we
checked in for work and out for breaks at a main computer. Then I
was told to go into a conference room with about 16 other employees
to be briefed on our assignment for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The group was equally divided by sex, race, and age. The people
under 25 were almost all black, many carrying college textbooks.
The people over 50 were almost all white. Actually they were gray,
from their hair to their pallor to their clothes. While we waited
for a supervisor, the atmosphere in the room was that of an
oversize elevator: No one made eye contact, no one spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Our assignment was to survey registered voters about a Southern
mayoral race. The poll consisted of 18 questions, everything from
who they planned to vote for for president to ``How safe do you
feel walking in your neighborhood at night? a) very safe; b)
somewhat safe; c) somewhat unsafe; d) very unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the supervisor, X, took us to our cubicles, told us to use
fake names -- I decided to call myself Natalie Lerner -- and
recommended we clean our headsets. X was one of three supervisors
on duty for 30 employees. I wished my local public school had a
similar ratio.
</P>
<P>
   I started calling. A computer-generated stream of phone numbers
appeared on my screen. When someone actually answered the phone, I
hit another key, and my script appeared. Just a few nights working
the phone makes you realize America's evenings move to a precise
rhythm:
</P>
<P>
   5:45 to 6:30: Answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   6:30 to 7:15: Kids screaming
</P>
<P>
   7:15 to 8:30: ``We're in the middle of dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   8:30 to 9:45: Answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I got half a sentence into my spiel, about 25 percent
of the people simply hung up on me. Amazingly, an equal number said
this wasn't a good time but agreed I could call back. One woman
said, ``Natalie, I can't talk now because ...'' I didn't hear her
reason because I was too busy wondering, ``Who the hell is
Natalie?''
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel a little like I was playing the slots in
Atlantic City: I had entered a timeless zone where I engaged in a
repetitive task hoping for a big score.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a hit.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman didn't hang up when I kept talking. I ran into
trouble on one of the first questions, however. She claimed to be a
registered voter but was not a Democrat or Republican and wasn't
sure what an independent was. I was about to hit ``Don't Know''
when supervisor Y -- who had been listening in -- came running over
to my cubicle and whispered furiously that I had to pin her down.
However, all I could do was repeat the question on the screen in
front of me because I was expressly forbidden to deviate from the
script. The woman finally agreed she was an independent.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors were constantly active. We could see by the
lights on our phone consoles that they were listening in, and at
any slip, they were by our side. When my neighbor said to someone
who didn't immediately hang up on her, ``Would you like to
participate in the survey?'' supervisor X came running over.
``Never, never ask them if they want to continue. They'll say,
'no.' It's like throwing raw meat to wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   My next night at work was the final session for the mayoral
race. Although the first night we had been instructed to try to get
men to answer the survey (``It's harder to get males, women are
used to connecting more,'' explained Y), tonight we needed only
women. My request to talk to the youngest woman in the house --
people who agree to be interviewed tend to be old -- yielded
responses from the rueful to the outraged. One man said, ``There's
no female in this house. I wish there was.'' Another replied,
``I've got a 44-year-old, a 45-year-old, and a 69-year-old. None of
them are here. I'm microwaving my own dinner!''
</P>
<P>
   Around 8, I went to the conference room for my 15-minute break.
I sat down next to a plump 50-ish woman who had her dinner laid out
on the table: six varieties of candy bars. She told me that she had
been moonlighting at Annoy for two years. She had a full-time day
job with a local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked two jobs my whole life,'' she said. ``I only sleep
three and a half hours a night.''
</P>
<P>
   I let my dinner break run to 19 minutes and when I returned to
the computer to punch in, it admonished me, ``You're late! Please
be on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the two nights, I dialed 210 phone numbers
and completed five interviews. When I left work, one of the
questions on the survey seemed apt. I realized I felt, ``c)
somewhat unsafe'' walking home at night. I hailed a cab. The ride
took about three minutes and cost $4, in other words, 40 minutes of
dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Night 3 I was assigned to the dreaded, ``Will You Be Prepared
When You Retire'' survey -- a look at how people earning more than
$150,000 are saving for their retirement. The inherent problem in
the survey was that it required persuading people making more than
$150,000 to answer a 30-question survey on their financial dealings
from a stranger making minimum wage. And recently, said Y, shaking
her head, the company paying for the survey decided they wanted 900
completed interviews instead of 600.
</P>
<P>
   I swabbed my headset with alcohol and started dialing. Very few
people listened to the end of my introduction, ``Hello, I'm Natalie
Lerner from ... doing a short survey on a vital topic ... will you
be prepared ... absolutely confidential ... interviewing
influential people.''
</P>
<P>
   In my first hour of calls, only one person even let me finish.
When I did, she said, ``I'm not influential'' and hung up.
Amazingly, at 6:45 I got a business owner and at 7:10 a sales
manager willing to do the almost 20-minute survey. Afterward, two
supervisors called me in.
</P>
<P>
   Overall I got an ``A,'' but they went over a number of mistakes
I made, such as hitting the key for ``extremely concerned'' when my
sales manager was only ``very concerned'' about making the right
investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to the phones. It took two more hours before I
convinced someone to do another interview. While I dialed, a woman
from the cleaning crew began vacuuming the hall, making me feel
grateful that I only had to sit in the little cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:45, when we start calling the West Coast, the older woman
one seat down said she was worried about what time we would get
out. Her trip required a subway and a bus transfer. Last night she
just missed the bus and so had to wait 40 minutes for the next one,
getting home around 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The college student next to me, who used the names of his
football teammates as a revolving pseudonym, finally completed an
interview. Before he hung up, he said, ``Thank you, thank you,
you're my only one for the whole night.'' Then at 10:46, the
supervisors walked up and down the rows telling us we could go
home.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got to the main computer to check out at 10:48,
the office was deserted. I decided that was my last night. I had
worked for 13.6 hours, dialed 370 phone numbers, and completed 13
interviews. My take-home pay was $77.24.
</P>
<P>
   When I got out to the street, there was an older woman from the
office, who walked with a heavy limp, already hailing a cab. When
she got in, I hoped her trip was a short one.

 (RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO MAY HAVE MISSED
 IT; ALSO MOVING IN THE ``E'' CATEGORY) 
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Muller's quick looks at some current magazine issues and a
popular website:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``CONSUMER REPORTS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen, start your engines! It's time for this
magazine's most-stolen issue _ rating the cars. This one is kept
locked in the public library's hermetically sealed bunker, only to
be checked out with three forms of ID, a blood sample and a
security deposit including, but not limited to, your first born. Of
course, this issue is well worth the trouble, rating every vehicle
from the Audi TT (isn't that cute?) to the Volvo S80 (less boxier
than ever!). Arizona drivers, of course, will skip straight to the
Sports Utility Vehicle section (we counted 45 SUV models alone),
even if the most rugged terrain they ever traverse is the ABCO
parking lot. The magazine goes high-tech this time around, rating
the car Web sites, from CarsDirect (www.carsdirect.com), which
allows you to ``build your own car'' (actually, just add extras),
to Kelley Blue Book (www.kbb.com), which pegs resale prices for
used cars. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``DISCOVER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely Science Lite, but the April issue includes a
couple of interesting pieces. The cover story details the discovery
of ancient Roman ships near the Leaning Tower of Pisa, in the
Tuscany region of Italy. Researchers have found the remnants of at
least 17 ships dating from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 500 and yielding
a number of artifacts, including incense burners, oil lamps, fish
hooks, sewing needles and numerous amphorae _ large earthen jars
used to transport goods around the Mediterranean. There's also an
interesting story on the world's ``deadliest carnivore'' a
half-mongoose, half-cloud leopard called a fossa, which lives in
Madagascar and apparently spends much of its food budget on Lemur
Helper. Our intrepid explorers actually manage to catch one of
these slick dudes, and then pass the tranquilized cat around for
polaroids. Way to be ecosensitive, dude.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ``GOLF'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is a strong message emanating from this magazine, and that
message is: ``We want to sell you some really expensive golf
clubs!'' Or a luxury car. Or both. Still, this issue includes some
interesting features, including an 18-hole ``course'' on everything
from repairing divots to teaching your kids to play. Of course,
like most articles in the magazine, some of these helpful hints
double as ads _ many of the ``solutions'' involve buying cool stuff
or going to a ritzy resort. If you really want to ruin your swing,
consult some of the technical-sounding instructions in the back,
with lines like ``the upper spine is farther from the target than
the lower spine.'' Uh huh. And the ball is rolling through the
desert. There is also a fun feature that names the nation's 10 best
public courses. Arizona made the list, with Apache Stronghold in
San Carlos. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ``THE NEW YORKER'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Includes one of those great articles that keep you coming back
for more _ a feature story on the top writer for ``The Simpsons,''
a former ``Harvard Lampoon'' staffer named George Meyer. It is
Meyer who writes many of the lines that are quoted from the wildly
successful series. Even his fellow writers stand pretty much in awe
of him. ``I would rather make George Meyer laugh than win an
Emmy,'' a colleague notes. Meyer, who traces his comedic roots back
to ``Mad'' magazine, culled his craft working for David Letterman
and Lorne Michaels. Writer David Owen does a nice job drawing Meyer
out, getting him to describe a less-than-idyllic childhood filled
with way too much television. There is also a well-done piece by
political correspondent Joe Klein which notes that John McCain
spent much more time adopting a posture of indignance than actually
explaining his positions. He says McCain plowed his jet into the
George W. Bush aircraft carrier, crippling both campaigns. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WEBSITE REVIEW: www.yesterland.com  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are things that just work better on the Web.
Yesterland is one of them. With an astounding commitment to detail,
the site chronicles Disneyland attractions that have closed over
the years, complete with pictures and narrative histories.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about nostalgia. All those rides that you remember from
childhood are here: the campy Submarine Voyage (``helmsman, steer
clear of the teetering columns!''), the Old Matterhorn (pre-1978)
and the Skyway to Tomorrowland/Fantasyland
</P>
<P>
   (those old buckets that hang on the wire, closed in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   There is a piece on the old PeopleMover (presented by Goodyear,
closed in 1995), which pushed guests around with motors installed
in the track, taking them through Tomorrowland's indoor attractions
and above its outdoor attractions. And don't forget Rocket to the
Moon, a ``D'' ticket that later became Mission to Mars, until it
closed in 1992. Today, it's a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   How deep does this site go? It even includes a long feature on
the old parking lot, which has been closed to make way for a new
slate of rides and other attractions. The article notes that those
who arrived early could park in the ``convenient Bambi section,''
but those who came late ``could be way back in Thumper or Winnie
the Pooh.'' &QL;

WEISKIRCHEN JOURNAL: AT $4 A GALLON, THE ROAD NOT TAKEN MAKES A
DIFFERENCE

 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEISKIRCHEN, Germany _ When Uwe Olzem finished filling up the
tank of his Nissan coupe, he could only envy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with paying about $3.65 a gallon for regular unleaded _
about double the price in the United States _ Olzem said he is
paying about $50 a week just to commute to his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame Americans for being upset at the higher
prices,'' said Olzem, a soldier in the German army. ``But they have
a very good deal.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries prepares to
consider raising oil production quotas next Monday in at a meeting
in Vienna, Americans are fretting over the prospect of $2 a gallon
gasoline and fill ups at the pump costing $50 or more for some big
sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Europe, where prices have approached $4 a gallon for
years, most drivers only wish they had it has bad as the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be wonderful,'' sighed Carica De Hoere, a teacher
from Harelbeke, Belgium, as she stopped here with a small group of
friends en route from a ski holiday in Austria. ``But of course, it
couldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices have jumped at least 20 percent in many European
countries compared to more than 50 percent over the past year in
the United States. But there have been few if any diatribes against
OPEC, nor grousing about the lack of gratitude for rescuing Kuwait
from Iraq in the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are European officials emulating the U. S. secretary of
energy, Bill Richardson, who has been on a whirlwind tour of oil
producing countries pleading for a sizable increase in production.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Germany, a country of carmakers and car lovers and the
legally-enshrined right to drive the autobahn at speeds of 100 mph
_ few seem worried that their way of life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``OPEC is the least of our problems,'' said Hermann Otto Solms,
who oversees economic policy issues for Germany's Free Democratic
Party, which has pushed for cutting taxes. ``Our problem is that
our own gasoline taxes are too high and are still going up. If OPEC
reduces production, that is merely an additional problem.''
</P>
<P>
   If Americans view the prospect of $2-a-gallon gasoline as a
nightmare, most Europeans would be thrilled to see it so cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all think it would terrible to pay $2 a gallon, but I
just filled up my tank this morning for about $5 a gallon,''
remarked Paul Horsnell, assistant director at the Oxford Institute
for Energy Studies in Oxford, England.
</P>
<P>
   British gasoline prices are even higher than those in
neighboring countries because the value of the British pound has
climbed sharply against most other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline taxes are at the heart of the difference between
American and European gasoline prices and attitudes. If American
drivers are addicted to cheap gasoline, European governments are
addicted to gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes total about three-quarters of the price of a gallon of gas
in most European countries. Beyond paying for road construction
maintenance and public transportation, gas taxes have become a
major source of government funds and are increasingly used to
offset cuts in social security taxes and other levies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the cash cows of the nation,'' complained Olzen, the
German soldier. ``I'm not bothered by what OPEC does. What bothers
me is that the government is taking 75 percent of the money I pay
for gasoline and putting it into its own pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   That has had a number of effects. Because the cost of oil
comprises a smaller portion of the price of a gallon of gasoline,
prices here have climbed far more modestly.
</P>
<P>
   Energy experts and economists argue that Europe's high gasoline
taxes have also reduced its exposure to oil shocks. Though European
oil imports have risen in recent years, both individuals and
companies have invested heavily in ways to reduce energy
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Europeans have consistently been able to get by
with less gasoline than Americans.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Europeans drive less than half as many miles each
year than Americans, according to studies by the International
Energy Agency, a publicly-funded research institute in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The standard explanation is that distances between cities and
even within cities are so much greater in America than in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only part of the story. In a study last year, the
Paris agency reported that the length of the average car trip in
the United States and Europe is virtually the same _ 8.7 miles
versus 8.1 miles _ but the big difference is that Americans made
nearly twice as many such trips.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Americans believe it is their God-given right to have as much
cheap gasoline as they want,'' said Gary N. Ross, chief executive
of PIRA Energy Group, an oil industry consulting firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this addiction, and addiction is a good word,
Americans drive almost 50 percent more than Europe and its cars are
less efficient. It has cost the United States dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Europeans who want to reduce gasoline taxes, like Sohms of
the German Free Democratic Party, admits to being amazed when they
visit the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cities, except perhaps New York, people can't
understand why you would want to walk a short distance rather than
drive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans have long driven cars so small and fuel thrifty that
they would be laughed off the American road by any self-respecting
owner of a sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though Europeans have developed a taste for heavier and
more powerful models, but European models overall get better
mileage than American cars _ averaging about 27 miles per gallon
compared to about 24 _ according to estimates by the IEA.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the gap is widening. According to the German
government, the average fuel efficiency of cars on German roads has
improved to about 27. miles per gallon from about 25.8 since 1992.
By contrast, the fuel efficiency of American cars has not budged.
Since the sport utility craze in the United States began, new car
and light-truck mileage has declined from 25.4 miles per gallon to
23.8 miles in the period from 1992 through last year.The upshot is
that European drivers have become inured to high gasoline prices
and have learned to economize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to high prices,'' said Freek Vlieger, a mechanic
from Woerden, the Netherlands, as he filled up his tank on the way
home from a ski holiday in Austria. ``For us, it's not so much of a
problem, because we don't use the car that much at home.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say people are happy about their lot. In Holland
and several other countries, people angry about gasoline prices are
trying to organize a ``strike'' on April 1, in which drivers will
refuse to drive or buy gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   But if people are angry, they are more angry about gasoline
taxes than the machinations of oil-producing countries. When
Germany's Free Democrats campaigned against the ruling Social
Democratic Party's plan to raise gasoline taxes in January, it
arranged to sell gasoline tax-free for one hour at a station in
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   The result led to mayhem, with thousands of drivers clogging up
the streets around the station in a bid to buy gas at 25 percent of
the normal price.

OSCARS SHOW IS GETTING A FACE-LIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: All times PST. Check local listings for time and 
 channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Streamlined, star-studded and ratings-enriched _ those are the
goals for the Academy Awards program Sunday night on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   First-time Oscars producers Richard D. Zanuck and his wife and
partner, Lili Fini Zanuck, have been brought in to spruce up the
show and stanch last year's ratings decline, when the TV numbers
ebbed to their lowest point since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   This year's program begins at 5:30 p.m., following the network's
half-hour pre-Oscars show.
</P>
<P>
   The Zanucks, themselves past Oscar winners for producing
``Driving Miss Daisy,'' wasted no time paring one piece of blubber
from the show. To the dismay of the dwindling contingent of
Hollywood choreographers, the 72nd Annual Academy Awards are
supposed to be free of any big, time-consuming dance numbers. Exit
Debbie Allen.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame, in a way. They've been choice targets for
post-Oscar cattiness. But the Zanucks are aiming for a 3 1/2-hour
show, more digestible than last year's record four hours and five
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Choreographer Kenny Ortega (``Dirty Dancing'') is part of the
Zanucks' staff, though, and dance is expected to survive not on its
own but as an element of the performances of the best-song
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The uncontested good news is the return of Billy Crystal, set to
host his seventh Oscarcast. Last year Whoopi Goldberg amused
herself with some of the bluest jokes in Oscar history.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Crystal has ready-made material in the recent theft
of 55 Oscar statuettes. The guess here is that Crystal will swing
his driver back and knock that off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   The acting categories this year aren't heavily stocked with
big-name nominees _ Russell Crowe? Janet McTeer? Hilary Swank? _
but there will be no shortage of star power in the presenter ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Older and newer Hollywood, and in between, are in the mix. The
presenters include Clint Eastwood, Cameron Diaz, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Ashley Judd, James Coburn, Cate Blanchett, Mel Gibson,
Heather Graham, Edward Norton, Samuel L. Jackson, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Charlize Theron, Uma Thurman, Drew Barrymore and
Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   Also Roberto Benigni, carrying with him hopes that he'll be as
delightful as a presenter as he was when he won for ``Life Is
Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other scheduled presenters are bound to attract notice. Jane
Fonda, recently separated from Ted Turner, rejoins the fold in
presenting an honorary Oscar to Polish director Andrzej Wajda.
Annette Bening, a best-actress nominee for ``American Beauty,'' is
due as a presenter. And due in another sense, too; she's poppingly
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Movies tend to lack hummable themes these days, but the live
performances of best-song nominees remain an Oscarcast staple.
Randy Newman, Phil Collins and Gloria Estefan somehow seem to be on
hand every year, and Sunday will be no exception.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, though, is to manage the nominee ``Blame Canada,''
from the randy ``South Park'' movie. There hasn't been an official
announcement, but watch for Robin Williams to give it a humorous
shot.
</P>
<P>
   While the Zanucks try to enliven events in the main tent,
producer and director Joel Gallen has been imported from the ``MTV
Movie Awards'' and ``VH1 Fashion Awards'' to salvage the half-hour
pre-Oscar show at 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, ABC and the Motion Picture Academy launched the
pre-Oscar show to grab extra ratings and revenue. The maiden
effort, hosted by Geena Davis, was a dud.
</P>
<P>
   This time, they'll attempt a triple-host arrangement with ABC's
Meredith Vieira (``The View''), actress and model Tyra Banks and
MTV personality Chris Connelly.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be so hard. The idea is to prime the home audience for
the big show and to catch celebrities as they arrive at the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles. Train the lens on the dresses and hope
that when someone says something stupid, it's a star and not one of
your hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Gallen promises, ``The audience will feel so close to the action
and frenzy of the red carpet (that) they may actually experience
rug burns.''
</P>
<P>
   So, wear knee pads and visors. This is no night for amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   But from a distance of 400 miles and two days, we can still
venture a few amateur predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' will edge ``American Beauty'' for best
picture. And in a bigger upset, Michael Caine squeaks past Haley
Joel Osment, Jude Law and Tom Cruise for best supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   I also predict that Warren Beatty will win the Irving G.
Thalberg Award. After all, no one likes to be wrong all the time.

   MARGIN-TRADING-RISKS (Undated) _ Borrowing money to buy stocks
has become immensely popular among individual investors. And who
can blame them? When stock prices are rising, the biggest gains go
to those who buy shares on borrowed money. When stock prices are
falling, however, borrowing to buy stocks is an expensive and
highly risky business. Market regulators are growing concerned that
the recent surge in investor indebtedness, which has been greatest
at online brokerage firms, reflects the participation of many
people who do not understand how dangerous stock market debt can
be. By Gretchen Morgenson.

   Borrowing money to buy stocks has become immensely popular among
individual investors today. And who can blame them? When stock
prices are rising, the biggest gains go to those who buy shares on
borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   When stock prices are falling, however, borrowing to buy stocks
is an expensive and highly risky business. While recent tremors in
some formerly hot market sectors may have awakened some investors
to this unhappy reality, market regulators are growing concerned
that the recent surge in investor indebtedness, which has been
greatest at online brokerage firms, reflects the participation of
many people who do not understand how dangerous stock market debt
can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am troubled by the apparent ease with which real neophytes
are going online these days all by themselves and trading on
margin,'' said Bradley Skolnick, the Indiana securities
commissioner and president of the North American Securities
Administrators Association. ``A lot of people are purchasing rather
speculative, high-risk stocks with borrowed money and that's a
source of concern for me. In a volatile market, trading on margin
can find you in a whole lot of hurt very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lael Desmond, a medical school student in Indiana, learned the
hard way how risky borrowing on margin can be. In late 1997,
Desmond, who was then 26, opened an account at Ameritrade; by June
1998, he had roughly $30,000 in his account. An investing novice,
he began borrowing money to buy shares of Amazon.com, Dell
Computer, Excite, America Online and Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond, who was to begin medical school the following fall, did
not fully understand what investing on margin meant. Yes, when
stocks go up, an investor can double his gains by borrowing from
his broker, paying a relatively modest interest rate for the
opportunity. But if the stock _ which serves as the asset backing
the loan _ declines in value, the customer will be asked to put up
more money to make up for the shortfall. This is known as a margin
call. When an investor chooses not to put up more money, his shares
are sold but he usually still owes money to the broker.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond, according to his lawyer, Jeffrey Gery at Maddox,
Koeller, Hargett &AMP; Caruso in Indianapolis, thought his margin
borrowing was like a mortgage or bank loan. He had no idea that he
could lose money on it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late summer of 1998, stocks took a dive due to to
the Russian debt crisis. On Friday, August 28, stocks began to fall
and continued their descent the following Monday, generating margin
calls of roughly $12,000 to Desmond. By Tuesday, the call had grown
to $21,000, which Desmond did not have. So he took out cash
advances on credit cards in the amount of $13,000 and borrowed
$8,000 from his brother. Nevertheless, by the time the funds were
wired to Ameritrade on the afternoon of September 1, the firm had
already sold Desmond's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   In Desmond's arbitration case, decided last January, he won
$40,453 from Ameritrade. Although the arbitrators did not give the
reason for their award, it is clear they believed Ameritrade sold
Desmond's holdings too quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Gery, one of two lawyers who represented Desmond, said of the
case: ``It's been our impression that a lot of online firms think
they are Web sites first and brokerage firms second. But they are
brokerage firms first and they have a duty to maintain very high
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   It is investors like Desmond, trading through online brokers,
who are most responsible for the big jump in margin debt.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Steven Galbraith, an analyst at the investment firm Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co., estimates that margin debt as a percent of market
value has soared 459 percent at online brokers since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Growth in margin debt for all stocks on the New York Stock
Exchange, by comparison, has gone up 190 percent during the same
period. Meanwhile, the value of the market, as measured by the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 has risen 139 percent during that time.
</P>
<P>
   Some online brokerage firms have recently increased their margin
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hubbard, a spokesman at Charles Schwab, said the firm
required a greater down payment than the 50 percent minimum set by
the Federal Reserve on 270 securities its executives feel are too
volatile or illiquid. Michael Dunn, Datek Online's spokesman, said
his firm had a large number of stocks where it refused to extend
margin, while 227 others required higher down payments.
</P>
<P>
   T.D. Waterhouse requires higher than normal deposits on around
300 stocks and Ameritrade, while not supplying details, said it
required higher initial deposits on some stocks. Officials at
E-Trade did not return a phone call seeking information about their
current margin requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But brokerage firms make big money lending to investors, so it
is perhaps not surprising that many still lend freely. Galbraith
estimates that margin interest paid by investors accounts for 20
percent of a typical Internet brokerage firm's revenues. In a
recent study, he found that even the most volatile high-fliers _
including such stocks as Red Hat, Doubleclick, Broadcom, Inktomi
and Internet Capital Group _ were marginable at one online
brokerage firm or another.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the market's whipsaws become more pronounced,
borrowing to buy stocks becomes positively treacherous. A stock
that falls only 10 percent, for example _ not a big move in today's
wild market _ could trigger a request for more money from an
investor who has borrowed the maximum amount.
</P>
<P>
   If the investor does not have the funds to add to his portfolio,
the shares are sold, possibly weakening an already sickly stock.
This is why excessive investor indebtedness can exacerbate downward
moves in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because falling stocks always seem to bounce back these
days, investors remain unworried.
</P>
<P>
   Margin debt on the New York Stock Exchange has surged 75 percent
in the past 12 months and now exceeds $265 billion, an all-time
high. Debt ballooned almost 9 percent in February alone and now
accounts for more than 1.5 percent of the Big Board's total market
value, also a peak.
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling is how fast margin debt is growing as a
share of overall consumer credit. According to Galbraith's
research, margin loans now account for 16 percent of total consumer
borrowings, up from 7 percent in 1995. Numbers like these prove
that the explosion in margin borrowings is coming from individual
investors, not institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've supplanted buying a washer-drier with debt with buying
Qualcomm on margin,'' Galbraith said. ``If you think of the
volatility of the asset being financed, it is probably more
dramatic than I suspect many of the people deploying leverage think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More investors seem to be discovering that margin trading has
pitfalls. The Securities and Exchange Commission reports that
investor complaints in that area have increased significantly in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Board, which has set the margin requirement
at 50 percent since 1974, recently expressed concern over the
outsized growth in margin debt. Yet in January, when the explosive
growth in margin debt became evident, chairman Alan Greenspan
rejected calls to increase the amount required of investors when
they buy stocks on margin. He argued that an increase in the margin
requirement would be unfair to small investors because they would
be unable to secure credit, while institutional investors could tap
other sources of funds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the damage that heavily margined investors can sustain in
a downward move in stocks is great enough that some observers
question Greenspan's inaction. Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y.,
said, ``It's the little guys who are going to get unduly hurt when
the market goes down so I think there's nothing wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator has been urging Greenspan to reconsider his
reluctance to raise the margin requirement. ``He has not closed the
door on it,'' Schumer said. ``And right now the Fed is undergoing a
study of margin debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Sylla, a professor of financial history at New York
University's Stern School of Business, called Greenspan's
small-investor argument inconsistent. ``He's worried about the
market being too high, but his argument that a margin requirement
increase would make it harder for small investors to participate is
in some sense saying, `I don't want to spoil the party for them
differentially,''' Sylla said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some regulators fear that investors are also borrowing from
sources other than their brokers to buy stocks, including credit
cards or second mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried not just about the margin but about people
borrowing on other assets like homes and the double dip effect that
would have in the event of a market decline,'' said Arthur Levitt,
chairman of the SEC. ``If we have a market decline, then that would
play out not just in terms of lower security values but also in
lower real estate values.''

   The opening piece of advice from my supervisor was this: ``I
recommend that you don't use your real name.'' Next he gave us
packets of alcohol swabs to disinfect our equipment. ``It's so
unsanitary,'' he shuddered. Then he cautioned us: ``You will deal
with some of the nicest people in the world. You will also talk to
people for whom the darkest corner of hell isn't dark enough.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first night at my new job. I had just been hired to
do telephone surveys for a company I'll call Annoy America. I would
be making the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is now negotiating a $1 raise to the $5.15-an-hour
minimum wage. Time magazine recently scoffed that such a move is
essentially symbolic since ``almost no one is working for minimum
wage these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course not, we're all billionaires! Except for the 10 million
or so people who forgot to get their Time Warner stock package and
now work for $6.15 an hour or less. These aren't just teen-agers
flipping burgers so they can buy navel rings. According to the
Economic Policy Institute, 70 percent of these people are over 20
years old, and almost half work full-time.
</P>
<P>
   When I called the number listed in The Washington Post
employment ad (``Telephone Interviewers''), I was given an address
and told to show up at the office the following Thursday evening
for a group interview. The office was long and narrow, filled with
rows of cubicles, about 30 of them.
</P>
<P>
   In each sat a person wearing a headset hunched over a computer.
There was a murmuring of random, canned phrases: ``Would you say
that makes you more likely or less likely?'' ``Do you feel
extremely confident, very confident, somewhat confident?'' ``Do you
own a gun?'' ``Do you agree or disagree that creationism should be
taught in the schools?''
</P>
<P>
   I was directed to a room where there were about a dozen of us,
mostly young black people, professionally dressed as if they were
arriving from another job. We filled out standard applications
(education, work experience, references). To a question about the
references, the interviewer said, ``Don't worry. I don't think
we've ever called anyone's references.''
</P>
<P>
   The interviewer told us we would call all over the country doing
surveys on everything from the presidential race to what kind of
paper towels people used. She warned us about two kinds of people:
those who were ``rude, rude, rude'' (at Annoy America there was a
sort of corporate amnesia over the fact that most people consider
strangers who call them at home to be rude, rude, rude), and old
people who wouldn't let us off the phone.
</P>
<P>
   She handed out stapled employee manuals and then told us that
the work hours were evenings from 5:45 p.m. until 11 -- at 9:45 we
would start calling the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   We had to work at least one weekend shift, and the minimum
number of hours per week was 16. We would be paid $6.15 an hour
(the District of Columbia's minimum wage is $1 above federal
requirements). But if we made a graveyard shift -- a weekend
evening -- part of our permanent schedule, we would make an
additional 25 cents an hour. ``It's an incentive,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   We would get a 15-minute dinner break, but we were asked not to
leave the building except to smoke. One man, about 30, said he had
a day job and he couldn't work until 11. ``Oh come on, a big macho
guy like you,'' said our interviewer. The man put down his manual
and left.
</P>
<P>
   To screen applicants, the boss had us read aloud in turn from
the manual. ``You are about to embark on one of the most
interesting and important types of work in the world today: survey
research.'' ``Rapport is a French word that has no real English
equivalent.'' ``The respondent will lose track of time and enjoy
the process.''
</P>
<P>
   If I had brought a baked potato with me, it would have gotten
the job, too, because when we finished reading, we were all asked
how soon we could start. One young woman said she didn't want to
work the following Monday because she and her fiance had a special
evening planned. She was taking this job, she explained, to pay for
their wedding. One word immediately sprang to mind: Elope.
</P>
<P>
   I started two nights later. Instead of punching a time clock, we
checked in for work and out for breaks at a main computer. Then I
was told to go into a conference room with about 16 other employees
to be briefed on our assignment for the night.
</P>
<P>
   The group was equally divided by sex, race, and age. The people
under 25 were almost all black, many carrying college textbooks.
The people over 50 were almost all white. Actually they were gray,
from their hair to their pallor to their clothes. While we waited
for a supervisor, the atmosphere in the room was that of an
oversize elevator: No one made eye contact, no one spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Our assignment was to survey registered voters about a Southern
mayoral race. The poll consisted of 18 questions, everything from
who they planned to vote for for president to ``How safe do you
feel walking in your neighborhood at night? a) very safe; b)
somewhat safe; c) somewhat unsafe; d) very unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the supervisor, X, took us to our cubicles, told us to use
fake names -- I decided to call myself Natalie Lerner -- and
recommended we clean our headsets. X was one of three supervisors
on duty for 30 employees. I wished my local public school had a
similar ratio.
</P>
<P>
   I started calling. A computer-generated stream of phone numbers
appeared on my screen. When someone actually answered the phone, I
hit another key, and my script appeared. Just a few nights working
the phone makes you realize America's evenings move to a precise
rhythm:
</P>
<P>
   5:45 to 6:30: Answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   6:30 to 7:15: Kids screaming
</P>
<P>
   7:15 to 8:30: ``We're in the middle of dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   8:30 to 9:45: Answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as I got half a sentence into my spiel, about 25 percent
of the people simply hung up on me. Amazingly, an equal number said
this wasn't a good time but agreed I could call back. One woman
said, ``Natalie, I can't talk now because ...'' I didn't hear her
reason because I was too busy wondering, ``Who the hell is
Natalie?''
</P>
<P>
   I began to feel a little like I was playing the slots in
Atlantic City: I had entered a timeless zone where I engaged in a
repetitive task hoping for a big score.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a hit.
</P>
<P>
   An elderly woman didn't hang up when I kept talking. I ran into
trouble on one of the first questions, however. She claimed to be a
registered voter but was not a Democrat or Republican and wasn't
sure what an independent was. I was about to hit ``Don't Know''
when supervisor Y -- who had been listening in -- came running over
to my cubicle and whispered furiously that I had to pin her down.
However, all I could do was repeat the question on the screen in
front of me because I was expressly forbidden to deviate from the
script. The woman finally agreed she was an independent.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors were constantly active. We could see by the
lights on our phone consoles that they were listening in, and at
any slip, they were by our side. When my neighbor said to someone
who didn't immediately hang up on her, ``Would you like to
participate in the survey?'' supervisor X came running over.
``Never, never ask them if they want to continue. They'll say,
'no.' It's like throwing raw meat to wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   My next night at work was the final session for the mayoral
race. Although the first night we had been instructed to try to get
men to answer the survey (``It's harder to get males, women are
used to connecting more,'' explained Y), tonight we needed only
women. My request to talk to the youngest woman in the house --
people who agree to be interviewed tend to be old -- yielded
responses from the rueful to the outraged. One man said, ``There's
no female in this house. I wish there was.'' Another replied,
``I've got a 44-year-old, a 45-year-old, and a 69-year-old. None of
them are here. I'm microwaving my own dinner!''
</P>
<P>
   Around 8, I went to the conference room for my 15-minute break.
I sat down next to a plump 50-ish woman who had her dinner laid out
on the table: six varieties of candy bars. She told me that she had
been moonlighting at Annoy for two years. She had a full-time day
job with a local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked two jobs my whole life,'' she said. ``I only sleep
three and a half hours a night.''
</P>
<P>
   I let my dinner break run to 19 minutes and when I returned to
the computer to punch in, it admonished me, ``You're late! Please
be on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the two nights, I dialed 210 phone numbers
and completed five interviews. When I left work, one of the
questions on the survey seemed apt. I realized I felt, ``c)
somewhat unsafe'' walking home at night. I hailed a cab. The ride
took about three minutes and cost $4, in other words, 40 minutes of
dialing.
</P>
<P>
   Night 3 I was assigned to the dreaded, ``Will You Be Prepared
When You Retire'' survey -- a look at how people earning more than
$150,000 are saving for their retirement. The inherent problem in
the survey was that it required persuading people making more than
$150,000 to answer a 30-question survey on their financial dealings
from a stranger making minimum wage. And recently, said Y, shaking
her head, the company paying for the survey decided they wanted 900
completed interviews instead of 600.
</P>
<P>
   I swabbed my headset with alcohol and started dialing. Very few
people listened to the end of my introduction, ``Hello, I'm Natalie
Lerner from ... doing a short survey on a vital topic ... will you
be prepared ... absolutely confidential ... interviewing
influential people.''
</P>
<P>
   In my first hour of calls, only one person even let me finish.
When I did, she said, ``I'm not influential'' and hung up.
Amazingly, at 6:45 I got a business owner and at 7:10 a sales
manager willing to do the almost 20-minute survey. Afterward, two
supervisors called me in.
</P>
<P>
   Overall I got an ``A,'' but they went over a number of mistakes
I made, such as hitting the key for ``extremely concerned'' when my
sales manager was only ``very concerned'' about making the right
investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to the phones. It took two more hours before I
convinced someone to do another interview. While I dialed, a woman
from the cleaning crew began vacuuming the hall, making me feel
grateful that I only had to sit in the little cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   At 9:45, when we start calling the West Coast, the older woman
one seat down said she was worried about what time we would get
out. Her trip required a subway and a bus transfer. Last night she
just missed the bus and so had to wait 40 minutes for the next one,
getting home around 1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous out there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The college student next to me, who used the names of his
football teammates as a revolving pseudonym, finally completed an
interview. Before he hung up, he said, ``Thank you, thank you,
you're my only one for the whole night.'' Then at 10:46, the
supervisors walked up and down the rows telling us we could go
home.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got to the main computer to check out at 10:48,
the office was deserted. I decided that was my last night. I had
worked for 13.6 hours, dialed 370 phone numbers, and completed 13
interviews. My take-home pay was $77.24.
</P>
<P>
   When I got out to the street, there was an older woman from the
office, who walked with a heavy limp, already hailing a cab. When
she got in, I hoped her trip was a short one.

   CREDIT (New York) _ Stocks soared again Thursday as investors
poured into technology and financial shares in a bet that the
Federal Reserve was almost finished raising short-term interest
rates. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 253.16 points, or
2.3 percent, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 1.6 percent.
Bonds also gained, with the interest rate on the 30-year Treasury

   MARGIN-TRADING-RISKS (Undated) _ Borrowing money to buy stocks
has become immensely popular among individual investors. And who
can blame them? When stock prices are rising, the biggest gains go
to those who buy shares on borrowed money. When stock prices are
falling, however, borrowing to buy stocks is an expensive and
highly risky business. Market regulators are growing concerned that
the recent surge in investor indebtedness, which has been greatest
at online brokerage firms, reflects the participation of many
people who do not understand how dangerous stock market debt can
be. By Gretchen Morgenson.

 &HT;    CFN gets $130 million boost
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consumer Financial Network said it received a $130.5 million
private equity investment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer Financial Network is a comparison shopping and
information tool for all manner of personal financial services,
including home mortgages, insurance, credit cards and investments.
The service is offered to corporations, who in turn provide it to
employees through Intranets, private Internets.
</P>
<P>
   The information is available on a CFN-owned Web site,
www.youdecide.com. It also could be used by large Web sites, such
as Yahoo or Excite, hoping to create an integrated financial
services section.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based CFN is majority-owned by IXL Enterprises, the
parent company of IXL, the Atlanta-based Web design firm. IXL
Enterprises hopes to spin off the unit into a separate company.
</P>
<P>
   Including the investment, CFN is valued at $650 million. Last
year, the 220-employee company lost $38 million on $1.9 million in
revenue, not including its October acquisition of iExpert,
according to the IXL Enterprises annual report.
</P>
<P>
   Investors include Kelso &AMP; Co., a New York-based investment firm,
which is iXL's largest shareholder. Also, Chase Capital Partners,
Capital Research, First Union, Hearst-Argyle Television, J.W.
Seligman, Royal Bank of Canada, Equifax, Westway Capital, Nevo
Investments and several individual investors. iXL remains CFN's
largest single shareholder, with more than a 50 percent stake. GE
Capital remains the second largest shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of the investment _ from a media company, banks
and New York venture capital _ was an effort to tap into a network
of contacts that could potentially steer business CFN's way, said
Caroline Vanderlip, CFN's executive vice president of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a technology with applications in a broad array of
fields, `` Vanderlip said. ``We use it to support financial
services, so a bank made sense. But we also knew that on the
private label side, that very well-connected sort of venture
capital money would help open doors for us.''
</P>
<P>
   CFN has offices in Buckhead, Duluth, Manhattan and Stamford,
Conn. Cathleen Raffaeli, CFN's president and chief operating
officer, works out of the Manhattan office with a staff of about
20.

BUSH, GORE STEP UP CHASE FOR CAMPAIGN CASH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although he has pledged to eliminate unrestricted
donations to political parties, Democratic presidential contender
Al Gore will be in Houston on Friday to scoop up more than $500,000
for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republican George W. Bush, whose record-shattering
fund-raising was almost matched by his record-setting spending,
also has hit the money circuit with events Thursday in Palm Beach,
Fla., and Friday in Little Rock, Ark. His appearances are expected
to net $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Despite heightened voter interest in fund-raising reform, both
candidates have stepped up their chase for campaign cash to prepare
for what could be a high-priced and nasty general election battle.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has moved to turn off the contribution spigot despite
vows to reach out to voters drawn to the campaign-finance reform
themes voiced by John McCain and Bill Bradley during the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been the most vocal in his embrace of the reforms
championed by McCain and Bradley, including the elimination of
unrestricted soft money to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush has never made campaign-finance reform a priority,
he endorsed modest changes, including abolition of soft money
contributions by corporations and unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both these guys are using the word reform, and I don't think
anyone is taking them at their word. They might talk about the
evils of soft money but that hasn't keep them from raising it,''
said Larry Makinson, director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, which monitors and analyzes fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is the name for unregulated contributions to
political parties that are intended for party building and not for
federal elections . However, in recent election cycles both parties
have used legal loopholes to funnel this money into issue ads on
the candidates' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   This year is shaping up to be no exception in the soft money
sweepstakes, with the Democratic Party predicting it will raise
$100 million and Republicans $177 million, much of it in
unregulated dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will fly to Houston on Friday night with the sole intent of
raising cash for his party. His first stop will be at the residence
of trial lawyer Denman Heard and his wife, Laura, who are hosting a
reception for 125 people expected to donate $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   He will then drop by the Museum District home of trial lawyer
Lee Godfrey, who is hosting a dinner for 40 people expected to
shell out $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raising excursions have been politically awkward for
Gore who finds himself cheerleading for the kinds of contributions
he says he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that Gore's interest in campaign-finance
reform is hypocritical and is intended to blunt criticism of his
involvement in questionable fund-raising practices in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the vice president says that he is so committed to reform
that he has instructed the Democratic Party not to spend any of the
soft money on issue ads aimed at Bush unless the Republican Party
starts airing attack spots first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to take whatever criticism comes with being an
advocate for campaign-finance reform because it is good policy,''
Gore said recently. Gore said that while he hopes Bush will accept
his challenge to eliminate soft money, he added, ``we're not going
to unilaterally disarm, and we're going to be ready if they try to
use special interest money to determine the outcome of the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans say they do not trust Gore's pledges based on
the 1996 presidential election when the Democrats blitzed the
airwaves with ads slamming GOP candidate Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let Al Gore do to us in 2000 what he did to us in
1996 with Bill Clinton, '' said Mike Collins, a spokesman for
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said it is still unclear what role Bush will play in
helping the GOP raise soft money. He said party officials met this
week with Bush's chief of staff Joe Albaugh to discuss such
matters.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the Texas governor has been forced to
concentrate on replenishing his campaign coffers, which were
depleted by a tougher-than-expected primary against McCain.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of February, Bush had $7.5 million in cash compared
to $10.5 million for Gore, according to the latest monthly
campaign-finance reports filed with the Federal Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The figures represent a stunning reversal of fortune for the
candidates. Most political observers had assumed that having raised
an unprecedented $73.9 million, Bush would be flush with cash
during the pre-convention primary period while Gore would be out of
money.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush's campaign, spending at a rate of $3 million a
week, went through more than $63 million, with about a third of the
money going for television and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan defended the spending rate
saying, ''We had a plan in place for the primary, and it was
successful.``
</P>
<P>
   The governor has scheduled 14 fund-raisers with a goal of
raising between $5 million and $10 million. He raised $750,000 at a
Palm Beach event Thursday and is expected to bring in another
quarter of a million in President Clinton's hometown of Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is prevented from raising more than $2 to $3 million more
for his own campaign because, unlike Bush, he is taking matching
federal funds. His campaign had raised about $37 million and spent
$27.4 million through the end of February.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and Bush allege that the other is captive of special
interests, both of their parties take in their share of soft money
from groups and individuals with interest in federal legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats benefit from generous giving from trial lawyers and
labor unions, a recent analysis by Common Cause showed.
Republicans, meanwhile, were showered with support from tobacco
companies, the National Rifle Association and phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause President Scott Harshbarger said that if neither
Gore nor Bush makes credible moves toward campaign-finance reform
they will ``increase people's cynicism about the whole system.''

 &HT;    Sunday's text: Thou shalt be counted
 &HT;    By Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The government and houses of worship will join hands
to pray this weekend, crossing the constitutional divide that
separates church and state in the spirit of getting an accurate
census count.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes has asked preachers, priests and rabbis; imams,
lamas and gurus to pitch the 2000 census in their sermons for the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, however, has been designated ``Census Sabbath''
because a week remains until the April 1 deadline suggested for
returning completed questionnaires. The big push targets the
religious community because those organizations run social service
efforts that benefit people who are historically hard to reach but
at the same time depend on federally funded programs.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is the only state to propose sermons, according to
Brenda August with the U.S. Bureau of the Census in Washington. The
federal agency distributed brochures and written announcements to
be given to worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours are not sermons,'' August said. ``A number of
organizations all over the country are implementing programs that
are targeted to their communities, (and) they have designed their
programs in their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians question the use of the sermons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the ACLU, we are concerned any time a governmental agency
attempts to shape the message delivered from a pulpit,'' said
Debbie Seagraves, executive director of the Georgia Chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union. ``That is one of the things we fear
the most when we stress the importance of separation of church and
state. This may seem innocuous on the face of it, but which agency
will come next? Could it be the Justice Department?''
</P>
<P>
   James Holmes, regional director for the census bureau, did not
object to a government-drafted religious message with a census
theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried to cover the entire spectrum, and what every
state is doing is complementing what we are doing,'' Holmes said.
Some churches will receive more information than others, he said,
adding, ``I'm not overly concerned about excluding any.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Carey, a spokeswoman for the Census Bureau in Georgia,
said the focus is churches with a large number of black, Hispanic
or Asian members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only certain churches are doing it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Kaiman, executive director of the Anti-Defamation League,
worried that the focus could be too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think they have to be careful that the message they are
sending is inclusive of all religions,'' Kaiman said. ``There is a
problem if they forget certain religions that do not follow certain
doctrines. That would show a lack of understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the emphasis of the somewhat disorganized state program
has been on the Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not overly sensitive,'' said Rabbi Shalom Lewis, who leads
the conservative Congregation Etz Chaim in Marietta. ``These are
just suggested texts. Any rabbi or imam can come up with their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he may include the census in his weekend message but
he already has had to answer questions from worshipers who are
concerned they will violate Jewish law if they are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious leaders, especially those who minister to
immigrants, are reluctant to participate in the government program.
They or members of their congregations do not trust the Census
Bureau's assurances that it will not share information with any
other police or federal agency, such as the Immigration and
Naturalization Service or the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them say they are not speaking from the pulpit,'' said
Jacqueline Rosier of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund in Atlanta.

 &HT;    Firms form virtual trading post
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. has teamed up with its two largest rivals
to form a virtual trading post for pulp, paper and wood products.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, International Paper and Weyerhauser Co., the
three-largest U.S. forest products companies, said Thursday they
intend to develop a separate Internet-based venture to cut costs
and make ordering easier for their business customers and
suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mechanism for conducting business in every form _
direct business with large customers, spot business with
intermittent customers or regular business with suppliers,'' said
John Balboni, vice president of e-business for International Paper.
</P>
<P>
   Although the initiative will be restricted to
business-to-business transactions, it's possible that the companies
may expand beyond that at some point, Balboni said.
</P>
<P>
   Each company will own equal stakes in the venture, which is
expected to attract more partners. The companies may consider
selling shares in the venture to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to join forces was easy, given the increasing
number of Internet-based companies in the pulp and paper supply
business, said Ken Haldin, spokesman for Atlanta-based
Georgia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three parties had a mutual interest. We looked at it in
terms of knowing what our customer needs are and knowing that
electronic marketplace is where they're moving,'' Haldin said. ``By
doing this together, it's much more cost-effective than by each of
us taking a separate path.''
</P>
<P>
   About $200 billion in products are shipped annually in the U.S.
paper and forest products industry. Internet-based sales in the
paper industry are forecast to top $90 billion by 2004, according
to Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the European paper industry got its first
Internet supply company. PaperX.com, led by Harvard Business School
graduates and former chief executives from European paper
companies, said its site will handle 10 percent of all the paper
traded there by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific and its partners plan to create a single supply
ordering standard with a common technology platform for the forest
products industry. That should benefit small and large customers
alike, Haldin said. The venture will generate revenue primarily
through transaction fees and advertising, Haldin said.
</P>
<P>
   A search for a chief executive is on, and the venture is looking
at potential technology partners.
</P>
<P>
   The company's headquarters location hasn't been identified.
Executives are looking at ``neutral'' cities other than the home
bases of the three founding companies. International Paper is based
in Purchase, N.Y. Weyerhauser's headquarters office is in Federal
Way, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific is based on Peachtree Street in Downtown Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Two executives from each company have formed a steering
committee for the venture. Georgia-Pacific members include David J.
Paterson, vice president of electronic commerce, and Robert A.
Renner, director of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have hired Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as their
financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The first transactions for the new company, which still must
meet regulatory approval, could come in the third quarter, Haldin
said. Until then, the companies said they will continue normal
sales and procurement activities.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper's alliance with PaperExchange.com will
remain part of its electronic commerce strategy. PaperExchange, a
Boston-based online business-to-business marketplace for the paper
and pulp industry, filed for a $115 million initial stock sale last
week.

 &HT;    Strike would impact Delta
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A possible shutdown at US Airways this weekend could flood other
airlines with stranded passengers, and Atlanta's two primary
carriers would get plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines and AirTran Airways are among US Airways' top
competitors along the eastern seaboard and would be prime
alternatives for fliers left in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean even bigger crowds than normal at Hartsfield
International Airport amid the busy spring break travel season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would expect our already heavy loads to turn into full
aircraft on many routes,'' Delta spokesman John Kennedy said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's already tight, especially for Florida routes,'' agreed
Tad Hutcheson, marketing director at AirTran.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown threat stems from a contract stalemate between US
Airways and its flight attendant union. Unless there is a
breakthrough by 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the airline says it will cease
operations rather than let the Association of Flight Attendants
begin random walkouts under a plan called CHAOS, for Create Havoc
Around Our System.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways' bookings would be honored by other carriers under
certain conditions and where space is available. Such agreements
are worked out among carriers in case of a strike.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways itself has a relatively small presence at Hartsfield,
with 31 daily departures to seven destinations, compared with about
130 departures for AirTran and 660 for Delta. Flights to New York
by US Airways Express, an affiliate, wouldn't be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The direct impact here wouldn't be too big,'' said Duluth
Travel owner Arthur Salus, who's been steering clients away from US
Airways for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But US Airways has a major Southeast hub in Charlotte. Many
passengers booked on connecting flights through Charlotte would
seek to re-book through Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said Delta doesn't have spare aircraft to add to routes
where the spillover might be greatest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot we can do other than accept tickets where we
have availability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran will add one extra daily Atlanta-Orlando flight starting
Saturday evening, Hutcheson said.
</P>
<P>
   Flightserv.com, a fledgling Atlanta-based company that books
individual seats on small chartered private jets, will offer its
service in Charlotte starting Monday if a shutdown occurs, a
spokesman said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Pope John Paul II made Edith Tzirer cry Thursday at
the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Tzirer, a Holocaust survivor, had been waiting 54 years to thank
him in person for saving her life, she said. Staring into his eyes,
her emotions got the better of her. The Roman Catholic leader
reached up with his white-robed arm and patted her gently, standing
on the cold stone floor that bore the etched names of Nazi
concentration camps in Germany and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope doesn't remember her,'' Joaquin Navarro-Valls, the
Vatican spokesman, said later. ``But her story is probably true
because the pope was there at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   It took place in a small town near Krakow, Poland, in 1945.
Liberation Day. Tzirer was 14 then, painfully thin, tubercular and
alone. She had just been released from the Skarzysko-Kamienna labor
camp. Wearing her camp uniform, she was riding a train to Krakow,
where she had lost contact with her family at the beginning of the
war in 1939. The train ran out of fuel and stopped in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   While the other passengers ate and drank, Tzirer said, she sat
off in a corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know to this day how he saw me,'' she said. ``He moved
the people aside and came to me and asked me why I was sitting
there like that.
</P>
<P>
   ```Did you eat? Did you drink?' he asked. I said that I hadn't
in a number of days already. He went and brought me my first cup of
tea, the first cup in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a seminary student, she said, young, tall and handsome
with blue eyes. ``To tell you the truth,'' she said, ``I thought
that it was God himself who had shown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tzirer said the man told her to come with him and board another
train, a cattle car bound for Krakow. She told him she was too weak
to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He picked me up and I fell back down again like a sack of
flour,'' she said. ``He took me on his back and carried me. We
walked for three, four kilometers _ I'm not sure _ through the
snow.''
</P>
<P>
   The man told her that his name was Karol Wojtyla and that he was
from the town of Wadowice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the cattle car was a Jewish family, whose members whispered
to her that she should watch out that the ``priest'' didn't mean to
``lock her up in a convent,'' she said. This frightened her, she
said, and in Krakow she ran away from him. Years later, she said,
in 1978, her life established in Israel, she read in a newspaper
that Karol Wojtyla had been named pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost fainted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's official biographer, Adam Bonieczi, said he was
skeptical about her story. ``I doubt she could remember him,'' he
said. ``He's told me a lot of similar stories, but I've never heard
him talk about her.''
</P>
<P>
   Tzirer's story was recounted on Israeli radio and television
throughout the day Thursday. Israelis believed it because it
reaffirmed the warm feelings they have toward the pope as a
Catholic leader who grew up with Jews, helped them after the war
and then led the church to recognize the enormity of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Also, her presence at Yad Vashem seemed to validate Tzirer's
story when she was presented to the pope Thursday, one of six
Holocaust survivors whom he met there. The program was pre-arranged
with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The version of her story in the introduction to the Yad Vashem
ceremony, however, was slightly different than that told by Tzirer.
It said the young seminarian had found her lying by a fence and
took her to a train station, where she joined other survivors.
</P>
<P>
   When Tzirer came face to face with the pope Thursday, she
blurted out what she had wanted to tell him, an old Jewish saying:
``Whoever saves the life of a single Jew, it is as if he saved the
world in its entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she lost her composure.

 &HT;    Quoting Scripture to capture message of 2000 Census
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes' office distributed several
Scripture verses and sermon ideas to promote participation in the
census. Here are two samples:
</P>
<P>
   Some interesting things happen when scripture is looked at
through Census eyes. We find that counting people is an integral
part of the Biblical story of our way with God and God's way with
us. If you have never preached a series on Nehemiah, try it.
Nehemiah is the tale of a public servant who rebuilt a great city,
Jerusalem, and in the process, helped a dispirited people find
their way. The importance of Nehemiah to the Jewish people cannot
be underestimated. One of the very first things that Nehemiah did
when he began the task of rebuilding was to enlist people to join
him in the effort. He took a census. As the city is rebuilt, he
lists the names of those who participated in the effort. Integrity,
trustworthiness, and confidence marked the activity of Nehemiah.
Those are the characteristics that the community of faith can
contribute to the process of getting a complete count for Census
2000. For our communities to be rebuilt everyone needs to be
accounted for and everyone has a part to play in the rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Census'' Text: Luke
2:1-7
</P>
<P>
   This is the famous Christmas story in which the political
authorities required all citizens to travel to the regional office
to be counted. Think of how fortunate and easy we have it. Just
fill out the form and mail it in.
</P>
<P>
   The census count is the background for one of the greatest
stories ever told. Joseph and Mary leave Nazareth en route to
Bethlehem. (By the way, the word ``Bethlehem'' means ``house of
bread.'' When people are not counted, they can forfeit money, jobs
and the means for purchasing bread.)
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the census journey, Verse 7 reads, ``She gave
birth to her first born.'' What a time to have a baby! What a
census journey to remember!
</P>
<P>
   They were registered for the census, but more importantly,
salvation was registered for those who chose to believe.

RABBI HITS JEWISH CRITICS' CLOUDED VIEW OF POPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking hours after Pope John Paul II appeared at a Holocaust
memorial in Israel, the head of the Reform Jewish movement in
America has criticized Jewish organizations for failing to
acknowledge the tremendous progress made in Catholic-Jewish
relations during this pope's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, said in a speech at Assumption College in Worcester,
Mass. that Jewish groups have been too quick to criticize the pope,
too focused on the Holocaust to the exclusion of other issues, and
remiss at informing their own children about the modern state of
Jewish-Catholic relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, we teach nothing at all about other religious
traditions to our children, and what we do teach on Catholicism is
likely to focus on the Inquisition and the Crusades,'' Yoffie said
in remarks prepared for delivery. ``This is a moral failure of the
first order, and we have a profound responsibility to provide an
immediate remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie said Catholics do a better job teaching their children
about Jews than Jews do about Catholics, and he said he will order
an immediate revision of Jewish school textbooks to reflect recent
changes in Catholic attitudes toward Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie gave John Paull II credit for visiting a synagogue,
condemning anti-Semitism, and establishing diplomatic relations
between the Vatican and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a church where anti-Judaism was a prejudice so routine that
rare was the member who did not experience it, only by
demonstrating an intense depth of concern expressed in powerful and
suggestive language could the pope hope to change the church's
direction and overcome the hostility of centuries past,'' Yoffie
said. ``And this is exactly what John Paul has repeatedly done. . .
. I doubt if we could find any other example in history of a church
initiating a process of such profound repentance, acknowledging the
sins of its members over a 2000-year period against the
practitioners of the religious tradition from which it sprang.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie said Jewish groups have been too focused on criticizing
what the pope hasn't said about the role of the church during the
Holocaust, instead of acknowledging the importance of what he has
said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for Jewish and Catholic theologians to discuss what it
means to be a saint at a time of evil as a way to understand the
debate over Pope Pius XII, who the church appears likely to beatify
despite Jewish concerns that he did not speak out against the
Holocaust. And Yoffie called for more Catholic-Jewish discussion of
issues surrounding ethics, the family, and the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Holocaust cannot be the sole item on the Catholic-Jewish
agenda,'' he said. ``It cannot become an obsession that crowds out
all those other subjects that so urgently require our collective
attention.''

 &HT;    Justice Department seeks to limit reno testimony
 &HT;    By Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The Justice Department wants U.S. District Judge
Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco to limit attorneys for Branch Davidian
survivors to two hours of questioning of U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno next week.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is set to be deposed on Tuesday morning at the Department
of Justice building in Washington, D.C., in the wrongful-death
lawsuit filed against the government by Branch Davidian survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed Thursday in Waco's federal court, Phyllis J.
Pyles, a Justice Department attorney, asks that Smith restrict
Reno's deposition to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is good cause for limiting the attorney general's
deposition to two hours because the national interest requires that
she be protected from any undue burden on her ability to perform
her governmental duties,'' Pyles wrote. ``Cabinet officers and
agency heads have greater duties and time constraints than other
witnesses and therefore are not normally subject to deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has agreed to be deposed ``despite the heavy demands on her
position,'' according to the motion.
</P>
<P>
   However, while lead plaintiffs' attorney Mike Caddell of Houston
has agreed to limit his questions to 90 minutes, Houston attorney
Jim Brannon will not agree to a time limit, the motion states.
</P>
<P>
   Brannon, who represents the estates of David Koresh's three
children born to his wife Rachel, said Thursday that two hours may
be plenty of time, but he won't know until the deposition starts.
For that reason, he will not agree to time constraints unless they
are court-ordered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know if I need two hours,'' Brannon said. ``The
question is, am I going to be permitted to explore the things I
need to explore? It may take two hours, it make take 30 minutes, it
may take five hours. You never know how dodgy the witness is going
to be. But I can assure you that nothing that she has to do is more
important that telling us the truth about Waco.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno authorized the plan that was designed to force Koresh and
his followers from Mount Carmel with tear gas and end the 51-day
standoff with federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six Davidians died April 19, 1993, after a fire swept
through Mount Carmel as FBI agents crashed holes into the compound
with military vehicles and inserted tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very interested in talking about fire protection with the
attorney general and emergency protection and what were the
restrictions or limitations on what these people could do,''
Brannon said. ``What were they authorized to do? When you have a
written plan that is argued about for weeks and weeks and then you
go down there and don't stick with it for two hours, we need to
find out who approved the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs have alleged that government officials were negligent
in the way they reacted after the fire broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Government representatives have said that they held back
firefighters from battling the blaze because Davidians were
shooting at agents and vehicles during the tear-gas assault.

BOSTON GIRDS FOR PROTESTS DURING BIOTECH CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAPHAEL LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With the possibility of ``Seattle-style'' unrest
erupting during a protest of a biotechnology conference this
weekend, Mayor Thomas Menino and police officials say the city is
prepared for the worst, but not expecting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fondest hope is that, five, six days from now, we'll be
saying this is all much ado about nothing,'' Police Commissioner
Paul F. Evans said of preparations for BIO2000, which begins Sunday
and runs through Thursday at the Hynes Convention Center. ``But we
would be remiss if we did not prepare for other eventualities.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, police have been undergoing special
training in large-scale civil disobedience, officials said, saying
the move was only partially inspired by the upcoming rally.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of a rally and counter-conference, called
Biodevastation 2000, have assured police that they are non-violent,
a point they reiterated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Menino and Evans said they have received
intelligence that some who plan to attend do not share their point
of view. The insurgents, they said, attended the often-violent
street protests that took place when the World Trade Organization
met in Seattle last year, a situation that largely took police
there by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civil disobedience is becoming more creative, more
innovative,'' Evans said during a press conference Thursday.
``We're concerned about small groups of people engaging in more
creative forms of disobedience. ... When it endangers lives and
public safety, then we have to be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, city officials have warned Back Bay shopkeepers
to take ``common sense'' precautions, and have requested that local
newspapers remove vending boxes, which vandals in Seattle used to
smash shop windows in Seattle. In addition, barricades will be in
place for most of the weekend at certain key areas near the Hynes,
and garbage cans will be removed.
</P>
<P>
   The rally's organizers stressed that they know of no plans by
any opponents of the biotechnology industry to create trouble, and
that their rally will be ``a family event'' complete with live
music and puppets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about a police overreaction because the
police definitely overreacted in Seattle, and that led to big
problems,'' said Jessica Hayes, one of the organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said the police ``have an underlying assumption to protect
the biotech industry, when our rights of peaceful gathering and
protest might be jeopardized.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, organizers have kept in close contact with police to
ensure that no violence marrs their chance to put their agenda in
the public eye. They say that the government has not done nearly
enough to regulate the fast-growing industry, which they say is
jeapordizing the environment and the public's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the (biotechnology) industry's research as the premier
public health and safety issue of the weekend, not our peaceful
gathering,'' said Brian Tokar, another organizer of the rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokar said he expected hundreds, and possibly 1,000 protestors
from across the country and Canada to attend the rally. In
addition, several scientists, activists, and celebrities such as
Ralph Nader will speak at various forums that will take place at
Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 8,000 delegates and vendors are expected to attend
some portion of BIO2000, which is being billed as the largest
gathering of its kind to date.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was last held, ironically, in Seattle. Carl
Feldbaum, president of the Washington-based Biotechnology Industry
Organization, said that demonstraters protested that conference,
held last May, without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a polite demonstration in which views were traded,''
said Feldbaum, whose organization is sponsoring BIO2000. ``I expect
more people this year, but I fully expect the rally to be a
peaceful one of people exercising their rights to speech and
assembly.

 &HT;    `I can be myself _ whatever incarnation that may be'
 &HT;    By T. Chante LaGon
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the morning after a rave. My ears hadn't stopped ringing.
The smell of wet smoke lingered, and traces of purple eye shadow
and red mascara held on where sweat had erased everything else.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, I felt connected. Drained _ I smiled at the thought of
dancing so hard _ yet somehow energized by a force stronger than
the brilliant lasers that flashed across the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   A rave is unforgettable. A good one changes your life.
</P>
<P>
   You start displaying PLUR _ peace, love, unity and respect _
every day. You are more open-minded. Giving strangers compliments
no longer seems strange.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that it takes a special person to be a raver. It takes
endurance. It takes a love for music that you won't hear on 99X or
Hot 97.5. Most of all, it requires a special mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   Ravers know there's something more than rush-hour traffic,
weekends in Buckhead or Sunday dinners: There's spirituality,
individuality, better living through music.
</P>
<P>
   When I walk into a party, the drums and bass remind me of my
hip-hop background. Eye candy is everywhere, from fairies and
``candy'' kids bejeweled in bright-colored necklaces and bracelets,
to dance circles surrounding breakers. Smiling faces sweep by,
almost all of them familiar, welcoming me to the community's latest
gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Our community is accepting. At a rave, I can be myself _
whatever incarnation that may be.
</P>
<P>
   Our community also has its problems _ some ravers wake up
``crustified'' from Ecstacy.
</P>
<P>
   But at its essence, the spirit of the rave community is freedom.
When I close my eyes and dance like no one's watching, my soul is
rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   T. Chante LaGon, 23, is senior writer for Lunar Magazine and an
active member of the Atlanta Alliance. She has been raving for
about three years.

RANGERS UPGRADE RESULTS OF TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Luis Alicea has what manager Johnny Oates
calls a ``track record.'' Oates has seen him play before and knows
what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   That might be all that keeps Alicea from losing his job as the
Rangers' every-day second baseman to the hard-charging Frank
Catalanotto. Oates has become enamored with the utility infielder
picked up from the Detroit Tigers, and his chances for more playing
time have increased daily this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a look that he has,'' Oates said. ``But when you've
been around this game a long time, you just get a feeling about a
guy that he can help you win ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto is one of several reasons why the Rangers, unlike
Jack of fairy tale fame, got more than a handful of beans when they
sent Juan Gonzalez to Detroit in the November nine-player trade.
The Rangers are feeling good about that swap.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Gabe Kapler is hitting with authority and making
diving catches. Catalanotto could end up being a front-line second
baseman rather than a utility infielder. Francisco Cordero, with
seven consecutive scoreless innings, is using his overpowering
stuff to throw more strikes down in the zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin Thompson (coming off shoulder surgery) still has to
pitch for us,'' general manager Doug Melvin said. ``You've got to
believe in a trade when you make it, and there's no reason to not
feel good about it ... seeing the progress of some of these guys,
overall our scouts and their evaluation of these guys were
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers knew about Kapler, Cordero and Thompson. They also
knew that Bill Haselman would be a valuable backup catcher. But
Catalanotto might be an extra dividend the Rangers weren't quite
expecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we made the trade, a number of people said, `don't forget
this guy,' '' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler is among those admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cat's a great player,'' Kapler said. ``He's going to have
success because he's a hard worker, he cares about his teammates
and he plays to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates is finding that out quickly. Catalanotto went 0-for-3 in
Thursday's 4-2 loss to the Minnesota Twins, but is batting .371
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Oates said he doesn't know how many at-bats Catalanotto will get
this season. But asked how many he'd like for him to get, Oates
quickly said, ``The way he's swinging the bat _ 600.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Oates, ``If he keeps swinging the bat like this, he may
get 600.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Catalanotto can play regularly at second base, Oates
said, ``I'm going to try and find out. He hasn't done anything to
hurt his chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspect defense is supposed to be what keeps Catalanotto from
playing regularly, but he has made only one error this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've shown them I can play and I warrant some playing
time,'' Catalanotto said. ``I don't think I've been bad in the
field. I've made some plays and held my own. I feel more confident
I can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I was given a fair chance to win the job. They
gave the job to Luis going in and I understand that. But
eventually, if I keep hitting, I'll get a shot at a starting job
down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto, a left-handed hitter, could also see time at third
base if Tom Evans, a right-handed hitter, beats out Mike Lamb.
Oates has been using Catalanotto at second and third this spring.
Anything to get him more at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the right team, Catalanotto can really help,'' Oates said.

explaining the changes, and then helped it to write another news
release explaining that the first release was completely wrong on a
crucial point.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of how that came to be raises questions about both the
firm's competence and its commitment to being an independent
auditor whose word can be trusted when it certifies that financial
statements comply with the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, here's what happened: MicroStrategy, a software and
Internet company, became a Wall Street darling thanks in part to
rapidly rising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   It now turns out that the company was, for at least two years,
not in compliance with the primary rule on revenue recognition for
software companies, Statement 97-2, which was issued by the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants in 1997. But to
know that you had to understand the rule and have access to the
company's contracts with its customers. There was no way to know
that from reading the public financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The PricewaterhouseCoopers' office in McLean, Va., certified the
1998 and 1999 financial statements. There is no indication that it
sought guidance from experts at the firm's national office who deal
with tricky accounting issues.
</P>
<P>
   Things might have continued as they were had MicroStrategy not
gotten a little cute. In October and again in January the company
announced unusual deals that increased revenues for the quarters
just ended. Each deal involved MicroStrategy selling to a customer
that simultaneously sold something else to MicroStrategy.
</P>
<P>
   That smelled funny to Howard Schilit, who runs the Center for
Financial Research and Analysis. He put out two reports critical of
the company. Forbes magazine followed with an article raising
similar questions.
</P>
<P>
   That is how one of the world's great auditing firms discovered
there was a problem. An accountant in the national office of
PricewaterhouseCoopers read the Forbes piece, according to one
person involved in the affair, and called the local office with
questions. Meetings followed, and MicroStrategy soon said its
accounting was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   But MicroStrategy's mea culpa, which was approved in advance by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, cited the wrong accounting literature. It
pointed to a relatively new statement from the Securities and
Exchange Commission that had nothing to do with the issue. That
offended some people at the SEC, and soon MicroStrategy issued a
clarification.
</P>
<P>
   Bulls on MicroStrategy think the company can flourish without
dubious accounting. Time will tell.
</P>
<P>
   But for PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was embarrassed a few
months ago by the revelation that many of its partners ignored
rules barring them from having financial relationships with audit
clients, the questions are more pressing. Was the local office
unfamiliar with Statement 97-2? Why did the national office not get
involved before the audit was completed? After the accounting was
fixed, who signed off on the misleading explanation?
</P>
<P>
   David Nestor, a spokesman for the accounting firm, declined to
answer those questions, saying they related to confidential client
affairs. But he did say that concerns about offending a client or
losing an account played no role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't compromise on audit quality,'' he said.

RAYTHEON, ARMY SEEK CAUSE OF WEAR IN PATRIOT MISSILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Army has taken hundreds of Patriot missiles out of service
after finding flaws in the ground-defense weapon, built by Raytheon
Co. in Massachusetts plants.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials said Thursday they have replaced Patriots from
batteries in the Middle East and in South Korea because of worn
electronic parts in the missiles' radar guidance-systems.
</P>
<P>
   The wear seemed to occur after the missiles had been kept on
combat alert for at least six months. The Army said it has plenty
of replacement Patriots, which are meant to shoot down attacking
aircraft and missiles and said it isn't clear the flaws would have
caused the missiles with damaged components to misfire during a
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But the Army and Raytheon are still looking for the root cause
of the problem, said Major Scott Hays in Washington. Officials are
also reviewing how long missiles can be kept ready to fire at a
moment's notice. ``Those missiles got a workout, much more so than
those in Germany or in other locations'' where the weapons aren't
kept at a high state of alert, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army briefed congressional staffers on the problem earlier
this month but only disclosed it publicly Thursday after it was
reported by The Wall Street Journal. The issue is the latest to
emerge for the Patriot, which the military initially touted for its
accuracy during the Gulf War but later acknowledged had a
lower-than-claimed success rate.
</P>
<P>
   Missile-maker Raytheon suffered another setback in January when
a prototype failed to strike and destroy a target during a test of
a proposed National Missile Defense program.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Raytheon lost out to the company now known as Lockheed
Martin Corp. in a competition to build a more precise version of
the Patriot called PAC-3. Last September Lockheed Martin received a
contract worth around $150 million to build 92 missiles and put
them into service by next year. Raytheon still builds ground-based
guidance radars for the PAC-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Raytheon was contracted to upgrade hundreds of
existing Patriots with more advanced electronics, a deal worth $47
million this fiscal year. Some of the missiles now in service up
are up to 10 years old, and several months ago the Army began
reviews of its missile stocks to discover which should be improved
first.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its past problems the Patriot remains a staple of US
defensive forces. Depending on outside temperature, it can take up
to 10 minutes to ready the missile to fire from its basic status.
But in units deployed near Iraq and North Korea, the missiles are
often kept on a ``hot'' alert status, eliminating the warmup time.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off seems to be a certain amount of wear on sensitive
electronic-components, which the Army has suspected based on
previous tests, Hays said. Sure enough, problems were discovered
when a batch of Patriots were taken apart at the Red River Army
Depot in Texas several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, wear was found in internal-guidance systems used
to link the missile with ground-based radar tracking the incoming
target missiles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing security issues, Hays and other Pentagon officials
declined to say exactly how many Patriots were taken out of service
and how many the Army has in all. Other countries that have
purchased the weapon or where Patriot batteries are manned by US
forces include Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Germany, the
Netherlands, Japan, and South Korea. The Pentagon said those
countries were told of the issue within the last 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon engineers are now reviewing the problem, and some of
the missiles might be test-fired at the White Sands, N.M., range to
see what impact the worn components might have on firing
operations, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Army must also estimate how much it would cost to fix
the problems and decide whether it would be worth saving the money
to spend on upgraded PAC-3 missiles instead. Until that decision is
made, the Army can't estimate the exact cost of the problem, said
Lieutenant General Paul Kern at a Washington press conference
Thursday. He added that the problematic components cost between
$80,000 to $100,000 in each missile.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Shea, spokesman for Raytheon in Lexington, Mass., said the
company didn't expect the problem to have a financial impact or to
affect foreign sales. Raytheon is currently producing a version of
the Patriot for the Greek armed forces.

 &HT;    Glock will mark pistols to aid tracing in crimes
 &HT;    By Brad Schrade
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Glock Inc. may have declined to join the settlement in
a federal lawsuit over handguns, but the company is already part of
a program that's a crucial part of the deal cut by Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   Glock and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
are engaged in a voluntary pilot program that would ``fingerprint''
every handgun the company assembles at its Cobb County
manufacturing plant. It would enable police to trace the owners of
guns used in crimes when only the bullets or casings are recovered.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its agreement with the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, one of the parties to the suit, Smith &AMP; Wesson,
has agreed to participate in the program _ if it can be shown to
work.
</P>
<P>
   When a gun is fired, it creates a unique mark on the bullet and
the shell casing. Under the Glock program, each gun will be fired
before it is sold, and the laser images of these markings will be
cataloged. These images will be compiled in an existing national
database known as Integrated Ballistic Identification System
(IBIS). The goal is to have a fingerprint of every gun that hits
the street.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the gun industry has been reluctant to assume
responsibility for connecting guns to the criminals who use them.
But more than half of all U.S. law enforcement departments use
Glock's sidearms. ``It's the right thing to do,'' said Jim Pledger,
Glock's national sales manager and a former FBI agent. ``We want to
meet in the middle. We want to be supportive of law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the concept has been greeted with skepticism by some
gun enthusiasts, who say it won't work because any criminal can
change the markings a gun makes within seconds. The government
should focus on keeping guns out of criminal hands and not waste
time cataloging gun marks, said Bill Powers, spokesman for the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole lot of people who have expressed concerns
about whether it has any real value,'' Powers said. ``It doesn't
take a whole lot of brain power or effort to change the markings.
There's not a criminal out there (who's) worried about this.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ATF says the program has the potential to help police
get a head start on investigations _ even without a suspect or a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   If police can match a shell that's been cataloged, by Glock or
another manufacturer, they could trace the gun back to its original
sale, said Tracy Hite, an ATF spokeswoman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the value of this to law enforcement,'' Hite said.
``It will give us the ability to pursue a criminal case without a
firearm in hand. Currently, in most cases (without an eyewitness),
the recovery of the firearm is critical to identifying the person
or persons involved in a violent crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The IBIS system started taking root in the early 1990s. Hite
said IBIS other related systems currently have 500,000 images
collected from shells or bullets collected at crime scenes. About
8,000 matches have been made from cold cases and about 16,000
criminal cases have been developed from the information.
</P>
<P>
   Hite said Glock initially only will catalog the markings on its
9 mm guns. The pilot program's main goal will be to test if it's
feasible to integrate with a production line. The system is to be
up and running in a few months. After nine months, the program will
be evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   And the gun industry that sells about 2 million handguns
annually in the United States will be eyeing the Glock program,
said Robert Delfay, president of National Shooting Sports
Foundation, the world's largest trade association for gun
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to skepticism over whether markings are a reliable
way of tracing guns, Delfay said, there is also a concern about
cost _ Who would pay for the system? The government is subsidizing
Glock's pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry position has been that we are supportive with
working with ATF to see if the system works and would be a viable
tool for law enforcement,'' Delfay said. ``If it is a viable tool
for law enforcement, we will do what we can to further
implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This industry is extremely responsible,'' Delfay said. ``They
realize while the ATF is a government agent it is somewhat removed
from the political motivations of the current administration. While
we're aware of the connection between the ATF and the Clinton
administration, we're not going to let that connection keep us from
cooperating with law enforcement.''

PATRIOTS CUT MOSS FOR BRUSCHI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Facing a $1.6 million cap hit on veteran
offensive lineman Zefross Moss's contract, the Patriots elected to
cut Moss to make room for linebacker Tedy Bruschi, whose two-year,
$3 million-plus deal became official once the Patriots made cap
space.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, 33, was arguably the Patriots' most consistent offensive
lineman the past three years, starting 42 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been speaking off and on with the Patriots for a few
weeks, so it's not shocking,'' said Moss's agent Don Cronson.
``These things happen, so we'll turn the chapter and move on to the
next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Cronson said the Patriots did not discuss a renegotiation of
Moss's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Moss was scheduled to earn $1 million this season, the final
year of his contract, and the team had already paid him a $100,000
roster bonus March 1. By cutting him now, the Patriots are
responsible for one-quarter of the $1.8 million signing bonus Moss
received when he signed his four-year, $5.2 million deal in 1997,
and the $100,000 roster bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots saved $1.05 million with the move, which they
applied toward Bruschi's cap hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have essentially replaced Moss at 50 percent of the
cost because they signed Grant Williams, whose cap hit is $850,000.
Moss has protected Drew Bledsoe very well on the right side. Now,
the Patriots will enter the season with three players _ Max Lane,
Williams, and Ed Ellis contending for the tackle jobs. If Bruce
Armstrong eventually returns, that means Williams, Ellis, and Lane
would vie for the right tackle job.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, who went undrafted out of Alabama State, has been in the
league since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zefross can still play and play at a high level,'' said
Cronson. ``I'm sure there are teams out there that would need a
veteran presence like Zefross, who is a model citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Israel can add the New Orleans Saints to the list of
teams, including the Giants and Seahawks, that are interested in
him. Agent Gary Uberstine said that despite the Patriots saying
they were moving ``closer'' to signing Israel last week, ``They
haven't made us an offer. I keep reading comments from them, but I
think they're trying to get Steve at a reduced rate.'' That
apparently won't happen any time soon.

FAMILY OF ROGER MARIS BATTLES WITH BUSCH
</HEADLINE>
  (mh) 
 By SANDRA L. NORTUNEN and LISE FISHER   
 The Gainseville (Fla.) Sun   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ For three years, the family of baseball
legend Roger Maris has been in a legal fight with one of the
largest beer distributors in the country _ Anheuser-Busch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a judge's ruling in a federal lawsuit is being played as a
win for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Maris family, which owns Maris Distributing Co. in
Gainesville, sued Anheuser-Busch in March 1997, claiming it
executed monopolistic practices and wrongfully terminated the Maris
company's wholesaler agreement, forcing the company to shut down.
Lawyers for the family have said the action was part of a pattern
of takeovers by Anheuser-Busch.
</P>
<P>
   Anheuser-Busch, which is based in St. Louis, said it ended its
agreement with Maris Distributing because the company was selling
outdated beer and was not meeting the requirements of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   On March 15, a judge from the U.S. District Middle Court of
Florida eliminated some points of the case and allowed others to
continue to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris was given the distributorship by August Busch Jr.,
who owned the beer company and the St. Louis Cardinals baseball
team, where Maris played in 1967 and 1968. The beer distributorship
is said to have been a reward to Maris for helping the Cardinals
win the 1967 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   An Orlando lawyer representing the Marises, Bernie Dempsey, said
the judge's decision allows the family to take Anheuser-Busch to
trial on at least one claim _ that contracts that conspire to
restrain trade or commerce are illegal. The ruling opens the door
to other similar lawsuits against Anheuser-Busch, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it a decision that is really favorable to Maris
Distributing, it is a decision that exposes Anheuser-Busch to the
possibility of lawsuits from any distributor who feels that
restrictions on public ownership has affected their ability to sell
their operations,'' Dempsey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is going to become a class-action suit,
but I can tell you that we have had a number of distributing
centers contact us about this since the case began,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Anheuser-Busch offered another spin on the judge's rulings.
The company said it was pleased with the judge's decision to
eliminate a separate claim of monopolistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court found that Anheuser-Busch Inc. had not attempted to
monopolize the market for beer distributorships,'' said a press
release from Royce J. Estes, vice president and deputy counsel for
the company. ``As to the remaining claim involving public ownership
of beer distributorships, the court found that this matter should
be resolved in trial. We are confident that the provisions in our
agreement with our beer wholesalers will be upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   The disputes between the Marises and Anheuser-Busch date to
1996, when the family declined Anheuser-Busch's offer of $20
million for the family's facilities in Gainesville and Ocala. The
family said the offer was less than fair market value.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey said the Maris family was instructed to sell their
operations, for which there was no other viable buyer. ``In August
1996, they were basically told to either get out of the business
immediately or they were going to be terminated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the family filed state and federal lawsuits,
Anheuser-Busch filed a countersuit, stopped delivering beer to
Maris Distributing and terminated its wholesaler agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The family operated facilities in Gainesville and Ocala for 30
years, employing more than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris died in 1985. His four sons _ Roger, Kevin, Randy
and Richard _ live in Gainesville, and his brother, Rudy, manages
the company, Dempsey said.
</P>
<P>
   After the plant was shut down, Berkhardt Distributors in St.
Augustine was awarded the new distributing contract for the
Gainesville market, and Bernie Little Distributorship of Eaton Park
took over the Ocala area.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY FINAL FOUR TEAMS SEEING FAMILIAR FACES

   You? Again?
</P>
<P>
   When Brown and Dartmouth face off this afternoon, it will be
their fourth meeting of the season. When Minnesota takes on
Minnesota-Duluth, it will be their sixth. A national title might be
at stake, but the semifinal pairings make it seem more like a
neighborhood game of pond hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to Boston to play the team that's 2 1/2 hours
away?'' chuckled University of Minnesota coach Laura Halldorson.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she or any of the other three coaches is complaining.
After all, they get to vie for the crown in the four-team American
Women's College Hockey Alliance 2000 Division 1 National Ice Hockey
tournament, so the chance to meet someone new is not a high
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another Ivy League game,'' said Brown coach Digit
Murphy of her appointment with Dartmouth, ``and the Ivy rivalry is
something you can't put away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown takes on Dartmouth at 5 p.m. in the first semifinal at
Northeastern's Matthews Arena, followed by Minnesota vs.
Minnesota-Duluth at 8.
</P>
<P>
   ECAC champion Brown (24-3-3) enters as the favorite, with
tournament MVP goaltender Ali Brewer coming off a 35-save
performance and everyone chipping in to shore up the scoring lost
when Tara Mounsey went down last month with a torn ACL. The Bears
are 3-0 this season against Dartmouth, beating them by scores of
1-0 and 6-1 in the regular season before their 6-3 victory in the
ECAC final last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Murphy sees in the Big Green quickness and
intensity, with good passing defensemen who can shoot from the
point, and a team without superstars that plays as a unit. ``That
team's playing for the front of the jersey,'' she said, ``not the
back.''
</P>
<P>
   That Dartmouth (20-11) is in the tourney at all is a surprise to
some, but three of its wins came when they counted the most:
against Harvard, including last Saturday's 3-2 overtime victory in
the league semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to be critical of it, fine,'' said Dartmouth
coach Judy Oberting of her team's selection, which was made by a
six-member committee after Sunday night's ECAC final. ``I don't
think we have a history of getting a lot of respect, period.'' This
season, her young team featured only one senior, who played
sparingly because of injury. ``People talk about us being the
no-names, the low-profiles. All along the talk was of Harvard and
Brown meeting for the national championship. We used that to our
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   If Dartmouth consists of the no-names, then Minnesota-Duluth has
the big names, certainly on the international scene. Led by US
Olympic forward Jenny Schmidgall, the nation's leading scorer (88
points on 39 goals and 49 assists) who transferred this season from
Minnesota, ex-Canadian Olympic coach Shannon Miller's team boasts
three other Olympians as well: Sweden's Erika Holst and Maria Rooth
and Finland's bronze-medal goaltender, Tuula Puputti. Its offense
is the most potent in the tournament, with three scorers among the
top six in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was a bit of a long shot,'' said Miller, asked if
she thought from the beginning that her team could make the
``frozen four'' in its debut season. ``But if I didn't know it was
possible, I wouldn't have set it as a goal.'' Did her opponents
think it was possible? ``I'm positive they didn't,'' replied
Miller. ``That's what makes it so fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that, despite the plethora of Olympians, her secret
is depth, especially her third line. ``They were huge in that final
game for us,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That final game'' was a 2-0 win over the University of
Minnesota to win the newly-formed Western Collegiate Hockey
Association tournament and earn an automatic bid to Boston. The
victory gave Duluth a 3-1-1 edge this season over the Gophers, who
before this season were pretty much the only game in the Midwest
when it came to Division 1 women's hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have another team in our league that strong is the best
thing that could happen,'' said Halldorson. ``Their program has
gotten a lot of national attention, which I think has benefitted
all of us in the Midwest.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota has some offense of its own, led by the nation's
leading goal-scorer (46) in Nadine Muzerall, and a defense that
includes senior Courtney Kennedy of Woburn and her sister, Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame Harvard couldn't be in it,'' said Murphy, ``but
you've got four teams who should put on a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, there will also be a Division 3 national
championship, in which Middlebury will face Augsburg (Minn.) in a
two-game series with a 15-minute ``mini-game'' as a tiebreaker if
necessary. Middlebury (22-2-0, including 18 shutouts) advances
after capturing its fifth-straight ECAC Division 3 title, while
Augsburg (21-5-1) won the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference tournament. The first game, which kicks off the
tournament, is Friday at 2.

STOCKS AND BONDS ADVANCE VIGOROUSLY AMID OPTIMISM ON RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks soared again Thursday as investors poured into
technology and financial shares in a bet that the Federal Reserve
is almost finished raising short-term interest rates. Similar
optimism fueled the Treasury bond market, as the price on the
30-year bond rose to its highest level since August.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 253.16 points, or 2.3
percent, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 1.6
percent. It was the tenth time since the beginning of February that
the Dow has gained or lost more than 200 points, a level that once
was eye-popping but has become almost routine.
</P>
<P>
   With very few companies having issued earnings warnings for the
first quarter, and interest rates dropping, investors are hungry
again for equities. Notably, the biggest, most liquid stocks were
the biggest gainers. Shares of companies like Microsoft, General
Electric and Cisco Systems, which all have billions of shares
outstanding, each gained more than 6 percent Thursday as investors
jumped into the mega-cap stocks that have performed so well for the
last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds also gained, with the interest rate on the 30-year
Treasury bond falling to 5.91 percent. The rally in bonds came as a
fight brewed Thursday between the Treasury Department and two
government-sponsored companies that help finance home mortgages.
Some analysts said safety-conscious institutional investors had
bought Treasury bonds and sold bonds of the two companies, Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, helping the Treasury market.
</P>
<P>
   Investor nervousness about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was not
confined to the companies' bonds. Shares in both companies stumbled
in morning trading Thursday, with Fannie Mae falling as low as $58
and Freddie Mac as low as $42.75.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have significant tax and regulatory
advantages over commercial and investment banks, and Treasury
Undersecretary Gary Gensler on Wednesday urged a congressional
committee to consider stripping the companies of many of those
benefits. A bill pending in the House of Representatives would
repeal a conditional line of credit that Fannie and Freddie have
with the U.S. Treasury. While the amount of money available is
relatively small compared to the size of the companies, Gensler
said that its repeal would make clear to investors that the
government does not stand behind the debt of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the two stocks ended the day higher after investors decided
that the odds are against Congress' significantly changing the way
the companies do business. Fannie Mae ended the day at $62.50, up
$0.640625, and Freddie Mac finished at $47, up 56.25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Posner, who covers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, said Congress is unlikely to pass legislation
that would raise borrowing costs for Fannie and Freddie, since
those increased costs would probably be passed on to consumers in
the form of higher mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, it's hard for me to see politically what
support this bill might have,'' Posner said. ``If legislative
momentum develops to make homeownership more difficult in the
United States, maybe Fannie and Freddie are at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bert Ely, who co-authored a paper released two weeks ago by
the American Enterprise Institute that argued against continuing
the subsidies for Fannie and Freddie, said investors would be wise
not to dismiss the prospect of Congressional action. As Fannie and
Freddie grow, with Fannie alone now issuing about $900 billion in
debt, the controversy will increase, Ely said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem that Fannie and Freddie have is the bigger they
get, the bigger a target they become,'' Ely said. The hubbub from
Gensler's comments ``will probably die down in the short term, but
there will be long-term repercussions from it,'' he predicted.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain on Thursday cast himself as a
vigorous campaigner for the Republican congressional majority and
insisted he was ``not interested in harming'' Gov. George W. Bush's
candidacy. At the same time, the Arizona senator left the door ajar
to another presidential run of his own four years from now.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong interview about his political plans, McCain
acknowledged several times that he was walking a ``very careful
line'' in trying to be loyal to his party while still remaining
true to the insurgent cause that attracted millions of new voters
to the Republican primaries this year.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of criticizing the party, as he did during his
campaign, McCain said he wanted to fight to change the Republican
Party from the inside. And he indicated that he was looking for a
rationale to support Bush that would allow him to go beyond dutiful
and distant assurances that he would stand by his party's
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Slouched in a chair in his Senate office and playing with a pen,
McCain said the difference between an endorsement of Bush and his
assurance this week that he would support his party's nominee was a
difference in ``the degree of enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's all kinds of ways, as you know, of, quote, supporting
the nominee,'' McCain said. ``I've always said I would, quote,
support.'' He said he needed to explore whether he and Bush shared
``fundamental agreements on things that allow me to express the
enthusiasm which I want to express. I mean, I'm not interested in
harming the candidate, any candidate of my party for president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said that in weighing an endorsement of
Bush, he also had to consider how the millions of people who had
been attracted to his candidacy would react. ``I don't want them to
pick up the newspaper and say, `Ehh, you know he's just like all
the rest.' I can't do that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican presidential
nominee, had been working to bring the two former rivals together.
He added, ``So it's a very careful line that I'm trying to walk and
that line is being nonconfrontational with the Bush people,
noncritical of Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the senator complimented Bush and said he had learned
from his rival that education was a more critical issue than he had
initially realized. And he praised Bush for displaying as governor
_ if not in the South Carolina primary _ a willingness to work with
Democrats and to try to broaden the base of the Republican Party.
And he said he did not have to agree with Bush on every issue.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, McCain indicated that he was well aware that
his role model Ronald Reagan gave no more than pro forma support to
President Gerald R. Ford after Ford defeated Reagan in the bitter
Republican primary fight of 1976. Ford lost the general election to
Jimmy Carter, and Reagan went on to win the presidency from Carter
four years later. McCain said, ``I would much prefer not to take
that route.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in contrast to remarks he made along the way on his
campaign bus, McCain did not rule out another presidential run,
even though he seemed uncertain whether he could recapture voter
enthusiasm a second time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain magic there,'' he said, ``The fervor, the
enthusiasm. You saw it. What's the shelf life of that? You don't
know.
</P>
<P>
   He said of another presidential race, ``You never say never. But
contemplation of another run right after this one _ I've got too
many other things to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain showed little ambivalence about his decision this week to
put his energy into campaigning for House and Senate Republicans
whose seats are considered vulnerable in November, whether or not
they support the ban on unlimited unregulated campaign
contributions that he calls the gateway to all other reforms in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't litmus-test these people,'' he said. ``We are
Republicans. We are all of the Republican Party. We share the same
philosophy and goals and goals. I would rather try to employ my
persuasive powers on them than say `OK, just because you don't
agree with me, I would rather have a Democrat.'''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he hoped that if he worked for other Republicans in
Congress they would be more receptive to his ideas. But he also
puckishly added that in politics, ``amnesia is a notorious disease
that I have seen manifested on many occasions.'' He laughed and
added, ``in fact, most recently in the last campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that even as he appealed to independents and Democrats
in his campaign, ``I never campaigned contemplating I'd become a
Democrat. I campaigned hoping that Democrats would support me just
as Democrats supported Ronald Reagan, recognizing that he wasn't
going to change his party affiliation or his core beliefs as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also defended his decision to create a political action
committee even though an earlier version of his campaign finance
legislation a few years ago had contained a ban on political action
committees.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his organization would only pay for his own travel
and that he would not accept the kind of big donations that he is
trying to ban, but only the limited donations allowed by the
election law. ``People in the reform movement understand that we
have to have some way of funding travel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain acknowledged that with an array of candidates now calling
themselves reformers, there was the danger of the ``debasement of
the word.'' And he said that he had to quickly ``put meat onto''
his call for a reform agenda, which includes changes in the
campaign finance law, the tax code, the Social Security system,
Medicare and the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have to prioritize those and try to achieve what's
achievable,'' he said. And he indicated that after a campaign
finance overhaul he was particularly interested in overhauling
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But then, asked whether Bush's proposal for a sweeping tax cut
could be squared with his own proposal to use a large share of the
surplus to pave the way for some Social Security payroll taxes to
be put into private retirement investment accounts, McCain lapsed
into a long silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I would be glad to entertain their proposals,'' the
senator said. ``But very frankly, I don't see the way you get there
without putting some money into the Social Security trust fund. So
that's one of the topics I want to discuss with Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to one of the most controversial moments in his
campaign, McCain staunchly defended the speech in which he called
two leaders of the Christian right ``agents of intolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to reject the leadership of Pat Robertson and
Jerry Falwell,'' he said, ``because of my fundamental conviction
that they were leading the party in the wrong direction.''

ARMY REPLACES HUNDREDS OF PATRIOT MISSILES AFTER DISCOVERING
DEFECT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Army said Thursday that it had replaced
hundreds of Patriot missiles protecting U.S. troops stationed in
Korea, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait after discovering a malfunction in
the missile's radio link.
</P>
<P>
   The Army also notified seven allied nations who operate Patriot
missile batteries of the problem, said Lt. Gen. Paul Kern, who made
the announcement at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The concern centered on missiles kept on full alert, or ``hot
status,'' for more than six months at a time and was discovered in
routine testing at the Red River Army Depot in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision a little over 10 days ago to actually
replace the missiles,'' Kern said.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, Israel, the Netherlands, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Japan
and Taiwan all have Patriot missiles, but Kern said the missiles in
those countries were on full alert for shorter periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot missiles replaced over the past 10 days are an
advanced version of those first used against Iraqi Scud missiles in
the 1991 Persian Gulf war. The decision to recall and replace the
missiles was first reported Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, the manufacturer, said that it was not liable for the
current problem because the so-called PAC-2 system offered only a
six-month warranty for keeping the missiles on a full alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty good handle on the components that are
failing,'' said David Shea, a Raytheon spokesman, ``but we have not
confirmed the exact cause of the problem yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot missiles are the sole protection against an enemy
missile attack for the 27,000 troops in Korea and 2,800 soldiers in
the Gulf region, and an Army spokesman said the replacements
provide full protection for the American bases. ``Our deployed
forces are not at risk,'' said the spokesman, Maj. Scott Hays.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was discovered when several of the missiles were
disassembled in routine checks at the army depot last fall.
Components of the radio link that allows the missile to communicate
with ground radar in tracking a target were found to be seriously
degraded.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said that missiles kept on full alert must be warm and
ready for use at a moment's notice. The heat, and intermittent
cooling periods, may account for the problem in the missile parts.
</P>
<P>
   After further testing and discussions with regional commanders
who oversee the Patriot batteries, the army decided to replace the
missiles that had been on full alert long past the six-month
warranty period.
</P>
<P>
   Kern said the cost of replacing the components alone was $80,000
to $100,000 for each missile, but he could not estimate the total
cost for the repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has enough missiles and component parts to replace the
suspect missiles in its arsenal but is uncertain whether the supply
is large enough to cover requests for replacements from the allies.
Japan, however, produces its own Patriots, Hays said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon and the Army are producing a new version of the
missile, a PAC-3 system that will be available next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe this will have an adverse impact on our
foreign sales or on our stock prices,'' said Shea, noting only a
slight dip in the company's stock price Thursday.

FIRST ROMAN CATHOLIC HOUSE CHAPLAIN SWORN IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending a bitter fight that melded the contentious
arenas of politics and religion, the House swore in the first Roman
Catholic priest ever to serve as House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of the Rev. Daniel Coughlin of Chicago follows
an acrimonious, four-month controversy that had Catholic,
Democratic House members accusing Republicans of anti-Catholic
bias.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan nominating committee last fall had voted a
Catholic, the Rev. Timothy O'Brien, as the top choice for House
chaplain, but House leaders instead selected a Presbyterian
minister, the Rev. Charles Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Wright Thursday withdrew from consideration, and House Speaker
J. Dennis Hastert, clearly angry at the partisan and personal
upheaval caused by the controversy, announced on the House floor
that he would name Coughlin in Wright's place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a more ugly and destructive political
campaign,'' Hastert, an Illinois Republican, told the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of this chaplain issue over the last four months
does not appear to be constrained by common decency,'' Hastert
said. ``It looks a lot like war, and it has an ugly face.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats noted the historical significance of swearing in
the first Catholic to the post of House chaplain. But they were
muted in their pleasure over their political victory, saying the
House needed to change the way it selected a chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process that got us here was so flawed, I don't think
there's anyone who's cackling with satisfaction,'' said
Representative Richard Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and a Roman
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very sorry it has come to this point,'' a solemn House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt told his colleagues on the House
floor.
</P>
<P>
   The post of chaplain is a mainly ceremonial job, which pays
about $131,000 a year, and has not traditionally been politicized.
But the selection of a chaplain to replace a Lutheran pastor, the
Rev. James Ford, who had held the job for 21 years, became mired in
politics in a Congress still smarting from the partisan impeachment
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of partisanship and a lot of distrust here in
the House,'' said Representative James P. McGovern, Democrat of
Massachusetts. ``One of the things I had hoped would happen when
Speaker Hastert took over was that he would work toward ending the
politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party also has been put on the defensive over the
issue of Bob Jones University, a private school whose leaders have
made anti-Catholic comments. Republican presidential contender
George W. Bush drew Democratic ire when he spoke at the South
Carolina school in February.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sources said Hastert held a meeting with Coughlin in
Chicago on Monday, the Associated Press reported. The following
day, he met privately with Wright, who signaled his intention to
withdraw. Coughlin was offered the job, only hours before his
appointment, and he flew to Washington almost immediately, the AP
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright withdrew, Hastert said because he ``did not want to serve
as the chaplain in a divided House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not allow this House to be torn apart and the office of
chaplain to be destroyed,'' Hastert told his colleagues as he put
Coughlin's name up for a vote. Coughlin, the vicar for priests in
the Chicago archdiocese, was given a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan, 18-member panel had winnowed a field of 38
candidates last year to three, including O'Brien and Wright. During
the vetting process, Democrats had been told that O'Brien was asked
what they considered offensive questions, such as whether O'Brien,
unmarried, could show that he was ``moral.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the selection committee, Democrats reported,
indicated they were ``uncomfortable'' with having a chaplain who
would walk the halls of the Capitol in a priest's collar and
vestment.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives J. Joseph Moakley, Democrat of Massachusetts,
and McGovern, both Catholics, sent a letter to Hastert in December,
asking him to explain why O'Brien was passed over. While the letter
did not explicitly accuse the Republicans of bias, it did note that
``it has been nearly 40 years since John F. Kennedy fought bigotry
and prejudice on his way to the White House. We are saddened that
the progress America has made toward religious tolerance and
inclusion does not seem to have reached the halls of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley said, ``I think Hastert probably did the only thing he
could do'' in naming a Catholic. ``This was a good way for him to
get out of it. I'm just glad it's resolved.''

 &HT;    Coke fills newly created post of diversity director
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's no question Doug Daft is moving quickly on
diversity issues. The only question is whether Coca-Cola's new
chairman is moving quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Daft told employees Thursday that he is promoting Juan Johnson
to the newly created position of vice president and director of
diversity strategies. Johnson, a 42-year-old Atlanta resident, will
report directly to Daft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his new position, Juan will be responsible for developing
and executing company strategies for building, maintaining and
leveraging diversity throughout our business system,'' Daft said in
an internal memo. ``Diversity is a clear business imperative for
our company and will continue to be a top priority for me.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the company's second promotion of an African-American to
a key position this week. On Wednesday, Coretha Rushing was
appointed head of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments come as former and current black employees
organize a bus ride ``for justice'' from Atlanta to next month's
annual shareholders meeting in Wilmington, Del., to pressure the
company into settling an increasingly controversial racial
discrimination suit.
</P>
<P>
   The planned three-bus convoy has caught the attention of both
Wall Street and the national media, increasing the stakes for the
world's largest soft drink company at a time when Daft has made
several moves to try to get this matter behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has he appointed new heads of diversity and human
resources, but he has said that he will be linking his success and
compensation _ as well as his managers' _ to meeting
soon-to-be-established diversity goals. He also said that
additional diversity initiatives will be announced shortly.
</P>
<P>
   But has Daft moved rapidly enough?
</P>
<P>
   In late January, the federal judge in the discrimination case
indicated that he would be ordering settlement talks, which he did
in early February. Yet the first face-to-face negotiating sessions,
which are being facilitated by a mediator, are currently scheduled
for April 17 and 18 _ only one day before the shareholders meeting
in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said it could be damaging for Coca-Cola's image
if the planned rally at the annual meeting gets widespread national
publicity and, possibly, around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discrimination case has been elevated from a regional
issue to a more important issue receiving heightened national
coverage,'' said Scott Wilkins, an analyst for Deutsche Bank.
``Now, more than ever, it is incumbent to settle the matter,
because clearly the plaintiffs have pushed this thing into a higher
gear ... Clearly, Coke is in a no-win situation, and any company
which is primarily a marketing company will do its utmost to
expedite a settlement in a case like this.''
</P>
<P>
   To press their case for a quick settlement, about 150 former and
current African-American employees will travel to rallies in
Greensboro, N.C., Richmond, Va., and Washington, D.C., before
reaching Wilmington. Organizers will discuss plans for the bus trip
Saturday at St. Phillip AME Church in Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   The key organizer of the ride, former human resources manager
Larry Jones, said Daft's appointments of Johnson and Rushing don't
go far enough to address concerns about the company's treatment of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have simply lost our tolerance for tokenism and
symbolism,'' Jones said. ``Those days are gone. It's time now for
some genuine fundamental discussions that will actually deal with
issues _ including settling the lawsuit and implanting structural
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also has talked about possibly calling for a national
boycott of Coca-Cola products in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts likely will ask Daft questions about the prospects for
settling the suit when he addresses them April 4 in New York. ``You
don't want to see it get to the point of a national boycott,'' said
analyst Bill Pecoriello of Sanford Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkins and some other analysts point out that Daft has done a
great deal on diversity since effectively taking over the company
in December, when M. Douglas Ivester announced that he would
prematurely retire as chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to judge the company too harshly because they have
been undergoing a change in management,'' Wilkins said. ``Doug Daft
is not sitting on his hands on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed by eight current and former employees,
alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against African-Americans
in pay, promotions and performance evaluations. The plaintiffs are
seeking class-action status so they can represent about 2,000
current and former black salaried employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the suit's allegations and opposed
plaintiffs' efforts to make it a class-action case.

 &HT;    The rave: At unconventional parties, devotees express themselves
through a rousing mix of dance, technology and spirituality
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The pulpit, altar and pews are gone from ``the
Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone too from this stately building near Turner Field in
southwest Atlanta, is the choir calling the faithful to worship. In
its place, turntable wizards keep late-night crowds dancing until
daylight in a fog-filled sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Votive candles that once burned softly have given way to glow
sticks floating in the darkness like Technicolor popsicles.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sacramental wine. But it's easy to find $25 tabs of
the designer drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   The Church is the site of weekly rave, high-energy parties that
for thousands of metro Atlanta young people have become unbridled
expressions of music, dance, technology and touchy-feely
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Seven nights a week, ravers attend parties at the Church,
formally known as Celebration Hall, or other venues such as the
Atrium, Studio Central, MJQ, the Masquerade and the International
Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Raves are unlike bars or alcohol-based parties; no one goes to a
rave to get drunk or picked up. Instead, ravers say they are
seeking PLUR _ an acronym for ``peace, love, unity and respect.''
For ravers, PLUR is gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my Sabbath, this is where my family is,'' says Stephen
Thomas, a lanky 20-year-old from Marietta, Ga., who goes by the
rave name DogFrequency. ``We're all just smiling strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about freedom of expression,'' says Dia ``D-Girl''
Ganblin, 20, of Atlanta. ``It's about being free and being
spiritual. For us, it's almost religious.''
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Shahan, 19, of Kennesaw, Ga., used to attend church
services with his family but has never been religious. A raver
since he was 14, he says PLUR has given him all the spiritual
guidance he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We reflect the unity in a society that is all messed up,''
said Shahan, who goes by the DJ name X-tastyle. ``There's no hate.
It's all love. The party reflects what the world should be more
like.''
</P>
<P>
   Raves in some form have been around for years, but they've grown
from semiprivate, underground affairs into gatherings that are
openly promoted.
</P>
<P>
   They surfaced in England in the mid-'80s, then were exported to
the pop-culture capitals of America: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles
and Miami. Finally they caught on in other cities and college
towns.
</P>
<P>
   As the parties got bigger and more visible, they sometimes
attracted unwanted attention. Concerns about drug use have led to
crackdowns and curfews recently in Savannah, Orlando, Tampa and
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, promoters have been throwing parties for about 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   These days digitally designed fliers advertising parties are
handed out at popular record stores, and rave promoters sometimes
hire off-duty cops to help with security.
</P>
<P>
   Raves can be as small as 100 people or larger than 2,000. Ticket
prices usually range from $15 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   Though professionally promoted, raves still have a back-alley
mystique.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these individuals tend to come from suburban areas
where they don't have a lot of nightlife,'' says Lt. Stan Savage of
the Atlanta Police Department, who keeps tabs on the rave scene.
``They come to the city to have a good time, and it gives them a
sense of living on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, raves are a chance to break out of a lifetime of
scheduled playgroups, parent-controlled little leagues and rigidly
structured extracurricular activities. A rave purposely defies
structure. The dress code, for instance, can be distilled into a
single word: ``whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Some partygoers are shirtless, others wear tank tops and chinos.
Super-sized surfboard jeans, Airwalk sneakers and ball caps twisted
to the back are de rigueur, but don't be surprised to see someone
sporting a three-piece suit either.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-gallon cowboy hats are cool. Giant monarch butterfly wings
hooked on your back? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   At one recent rave, a man standing about 6-foot-4 wore a
sparkling, all-white jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The rave scene _ in principle, at least _ knows no color, ethnic
or sexual barriers. Though predominantly white, most parties have a
smattering of blacks, Asians and Latinos in attendance. At the
Church recently, the sight of two young women smooching didn't
cause a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Scott ``Cyborg'' Buchmann, 17, of Alpharetta, Ga., says he's
half-Puerto Rican ``and half crazy.'' When he goes raving, he
spends the night break dancing, spinning like a madman on his
hands, knees and back. ``You know how I learned to do this?'' he
asks proudly after a sweat-drenched performance. ``I went on the
Internet and taught myself.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech hippies?
</P>
<P>
   Ravers' four-letter creed, PLUR, evokes the ``make love, not
war'' chants of '60s flower children. Their use of drugs and
disdain for some social conventions likewise follow a
countercultural path trod by the beatniks and hippies.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Walsh, 18, of Cullowhee, N.C., sounds like a refugee from
the Summer of Love when explaining why he's driven three hours to
attend a rave at the International Ballroom in DeKalb County. ``You
know these people are your brothers and your sisters,'' he says.
``You could just feel the good vibes coming off the flier.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet ravers diverge from earlier countercultures when it comes to
their attitude toward the world at large. Most ravers are not
trying to change the world, just trying to find a place in it for
their parties.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike hippies, who rejected technology, ravers embrace it.
Their music and slick party fliers are computer-enhanced
masterpieces. Ravers often use their e-mail addresses as party
nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's harder to be special today. It's hard to feel like you
can make a dent in society,'' says Joe Figura, 26, a longtime raver
who works for an Atlanta investment firm as a computer
troubleshooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that a lot of things people told us about things
like college are a complete scam,'' Figura says. ``I don't want to
wake up when I'm 50 and be locked into a life or a job I can't
stand.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to get a fix on the rave scene is to consider it the
anti-Buckhead (Atlanta's yuppie entertainment district).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go to Buckhead, you have to worry about how you look
and who's looking at you,'' says James Chase, 24, a journalism
student at Georgia Perimeter College. ``I have never seen a fight
at a rave. You go to Buckhead, and there are 30 or 40 fights every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   While police have occasionally shut down raves and made drug
arrests, the parties haven't become a major public safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are parties out there, and we act on them when
we get information about drug use,'' says APD's Savage. ``But it's
not an epidemic. We don't need a rave party task force. As we get
information and evaluate it, we'll see if there is a need to
increase our enforcement efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministers of music
</P>
<P>
   There is no pecking order among partygoers, but DJs rule the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are about a natural energy that flows through the
music,'' Figura says. ``That's why the DJ is such a god, because he
sets the tone. He gets everybody on the same level.''
</P>
<P>
   To ravers, DJs such as Sasha, Danny Tha Wildchild and Rabbit in
Tha Moon are more than just platter pickers. They are highly
sought-after artists who travel around the world creating sonic
landscapes from spinning vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   DJs can earn as little as a few hundred dollars to as much as
$30,000 for a three-hour set, plus expenses. Most raves feature
three or more DJs in separate rooms playing a particular specialty,
such as trance, breakbeat, house, drum and bass, or jungle.
</P>
<P>
   T.C. Izlam, aka The Funky Alien, is ``hip-hop junglist'' _
representing a cross-bred style influenced by hip-hop, soul and
reggae. A typical set by Izlam includes samples from Mary J. Blige,
Queen, Frank Sinatra, Alvin and the Chipmunks and an organ riff
from the ``Batman'' theme song.
</P>
<P>
   After spinning and rapping at a packed party at the Atrium in
DeKalb County, Izlam describes his role: ``When you're standing
there in front of the crowd, you're like a minister. I have to
abduct everyone in the party. It's like the apocalypse is happening
right there, and you feel like a god on that stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Night at the rave
</P>
<P>
   Despite being mostly alcohol-free, some parties are advertised
as ``18 and older.'' That doesn't stop underage ravers who use fake
IDs.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering, all partygoers are frisked from head-to-toe and
asked to empty their pockets, purses and backpacks for weapons and
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, it helps to have plenty of cash. Small bottles of
water sell for $3, and a pack of chewing gum costs about a buck.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more expensive items for sale are $6 glow sticks _
plastic tubes of luminescent liquid. Ravers attach them to string
and swing them furiously around their bodies, creating arcs of
ghostly neon light. Others put glow sticks between their fingers
and perform hypnotic hand dances for fellow ravers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to see ravers wearing surgical masks or paper
dust filters, which keep out airborne dust kicked up by dancers and
smoke emitted by fog machines. Ravers sometimes slip tiny glow
sticks underneath the masks, adding to the already eerie effect.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother asking somebody to dance _ it's considered
declasse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, everyone on the dance floor is bound together by a
convulsive, chest-rattling bass beat and clangorous synthesizer
riffs that can reach ear-shattering levels.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to hold a conversation near the dance floor is futile.
``People talk, but it doesn't usually go beyond a greeting or
acknowledgment of someone you saw at another party,'' says Eddie
Ku, 30, of Atlanta. ``People come to dance, not to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Limber bodies twist and contort to the electrified rhythms as
their movements blur in hyperkinetic frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a zone you go into where everything disappears,'' says
Adriana Chiknas, 18, of Decatur, Ga. ``It's just you and the music.
There's nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Raving and rolling
</P>
<P>
   It's common to see ravers chewing on baby pacifiers, sucking on
sour gumballs, or downing bottled water. Not all of them are simply
satisfying their thirst or a sweet tooth.
</P>
<P>
   Some are using Ecstasy, or X, a synthetic drug that produces a
mildly hallucinogenic high similar to amphetamines. It's usually
sold in tablets imprinted with corporate logos or cartoon
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Pacifiers, candy and gum are sometimes used to keep those
``rolling'' on X from grinding their teeth when the drug kicks in _
a common side effect. Users may have a glassy, heavy-lidded stare
and slur their words. The drug also tends to dehydrate users,
leaving them with a strong craving for water.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy gives off a garlicky scent. If a critical mass of ravers
is rolling on X, the smell wafts upward on waves of pungent
perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   The candy helps freshen a user's breath, and some ravers sniff
Vicks nasal inhalers, a practice that is said to help increase the
drug's potency.
</P>
<P>
   Ravers sometimes sit in ``cuddle puddles,'' small clusters on
the floor, massaging one another's shoulders and backs in a gesture
of solidarity that also enhances the drug's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Users say X makes them feel sensual, but not sexual. The feeling
has been compared to a warm, almost electric buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's PLUR to the utmost,'' says Judd ``Lizard'' Martin, 20, of
Roswell, Ga. ``You want to talk to everybody and touch everybody.
It's an all-over good feeling, but it's nothing like alcohol or
pot.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravers say the use of X is widespread, and many acknowledge
trying it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer admit to using GHB _ a cheaper illegal drug nicknamed
``Georgia Home Boy.'' A colorless liquid, GHB is sometimes called
the ``date-rape drug,'' because it can be slipped into a drink to
incapacitate a sexual-attack target.
</P>
<P>
   Both X and GHB can be lethal, and overdose cases are common in
Atlanta emergency rooms. ``On Friday and Saturday nights, emergency
rooms in urban areas can easily see 20 a night,'' says Dr. Robert
Geller, director of the Georgia Poison Center. The most common
sources, Geller says, are raves and gay bars.
</P>
<P>
   At a rave in November at the Nike Pavilion, nine people were
taken to Grady Memorial Hospital after overdosing on GHB. One of
the victims, a young man, collapsed in a heap. A young woman rushed
to him, lifted her shirt and rubbed his face in her bare breasts in
an effort to keep him conscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done this before, and that usually wakes them up,'' said
the woman, who would only identify herself as Carla. ``I'm sure
he'll live through this.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, a group of Atlanta promoters formed the Atlanta
Alliance to promote PLUR and to combat drugs. The Alliance began
handing out leaflets to ravers alerting them to the dangers of
Ecstasy, GHB and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to get like other cities that have anti-rave
laws,'' said Christian Long, one of the founders of the Alliance.
``We have a flourishing scene, and it's well-respected, and we want
to keep it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray of `Sunshine'
</P>
<P>
   At the Church, Jessica Bowie, 19, of Marietta, Ga., is dressed
up as a Catholic schoolgirl, complete with pigtails, a plaid skirt,
knee socks and black patent leather shoes. Bowie, who goes by the
nickname ``Sunshine,'' is a candy raver, a type of partygoer known
for outrageous costumes and goody bags filled with sweets,
whistles, bubbles, Slinkies and other knickknacks that they give
away.
</P>
<P>
   She offers to give a stranger a back rub with an electric
massager. Her gesture, in many ways, sums up her feelings about the
rave scene that she has made her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want everybody to feel good,'' Sunshine says. ``I've
never seen somebody leave a party mad. That's why we're here, isn't
it? To love each other and feel good.''

 &HT;    TB Day set to raise awareness
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One jumbo jet full of people, crashing every hour on the hour,
every day, for a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's the human toll of tuberculosis on the world. Every year,
8 million people acquire the lung-destroying illness, and more than
2 million die. Overall, up to one-third of the world's population
may be infected by the bacterium, though they do not all have
active disease _ the time when it damages the body and can be
easily spread.
</P>
<P>
   Today is World TB Day, a United Nations-sponsored initiative
that hopes to focus international attention on the persistence of
TB. But if you think that requires imagining Indian cities and
African villages, Georgia health workers suggest you think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas we could go into in Atlanta that have rates of
tuberculosis similar to developing countries,'' said Dr. Henry
Blumberg, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University
School of Medicine. ``In the city of Atlanta, the TB rate is five
times the national average.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, TB cases have been declining since the early 1990s.
But last year in Georgia, cases began to rise again, from 631 cases
to 666, according to the state Division of Public Health. Georgia
is among the nation's 10 worst states for rates of TB.
</P>
<P>
   TB is a disease of poverty; Southern states have a
disproportionate share of U.S. cases. It is also a disease
associated with immigration; roughly two of every five cases
nationally (one of five in Georgia) occur in someone who was born
outside the United States. In Atlanta, that has meant TB infection
among immigrants who do landscaping and construction work, as well
as in graduate students who go home for vacations to countries with
high rates of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we are an international city, we need to have a
heightened awareness and diligence about finding people who are
infected and getting them the treatment they need,'' said Dr. Eric
Benning of the Fulton County Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   TB develops slowly and takes a long time, six months at least,
to treat _ two factors that make it difficult to tackle and to
lobby for. This week, Reps. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Connie
Morella (R-Md.) introduced a bill in Congress that calls for a $100
million contribution to international TB control programs.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Georgia advocates have called for the state to
expand Medicaid coverage to TB patients, a move that could bring an
additional $2 million in matching funds to the state each year.

 &HT;    Sanders out front in Southern All Stars circuit
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ronnie Sanders enters Saturday's race at Peach State
Speedway in Jefferson hoping to pad his points lead in the Southern
All Stars stock-car circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, from Fayetteville, won the opener at Birmingham
International Raceway and has recorded two top-five finishes in
non-SAS races. He credits his car-builder, Frankie Grill, and his
engine-builder, Gary Dingler.
</P>
<P>
   Other local drivers in the 200-lap race include Dawsonville's
Ricky Turner, Johnny Henderson from Conyers and Scott Griffin from
Tyrone. Qualifying is at 5:30 p.m., the main event at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unexpected win: Jody Coltrane went to Seven Flags Speedway
last Saturday to work on his brother's pit crew and wound up
winning the feature race. Coltrane ran into car owner Sonny
Blackwell, who asked if he wanted to drive a spare car. After
borrowing a firesuit and a helmet, Coltrane qualified second and
won the race.
</P>
<P>
   _ ASA changes: The American Speed Association opens this weekend
in Lakeland, Fla., with radical rules changes. The $30,000 racing
engines have been replaced with power plants built on the assembly
line. And B.F. Goodrich will make its return to the stock-car tire
business.

<P>
   An important piece of the global-warming picture has come into
clearer focus with a confirmation by scientists that the world's
oceans have soaked up much of the warming of the last four decades,
delaying its full effect on the atmosphere and thus on climate.
</P>
<P>
   The warming of the deep oceans had long been predicted, and the
consequent delaying effect had long been thought to exist. But
until now the ocean's heat absorption had not been definitively
demonstrated, and it rate and magnitude had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The new finding, by scientists at the National Oceanographic
Data Center in Silver Spring, Md., is based on an analysis of 5.1
million individual measurements, by instruments around the world,
of the top two miles of ocean waters from the mid-1950s to the
mid-1990s. The analysis, the first on a global scale, is being
published Friday in the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   As the earth warms, from either natural or human causes, or
both, not all the extra heat goes immediately into the atmosphere,
where its effect on climate is most direct. Much of it is absorbed
by the oceans, which store it for years or decades before releasing
it.
</P>
<P>
   This means that to whatever extent the planet is being warmed by
emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide,
which are produced by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas,
only part of that heating has materialized so far at and above the
earth's surface. Some experts believe that about half the
greenhouse warming produced so far is still in the oceanic pipeline
and will inevitably percolate to the air in the decades just ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The average surface temperature of the globe has risen by about
1 degree Fahrenheit over the last 100 years. Over the last 25
years, the rate of surface warming has accelerated, amounting to
the equivalent of about 3.5 degrees a century. By comparison, the
world is 5 to 9 degrees warmer now than in the depths of the last
ice age, 18,000 to 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists generally agree that it is unclear how much of the
warming is attributable to increasing greenhouse gases and how much
to natural causes; many think both are involved.
</P>
<P>
   The new study shows that the average warming of the seas over
the 40-year study period amounted to about one-tenth of a degree
Fahrenheit for the top 1.9 miles of ocean water as a whole, and
more than half a degree in about the top 1,000 feet. That, experts
said, is roughly as great a warming as computerized models of the
climate system say it should be, given the estimated magnitude of
outside influences on the climate system like the heat-trapping
gases and solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the ocean may now be giving up to the
atmosphere some of the heat it stored in the early part of the
study period, but this has not been established, said Sydney
Levitus, the chief author of the study. He is the director of the
Ocean Climate Laboratory, part of the data center at Silver Spring,
which in turn is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Levitus said, it is possible but not established that
more frequent appearances of the phenomenon known as El Nino, a
semi-periodic warming of the eastern tropical Pacific that disrupts
weather around the world, are related to the generally warming
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Levitus and colleagues collected temperature data gathered by
scientists who lower thermometers into the depths. Over the last
seven years, they fed the data into computers and then extracted
the warming pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the oceanic warming surprised some experts.
One, Dr. Peter Rhines, an oceanographer and atmospheric scientist
at the University of Washington in Seattle, said it appeared
roughly equivalent to the amount of heat stored by the oceans as a
result of seasonal heating in a typical year. ``That makes it a big
number,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James E. Hansen, a climate expert at the NASA Goddard
Institute for Space Studies in New York, said the finding was
important because, ``in my opinion, the rate of ocean heat storage
is the most fundamental number for our understanding of long-term
climate change.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Hansen and colleagues used a computer model to
calculate the amount of warming that should have been produced up
till then by external influences on the climate system like
greenhouse gases and solar radiation. They found that because of
the storage of heat in the ocean, only about half the surface
warming should have appeared. Levitus and his fellow researchers
say in their Science paper that their findings support the Hansen
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Levitus said the cause of the oceanic warming was not
clear, although ``I believe personally that some of it is due to
greenhouse gases.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe that natural factors like recurring
oscillations in ocean surface temperature in various parts of the
world may play a role in the last century's warming. For example,
earlier studies by Dr. Gerard Bond of Columbia University's Lamont
Doherty Earth Observatory found that the climate of the North
Atlantic region, at least, had alternated between cooler and warmer
every 1,500 years, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   The world may be entering one of the natural warming cycles now,
say Bond and Dr. Charles D. Keeling, a climate expert at the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego. In a study
published this week in the online edition of Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, Keeling suggested that a natural
fluctuation in ocean tides over hundreds of years might contribute
to these long-term cycles of warming and cooling. Other possible
causes have also been suggested.
</P>
<P>
   If the world is entering a new warm cycle, Keeling said, that
does not rule out the possibility of greenhouse warming. In fact,
he said, a combination of natural heating and the greenhouse effect
could combine to push the world into an episode of rapid warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to look out for the period just ahead,'' he said.

REFORM RABBIS EXPECTED TO SUPPORT SAME-SEX WEDDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a historic move that will place them at the center of a
debate now roiling the nation's religious organizations, America's
Reform rabbis are expected to give their official support next week
to ceremonies, including weddings, that bless the relationships of
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, scheduled to take place Wednesday in Greensboro, N.C.,
would make the rabbis the first group of mainstream American clergy
to endorse same-sex ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Although individual clergy from a variety of liberal religious
groups, including Reform Judaism, already are performing such
ceremonies without sanction by their national organizations,
advocates for gay rights are hailing the expected vote by the
Central Conference of American Rabbis as a milestone in the
struggle by gays and lesbians for acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how to treat gay and lesbian couples is one of
the hottest social issues currently vexing not only Judaism, but
also a number of Christian denominations. Later this year the
Episcopal, Presbyterian and United Methodist churches each are
expected to debate the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays and lesbians . . . have been subjected to implicit and
explicit signals from society, including religious groups, that
they were in some way sinful, not healthy, abnormal,'' said Rabbi
Paul Menitoff, executive vice president of the Central Conference
of American Rabbis, which represents 1,800 Reform clergy. ``This
kind of resolution being passed by a major religious group will
send a signal that will be important to Jewish gays and lesbians
and beyond, a signal that they're not viewed as sinful, but as
normal, healthy people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform movement, the largest in American Judaism, has taken
the lead on liberalizing both ritual and political practices.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have now banned gay marriages, but Vermont lawmakers
are poised to define a new legal status called civil unions for
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the primary reasons people do not support same-sex
marriage as a public policy matter is because of deeply held
religious views,'' said David M. Smith, communications director for
the Human Rights Campaign, a Washington-based gay rights group.
``As religious institutions support civil unions, it helps dispel
some of the mythology and take away some of the fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The rabbis' resolution is vaguely worded, and is still being
modified to acknowledge the concerns of some critics. But in the
resolution, which Menitoff said he expects to pass, the rabbis
resolve that same gender relationships are ``worthy of affirmation
through appropriate Jewish ritual'' and it calls on the rabbis'
organization to develop educational and liturgical resources for
same-gender ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution does not require rabbis to perform ceremonies,
nor does it specify what kind of ceremony might be performed, but
rabbis say the ceremonies already being performed range from the
simple blessing of a new home, to a makeshift commitment ceremony,
to a full-fledged wedding with the traditional recitation of seven
blessings, exchange of vows under a canopy, and the smashing of a
glass.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution allows each rabbi to decide whether to officiate
at a ceremony and calls on other rabbis to support such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Reform rabbis have been engaged in heated debate via several
Internet discussion groups; some have threatened to walk out of
next week's meeting during the vote, while others are discussing
the formation of a traditionalist caucus within the Reform rabbis'
organization to advocate for conservative standards on conversion,
dietary practices and same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Already, an estimated 500 Reform Jewish rabbis and numerous
United Church of Christ ministers are performing same-gender
ceremonies without fear of reprisal from their national
organizations, and in eastern Massachusetts Episcopal Bishop M.
Thomas Shaw is authorizing same-sex ceremonies on a case-by-case
basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Unitarian Universalist Association, a religious organization
that does not profess a particular set of theological beliefs,
voted to endorse same-sex marriages in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In some other denominations, individual clergy have performed
same-sex ceremonies but some have been fired or otherwise
disciplined as a result.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic Church is actively involved in the fight
against gay marriage, and last year the Vatican ordered an end to a
ministry to gays by an American priest and nun. The United
Methodists last year found two ministers guilty of violating church
law for blessing a gay marriage but then this year dismissed a
complaint against 68 ministers who officiated at a ceremony for a
lesbian couple.
</P>
<P>
   Within each church the issue of how to treat gays and lesbians
is hotly disputed. The three Protestant denominations, Episcopal,
Presbyterian and United Methodist, that take up the issue this
year, will be debating a variety of resolutions on policies
affecting gays.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's vote by the Central Conference of American Rabbis, a
111-year-old association, comes 10 years after the same group
endorsed ordination of gays and lesbians. In 1972, the Reform
movement became the first Jewish denomination to ordain women.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time the Reform movement came around to ordaining
women, lots of Protestant denominations had been ordaining women
for a long time, and American society had become so egalitarian
there was a sense one was catching up with the larger culture,''
said Jonathan D. Sarna, a professor of American Jewish history at
Brandeis University. ``But the larger culture is still divided on
the issue of gay marriages, and as a result this issue is more
divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay Jews are welcoming the expected vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Jew, I really wanted to bring in the rituals that have
been important to me my whole life _ as I was bat mitzvahed and
confirmed, I wanted to have a wedding,'' said Tamara Indianer, 32,
of Arlington, Mass., who had a Jewish wedding with another woman.
``Although my partner and I have since split up, it was very
important to me to have my friends and family support our union as
I supported their heterosexual unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Margie Chebotariov, 39, of Miami Beach, agreed. The daughter of
a conservative cantor, she said she wanted Jewish ritual to be part
of her relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bit of support we can get on any level, especially on a
religious level, is important,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents argue that the resolution violates the teachings of
the Torah, is out of step with American public opinion, will harm
nascent Reform Jewish movements in Israel and Russia, and will
undermine rabbis who do not want to perform interfaith heterosexual
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jewish movements are unhappy with the Reform rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctification of a marriage between two people of the
same sex would not be appropriate,'' said Rabbi Jerome M. Epstein,
executive vice president of The United Synagogue of Conservative
Judaism. ``The Torah clearly prohibits that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Steven M. Dworken, executive vice president of the
Rabbinical Council of America, which represents Orthodox rabbis,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible mistake because they're separating
themselves from that which has been normative Jewish practice since
the beginning with Adam and Eve,'' Dworken said. ``This
sanctification of same-sex unions unfortunately establishes a
tremendous rift between the traditional segments of Judaism and the
Reform movement.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PROBES MISSING WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has begun a criminal
investigation into the disappearance of thousands of White House
e-mail messages that had been subpoenaed in campaign-finance and
other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations will also look into allegations, made at
congressional hearings Thursday, that White House officials warned
contractors to keep quiet about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mails were sought during congressional and judicial
inquiries into campaign fund-raising abuses in the 1996
presidential campaign, among other criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's involvement, disclosed Thursday in
court papers, helps resurrect the campaign-finance scandal, which
White House officials had hoped was behind them. GOP presidential
candidate George W. Bush Thursday quickly weighed in on the
controversy, which is sure to be a contentious issue in the 2000
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Beth Nolan acknowledged last week there was
a previously unknown glitch on the computer server in the office of
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the Justice Department was opening its
investigation, a department official said, ``It's serious enough to
warrant more than just picking up the phone,'' and calling the
White House to find out what happened. ``But, we're not quite sure
if there's anything there.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators want to know why the White House computer system
failed to capture thousands of incoming e-mails to top White House
personnel, and whether the effort was deliberate. They also want to
know whether White House employees made threats to workers of
Northrop Grumman Corp., which ran the computer system, to prevent
the existence of the e-mail from being disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conrad, chief of the Justice Department's campaign
finance task force, said in the court papers that investigators had
recently learned that the White House's record-keeping system had
for some time failed to capture e-mails sent from external
computers, and that some of the messages may have been related to
various investigations, including its investigation into 1996
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote that the task force ``has initiated an investigation''
into whether as a result of computer error, task force subpoenas
issued to the Executive Office of the President ``were not fully
complied with.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The task force intends to investigate whether
persons were in fact threatened with retaliation in order to
prevent the existence of the affected e-mail (if any) from becoming
known to the task force.''
</P>
<P>
   The court documents were filed as part of a request to delay a
civil lawsuit filed in part by the conservative legal group
Judicial Watch, which has pursued numerous cases against the
Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing Thursday, Northrop contractors
working on the e-mail project testified they had reported the
computer foul-up, which began in 1996, to White House officials in
June 1998, a time when the White House was consumed by the Monica
S. Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Two contractors said White House officials told them to keep
quiet about the problem and said they could be jailed if word got
out. ``There would be a jail cell with my name on it,'' contractor
Robert Haas told a hearing of the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Two other contractors at the meeting said they did not recall
being threatened with jail, but all remembered being told to keep
quiet about what was a sensitive issue. A fifth participant said
she thought she had been threatened with jail, but was unclear by
whom.
</P>
<P>
   Two White House employees alleged to have made the threats, Mark
Lindsay and Laura Callahan, testified later to the committee that
they had never tried to intimidate anyone or make threats over the
e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I unequivocally deny that I threatened anyone regarding
disclosure of the e-mail situation,'' Lindsay said.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said Haas ``may be having a bad recollection or he
might have an overactive imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for the House committee, Nolan, the White
House counsel, said she has instructed Charles Easley, the
associate director of the Office of Administration's Security
Division, to conduct a review of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan, who was not called Thursday to testify, also said in her
prepared statement that the ``computer glitches are the result of
unintentional human error. . . . No one attempted to hide
responsive information from this committee or any other
investigative body.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still in the process of determining the scope and time
period involved,'' she said in a letter to Representative Dan
Burton, an Indiana Republican and chairman of the House committee
investigating the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the hearing, White House spokesman Jim
Kennedy said the administration had been in touch with Justice
Department investigators over the past several weeks and was
cooperating with them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the investigation would raise fresh questions
about White House fund-raising, Kennedy said, ``This is a problem
involving the technology, and we are doing what we can to help
resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, campaigning in Florida, pounced on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a controlling legal authority in the White
House,'' the Texas governor said, referring to a now-infamous
statement by Gore three years ago when he said there was ``no
controlling legal authority'' governing his fund-raising
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best campaign finance reform starts with having an
administration that will adhere to the law and an attorney general
who will enforce the law,'' said Bush. ``I look forward to seeing
where these e-mails are and what was in these e-mails.''

DRUG-RESISTANT TB JUMPS IN GERMANY, DENMARK, NEW ZEALAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Deadly drug-resistant tuberculosis, a highly
infectious disease, is spreading more rapidly from poor nations to
rich ones, raising a new health concern for the Western world,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The infection rate, though still low, jumped 50 percent in one
year in Germany and Denmark, and it doubled in New Zealand,
according to a report being released Friday in Amsterdam by the
World Health Organization and the International Union Against TB &AMP;
Lung Disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a warning to the developed world,'' said Nils Daulaire,
president of Global Health Council, an alliance of global
health-care advocates. ``There are hot spots now &UR;  &LR; developing and if
we don't deal with it immediately, it's only going to get much
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   While drug-resistant tuberculosis has taken root in many of the
world's poorest countries, global health experts believe the fight
against TB will not fully begin until it spreads to the wealthiest
countries _ and those nations see it as a national security threat,
and begin spending billions of dollars to defeat it everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis, which spreads through the air when an infected
person coughs, sneezes or spits, kills about 1.5 million people a
year, 98 percent of them in developing countries. The Mycobacertium
tuberculosis bug develops immunities to the most common drugs if
the treatment isn't completed or is improperly administered.
</P>
<P>
   But even as reports in recent years circulated about frightening
epidemics of drug-resistant TB in Russian prisons and slums in
every continent, no one knew the rate at which the infectious
disease was growing, or whether treatment was helping.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the 117-page report establishes the
beginnings of a baseline of information about the drug-resistant TB
bug, comparing data from 1994 to 1999, and it showed that proper
treatment had slowed the spread of drug-resistant TB.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, several areas reported alarming increases in drug-resistant
TB, including Estonia; the Henan and Zhejiang provinces of China;
the Tamil Nadu region in India; Iran; Mozambique; and Russia. Other
countries reporting that drug-resistant TB accounts for more than 6
percent of all TB cases were Israel, Italy and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has reported only a handful of cases, and
almost all of them are transmitted by foreign travelers, officials
said. The numbers of cases in wealthy countries still remains
relatively small _ Germany has about 100 people infected with
drug-resistant TB _ but only a few years ago there were no cases.
</P>
<P>
   WHO's recommendation will be to increase by threefold a program
treating people with easily curable TB. The program is called
directly observed treatment, or DOTS. The organization also
supports several pilot projects to treat those with drug-resistant
TB.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago, the WHO said in a report that those who
contract drug-resistant TB in poor countries would almost surely
die because of the high cost of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a Cambridge, Mass. group called Partners in Health
started a project in Lima, Peru, in which it cured more than 100
people in the Carabayllo slum who had drug-resistant TB. The cost
per patient then was up to $10,000. Now, according to Jim Yong Kim,
the group's executive director, the price of the drugs should drop
to about $500 per patient as a result of negotiations with the
pharmaceutical industry _ and WHO's reversal to a position that
poor people with the illness could be cured, which created a market
for the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, in a telephone interview from Amsterdam, where he is
attending a TB conference, applauded the WHO report, saying it
``marks a real change in its policy'' that DOTS alone cannot solve
the TB epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis is dormant in most people, activated almost always
when a person's immune system weakens. TB kills large numbers of
people with HIV even in countries such as Botswana that have good
anti-TB programs.

SCIENTISTS DECIPHER GENES OF CRUCIAL FRUIT FLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the aid of powerful supercomputers, scientists have rapidly
deciphered the entire genetic blueprint for the common fruit fly,
the most complex organism yet decoded and a major milestone along
the road to understanding all human genes.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough underscores how quickly genetic research has
advanced in just a few years, as researchers moved up the
evolutionary ladder from identifying all the genes in lowly
bacteria to the more complex fruit fly. Now, the same researchers
who decoded the fly predict they'll decipher the human genome by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Purely as a technical feat, the deciphering of some 180 million
individual units in the genetic message of Drosophila melanogaster
is a major achievement, taking less than a year from start to
finish.
</P>
<P>
   But understanding the fruit fly, a work horse of genetic
research, has great value in itself. Because so many of the fly's
genetic functions closely parallel those of humans, the trove of
information will be of enormous value in studying human health and
disease, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenal milestone,'' said Dr. Francis Collins,
director of the National Human Genome Research Institute. The fly
genome _ its complete set of genes that is carried in every cell _
is the largest yet deciphered, and only the second animal, the
first being a worm.
</P>
<P>
   A creature's genome, or complete genetic blueprint, contains all
the genes and the chromosomes on which the genes are located. The
fruit fly, researchers said Thursday, has 13,601 genes compared to
an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 genes in the human genome. Taken
together, these genes comprises all the information for making
proteins which build and operate the body.
</P>
<P>
   One scientist who studies fruit fly development said the
achievement ``marks the end of a century of gene hunting and
heralds a new era of exploration and analysis.'' The researcher,
Thomas B. Kornberg, a biochemist at the University of California in
San Francisco, said that in the past several years, the
unanticipated genetic similarities between fruit fly and man ``have
really shocked people.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, it's been shown that alcohol will make
prevously sober fruit flies drunk and they will pass out. But with
repeated exposure, the flies learn to tolerate alcohol and even
exhibit withdrawal symptoms, suggesting very close metabolic
similarities to humans.
</P>
<P>
   The publication of the fly sequence in the current journal
Science also amounts to a vindication of the bold gene-reading
approach of J. Craig Venter, whose company Celera Genomics was a
key collaborator in the project. Called ``whole-genome shotgun,''
the method is faster than standard methods and the speedy
production of the fly sequence showed that it works.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome depended on Celera's hundreds of supercomputers that
were used to assemble millions of bits of DNA he created by
breaking up the fly's genome into fragments small enough to
decipher. Some biologists had questioned whether, even with the
supercomputers, the genome data could be pieced back together with
sufficient accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, the government genome chief, who previously was
skeptical of Venter's approach, said that the results ``show that
the `whole shotgun' approach can be successfully applied'' to a
creature as complex as the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Venter and Celera, based in Rockville, Md., are also using the
whole-genome shotgun method as they race with the government's
Human Genome Project in deciphering the human DNA message, which is
about 30 times bigger than that of Drosophila.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government agency and the private company have
publicly feuded over how Celera's genome data would be made public.
As a result, the two sides so far are going their separate ways
instead of collaborating.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project led by Collins says it will have a
``rough draft'' of the human genome deciphered by June. Celera,
which claims to have about 95 percent of the human sequence, says
it will finish it by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration between Celera and scientists led by Gerald
Rubin at the University of California in Berkeley, a noted fruit
fly researcher, involved dozens of investigators in several
countries. The paper in Science reporting on the sequencing project
listed nearly 200 authors. The main authors are Mark D. Adams and
J. Craig Venter of Celera, and Rubin, who heads the Berkeley
Drosophila Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said in a statement that the ``unique collaboration''
between Celera in the private sector and the University of
California at Berkeley and Baylor University in the academic world,
was hugely successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a complete Drosopohila genome 18 months sooner and
millions of dollars cheaper than anyone expected,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with publication of the sequence, the data itself has been
put into a public database that can be accessed at no charge,
Celera gave companies who paid a subscription fee an early look at
the data last year.

DOWN TO THE WIRE, US AIRWAYS AND UNION TRY TO RESOLVE CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass., Pa., N.C.)   (rk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a strike deadline set for 12:01 a.m. Saturday, US Airways
and its flight attendants were locked in talks Thursday in
Washington that are aimed at reconciling the airline's goal of
reducing its high operating costs with the union's push for a pay
increase.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the union, the Association of Flight Attendants,
said progress was slow, with many big issues still unresolved. The
two sides have agreed not to discuss details of the talks, but
industry analysts said the remaining sticking points included wages
and the airline's push to tighten work rules.
</P>
<P>
   The labor dispute has already hurt US Airways as the threat of a
strike has cut into its airline ticket sales. A strike would
undermine customer loyalty and hurt the airline's bottom line,
jeopardizing the ambitious strategy of Stephen Wolf, the company's
chairman, to steadily expand US Airways into a top-notch player
while reining in its costs, which are the highest per seat mile
among the major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are very high,'' said Philip Baggaley, an airline
analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``This is the last major labor
group they need to settle with.''
</P>
<P>
   The union representing the airline's 10,000 attendants has
threatened a partial strike that would disrupt 49 of the carrier's
most heavily traveled routes. Fearing that the union's tactics
would wreak havoc and strand thousands of passengers, US Airways
has said that it will shut down operations if no tentative
agreement is reached by midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say a shutdown could reduce revenue by $25
million to $30 million a day. Then the company would face
significant costs in carrying out its promise to continue paying,
as long as feasible, the salaries of more than 30,000 employees who
are not flight attendants. To help weather a confrontation, the
company recently drew down a $500 million credit line.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest disruption would occur in the East, where US
Airways, the sixth-largest carrier in the nation, controls more
than one-third of the region's market share. It runs a New
York-Boston-Washington shuttle, and its three major hubs are
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry analysts said there was a good chance of a
strike because the company was demanding cost restraints at the
same time that flight attendants were angry about not having
received a raise in four years. Their last contract expired in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the flight attendants might hesitate to walk out
because many workers in the airline's other unions were upset that
the attendants might turn down a contract similar to those that
they have already accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Not embracing the flight attendants' cause, Roy Freundlich,
spokesman for the airline's branch of the pilots union, the Air
Line Pilots Association, said the pilots were neutral in the
dispute. He added, however, that the union would hold management
responsible for any ill effects caused by the company's threat to
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways said Thursday that it had arranged for other airlines
and Amtrak to honor its tickets if its operations are shut down on
Saturday. The airline advised customers holding electronic tickets
to call US Airways or a travel agent, or to go to a US Airways
counter to get their tickets reprocessed, either electronically or
on paper, so they will be accepted at other airlines. Customers
holding a Dividend Miles award ticket should call US Airways.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In previous rounds of bargaining, Wolf vowed to shrink the
airline if the unions insisted on high-cost contracts. His threats
helped persuade the three other major unions _ the pilots, the
mechanics and the ticket agents _ to sign a contract without
significant disruption.
</P>
<P>
   These agreements have enabled Wolf to move steadily to expand
the airline since he took its helm in 1996. He has agreed to buy
400 new planes, has expanded routes to Europe and has set up a
system of low-cost regional carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to long-term growth, company officials say,
is its high cost structure. Merrill Lynch estimates that US
Airways' cost per available seat mile is 12.96 cents, compared with
9.72 cents at United, 9.44 cents at American, 8.88 cents at Delta
and 7.56 cents at Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Murphy, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, said the airline's
high costs were a carry-over from the smaller airlines that were
combined to form US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a legacy of inefficiency from prior management, from
Allegheny, Piedmont, a management mentality before Steve Wolf of
running the airline for employees and not the shareholders,''
Murphy said. ``You cannot compete with companies like Southwest
when that happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the company's record profits, in 1997 and 1998, the
flight attendants have demanded a substantial raise but have not
publicly disclosed the amount. In response, officials say the
company's financial picture has soured, noting that in the second
half of 1999 the airline lost nearly $160 million because of
soaring fuel costs, hurricanes and a maintenance slowdown. The
attendants' pay ranges from $17,145 to $36,918 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is pressing the flight attendants to accept the same
formula its other unions accepted. That would link the attendants'
pay to the average of their counterparts at the nation's four
largest airlines plus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The union's negotiators have balked at accepting this formula,
saying it would reduce their wages and benefits by 5 percent. In a
letter on the union's Web site, Lynn Lenosky, president of the
flight attendants' branch at the airline, said, ``While we don't
necessarily object to the term parity, we object to management's
attempts to force an unfair parity formula upon the flight
attendants.''
</P>
<P>
   She said management wanted the attendants to use the same
formula as the pilots, but she insisted that the formula should be
adjusted for the attendants because they do very different work.
Because US Airways has so many short routes, she said, attendants
typically serve 36 percent more passengers an hour than the
attendants at the four largest airlines: United, American, Delta
and Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling a narrowing of differences, the airline sent its
employees an electronic bulletin Thursday night saying that it was
offering the flight attendants alternative ways to calculate the
parity formula, while still achieving the company's goal of
remaining cost-competitive with the major airlines.
</P>
<P>
   But company officials say they fear that other unions will
object if the attendants receive a better formula. In a letter to
employees last month, Wolf said, ``If the flight attendants were
paid above parity plus 1 percent, other employee groups could
rightfully ask for the same treatment, and the company would again
return to significantly uncompetitive labor costs across the
board.''

COMMENTARY: RUDY'S SECRET STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudy Giuliani's plan for winning the Senate race is
now becoming very clear. He's going to drive New Yorkers so crazy
they'll vote for him just to get him out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday the city thrilled to reports that the mayor had ended
his boycott on meeting Harold Levy, the interim schools chancellor.
Having already driven two chancellors out of town shrieking,
Giuliani wanted the school board to hire a businessman who
understood management principles. Levy is a Wall Street executive
who understands management principles. However, he was not the
mayor's idea. Therefore Giuliani refused to speak to him when he
was appointed in January. When Levy reached out, the mayor declined
to come to the phone.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have come to regard stuff like this as normal, like
a wife so inured to a dysfunctional marriage that she no longer
thinks it is unusual when her husband requires her to stand at
attention while he eats dinner, and serve his peas in even-numbered
portions.
</P>
<P>
   We respond to any concessions _ like talking to the schools
chancellor _ with incredible gratitude. (Thirty-seven peas? Oh
dear, so kind of you to eat them anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   During the crisis over a police shooting of an unarmed black man
last year, the city was loud in its applause when the mayor reached
out to African-American officials by inviting them to breakfast at
Gracie Mansion. We had so lost track of reality, we barely bothered
to ask why the mayor hadn't been talking to these people all the
time. (That crisis, by the way, is not to be confused with the
current police shooting of an unarmed black man, nor the one before
that.)
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has turned City Hall into a fortress, with so much
security it is easier to get in to watch the U.S. Congress than a
hearing of a city council subcommittee. When we are not thanking
him for a modicum of polite behavior, we are waiting nervously for
the next outburst. The blow-ups usually come as a surprise because
Giuliani avoids face-to-face confrontations. You don't necessarily
know he's angry until he calls a press conference and denounces you
to the entire world as a terrible person.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gov. George Pataki say Giuliani has never explained
why, back in 1994, he suddenly endorsed Mario Cuomo's re-election
and sailed into an attack on Pataki, a fellow Republican whom he
had barely met. After Cuomo lost, Giuliani stopped fighting with
Pataki in public, except for a few extremely critical issues like
the renaming of a highway in honor of Joe DiMaggio. However, many
Republicans found it hard to understand why the governor cleared
the way for his Senate candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Obvious explanation: The governor wants him out of here. No
sacrifice is too great to put him on that Washington shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Our current civic crisis involves Patrick Dorismond, who was
killed by a police officer as he walked out of a bar unarmed. We
still do not know a lot of crucial details. But we do know the
appropriate response for a mayor: This is terrible. No one should
leap to judgment over the officer's conduct. But my heart goes out
to the young man's family.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Giuliani has gotten into a long-running dispute over why
the police made Dorismond's juvenile record public. Only an
absolutely impossible person would pursue such an argument,
supporting the cops by sliming the dead person, explaining that the
records were unsealed because ``when you die, your privacy
interests end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton is going to have a hard time overcoming this
exhaust-the-voters tactic. It might be worth it to promote the man
just to keep him from spending any more of our money on baseball
stadiums. He's committed $112 million to two minor-league parks
already, and we'll never get it back. The only bargain the city
ever got on athletics was the stadium the U.S. Tennis Association
built in Queens, leaving us with a great public facility and no
bill. The mayor, however, boycotts the place because that was his
predecessor's deal.
</P>
<P>
   And now it all makes sense. Giuliani is running not on what
he'll do in Washington, but what he'll stop doing in New York. And
there are so many impossible men in the Senate already, nobody
would even notice he's there.
</P>

RURAL WOMEN TELL CLINTON OF THEIR RISE TO EMPOWERMENT

<P>
   NAYLA, India _ Ringing a flower garland around President
Clinton's neck and tossing rose petals on his head, dozens of farm
women clad in everyday dresses of rainbow-colored cotton welcomed
him to a dusty village in northeastern India Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Showing him a face of the nation a world apart from the halls of
Parliament in New Delhi or the high-tech office parks of India's
Silicon Valley, the women clapped hands to the beat of turbaned
drummers, danced and sang of doing daily chores that begin with
grinding wheat at 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grind and I grind until my knees ache, yet there is no
dignity for my work,'' the women sang. ``Awaken, women of my land!
It's time we empower ourselves!''
</P>
<P>
   Their stories contrasted with the common image of rural Indian
women as uniformly downtrodden and oppressed, denied education and
political rights, and passively accepting their woeful state as
their karma, or destiny.
</P>
<P>
   While still true of some, that monochromatic vision is outdated.
As Clinton learned, growing contact between cities and villages,
concerted efforts of Indian development agencies, and the election
of numbers of women to local councils have resulted in even many
unschooled females are empowering themselves economically,
politically, and most of all, psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   They have formed agricultural cooperatives and raised funds to
give small loans to women starting modest businesses. They have
battled for equal pay for equal work. They have demanded education
for children who previously labored in factories. They have run for
village posts and won, crusading for clean water and schools. They
have even persuaded some families not to marry off their children
before age 18.
</P>
<P>
   A typical story Thursday was that of Batto Devi, whose husband
died a few years ago, leaving the illiterate woman with no means to
support herself and her two children. Her in-laws tried to force
her to marry her husband's younger brother, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1984, Batto Devi was chosen for a women's development
program sponsored by the government of the state of Rajasthan, long
considered one of the most backward in India. Perhaps because of
its reputation for extremely low female literacy rates and
occasional incidents of ``sati,'' the illegal practice of burning
widows on their husbands' funeral pyres, Rajasthan has worked to
train Batto Devi and other women about their rights and how to
fight for them.
</P>
<P>
   She began working on a road building site, but soon learned that
the 25 cents a day that she and other women were being paid was
just half the minimum wage for men doing the same work. Batto Devi
fought until salaries were equalized and, for 13 years, she has
been a roadwork supervisor, a position once held only by men. In
her spare time, she has organized night schools and child care for
her employees.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are 200 women in her cooperative, and they share
$1,500 in shared assets, which they loan to any member for small
business projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are small amounts, but they suit our needs, and we are
very happy,'' said Batto Devi, 35, of Dangarwada village. ``We
believe men and women are equal . . . and I will strive for greater
awareness among women of Rajasthan.''
</P>
<P>
   One group of women who formed a dairy cooperative in nearby
Dhoblai village demonstrated a computerized milk measuring machine
they bought to automatically calculate the fat content, volume, and
payment owed to each farmer. They also described an attempt by a
group of men to take over their franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that no matter what, we wouldn't let the men (do
that), because by rights, it was ours,'' said Santosh Chaudhary,
49, of Gokulpura. She said the women underpriced their competitors
till the men ``had to flee the village. I tell many women in
similar situations that they don't have to suffer in silence. They
can fight for their rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The women gave the president his own membership card in their
cooperative. Moved, he replied, ``I grew up in a place with many
dairy cows, and I know what hard work is, and I will always
treasure this. I will put this up in the White House so everyone
will know I came here and what you are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   A male villager asked Clinton if he agreed with ``the
stereotypical image of Indians all over the world as backward
people,'' now that he had been in India for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said no, adding that ``if in India you can prove that
people can lift themselves from poverty. . .end discrimination
against women. . .and learn to work together across tribal and
caste lines because of democracy, you will give the world the
greatest gift it could have.''

INCREASED BACKING GIVES CAIN FULL RIDE

<P>
   &LR;  Caution was the catchword in Saturday's NASCAR Winston West
Series season opener at Phoenix International Raceway. By the end
of the NAPA Auto Parts 100, nine caution flags slowed 39 laps of
the race.
</P>
<P>
   For Bill Sedgwick of Acton, the last caution was a blessing. For
Jerry Cain of Canyon Country, it was a black cat.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick, a lap down with about 10 to go, had just pitted to get
four new tires. When he got back on the track, he caught and passed
race leader and eventual winner Kevin Richards to get back on the
lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   Then disaster struck and Cain was caught in the middle of it. A
crash on lap 92 took out the third- through seventh-place cars,
including Cain's, and allowed Sedgwick to catch the lead pack. As a
result, Sedwick finished sixth, and Cain dropped to 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if everything's perfect, you still need Lady Luck to push
you over the top,'' Cain said. ``We had a top-three car until the
melee broke out.''
</P>
<P>
   But the weekend wasn't a total loss. With the strong race,
Cain's main sponsors, Puget Sound and Consumer Savings, and others
increased their funding of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Cain was able to add three more cars to his team and make a
commitment to race the entire 12-race Winston West season. Before
Phoenix, Cain was uncertain if he would be able to race the whole
season.
</P>
<P>
   With five Chevy Monte Carlos in his stable, Cain is looking
forward to this weekend's Coors 200 at Mesa Marin Raceway in
Bakersfield. As a NASCAR Super Late Model driver there, Cain was
consistently in the top 10 at weekly races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I predict that we will be in the top five in qualifying,''
Cain said. ``and if we don't crash, we will finish in the top
five.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series and the Featherlite Southwest
Series will join the Winston West Series at Mesa Marin this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tune in: NASCAR and Speedvision, a 24-hour cable network that
covers motor sports, announced plans to televise eight Winston West
Series races this season.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the broadcasts will be three events at Irwindale
Speedway. The others are two events at Mesa Marin Raceway in
Bakersfield and one each at Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, Wash.,
Portland Speedway in Oregon and Rocky Mountains Raceways near Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The Irwindale Speedway events will be the Home Depot 250 on June
24, the Home Depot 250 on Aug. 19 and the Home Depot 300 on Nov.
11, which will also be the Winston West season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Winston West Series race at California Speedway on
April 29 is scheduled to be broadcast on ESPN2.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to growth in recent seasons, the series has
experienced an increased level of competition,'' said Tom Deery,
NASCAR vice president. ``This television coverage will allow fans
across the country an opportunity to view the intense competition
in the series. And it will allow these drivers to showcase their
talent to a national audience, while providing tremendous added
exposure to the teams and their sponsors.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Leader of the pack: NASCAR Busch Grand National Series driver
Ron Hornaday Jr. continued his streak as the top-finishing rookie
with his performance in Saturday's SunCom 200 event at Darlington
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, from Palmdale, has been the top-finishing rookie in
four consecutive Busch series events. He holds a 20-point lead in
the rookie standings. Kevin Harvick of Bakersfield and Jay Sauter
each have 44 and are tied for second in the rookie race.
</P>
<P>
   His eighth-place finish was histhird top-10 showing of the year
and placed him sixth in the season standings. Matt Kenseth leads
the series with 823 points. Mark Martin, who won the SunCom 200 and
his third race in five Busch events, is second with 725. Hornaday
has 641.
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Alliance Corp. in Irvine, Calif., a nationwide home equity
lender facing numerous lawsuits accusing it of deceptive sales
practices, announced Thursday that it had stopped making new loans
to homeowners and had filed for bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage company, which had offices in more than a dozen
states, including New York, New Jersey and California, said that it
had closed its loan offices and laid off 85 percent of its work
force of roughly 480 employees. Several employees said the company
was offering generous severance payments.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, one immediate effect of the bankruptcy filing
is to freeze all the pending consumer lawsuits facing the company
and force those plaintiffs, who include many elderly homeowners and
the AARP, to pursue their claims in bankruptcy court. Also caught
in the bankruptcy litigation freeze is a consumer class-action case
pending in U.S. District Court in Newark, N.J., and a shareholder
class-action lawsuit filed in state court in Orange County, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy cases cover the parent company and several
subsidiaries, including its flagship, First Alliance Mortgage Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Chapter 11 filings, seeking a reorganization of the company
rather than its liquidation, were made Thursday afternoon in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana, Calif., hours after the company
asked the Nasdaq market to suspend trading in its stock pending an
important announcement.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to employees and investors, the company said it
was forced to file for bankruptcy protection because of legislative
proposals in several states that would cap the size of its loan
fees, and by the ``recent unwarranted negative publicity against
the company arising from the joint stories by The New York Times
and ABC News 20/20 program.''
</P>
<P>
   Those stories, published in The Times on March 15 and broadcast
the same evening on ABC, detailed the numerous consumer complaints,
lawsuits and regulatory actions pending against First Alliance,
including allegations that it failed to adequately and clearly
disclose the extremely high fees or ``points'' it charged, which
sometimes totaled as much as 25 percent of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance, as noted in the stories, has denied the
accusations and insisted that it has fully disclosed all the terms
of its loans to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's statement Thursday, Brian Chisick, the
company's founder and chairman, said that ``these unfair and
inaccurate stories have devastated the company's 30-year reputation
and acutely hindered the company's relationships with businesses,
consumers and regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Canavan, one of the San Jose lawyers representing the
AARP and several homeowners in their cases against First Alliance,
said her firm was considering whether it could challenge the
company's bankruptcy filing as having been made in bad faith. ``The
bankruptcy filing appears designed to protect them from having to
make long-overdue restitution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the consumer cases and the shareholder lawsuit, First
Alliance is also facing lawsuits by regulators in Illinois and
Massachusetts. Late last week, the company withdrew from Washington
state, where it was facing a regulatory action aimed at suspending
its license.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is less clear how the bankruptcy filing will affect those
regulatory actions. Patricia D. Kelly, the chief of the attorney
general's consumer protection division in Illinois, said that she
did not expect her state's lawsuit against the company to be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a company files for bankruptcy, that does not preclude
the state from exercising its police powers,'' Kelly said Thursday.
``So we will continue to proceed in state court to seek an
injunction and any other relief we are entitled to.''
</P>
<P>
   Financial records provided to investors by First Alliance on
March 14 showed no signs of financial distress. As of Dec. 31, the
company had assets of more than $112 million, including more than
$15 million in cash, and liabilities of just $33 million. According
to those records, the company's single largest debt is a $14.1
million line of credit owed to Lehman Brothers. The list of
creditors included in the bankruptcy filing will not be available
until later Friday so it was not immediately possible to determine
others that may have significant claims against the company.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman, said his company has
taken no action to precipitate the bankruptcy filing and had not
even been aware of it until it was announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   However, it is likely that Lehman will emerge as one of the
largest creditors of First Alliance, which would give it
significant influence over the reorganization process. Lehman
Brothers also has a small equity stake in First Alliance, which it
acquired as part of its fee for providing the mortgage company's
line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Several bankruptcy experts said Thursday that the company's
apparent financial health suggests that its bankruptcy filing was a
strategic move to help it cope with the litigation it is facing
without destroying the company's value to its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies facing the kind of massive consumer litigation that
First Alliance faces may find that Chapter 11 is the only
opportunity the business has to survive,'' said Elizabeth Warren, a
bankruptcy professor at the Harvard Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Venditto, a bankruptcy attorney in New York City,
pointed out that an avalanche of litigation has propelled a number
major companies, including all the country's asbestos
manufacturers, to seek bankruptcy court protection over the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, litigation will slowly bleed a company, so you want
to stop the bleeding at the earliest possible moment,'' Venditto
said. ``If properly handled, it could be the best possible move for
shareholders,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of those shareholders are Chisick and his wife
Sarah, who jointly own more than 12.4 million shares of the
company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday night, that stake was worth roughly $22.4
million, down from nearly $300 million at the end of 1997, before
First Alliance's mounting legal problems dampened investors'
appetite for the company's shares. When the shares last traded
Wednesday, they changed hands for roughly $1.81 each.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Chisicks, who still own nearly 70 percent of the
company's outstanding shares, were able to reap profits of roughly
$135 million when First Alliance first sold shares to the public in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Besides shareholders, other Wall Street investors have an
indirect stake in First Alliance's loan operations. Since 1993, the
company has sold nearly $2 billion of its loans to various Wall
Street trust funds, which in turn sold a form of promissory notes
to pension funds and other institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who monitor those notes, which are called
mortgage-backed securities, said Thursday that the bankruptcy
should not directly affect noteholders. Many of the deals were
insured, guaranteeing investors that they would be paid principal
and interest in a timely fashion, one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   First Alliance is still responsible for servicing the loans that
were sold to the trust funds, collecting monthly payments from
homeowners and forwarding part of that money to the trust funds.
But Jerry Hager, the company's general counsel, said Thursday that
First Alliance did not anticipate any interruption in its servicing
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1971, First Alliance describes itself as a
``subprime'' lender, one that specializes in making loans to people
whose past credit problems or low income prevent them from
borrowing from traditional lenders. Because of the additional risks
involved in making such loans, the company has said, it must charge
higher fees in interest rates than conventional lenders do.
</P>
<P>
   However, regulators have argued that many of First Alliance's
customers could qualify for traditional loans at much lower cost,
and that the company's high fees are not related in any way to the
creditworthiness of its borrowers.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pretty much everything that's right about ``Aida,''
the new Disney cartoon pretending to be a Broadway musical, can be
summed up in two words: Heather Headley.
</P>
<P>
   Headley, who last worked as a Disney employee wearing zoological
drag in ``The Lion King,'' here sheds fur and claws to assume a
woman's part, that of the title role of the Nubian princess in
captivity. She wears royalty as if it were a body stocking, right
next to the skin, and it's easy to see why the other characters
onstage sense there is something that separates Aida from your
run-of-the-mill slave.
</P>
<P>
   She has fire, self-possession and an uncompromising sense of
purpose. Although she may have goddesslike attributes, she also
gives off a purely human, flesh-and-blood intensity. That is more
than can be said for anyone or anything around her at the Palace
Theater, where ``Aida'' opened Thursday night under the direction
of Robert Falls, with songs by Elton John and Tim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that casting Headley was not in the best
interests of ``Aida.'' The move is on a par with inviting Lauren
Hutton to your 35th high school reunion and then expecting to look
good when she stands next to you in your class picture.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, without Headley there would be nothing for
grown-ups to focus on once they get past the visual jolt of the Las
Vegas arcade that is passing for ancient Egypt, the work of the
eminent set designer Bob Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   Children under 12 may also find sitting through the evening's
two and a half hours a chore because the show seems to keep
anxiously changing its mind about just to whom it is trying to
appeal. Like many Broadway megamusicals today, it has the
disconnected, sterile feeling that suggests it has been assembled,
piecemeal, by committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aida,'' which has been through several incarnations starting
with a disastrous appearance in Atlanta in 1998, still has not
decided what it wants to be. It's not an out-and-out clunker like
the stage version of ``Saturday Night Fever.'' But it seems
stranded in its own candy-colored limbo, thrashing between childish
silliness and civic preachiness, between campy spoof and tragic
tear-jerker, between two and three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is the first of the Disney Broadway productions
(following the enduringly successful ``Beauty and the Beast'' and
``The Lion King'') not to be inspired by an animated film, it
appears to be waiting for the greater destiny of translation into a
cartoon. Actually, trimmed to 80 minutes and re-envisioned by
Disney's crack team of animators, it could be a perfectly
respectable children's movie _ not like ``The Little Mermaid'' or
``The Lion King,'' but as good at least as ``Aladdin'' or
``Tarzan.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Disney's version of ``Tarzan'' had a score by Phil
Collins that was so generically Phil Collins that it seemed
abstract, John's score for ``Aida'' might have been assembled from
a ``make your own Elton John song'' software program. It has all
the memory-grabbing adhesiveness of unchewed gum, but it would work
fine as background music for enchanting bits of animated whimsy.
(You know, singing sphinxes and the like.)
</P>
<P>
   What's more, cartoon creatures can get away with the instant
shifts between wisecracking facetiousness and sacrificial nobility
demanded of the performers here. They might even get away with some
of the flat, dubbed-sounding line readings of the show's ``Perils
of Pauline''-style dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   This is all rather confounding given the theatrical pedigrees of
several of the show's chief creators. Falls, the artistic director
of the Goodman Theater in Chicago, oversaw the inspired staging of
last year's revival of ``Death of a Salesman''; David Henry Hwang,
who wrote the book for ``Aida'' with Linda Woolverton and Falls, is
the Tony Award-winning author of ``M. Butterfly.'' Wayne Cilento,
the show's choreographer, won a Tony for the Broadway hit ``Tommy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the script and lyrics, which rework the myth that inspired
Verdi's opera of the same name, feel directly descended from a
Disney story conference. Aida herself is close kin to Disney's
Pocahontas and to Ariel the mermaid, another spunky, adventurous
young woman with a prescient feminist streak and a curious side
that gets her into lots of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Taken captive with a group of her Nubian handmaidens, Aida
immediately grabs the eye of the conquering Egyptian captain,
Radames (Adam Pascal, of the original ``Rent''), who is reluctantly
betrothed to Amneris (Sherie Rene Scott), the daughter of the
ailing Pharaoh (Daniel Oreskes). Duty clashes with love, as it does
in the world of Verdi, and the outcome is again tragic, unless you
believe in reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Before the climactic Liebestod (during which, rest assured, no
one sings ``Candle in the Wind''), there's time for fun, frolics
and carnage. There's even time for a Busby Berkeley-style water
ballet (with suspended dancers ``swimming'' behind a scrim in the
image of a pool) and a ``Jetsons''-style fashion show, in which
Amneris' servants parade in Futurist-style Egyptian outfits,
designed by Crowley, that should top every drag queen's must-have
list. For those with darker tastes, there are scenes of hope and
suffering in the internment camp where bedraggled Nubians await
execution.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are two supporting roles that come straight from the
Disney cartoon stock company: the sly, ingratiating and ultimately
heroic sidekick, usually represented in Disney films by a cute,
small animal like a guppy or a monkey, and the demonic villain.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Perkins plays the sidekick, Mereb, a Nubian slave with a
sarcastic streak; John Hickok, looking like Terence Stamp in a punk
phase, is the gargoyle villain, Zoser, Radames' father. Neither
projects a lot of personality, although Hickok is especially
wooden.
</P>
<P>
   He has also been asked to lead the evening's most unfortunate
choreography, in which Zoser and his henchmen do hieroglyphic
voguing routines, typical of Cilento's MTV-style staging here.
Hickok has also been burdened with lines usually spoken by men with
black top hats and curled mustaches. (``Can't seem to keep them
alive down there,'' he notes blithely, after giving orders that a
group of slaves be sent to work in the copper mines.)
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue, by and large, is of the B-movie swashbuckler
variety of the 1930s and '40. (Radames to Aida, when he demands
that she scrub his naked torso: ``You are much better with a sword
than you are with a sponge.'') There are also instances of the sort
of camp declarations more common to Charles Ludlam-ish parodies.
(Mereb salaams before Amneris while praising her as ``first in
beauty, wisdom and accessories.'')
</P>
<P>
   The more exalted sentiments, about destiny and duty, are
reserved for Rice's rather perfunctory lyrics: ``Nothing is an
accident/We are free to have it all/We are what we want to be/It's
in ourselves to rise and fall.'' That's the moral of ``Aida,'' that
and the reasonable contention that imperialism and slavery are bad.
</P>
<P>
   Pascal, who emerged as a bona fide matinee idol for the under-20
set (a rare thing on Broadway) in ``Rent,'' looks embarrassed to be
wearing all those regal robes and armor here, and his movements and
line readings are correspondingly stiff and self-conscious. When he
sings, he sounds remarkably like Elton John, which does not
contribute much to his characterization.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who seems to have some spark beneath those towering
headdresses, is a sadder casualty. Amneris has been conceived as an
insecure, surface-obsessed fashion plate, played in the manner of
Tori Spelling on ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheap laughs are milked from her desperate attempts to win
Radames' love. (``There's a buck-naked princess lying in bed,
calling your name,'' she screams.) She is asked to sing lyrics
like, ``I would rather wear a barrel/Than conservative apparel.''
But she finally turns out to be a monument of political virtue,
invested in the cause of world peace. Who, other than Diana,
Princess of Wales, could convincingly pull off such a transition?
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, Headley, and she is simply splendid. She not
only has what is called It _ that ineffable, sensual glow _ but
also a voice of stunning emotional variety and conviction. Anytime
she sings, whether of memories of a lost girlhood or of Aida's
reluctance to take on a mantle of power, the show springs into
vital life, only to sag into its torpor again when she leaves the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   For those who live to follow the trajectories of rising stars, a
trip to ``Aida'' may be worthwhile. Everyone else is advised to
wait for the cartoon. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE 3-MINUTE CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; In Geneva on Sunday President Clinton will be meeting with
Syria's president, Hafez Assad. Here's how I imagine the dialogue
will go:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton: ``Hafez, it's good to see you again. When you were
younger you were renowned for giving presidents and diplomats
12-hour lectures on the history of Syria. Neither of us has the
energy for that anymore, so I'm going to be very brief. This summit
should take just three minutes, because I have only three
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``First: Are you still in charge? Now don't be insulted by that.
Those idiots in the White House press corps ask me that all the
time. I know you're still president, but there are a lot of rumors
about your diabetes and memory loss _ so would you mind doing 20
push-ups for me and naming the last six U.S. presidents you dealt
with? (Assad starts doing push-ups on the floor and naming U.S.
presidents.) Good. Good ... No, no, Nixon came before Reagan, but
that's close enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, you know, Hafez, health isn't your only weakness. We both
know that your authority has been challenged by the fact that you
haven't been able to win acceptance _ from your army, Baath Party
or Alawite community _ for your son Bashar to become your
successor. Why do I care? Because the Israelis are used to thinking
about Syria as a one-man regime, in which you could decide
everything. If that's not the case anymore, then you're just like
Ehud Barak _ more so than either of you would admit. And if you're
both in the same position, you're going to have to protect each
other from the political risks involved in any Syrian-Israeli peace
treaty. I need to make sure you both understand that before I go
any further.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second question is: Are you ready to offer the Israelis
something more than just a legalistic peace? Hafez, you can't
persuade the Israeli public _ and it's the public there that
ultimately will decide _ to give up as important a strategic asset
as the Golan Heights while you treat them like lepers. You have to
signal Israelis that there is something new in the Syrian attitude
toward them as a people. Because if you're just offering the
Israelis the same old Syrian hostility _ but without the Golan _
well, they may just prefer to keep the Golan, with your hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hafez, it doesn't take much. If you do the right thing, and
come up with the security arrangements Barak needs, the Israeli
public will endorse this deal for one big reason: because you've
agreed to let Israelis drive across Syria to Europe. For Israelis,
peace with Egypt was the gateway to the Sahara. But peace with
Syria, wow, that's the gateway to Europe. Psychologically, for
Israelis to know that they could drive to Istanbul and Athens
anytime they wanted ... well, you just can't imagine how important
that is to a people bottled up for so long. You'll make more money
from speeding tickets than you ever made from oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``But before we get too warm and fuzzy here, Hafez, let me ask
question three: Do you understand what will happen if you don't
make this deal? Syria has been able to survive as a rogue state,
even after the collapse of your Soviet backers, because you had
some oil, which is now running out, and because you were one of the
all-time great rogues. But Hafez, your son Bashar, the eye doctor,
he's no rogue. And a rogue state without a rogue leader or oil
won't last. You'll be Albania. Now, we're trying to restore ties
with Iran. It will take time. But if we break through with Iran,
before Syria makes peace, who needs you? Moreover, the Israelis
will unilaterally withdraw from Lebanon, and leave your army there
_ exposed as the sole occupier of Lebanon. So your choices are
clear: peacemaker with Israel or occupier of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you opt for peacemaker, well, I'm no eye doctor like your
son, but I can sure fix how the world would look at your country. I
don't have the clout to get you any aid money from Congress, but I
know a little bit about raising money from Asians, and we'll get
Japan and Europe to help you pay for peace. So there you have it,
Hafez. Three questions, three minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Assad: ``Bill, I will be even more brief. I am strong and I am
ready. But remember: I need all our land back in exchange for
peace. I'm not going to be the first Arab leader who gives the
Israelis an inch _ not one inch. Do you and Barak understand that?
Are you and he strong enough for such a deal? Are you ready?''

YOUR NUTRITION I.Q.
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With television quiz shows so popular, we thought we'd try a
quiz of our own. Regis won't be reading the questions, but you can
have as many lifelines as you like. There's no $1 million prize at
stake, simply your health, which should be worth at least that much
- or more.
</P>
<P>
   Designed with a little help from the American Dietetic
Association and its book, ``Complete Food &AMP; Nutrition Guide'' by
registered dietitian Roberta Larson Duyff (Chronimed Publishing),
plan to gather a few friends or relatives and put them to the test.
See how far they get. For fun, keep score so participants can
assess their nutrition savvy.
</P>
<P>
   And when you're in the mood to challenge yourself even more (or
have additional questions), turn to ADA's Hotline at (800)
366-1655, or go to its Web site, www.eatright.org (which is linked
to other nutrition and health Web sites).

QUIZ ANSWERS &QL; 
Check to see how you did on the quiz. If you score 24 to 30,
consider yourself a nutrition whiz; 18 to 24, you are nutrition
savvy but could brush up on some of the finer points; 10 to 15,
keep trying and learning about nutrition and food for good health.
</P>
<P>
   1. a) A deck of cards. Two to 3 ounces of cooked lean beef,
poultry with the skin removed, or fish constitutes one serving.
</P>
<P>
   2. True. The better daily choice for including calcium without
the fat is two to three servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy
products, rather than whole or full-fat dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   3. False. According to the American Dietetic Association, being
brown in color does not mean a bread is high in fiber. If the bread
ingredient list notes that it contains whole wheat or other whole
grains, then it probably has fiber. The brown color may be from
caramel coloring. Check the Nutrition Facts label for the number of
grams of fiber per serving.
</P>
<P>
   4. False. Irradiation results in minimal nutrient loss, just
like other forms of food processing, such as drying, freezing and
pasteurization. Irradiation eliminates harmful bacteria and retards
spoilage and has been approved by the FDA for use in red meats,
poultry, fresh fruits and vegetables, and flour and grain products.
</P>
<P>
   5. False. The 98 percent fat-free claim refers to the weight of
the food, not its calories. If a food is labeled fat-free, it
contains .5 grams of fat or less per serving. Read the Nutrition
Facts label for grams of fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   6. False. There is little difference, depending on the handling
of the produce. Canned and frozen produce is generally processed at
its peak and may contain more nutrients than fresh produce.
However, canned or frozen produce may have added sugar or salt,
which should be considered when purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   7. a) 1 cup strawberries. A cup of strawberries has a whopping
85 milligrams of vitamin C - more than an orange's 80 milligrams. A
kiwi runs a close second with 75 milligrams. An apple has only 8
milligrams while a nectarine has only 7. People age 15 and over
need 60 milligrams of vitamin C a day.
</P>
<P>
   8. d) 1 tablespoon apple butter. Apple butter has no fat at all,
because it's made from naturally fat-free apples and has no added
fat. A tablespoon of butter or margarine has 11 to 12 grams fat.
White, tub and light versions have less fat - and because they are
easier to spread, you usually use less. Peanut butter has 4 grams
fat, but it's a cholesterol-free source of protein and contains 1
gram of fiber.
</P>
<P>
   9. a) Two hours. Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared
foods and leftovers within two hours or sooner to keep harmful
bacteria from growing and multiplying. If you're not sure about a
food's safety, toss it. When in doubt, throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   10. True. Cholesterol is only found in animal foods. Peanuts are
a plant food.
</P>
<P>
   11. b) 20 to 30 grams. Many of us eat only half the recommended
daily quota of 25 to 30 grams of fiber. You can increase the fiber
in your diet with whole grains (breads, cereals, pasta and rice),
fruits, vegetables and legumes (dried beans and peas).
</P>
<P>
   12. a) Foods of animal origin, such as pork, chicken, fish,
beef, milk, butter and eggs. The key here is cholesterol.
Cholesterol is found only in foods of animal origin. Plants do not
contain cholesterol; however, some contain significant amounts of
fat, such as vegetable oils. Many seafoods are low in fat and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   13. d) All of the above. An eating style that promotes overall
health is based on enjoying a variety of foods from all the food
groups, eating in moderation (using fats, oils and sugar sparingly)
and balancing the kinds of foods consumed (not too much of any one
food).
</P>
<P>
   14. False. Cottage cheese supplies only 65 milligrams of calcium
in a half a cup. If you are eating it for its calcium content, try
more calcium-dense foods such as milk or yogurt, which contain 300
milligrams of calcium per 8 ounces, or 1 ounce of Cheddar cheese,
which contains 200 milligrams of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   15. True. The calorie content of any food depends on its
nutrient content - how much carbohydrate, fat and protein it
contains. A calorie is defined as a unit of energy. One gram of fat
provides 9 calories, while 1 gram of either carbohydrates or
protein supplies 4 calories.
</P>
<P>
   16. False. One teaspoon of salt contains about 2,300 milligrams
of sodium.
</P>
<P>
   17. True. Sodium is a mineral that occurs naturally in food.
Sodium helps maintain proper fluid balance, regulates your blood
pressure, transmits nerve impulses and helps your muscles relax,
including your heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   18. e) All of the above. Eat a variety of in-season fresh fruits
- and opt for frozen, dried and canned to avoid boredom and when
the fresh counterparts are out of season.
</P>
<P>
   19. False. There is no direct link between snacking and body
weight. The issue is total calories, not how often you eat. Your
calorie or energy balance at the end of the day - based on the
number of calories you ate and the number of calories you burned -
determines whether you gain, lose or maintain weight.
</P>
<P>
   20. False. Shell color doesn't affect nutrition quality. The
color of the eggshell varies with the breed of hen.
</P>
<P>
   21. True. The Pyramid is a guideline, not a rigid prescription,
and it contains the building blocks of a healthful diet. It's
designed for all healthy males and females, young and old, age 2 or
older. The minimum serving from the five food groups supplies about
1,600 calories, which is sufficient for inactive and some older
adults. The midpoint in the number of servings suggested provides
about 2,200 calories, a good target for many children, teen-age
girls, active women and inactive men. Teen-age boys, active men and
many athletes may eat from the top of the serving ranges, or about
2,800 calories.
</P>
<P>
   22. b) 30 percent. Nutritionists recommend no more than 30
percent, which includes less than 10 percent of total calories from
saturated fats, about 10 percent from monounsaturated fats and
about 10 percent from polyunsaturated fats.
</P>
<P>
   23. True. Most of your energy should come from carbohydrates,
complex as well as simple. Complex carbohydrates or starches are
found in grains, legumes and vegetables. Sugars, the most simple
form of carbohydrate, are either naturally present in foods, such
as fruit and milk, or added. Either way, your body uses them in the
same way - to fuel body processes and physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   24. a) Sweet potatoes b) mangoes and d) spinach. For vitamin A,
eat plenty of deep yellow, orange and some dark green leafy
vegetables - and some deep yellow fruits. Try to eat at least one
serving daily. Note that although orange juice has some vitamin A,
its better nutrient assets are vitamin C and potassium.
</P>
<P>
   25. False. Low-fat means 3 grams or less of fat per serving.
Reduced or less fat means at least 25 percent less fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   26. False. Salmon has about 185 calories and 9 fat grams per
3-ounce cooked portion compared with 190 calories and 9 fat grams
in the same portion of roasted, light-meat chicken with the skin
on. Skinless, this same portion of chicken contains about 150
calories and 3 fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   27. True. However, these oils are still 100 percent fat with 120
calories per tablespoon, so they should be used sparingly. The goal
for health is to use oils high in monounsaturated fatty acids
instead of other fats and oils.
</P>
<P>
   28. False. Enriched means adding back nutrients that were lost
during food processing. For example, B vitamins, which are lost
when wheat is refined, are added back to white flour. Fortified
means adding nutrients that weren't present originally. Milk, for
instance, is fortified with vitamin D, a nutrient that helps your
body absorb the calcium and phosphorous in milk.
</P>
<P>
   29. False. Butter and margarine both have 100 calories per
tablespoon.
</P>
<P>
   30. False. Vitamins are not a source of energy, but help convert
food to energy. &QL;

POPE SPEAKS OF THE `TERRIBLE TRAGEDY OF THE SHOAH' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the somber setting of Israel's Holocaust
memorial, Pope John Paul II offered a soul-searching reflection of
the Holocaust's ``godless ideology'' Thursday, and declared the
Catholic church ``rejects'' and is ``deeply saddened'' by Christian
persecution of Jews throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this place of memories, the mind and heart and soul feel an
extreme need for silence. Silence in which to remember,'' the
pontiff said in the flickering light of the ``eternal flame'' at
Yad Vashem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silence because there are no words strong enough to deplore
the terrible tragedy of the Shoah'' _ or Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But for some _ Israelis, Jews and Christians alike _ John Paul's
words were not enough. They were hoping to hear the pope address a
different kind of silence, specifically the silence of the World
War II-era pope, Pius XII, in the face of death camps where 6
million Jews were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's chief rabbi, Israel Lau, who grew up in the same area
of Poland as the pope and who had an emotional morning meeting with
the pontiff at the Great Synogogue, has praised John Paul's efforts
at reconciliation. Lau, however, who lost most of his family in
death camps in Poland, also expressed disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, Lau said, needs to directly address the official
silence of the church under the papacy of Pius XII.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected penetrating criticism of his deeds, of the complete
silence when our blood was spilled,'' he said. ``Such criticism is
vital for the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Pius spoken out, Lau and others maintain, countless Jewish
lives may have been saved. The Catholic church has disagreed,
saying that Pius's silence was a diplomatic strategy that actually
helped save Jews. Catholic theologians also point out that some
priests and nuns risked their lives to try to save Jews from the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the consideration of Pius XII for beatification, the last
step before sainthood, has outraged many Jews and Christians.
Critics are demanding that the Vatican open its archives on Pius to
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disappointment in Thursday's speech among some, the
pope's message and his genuine grief seemed to resonate among
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the nearly 50 Holocaust survivors in attendance,
among some 300,000 Holocaust survivors in Israel, were brought to
tears as the pope ceremoniously lit the ``eternal flame'' in Yad
Vashem's stark Hall of Rememberance. The hall's walls are lined
with boulders and the floor is cold, gray concrete, as in a tomb.
In the center of the hall is a flat stone under which lies the
cremated remains of victims of six Polish death camps.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul listened to poignant rememberances of victims, and the
mournful cry of a cantor praying for the souls of the dead. At one
point the 79-year-old pontiff seemed overwhelmed and shaken, wiping
away what many who watched thought were tears.
</P>
<P>
   Several Vatican historians called Thursday's appearance a
crowning moment of a 22-year papacy devoted to healing wounds in
Catholic-Jewish relations, a drive fueled by his haunting memories
of Nazi persecution in his native Poland of Jews, some of whom were
childhood friends and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal memories are of all that happened when the
Nazis occupied Poland during the war, I remember my Jewish friends
and neighbors, some of whom perished, while others survived.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to Yad Vashem to pay homage to the millions of
Jewish people who, stripped of everything, especially of their
human dignity, were murdered in the Holocaust. More than half a
century has passed, but the memories remain. ... No one can forget
or ignore what happened. No one can diminish its scale.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope stopped short of assigning blame on the Catholic church
or on Pius XII, Vatican observers say, because to go any further in
the apology could create a historical impression that the church
feels is inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to bear in mind that the extermination of the
Jews during the Holocaust was conceived and perpetrated by Hitler,
not by the Catholic Church,'' wrote Lorenzo Cremonesi, a
correspondent covering the pope for the Italian daily Corriere
della Sera.
</P>
<P>
   In his 15-minute speech, the pope addressed the origins of Nazi
ideology, saying, ``How could man have such utter contempt for man?
Because he had reached the point of contempt for God. Only a
godless ideology could plan and carry out the extermination of a
whole people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the audience were dozens of Holocaust survivors, some of them
from the pope's hometown of Wadowice. The town's large prewar
Jewish community was virtually wiped out by the killing and
displacement caused by the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony, six survivors were invited to spend time with
John Paul. And in one of the more symbolic gestures of the day, the
frail pope rose from his chair and walked unsteadily toward the
four men and two women so that it was clear he was coming to them
and not they to him.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was Shlomo Breznic, 64, a Haifa University
psychologist. During the Holocaust, his parents placed him in an
orphanage where Catholic nuns were hiding Jewish children, and
risking their lives to do so. His parents were deported to
Auschwitz, where they were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for the pope. My heart is on his side, not on the side
of those who demand more. He made a big step, a very important step
and one we have been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not saved by the Catholic church, but by a few brave
nuns,'' he said. ``This pope's relationship with the Jews is very
special . ... He made a big breakthrough when one considers the
constraints of the establishment he heads. It is not a closing of
the circle, one cannot close a circle in history in one generation.
It's a shame words like this came so late. But we have to be
grateful they came.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak gave a powerful and stirring
speech that made reference to his maternal grandparents and the
pope's knowledge and sensitivity to the plight of Europe's Jews,
since John Paul was a young seminarian in Poland while the killing
was happening all around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandparents, Elka and Shmuel Godin, mounted the death
trains at Umachlagplatz near their home in Warsaw, headed towards
their fate at Treblinka _ you were there (in Poland), and you
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have done more than anyone else to bring about the
historic change in the attitude of the church toward the Jewish
people,'' Barak said. ``Here, right now, time itself has come to a
standstill. This very moment holds within it 2,000 years of
history. And their weight is almost too much to bear.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With television quiz shows so popular, we thought we'd try a
quiz of our own. Regis won't be reading the questions, but you can
have as many lifelines as you like. There's no $1 million prize at

QUIZ ANSWERS &QL; 
Check to see how you did on the quiz. If you score 24 to 30,
consider yourself a nutrition whiz; 18 to 24, you are nutrition
savvy but could brush up on some of the finer points; 10 to 15,
keep trying and learning about nutrition and food for good health.
</P>
<P>
   1. a) A deck of cards. Two to 3 ounces of cooked lean beef,
poultry with the skin removed, or fish constitutes one serving.
</P>
<P>
   2. True. The better daily choice for including calcium without
the fat is two to three servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy
products, rather than whole or full-fat dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   3. False. According to the American Dietetic Association, being
brown in color does not mean a bread is high in fiber. If the bread
ingredient list notes that it contains whole wheat or other whole
grains, then it probably has fiber. The brown color may be from
caramel coloring. Check the Nutrition Facts label for the number of
grams of fiber per serving.
</P>
<P>
   4. False. Irradiation results in minimal nutrient loss, just
like other forms of food processing, such as drying, freezing and
pasteurization. Irradiation eliminates harmful bacteria and retards
spoilage and has been approved by the FDA for use in red meats,
poultry, fresh fruits and vegetables, and flour and grain products.
</P>
<P>
   5. False. The 98 percent fat-free claim refers to the weight of
the food, not its calories. If a food is labeled fat-free, it
contains .5 grams of fat or less per serving. Read the Nutrition
Facts label for grams of fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   6. False. There is little difference, depending on the handling
of the produce. Canned and frozen produce is generally processed at
its peak and may contain more nutrients than fresh produce.
However, canned or frozen produce may have added sugar or salt,
which should be considered when purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   7. a) 1 cup strawberries. A cup of strawberries has a whopping
85 milligrams of vitamin C - more than an orange's 80 milligrams. A
kiwi runs a close second with 75 milligrams. An apple has only 8
milligrams while a nectarine has only 7. People age 15 and over
need 60 milligrams of vitamin C a day.
</P>
<P>
   8. d) 1 tablespoon apple butter. Apple butter has no fat at all,
because it's made from naturally fat-free apples and has no added
fat. A tablespoon of butter or margarine has 11 to 12 grams fat.
White, tub and light versions have less fat - and because they are
easier to spread, you usually use less. Peanut butter has 4 grams
fat, but it's a cholesterol-free source of protein and contains 1
gram of fiber.
</P>
<P>
   9. a) Two hours. Refrigerate or freeze perishables, prepared
foods and leftovers within two hours or sooner to keep harmful
bacteria from growing and multiplying. If you're not sure about a
food's safety, toss it. When in doubt, throw it out.
</P>
<P>
   10. True. Cholesterol is only found in animal foods. Peanuts are
a plant food.
</P>
<P>
   11. b) 20 to 30 grams. Many of us eat only half the recommended
daily quota of 25 to 30 grams of fiber. You can increase the fiber
in your diet with whole grains (breads, cereals, pasta and rice),
fruits, vegetables and legumes (dried beans and peas).
</P>
<P>
   12. a) Foods of animal origin, such as pork, chicken, fish,
beef, milk, butter and eggs. The key here is cholesterol.
Cholesterol is found only in foods of animal origin. Plants do not
contain cholesterol; however, some contain significant amounts of
fat, such as vegetable oils. Many seafoods are low in fat and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   13. d) All of the above. An eating style that promotes overall
health is based on enjoying a variety of foods from all the food
groups, eating in moderation (using fats, oils and sugar sparingly)
and balancing the kinds of foods consumed (not too much of any one
food).
</P>
<P>
   14. False. Cottage cheese supplies only 65 milligrams of calcium
in a half a cup. If you are eating it for its calcium content, try
more calcium-dense foods such as milk or yogurt, which contain 300
milligrams of calcium per 8 ounces, or 1 ounce of Cheddar cheese,
which contains 200 milligrams of calcium.
</P>
<P>
   15. True. The calorie content of any food depends on its
nutrient content - how much carbohydrate, fat and protein it
contains. A calorie is defined as a unit of energy. One gram of fat
provides 9 calories, while 1 gram of either carbohydrates or
protein supplies 4 calories.
</P>
<P>
   16. False. One teaspoon of salt contains about 2,300 milligrams
of sodium.
</P>
<P>
   17. True. Sodium is a mineral that occurs naturally in food.
Sodium helps maintain proper fluid balance, regulates your blood
pressure, transmits nerve impulses and helps your muscles relax,
including your heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   18. e) All of the above. Eat a variety of in-season fresh fruits
- and opt for frozen, dried and canned to avoid boredom and when
the fresh counterparts are out of season.
</P>
<P>
   19. False. There is no direct link between snacking and body
weight. The issue is total calories, not how often you eat. Your
calorie or energy balance at the end of the day - based on the
number of calories you ate and the number of calories you burned -
determines whether you gain, lose or maintain weight.
</P>
<P>
   20. False. Shell color doesn't affect nutrition quality. The
color of the eggshell varies with the breed of hen.
</P>
<P>
   21. True. The Pyramid is a guideline, not a rigid prescription,
and it contains the building blocks of a healthful diet. It's
designed for all healthy males and females, young and old, age 2 or
older. The minimum serving from the five food groups supplies about
1,600 calories, which is sufficient for inactive and some older
adults. The midpoint in the number of servings suggested provides
about 2,200 calories, a good target for many children, teen-age
girls, active women and inactive men. Teen-age boys, active men and
many athletes may eat from the top of the serving ranges, or about
2,800 calories.
</P>
<P>
   22. b) 30 percent. Nutritionists recommend no more than 30
percent, which includes less than 10 percent of total calories from
saturated fats, about 10 percent from monounsaturated fats and
about 10 percent from polyunsaturated fats.
</P>
<P>
   23. True. Most of your energy should come from carbohydrates,
complex as well as simple. Complex carbohydrates or starches are
found in grains, legumes and vegetables. Sugars, the most simple
form of carbohydrate, are either naturally present in foods, such
as fruit and milk, or added. Either way, your body uses them in the
same way - to fuel body processes and physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   24. a) Sweet potatoes b) mangoes and d) spinach. For vitamin A,
eat plenty of deep yellow, orange and some dark green leafy
vegetables - and some deep yellow fruits. Try to eat at least one
serving daily. Note that although orange juice has some vitamin A,
its better nutrient assets are vitamin C and potassium.
</P>
<P>
   25. False. Low-fat means 3 grams or less of fat per serving.
Reduced or less fat means at least 25 percent less fat per serving.
</P>
<P>
   26. False. Salmon has about 185 calories and 9 fat grams per
3-ounce cooked portion compared with 190 calories and 9 fat grams
in the same portion of roasted, light-meat chicken with the skin
on. Skinless, this same portion of chicken contains about 150
calories and 3 fat grams.
</P>
<P>
   27. True. However, these oils are still 100 percent fat with 120
calories per tablespoon, so they should be used sparingly. The goal
for health is to use oils high in monounsaturated fatty acids
instead of other fats and oils.
</P>
<P>
   28. False. Enriched means adding back nutrients that were lost
during food processing. For example, B vitamins, which are lost
when wheat is refined, are added back to white flour. Fortified
means adding nutrients that weren't present originally. Milk, for
instance, is fortified with vitamin D, a nutrient that helps your
body absorb the calcium and phosphorous in milk.
</P>
<P>
   29. False. Butter and margarine both have 100 calories per
tablespoon.
</P>
<P>
   30. False. Vitamins are not a source of energy, but help convert
food to energy. &QL;

   Risk. Reward. Ker-plunk.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, there was a lot more ker-plunk than reward at the
Tournament Players Course at Sawgrass.
</P>
<P>
   Made even more cranky by a cool, gusting wind, one of the
meanest tracks in the game put player after player over its knee
and delivered a relentless spanking in the first round of The
Players Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The leader board might say Hal Sutton is at the top of golf's
best field. In truth, the real leader is the TPC.
</P>
<P>
   The dreaded island green on the par-3 17th was the primary curse
for everybody from Sergio Garcia to Tiger Woods to Tom Kite. From
young blood to blue blood to orange blood, the 17th
indiscriminately doled out double bogeys or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't just the famous 17th. There was a twice-hit chip
by Craig Stadler immediately after he had whiffed in the deep rough
moments before at the 12th hole. Nick Price shanked a pitch on the
same hole. Fred Couples double-bogeyed two holes on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th hole claimed seven double bogeys. The par-4 18th had a
scoring average almost identical to that of the par-5 16th. The
average score was 76.276, more than four shots over par.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't the water, it was the thick rough that extracted
foul shots and foul language at the tournament known informally as
the fifth major.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this golf course great,'' said Sutton after
he managed a 3-under-par 69 to lead by a shot over seven players.
``There is always that urge to test it, to see if you can do (this
or) that. The risk is there at all times, with a reward out there,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes this a major. Major championships are about
being patient when conditions get difficult on a great golf course
where there is a lot of risk/reward. It takes a lot of patience,
especially on a difficult day.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't come much more difficult than Thursday at the
TPC.
</P>
<P>
   The wind was strong, and the greens were hard and fast. Missing
fairways meant chipping out. Missing greens meant playing for bogey
or taking a drop after taking a bath. It was a day when play was so
slow that 21 players were stopped by darkness.
</P>
<P>
   And it was that rare time when the conditions were more
intimidating than even Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of an ominous feeling going out there, because you
knew you were going to have to hit some really good shots to shoot
well,'' said Jim Furyk, who shot par-72 and was one of only a
handful of afternoon players who stayed within shouting distance of
the lead. ``You could strike some really good shots and still shoot
75 or 76.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 22 players at 80 or above.
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 was an adventure for every group. There were 41 balls hit
into the water surrounding the 17th. Some players, like John Daly
and Duffy Waldorf, found it twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew some things were going to happen, some bad things,''
said David Duval, who shot 75. ``And some of those were going to be
off of good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Duval, Furyk lives a short drive from the TPC. And he was
in awe of the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I've played it a hundred times, I've never played
it like it is this week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who managed a routine par on the 17th, fared better than
everybody else over the course of the day. But he admitted it was a
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to get that 69, because the golf course showed
its teeth,'' he said. ``You couldn't get through without some
bogeys. You just want to stay away from the big numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's fourth hole was a prime example of doing so. He drove
one foot into the rough and had only 120 yards to the front of the
green. But with a creek in front of the green, he wasn't going to
take any chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``That rough is like wire,'' he said. ``It's really gnarly
stuff. I'm looking at my lie there, and, best-case scenario, I
probably could carry the water. But if I don't, I have to get up
and down for a 5 and I've brought 6 into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just chipped into the fairway, knocked the next one on the
green and almost made my par. I made my bogey and walked off.''
</P>
<P>
   With a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   As for the greens: When the golfers are done this weekend, they
could bring the tennis pros in for a little Wimbledon warm-up. The
balls bounce like they're yellow, fuzzy and filled with air rather
than dimpled, balata and filled with whatever technological
breakthrough is hot this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton went on to birdie the par-5 11th hole when he reached the
green in two with a 4-iron and two-putted, then wedged his approach
to 10 feet on the par-4 12th for another birdie. He got to 3-under
when he two-putted the par-5 16th after reaching the green in two.
</P>
<P>
   But Sutton's success was the exception. Check out the list of
players in the 80s: Garcia, Shigeki Maruyama, Bob Estes, Stadler,
Tim Herron and Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Stadler had two triple bogeys on the back nine. His double-hit
chip led to one. Then, after a flop shot flopped, he hit a second
chip at No. 16 into the water behind the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to make sure I hit the second one hard enough,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Woods, winner of 10 of the last 16 tournaments worldwide in
which he has played, wasn't immune to the struggles. He was
cruising along at 3 under par and tied for the lead until he hit a
9-iron that got caught in the wind and came up short on the 17th,
splashing a few yards shy of the bulkhead pylons. His double bogey
left him at 1-under 71.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a little 9-iron, and I tried to hit the ball right at
the bunker and let the wind drift it over,'' Woods said. ``But it
didn't do it and it went in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even after I went in the water, I wasn't upset. Anything
in the red (under par) is good. Under these conditions, if you'd
have told me I could shoot something in the red, I'd have been
happy. I figured I'd make my double (at 17), play 18 and still
shoot a number in the red.''
</P>
<P>
   Which he did. The main thing for Woods is that he remains
solidly in the hunt to continue his dominance. The last player to
have 10 victories in a shorter period of time than Woods' recent
success was Byron Nelson, who won 11 in a row in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was survival more than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can get your name on the leader board or close to
it in the first round, you've done your job,'' said Lee Janzen, who
shot 2-under 70 and was tied for second with six others.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, there were some cries that the course was becoming
unplayable by midafternoon, when scores ballooned the worst amid
capricious zephyrs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You definitely want to keep the golf course fair, which, if
the wind keeps blowing, is going to be hard to do,'' said Billy
Mayfair.

ROBINSON REPLACES FTOREK AS DEVILS COACH  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned by a recent slump and determined to avoid the early
playoff exit that has become a disturbing habit for them in recent
seasons, the New Jersey Devils Thursday dismissed their coach,
Robbie Ftorek, and replaced him with Larry Robinson, one of his
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   It was a drastic move by a team that has the third-best record
in the NHL and is in first place in the Eastern Conference. But it
was one that Lou Lamoriello, the team's president and general
manager, believed was necessary after watching the team lose 12 of
its previous 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was over a period of time that I thought about this because
I didn't see light at the end of the tunnel,'' Lamoriello said in a
conference call announcing the change. ``The decision was reached
because I felt we should change direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about taking such drastic action with only eight games
left, Lamoriello said he felt comfortable with the decision because
Robinson represented continuity at the coaching level. He said that
Robinson was familiar with the team and the players and added, ``It
would be too late if I waited any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's first task will be to restore to the team some
chemistry that clearly has been missing for the last month. Several
of the team's veterans were disgruntled with Ftorek, but they kept
it under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   The move reflects the franchise's misgivings about Ftorek's
ability to lead a talented team deep into the playoffs. The last
three seasons the Devils have exited the postseason earlier than
expected, losing in the second round in 1997 and in the first round
the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils were acquired by the YankeeNets on March 17 for $175
million, but Lamoriello said Thursday that the new owners had
nothing to do with his decision. ``The new ownership respected the
judgments I've made,'' Lamoriello said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are signs that the move may be the beginning of a
more hands-on approach by the YankeeNets organization.
</P>
<P>
   At a Yankee loss last week, George Steinbrenner, the New York
Yankees' principal owner, was fending of questions about the team's
poor spring training record when he said that changes would be
coming, but not with the Yankees. The inference was clearly to
other teams under the Yankee umbrella. Also, according to a Yankee
official, people in the organization have been watching tapes of
Devils games since early in the season _ just as they had studied
New Jersey Nets games before the YankeeNets merger was completed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without any consistency the last month, the Devils
(41-25-8) have shown no signs of improvement. They played with
little inspiration in losing three of their last four games. Just
as importantly, the Devils are in serious danger of losing the
Eastern Conference title to the Philadelphia Flyers, who trailed
the Devils by three points entering Thursday night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello admitted Thursday that he had deliberated the
decision for several days because of the way his team had been
playing. The 5-0 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes on Tuesday must
have reinforced his conviction that a change was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   When Robinson was appointed assistant coach last May, he said he
had no intention of becoming the head coach and did not want to
lurk over Ftorek's shoulder. Lamoriello said that Robinson reminded
him of that when he approached him to take over the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry reminded me that when he was hired he had no intention
to be the head coach, but I told him he was the best person to lead
the team,'' Lamoriello said. After a practice Thursday at the
Nassau Coliseum, where the Devils play the New York Islanders
Friday night, Robinson said: ``Lou said he wanted to meet with me.
I stood there with my wife and thought `Oh no. Uh-oh. Oh no.' I
thought that's what it was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way did I want to come here lurking to be the next head
coach,'' said Robinson, who won six Stanley Cups with Montreal and
was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was considered a key to the Devils' winning the Stanley
Cup in 1995 when he was the assistant to Jacques Lemaire. Robinson
left the Devils to be the head coach of the Los Angeles Kings and
returned to the Devils after coaching the Kings for three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lamoriello said he had a high regard for Ftorek, who has been
with the organization for nine years, the last two as head coach,
when he amassed a record of 88-49-19. Lamoriello said Ftorek would
stay on in the organization in some capacity. ``He has the option
of staying as long as he sees fit,'' Lamoriello said.
</P>
<P>
   At practice Thursday, Devils players said that no matter who is
coaching, the burden was on them to pull out of the slump. ``It's
still up to us, the guys in this room, to get it done,'' said
defenseman Scott Stevens. ``Obviously we're going to get a little
different direction in different areas with Larry. Not a big
difference, little things, like positioning. Get things cut and dry
a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bold move with eight games left in the season,'' said
the right wing Randy McKay. ``The easy way is to point the finger
at one person. It's a drastic change and it's up to us to turn it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the players accepted responsibility, there was thought
that a strain had developed between Ftorek and many of the players,
especially the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In the first month of the season, the defenseman Ken Daneyko was
benched in St. Louis. It would have been Daneyko's 999th career
game, meaning his next one, No. 1000, would have been played at
home. But by sitting Daneyko in St. Louis, Ftorek assured that
Daneyko's milestone game would be played on the road, infuriating
Daneyko and annoying many of the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Ftorek also benched the defenseman Lyle Odelein on more than one
occasion for no apparent reason. Players said they often did not
understand Ftorek's logic, and would regularly wonder ``what
riddle,'' as they put it, Ftorek would come up with each day
</P>
<P>
   One of Ftorek's problems in recent games was that he was unable
to blend into the lineup the team's newest acquisitions, Vladimir
Malkahov and Alexander Mogilny. The two Russians simply have not
played up to expectations, especially Mogilny, who has just two
assists in his four games with the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello insisted Thursday that he had no input from players
about his decision. He said it was his ``responsibility to
recognize what was going on'' with his team.

SPORTS COLUMN: LAMORIELLO IN RANGERS' FUTURE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sudden sacking of Robbie Ftorek as coach could be the
beginning of the end for the Devils' organization as their
loyalists have come to know and love it, if not the beginning of
what could be Lou Lamoriello's eventual takeover of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   And if Lamoriello does become a Lincoln Tunnel commuter, Devils
loyalists should feel free to blame George Steinbrenner and the
YankeeNets combine.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Devils third over all in the National Hockey
League with 95 points and only eight regular-season games
remaining, Lamoriello decided that the Atlantic Division leaders
had lost what he described as their ``ice discipline'' under Ftorek
during a 5-10-2 slump that hit bottom in Tuesday night's 5-0 loss
to the Carolina Hurricanes at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we were playing,'' Lamoriello said Thursday, ``I
didn't see the light.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Devils' president and general manager did see was a
hockey team stumbling through the darkness toward the Stanley Cup
playoffs, ripe for a first-round embarrassment for the third
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to be more specific about what he meant by the loss of ice
discipline, Lamoriello stick-handled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not playing up to our capabilities,'' he said. ``Whatever that
means.''
</P>
<P>
   To lead the Devils out of that darkness, Lamoriello promoted
Larry Robinson as Ftorek's successor. As a Canadiens defenseman two
decades ago, Robinson was considered hockey's heavyweight champion.
But as a head coach with the Los Angeles Kings for four seasons
between terms as a respected Devils assistant to Jacques Lemaire
and Ftorek, he inspired only one playoff team.
</P>
<P>
   When the Devils rehired Robinson last summer, hockey people
nodded knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   Following the Devils' seven-game swan dive against the Penguins
in last year's playoffs, Lamoriello now had Robinson if the Devils
sputtered. And they have.
</P>
<P>
   Moves like this have established Lamoriello's reputation as the
NHL's chess master, its most respected general manager. But this
surprising change of coaches this late in the season also involves
what looms as Lamoriello's last stand: trying to win a second
Stanley Cup for John McMullen, who has sold the Devils for $175
million to the new YankeeNets combine controlled by Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Lamoriello insisted that the YankeeNets ownership, which will
not officially take over until July, had no input in Ftorek's
firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They,'' Lamoriello said of the new ownership, ``respect the
judgments I have made and will make until they take over.''
</P>
<P>
   But when YankeeNets does take over, Lamoriello will be a
front-office free agent _ free to retire and enjoy his reported
share of at least $25 million in the Devils' sale, free to stay
with the Devils if the new ownership is smart and offers to retain
him, free to join another team as its general manager if he is
smart.
</P>
<P>
   And why couldn't that team be the Rangers?
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers miss the playoffs for the third straight year as
they seem destined to do, the Madison Square Garden honchos might
decide that Neil Smith is expendable, especially if Lamoriello were
to show any willingness to defect to the Devils' fiercest rival.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that McMullen is a buddy of Charles F. Dolan, the
Garden impresario.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan, like every other NHL club owner, knows that under
Lamoriello, the Devils not only have been a more consistent winner
_ at least during the regular season _ than the Rangers lately but
have done it with a relatively inexpensive payroll, currently a
bargain $37.6 million compared with the Rangers' wasteful $61.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Also keep in mind that Lamoriello's coaching change could
backfire. Ranger historians remember 1989, when Phil Esposito, then
the general manager, fired Michel Bergeron and took command behind
the bench for the final two games. The Rangers lost both games,
then were swept by the Penguins in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Esposito was gone and Neil Smith was hired.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly only 3 points ahead of Philadelphia before the Flyers'
game with the Kings' last night, the Devils play five of their
eight remaining games on the road, beginning Friday night with
back-to-back visits to the Islanders and to Toronto before going to
Pittsburgh on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   But for better or for worse, Larry Robinson is now behind the
bench.

U.S. TELLS U.N. THAT DUES PROBLEM MAY THREATEN PEACEKEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ With other countries resisting the U.S. effort
to lower its dues to the United Nations, the U.S. representative on
Thursday warned that failure to revamp the payment system could put
international peacekeeping in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1996 act of Congress, the United States stopped paying
its 31 percent assessment for peacekeeping operations, unilaterally
lowering it to 25 percent and thus falling steadily deeper into
debt. The Clinton administration also made a deal with Congress to
cut regular budget payments, from 25 percent to 22.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, now has to win agreement
from 187 other, very reluctant, nations. His chances of succeeding,
most diplomats say, are not good.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeeping, however, is supported by many nations, and the
prospect of its collapse if assessments are not restructured _ and
not just for the United States _ attracts attention.
</P>
<P>
   As he shifted the focus from regular budget dues to
peacekeeping, Holbrooke picked up some support from Russia. Before
a crucial session of the General Assembly finance committee
Thursday, the Russian representative, Sergey Lavrov, and Holbrooke
issued a joint statement saying that they had agreed ``to intensify
Russian-American cooperation in the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   But an hour later in open debate _ a session that amounted to
the full General Assembly's sitting as a finance committee _ Lavrov
joined other nations in rejecting a deal with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is open to reforming the assessment scale based on
capacity to pay, Lavrov said, adding, ``At the same time, there
should not be any doubt that the principle of real capacity to pay
is inseparable from member states' responsibility to fulfill their
financial obligations without conditions and demands.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Russia, despite its economic difficulties, paid in
full its current contribution to the regular budget and has for six
years made payments to peacekeeping budgets that exceed its annual
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese representative was more blunt, saying that although
China did not object to a review, it did question how in today's
economy the United States could ask for a reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that reform means only the lowering of the ceiling,''
said China's new representative, Wang Yingfan. He noted that the
``major contributor'' _ he did not name the United States _ is now
assessed at 25 percent of the regular budget, even though its share
of the world economy, the rough guide to assessments, is 27
percent.
</P>
<P>
   China does not pay dues equal to its share of the world economy
because it is given a discount based on the low per capita income
of its 1.2 billion people, a situation that many other governments
criticize.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's representative, Robert Fowler, speaking also for
Australia and New Zealand, suggested that members should look for
more effective ways to punish debtors. The Canadian message was pay
up first and then we can talk about changing things.
</P>
<P>
   By the United Nations' accounts, the United States owes more
than half the total $3 billion in unpaid dues.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, under huge pressure from Congress to curb
peacekeeping costs, is arguing here and around the world that
United Nations efforts in that field need to be strengthened, not
weakened, but that there will have to be a more equitable sharing
of costs. Many nations are given discounts on peacekeeping bills
based on quarter-century-old calculations. And there is no system
to update peacekeeping assessments, as there is for the general
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, some of the defects of the U.N. system are at
such a scale that they seriously threaten our core goals,
especially peacekeeping,'' Holbrooke said in his speech Thursday.
``If not corrected, they could threaten the future of the
institution itself.

 &HT;    Road warriors: Lady Bulldogs welcome travel
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ With nearly 20,000 miles logged on their season
already, what's another 4,200-mile round trip for the Georgia Lady
Bulldogs?
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's ambition for a second consecutive Final Four takes a
roundabout route this weekend in the West Regional. There, the Lady
Dogs play North Carolina on Saturday night in the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   It is the longest journey of the season for the Lady Dogs, who
have been to New England, Virginia, Texas and California and to
Illinois twice in their nonconference schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately, we've been taking charter flights or buses for some of
our SEC games, usually coming back the night of the game,'' Georgia
coach Andy Landers said. ``We're a little bit excited about going
back out on the road like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Dogs won the Preseason NIT in Champaign, Ill., as well
as tournaments at Maine, Houston and Long Beach State. They made a
second trip to the Midwest, losing a regular-season game at
Illinois on Jan. 2, and finished up their SEC road swing at
Kentucky and Arkansas in the same week.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, through flight delays, time in hotels, countless
communal meals and trips to malls and movie theaters, they resolved
what coaches and players conceded had been problems in team unity
the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Landers purposely wanted to take his troops on the
road to get them ready for the long haul of NCAA play in March. The
Lady Dogs have had only 11 games at home, including their first two
wins in the NCAA Tournament last weekend. The time spent away from
home has been beneficial off the court as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing out of the ordinary,'' senior forward Angie Ball
said. ``It's just being together a lot, talking and laughing and
coming up with inside jokes. We've all learned to appreciate each
other a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The correct word for it is maturity,'' Landers said. ``We had
people coming in from a lot of places and a lot of different
backgrounds, and they all needed time to get to know each other and
get comfortable with each other. They've been very professional in
how they've handled it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball, from Toronto, watched La'Keshia Frett, Tracy Henderson and
Kedra Holland-Corn from the bench as a freshman. The next year, the
arrival of Kelly and Coco Miller and others brought substantial
roster changes, and it took time to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably gotten to know the twins better than anybody,''
Ball said. ``When they first got here, they were so quiet, and they
really kept to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Reserve guard Camille Murphy has taken freshman guard and
roommate Tameiko Washington of Tennille under her wings, guiding
her through the same familiarity process she went through a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traveling has really pulled us together more as a family
unit,'' said Murphy, who is from Syracuse, N.Y. ``If you can get
people to cooperate and like each other off the court, then
whatever you do on the court is magnified even more.''

 Eric V. Copage, a reporter for the City Weekly section of The New
York Times, writes about culture.  
 By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Limor Tomer, a Juilliard-trained pianist and former
music history teacher at New York University, descended into the
dim light of the basement of Two Boots, an East Village pizzeria.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the owners of the pizzeria had used the
basement, called the Den, sporadically for video nights and private
parties. But now Tomer, walking around the 500-square-foot space,
was evaluating it for her own use.
</P>
<P>
   She looked at the size of the sound board, the size and quality
of the speakers and the postage stamp-size stage in the corner,
then smiled. ``The room holds 50 people, but it has a comfortable
vibe,'' Tomer said recently. ``It is completely open. It doesn't
say drum-and-bass or jazz or classical. So anything could be played
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, in the brave world of new music in New York,
versatility is the key word. Tomer is one of a small but avid group
of advocates who are presenting music that falls between the cracks
of genres. It is music that won't fill 600-seat auditoriums but may
be the wellspring for mainstream music to come. Call Tomer and her
ilk downtown Diaghilevs, mini-impresarios, or settle for a less
grandiose term, music curator.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, while they usually work on a small scale, what they
do is hugely important to the artistic soul of New York. In an
environment in which culture is straitjacketed and niche-marketed
at warp speed, they are keeping in circulation its most precious
artistic currencies: experimentation, risk taking and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these edgy impresarios have a steady venue; some are
peripatetic and, like sonic Johnny Appleseeds, move from church to
cafe to bar to basement, as well as smaller traditional venues
throughout the city, to find places for unfamiliar, often
challenging, music. They differ from nightclub bookers in that they
are not primarily trying to fill up a space. They differ from the
typical concert producer in that they are not merely signing up an
artist.
</P>
<P>
   They are on a personal mission: exposing others to the music
about which they are enthusiastic. Even when the music is not hard
to classify _ like German lieder or chamber music _ they are
putting that familiar music in unfamiliar places, and thereby
cross-pollinating audiences.
</P>
<P>
   George Steel, who is the executive director of the 685-seat
Miller Theater at Columbia University, also uses smaller venues
downtown. ``It's a wonderful period of transition in terms of
instrumentation, in terms of the amount of improvisation,'' he
said. Steel recently presented a concert by the chamber group the
Absolute Ensemble at the Flea, a 75-seat theater in TriBeCa. It
featured a chamber transcription of the Mahler Fourth Symphony with
a part for a Yamaha DX7 electronic keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   He presented the concert at the Flea because, he said, ``you can
grab a beer and go into the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The social pressure is off the audience to behave in the usual
prom-night fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Steel's next downtown adventure will be in July, when he
presents contemporary classical music at the Cornelia St. Cafe in
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   David Linton, a composer specializing in electronic music, has a
somewhat different approach to curating. His idea is that
presentations should be a cross between a party and a concert, a
kind of switched-on Lilith Fair, without the feminist slant.
</P>
<P>
   The artists in his shows specialize in electronically generated
sounds, ranging from techno to Morton Subotnick-like sheets of
sound. Linton has put on shows in places like Context Studios, a
performance space, and the basement lounge at CBGB's, both in the
East Village, as well 168 Bar in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   His SoHo loft was the original home of Sound Lab, an underground
club for electronic music. His latest curatorial project, Unity
Gain, a series of freewheeling works by composers, will be
presented the first Wednesday of every month at Galapagos, a bar
and gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Some of the composers will
show up at virtually every presentation, and others will
participate less frequently, resulting in a mix of new and old
music so that audiences will never know exactly what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   This mixing and blending of musics and audiences stems from
several factors. An increasing number of musicians feel at home in
more than one musical genre. Even a musician devoted to classical
music, for instance, cannot escape the dissonant harmonies that are
frequently found in movie soundtracks or the African music played
in the background music at an upscale coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet audiences seem increasingly segmented, as record companies
and concert promoters stream performers into a given niche.
``People into one thing tend not to cross over into another
thing,'' said Tomer, who also curates three nights a week for the
BAM cafe at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and organizes a monthly
series of classical music at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater in the
East Village.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the growing segmentation is the price of
tickets. When $20 to $25 tickets are the cheapest seats, everybody,
musician, curator and institution alike, can feel the creeping
conservatism higher ticket prices might inspire. Conversely, when
the entrance fee is about the same as a movie ticket, musicians and
curators feel freer to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, artists dedicated to their art will eventually find
places to perform, especially in today's New York City, where a
booming economy has put a new performance nook on nearly every
block. But through their passion, these music curators facilitate
exposure. Many are performers or former performers who see their
role as advocating and nurturing colleagues rather than merely
pushing acts.
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenon of music curating in New York can be traced back,
if not to the prewar Copland-Sessions concerts, then at least to
1960, when the composer La Monte Young ran a series of concerts in
Yoko Ono's Chambers Street loft. In 1971, Rhys Chatham became the
first curator at the Kitchen, an alternative performance space then
in Soho.
</P>
<P>
   And while curators like Phill Niblock, who runs the Experimental
Intermedia concerts, Thomas Buckner of the Interpretations Series
and Jim Staley of Roulette have been active for decades, today's
curators face vastly different challenges. For years, there was
little interest from the uptown crowd. But today happenings
downtown travel uptown at warp speed.
</P>
<P>
   NBC recently opened a theater space called P.S. NBC at the Here
Arts Center in SoHo, one of the city's leading alternative
theatrical spaces. The purpose? To scout talent for the network.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, over the last several years mainstream music
institutions have noted the increased openness of their audiences
and taken steps to exploit it. Lincoln Center has used its summer
festival to explore fringier territory like ``The Electronic Ordo
Virtutum,'' a new interpretation of Hildegard von Bingen's
12th-century proto opera.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, it has turned to smaller venues _ the 600-seat John
Jay College Theater and the 500-seat New Victory Theater _ to
present more experimental productions during its regular season.
Carnegie Hall is also building a more flexible setting for music,
the Judy and Arthur Zankel Hall, to expand the kinds of programming
it presents.
</P>
<P>
   Will today's music curators and their close relationships with
artists be ennobled by alliances with larger institutions, given
greater budgets and more freedom? Or will they be made virtually
obsolete, gobbled up by mainstream venues?
</P>
<P>
   The betting is that there will always be lofts, bars and living
rooms where people working in what will always be the no man's land
of experimental music will gather. There will always be those who
take joy in seeking out relationships with fringe artists, and
midwifing a musician from obscurity to an appreciative audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's late after a performance at Tomer's Saturday Balkan Cabaret
at the Den at Two Boots. The musicians are packing, but the
audience is still lingering _ talking, basking in the
reverberations of the music. Asked what she would do if the music
she is so passionate about suddenly went mainstream, Tomer knitted
her brow and offered an idealistic response: ``If what I am
interested in becomes popular enough to support itself, if it
creates enough momentum to garner bigger institutions, then I am
gone. I will go on to the next uncharted area.''

LEGISLATORS PLAN RESPONSE TO JUSTICES' RULING ON FDA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Texas, Miss., Ariz., Mass.)   By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Against long odds, antismoking advocates expect to
push next week for legislation to overturn Tuesday's Supreme Court
decision that bars regulation of the tobacco industry by the Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican who is also a heart
surgeon, said in an interview Thursday he was ``likely'' to
introduce legislation next week drawn from the 1998 bill that died
in a Senate filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Frist had drafted the part of that year's tobacco bill giving
the FDA the specific regulatory authority that the Supreme Court
ruled the agency had improperly assumed for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Reed, the White House aide who handles tobacco issues,
said that President Clinton would get involved in the issue after
his return from Asia and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed said that even though the FDA provisions of the 1998
bill had bipartisan support, it would be hard to get them through
``the current Congress,'' which he said had a ``lousy record'' on
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Republican majority leaders in both houses of
Congress Thursday reiterated their opposition to any FDA tobacco
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Michele A. Davis, an aide to Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, said
Armey believed ``the FDA already has too much power.'' John
Czwartacki, press secretary for Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi,
said Lott stood by his reaction to the Supreme Court ruling on
Tuesday, when he said the agency already took too long to get drugs
and medical procedures approved and did not need more duties.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who led the fight for
the 1998 bill, has shown little inclination to take up the cause
again. Having encountered the influence of the special interests,
especially the tobacco companies and their clout before in a $50
million campaign,'' he said on Tuesday, ``I can tell you that I'm
not optimistic that we will be able to get that done until we have
campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry advertised heavily against the 1998 bill, saying
its tax increases would not curb smoking but just make it more
expensive for the poor. Except for two Democrats from
tobacco-growing states, though, the only senators who voted to kill
the bill were Republicans, who for years have received the bulk of
contributions from the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis released Thursday by the Center for Responsive
Politics showed that pattern was continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Examining contributions reported to the Federal Election
Commission from Jan. 1, 1999, through March 1, 2000, it found that
82 percent of the industry's $2,587,106 in contributions by
political action committees and individuals and in soft money,
which can come directly from corporations, had gone to Republicans.
The GOP received $2,125,920, and Democrats received $454,936.
</P>
<P>
   A leading antismoking lobbyist, Matthew Myers, president of the
Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called the opposition of Republican
leaders to any legislation ``a real testament to the campaign
finance system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision, some industry
spokesmen have suggested that they would accept some regulation in
exchange for some kind of protection from lawsuit verdicts or
federal encouragement for their efforts to produce cigarettes less
threatening to the health of smokers.
</P>
<P>
   But Reed scoffed at that idea. ``I don't think the court's
position put the industry in any stronger bargaining position than
it was before,'' he said. ``It's still unpopular. It's still on the
ropes in court. It's still outside the political mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the planned legislation, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, the senior Democrat on Frist's subcommittee on
public health and a major foe of the tobacco industry, said, ``I
think it's got life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Lott's expected opposition was the main obstacle.
Otherwise, Kennedy said, ``The Senate could act quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted legislation was necessary: ``Youth smoking is a
genuine crisis. The tobacco companies are shameless in trying to
hook kids on smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   Frist spoke in more measured terms. He called youth smoking
``the number one public health challenge in this country today.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that, ``If we are going to truly reduce youth smoking,
then government regulation is going to be required.''
</P>
<P>
   Frist said he wanted to talk to more colleagues and review the
court's opinions and the 1998 legislation to decide whether the FDA
was indeed the best regulatory agency for that job. But he said he
thought he was likely to reach the same conclusion he had
previously and put forward an FDA bill.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, the antismoking lobbyist, said that ``it's too early to
declare'' the legislation dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Senator Frist introduces it and moderate Republicans
support it, then there could be a real push,'' he said. ``Then it
will depend on how hard the Republican leadership opposes it.''

   The classic six degrees of  &UR; Kevin Bacon &LR;  game presents the
challenge of connecting any actor to Bacon, the links being movies
in which both parties have appeared. For instance, writes
 &UR; Malcolm Gladwell  &LR; in ``The Turning Point'' (Little, Brown;
$24.95), &UR; O.J. Simpson &LR;  was in ``Naked Gun'' with  &UR; Priscilla &LR; 
 &UR; Presley &LR; , who was in ``Ford Fairlane'' with  &UR; Gilbert &LR;   &UR; Gottfried &LR; ,
who was in ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' with  &UR; Paul Reiser &LR; , who was in
``Diner'' with Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   On average, writes Gladwell, citing computer studies by a
scientist at the University of Virginia, actors are 2.8312 steps
from  &UR; Kevin Bacon &LR; . That makes Bacon 669th in a ranking of the
``connectedness'' of Hollywood actors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top 15 people, with the lowest numbers of steps, are
 &UR; Robert Mitchum &LR; ,  &UR; Gene Hackman &LR; ,  &UR; Donald Sutherland &LR; ,  &UR; Shelley &LR; 
 &UR; Winters  &LR; and  &UR; Burgess Meredith &LR; , perhaps because they've each made
many movies. The No. 1 well-connected actor:  &UR; Rod Steiger &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The reason, writes Gladwell, is Steiger's range. ``He's been in
38 dramas, 12 crime pictures and comedies, 11 thrillers, eight
action films, seven Westerns, six war movies, four documentaries,
three horror flicks, two sci-fi films, a musical and more.'' He has
managed to act with everyone ``because he has managed to move up
and down and back and forth among all the different worlds and
subcultures and niches and levels that the acting profession has to
offer.''

 &UR; FAVORITE FLICKS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles magazine says that  &UR; Yasser Arafat &LR; 's favorite movie
is ``Pretty Woman,'' which aides say he's seen 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The Earth Island Journal has bestowed its 1999 Brown Screen
Award for the ``Least Environmentally Sensitive Film'' to ``You've
Got Mail.'' EIJ calls the movie a ``sappy celebration of franchise
fascism'' with a terrible message, that ``the death of small-town
values is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. The  &UR; Ayn Rand &LR;  Institute says that this year's Oscar
nominees reflect a ``culture of decay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is the barometer of a culture,'' says senior writer
 &UR; Robert Tracinski &LR; . ``That which we view as good or great art is a
window to our most fundamental moral values and convictions. The
nominees for best picture fall, broadly, into two categories: the
`realistic' film such as `American Beauty' that depicts the essence
of human nature as depraved and amoral, and the `uplifting' film
such as `The Sixth Sense' that depicts morality as possible only in
a mystical realm.'' The Randians didn't mention ``The Cider House
Rules.''

   _ &UR; Firat Yener  &LR; was at one of those late-night San Francisco
clubs last week when  &UR; Liza Minnelli &LR; , looking particularly
unglamorous, came in with her entourage. When no one recognized
her, the club sent minions out into the crowd to inform them that
she was there, in an effort to create the customary and expected
fuss over the diva.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; QUICK TURN-AROUND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In November, the heirs of San Francisco museum benefactor
 &UR; Madeleine Haas Russell  &LR; put up for auction some of the art she had
bequeathed to them, including  &UR; Giovanni Segantini &LR; 's ``Springtime
in the Alps,'' which had hung at the Palace of the Legion of Honor
from 1924 until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, auctioned by Christie's, fetched $9.5 million, far
above its estimate of $4 million to $6 million. It was bought by
 &UR; Martin Zimet &LR; , owner of the French &AMP; Co. Gallery in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's heirs are probably gnashing their teeth at the news,
reported in the New York Times this week, that Zimet has put the
painting on sale for $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: ``Describe a movie scene that provides the best insight &LR; 
 &UR; into the relationship between the sexes.'' A: ``The scene in &LR; 
 &UR; `Bob &AMP; Carol and Ted &AMP; Alice' in which they're all ready to have &LR; 
 &UR; their supposed tryst and they all just lose it. ... I think that &LR; 
 &UR; probably sums up the relationship between men and women: the &LR; 
 &UR; bravado, the come- &LR; 
 &UR; ons, the possibilities, the fantasies and then, when it comes &LR; 
 &UR; down to it, for a lot of people, this empty experience.'' &LR;

$24.95), &UR; O.J. Simpson &LR;  was in ``Naked Gun'' with  &UR; Priscilla &LR; 
 &UR; Presley &LR; , who was in ``Ford Fairlane'' with  &UR; Gilbert &LR;   &UR; Gottfried &LR; ,
who was in ``Beverly Hills Cop II'' with  &UR; Paul Reiser &LR; , who was in
``Diner'' with Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   On average, writes Gladwell, citing computer studies by a
scientist at the University of Virginia, actors are 2.8312 steps
from  &UR; Kevin Bacon &LR; . That makes Bacon 669th in a ranking of the
``connectedness'' of Hollywood actors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top 15 people, with the lowest numbers of steps, are
 &UR; Robert Mitchum &LR; ,  &UR; Gene Hackman &LR; ,  &UR; Donald Sutherland &LR; ,  &UR; Shelley &LR; 
 &UR; Winters  &LR; and  &UR; Burgess Meredith &LR; , perhaps because they've each made
many movies. The No. 1 well-connected actor:  &UR; Rod Steiger &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The reason, writes Gladwell, is Steiger's range. ``He's been in
38 dramas, 12 crime pictures and comedies, 11 thrillers, eight
action films, seven Westerns, six war movies, four documentaries,
three horror flicks, two sci-fi films, a musical and more.'' He has
managed to act with everyone ``because he has managed to move up
and down and back and forth among all the different worlds and
subcultures and niches and levels that the acting profession has to
offer.''

 &UR; FAVORITE FLICKS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles magazine says that  &UR; Yasser Arafat &LR; 's favorite movie
is ``Pretty Woman,'' which aides say he's seen 20 times.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. The Earth Island Journal has bestowed its 1999 Brown Screen
Award for the ``Least Environmentally Sensitive Film'' to ``You've
Got Mail.'' EIJ calls the movie a ``sappy celebration of franchise
fascism'' with a terrible message, that ``the death of small-town
values is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   P.P.S. The  &UR; Ayn Rand &LR;  Institute says that this year's Oscar
nominees reflect a ``culture of decay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Art is the barometer of a culture,'' says senior writer
 &UR; Robert Tracinski &LR; . ``That which we view as good or great art is a
window to our most fundamental moral values and convictions. The
nominees for best picture fall, broadly, into two categories: the
`realistic' film such as `American Beauty' that depicts the essence
of human nature as depraved and amoral, and the `uplifting' film
such as `The Sixth Sense' that depicts morality as possible only in
a mystical realm.'' The Randians didn't mention ``The Cider House
Rules.''

 &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Firat Yener  &LR; was at one of those late-night San Francisco
clubs last week when  &UR; Liza Minnelli &LR; , looking particularly
unglamorous, came in with her entourage. When no one recognized
her, the club sent minions out into the crowd to inform them that
she was there, in an effort to create the customary and expected
fuss over the diva.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; QUICK TURN-AROUND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In November, the heirs of San Francisco museum benefactor
 &UR; Madeleine Haas Russell  &LR; put up for auction some of the art she had
bequeathed to them, including  &UR; Giovanni Segantini &LR; 's ``Springtime
in the Alps,'' which had hung at the Palace of the Legion of Honor
from 1924 until recently.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, auctioned by Christie's, fetched $9.5 million, far
above its estimate of $4 million to $6 million. It was bought by
 &UR; Martin Zimet &LR; , owner of the French &AMP; Co. Gallery in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's heirs are probably gnashing their teeth at the news,
reported in the New York Times this week, that Zimet has put the
painting on sale for $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: ``Describe a movie scene that provides the best insight &LR; 
 &UR; into the relationship between the sexes.'' A: ``The scene in &LR; 
 &UR; `Bob &AMP; Carol and Ted &AMP; Alice' in which they're all ready to have &LR; 
 &UR; their supposed tryst and they all just lose it. ... I think that &LR; 
 &UR; probably sums up the relationship between men and women: the &LR; 
 &UR; bravado, the come- &LR; 
 &UR; ons, the possibilities, the fantasies and then, when it comes &LR; 
 &UR; down to it, for a lot of people, this empty experience.'' &LR;

 STATE-ADKINS-TEX 
COWBOYS' ADKINS DOES IT ALL _ QUIETLY (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Desmond Mason scores and dunks. Doug Gottlieb passes. Brian
Montonati rebounds and plays defense. Glendon Alexander shoots and
makes 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State is still playing in the NCAA Tournament because
those players have blended their various skills. Joe Adkins does
all of that. The 6-1 senior guard from Oklahoma City is Oklahoma
State's silent and unnoticed most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins is a major reason why the third-seeded Cowboys (26-6)
have reached the Sweet 16, where they'll face No. 10 seed Seton
Hall (22-9) on Friday night. Top-seed Duke (29-4) plays
fifth-seeded Florida (26-7) in the other East Regional semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he gets the credit he deserves,'' Oklahoma State
assistant coach Sean Sutton said. ``He's just about our best
on-the-ball defender, night-in and night-out. He can score points,
handle the ball, make free throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Adkins statistics are modest _ 11 points per game, 3.4 rebounds
per game, 4.1 assists per game. But twice he has scored 21 points
this season; three times he has had eight or more rebounds; twice
he has had nine assists. Adkins, who was named an honorable mention
All-American by The Associated Press, is the Cowboys' Mr. Fix It.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Joe comes out there, he gets something done
regardless of what it is,'' said Mason, the senior guard/forward
from Waxahachie who averages a team-best 18.3 points per game.
``There are days when he comes out and scores and there are other
days when he dishes the ball. And he's always been a good defensive
player.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first-round victory over Hofstra, Alexander held Craig
``Speedy'' Claxton to 20 points on 7-of-18 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, it's about pride,'' said Adkins, who usually
fills the role as the Cowboys' designated defender on perimeter
scorers. ``Watching film of Hofstra, I saw that Claxton had scored
40 a couple of times. I was like, `Nah, I can't let him get 40 on
me in front of all those people.' Plus, everybody is watching back
home on TV, so if I get lit up, they're going to let me know about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State is likely to need some perimeter defense against
the upstart Pirates. In two NCAA Tournament victories, Seton Hall
is shooting 52.2 percent from 3-point range. In a second-round
upset of second-seeded Temple, Seton Hall was 15-of-30 from 3-point
range.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins is not shy about shooting. He weathered a January slump
that saw him make just 28 percent of his field-goal attempts. But
in the 12 games since the calendar flipped to February, Adkins has
raised his shooting percentage to 40 percent while averaging 14.3
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   The past two seasons, Adkins has won the Mr. Clutch award
presented by the Oklahoma State coaching staff. Whether it's
game-clinching free throws or an attempt to beat the shot clock,
Adkins is the Cowboys' best option.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he brings to the table is his confidence,'' Sutton said.
``He's not afraid to take the big shot when the game is on the
line. The game is hanging in the balance and he just jumps up and
takes and makes a big shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a streaky shooter. But he never lets things effect him.
That's a great quality to have.''
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma State's second-round victory over Pepperdine, Adkins
hit two 3-pointers during his team's game-clinching spurt. After
the first, he did an Austin Powers-like ``Yeah, baby'' and after
the other _ set up by a sweet pump fake _ Adkins performed a
body-shake boogie.
</P>
<P>
   And after the game, the microphones and notepads crowded around
Mason, Gottlieb and high-scorer Fredrik Jonzen. Adkins was wide
open.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really worry about that,'' Adkins said of his low
profile. ``Those guys deserve all the hype because they're our best
players. I just kind of go along with the flow. We need guys who
just go out and make plays when we need them. That's why I try to
do.'' nn

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26)  
 (af)  
 By JENNIFER FREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could call Avis Gold's exercise area a home gym. But then
you could call the palace at Versailles a building.
</P>
<P>
   The glass-enclosed workout center at Gold's home in Purchase,
N.Y., has nine pieces of equipment worthy of a health club,
including the giant Trotter MG2300 multigym _ a $12,000 weight
machine with a dozen stations. The adjoining spa, done with Italian
marble mosaics, includes an eight-person hot tub (with a tiered
cedar ceiling and a screen that can be lowered for privacy), a
steam shower and counter tops of brushed nickel and granite.
</P>
<P>
   Filling 2,000 square feet, about the size of the average new
home, the gym cost about $40,000 for equipment alone, according to
Richard Miller, president of the Gym Source in Manhattan, who
supplied the machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equipment is the cheapest part,'' Miller explained. The
spa and workout space, he added, could easily cost many times as
much.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the stationary bike stuck in a dusty corner of the
basement. Especially in wealthy suburbs, home gyms, if not all as
elaborate as Gold's, are becoming de rigueur in new construction
and common in renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of our generation rewarding itself,'' said Valerie
San Antonio, who is in her early 40s. She built a gym on the third
floor of her Greenwich, Conn., home that is big enough for an
aerobics class. ``It's our generation trying to extend what used to
be middle age.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 18.1 million Americans exercised at least 100 days a year
in their homes in 1998, up 61 percent from 1987, according to
American Sports Data of Hartsdale, N.Y. More women, in particular,
are involved, Miller said. ``Women have always dictated what goes
into a home,'' he said. ``If a man wanted a gym a few years ago, he
usually got stuck with some small gym out of the way. Now it's
important to her. It gets a better space.''
</P>
<P>
   The availability of reasonably compact equipment built to health
club standards has furthered the trends. The Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association reports that sales of home gym equipment
rose to $2.8 billion wholesale (roughly half the cost of retail) in
1998, from $771 million in 1988. Many home gyms are now equipped
with a television or two (his and hers), telephones, refrigerators,
stereo systems and gym equipment that can run to $50,000, though
the average is $10,000 to $15,000, plus construction or remodeling
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some are customized with punching bags for kick-boxing
enthusiasts or stock-quotation machines for Wall Streeters. The
exercise area often adjoins a sauna or steam room that can be more
elaborate than the gym itself.
</P>
<P>
   Gold's workout center, installed about four years ago and since
expanded, includes a Precor elliptical trainer _ a hot new aerobics
machine that lets users climb, step and glide without bashing their
knees. There are also jump ropes, boxing gloves, a mini-trampoline
and other gadgets. ``We're very athletic,'' said Gold, who is 41.
``We knew right off that we wanted to put a gym in our home.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Westchester County and Connecticut suburbs of New York
City, builders of custom homes that generally cost several million
dollars say 80 percent include separate, often elaborate home gyms.
``Years ago, we'd carve a room out of the basement,'' said Arnold
Karp, a builder in New Canaan, Conn. ``Now it's really become a
feature room, not one you want to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles S. Cohen, who owns a commercial real estate firm in
Manhattan, built a gym in 1995 in his 16-room mansion (with an
elevator) in Greenwich. He adds about $10,000 of equipment a year,
Miller said, most recently the Quantum Thera-Crunch device for
working those abs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no wait for machines,'' said Cohen, 48, who has at
least 25 of them. ``And there's none of the getting dressed and
undressed. Here it's a one-costume change.'' He is building another
gym in his Manhattan apartment, with an additional $30,000 of
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In the Silicon Valley in California, some 90 percent of new
multimillion-dollar homes include elaborate exercise areas, often
adjoining outdoor pools and hot tubs, said Jude Kirik, president of
Pacific Peninsula Architecture in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   The trend isn't confined to the coasts, though homeowners in the
heartland may not have to spend as much to have space for a gym.
When Fred Mahler, 37, a financial planner, moved into a new home in
Overland Park, Kan., four months ago, the first thing he did was to
complete a 750-square-foot gym, spending $14,000 on equipment.
``It's probably the only room that's finished,'' Mahler said.
</P>
<P>
   In their home near Telluride, Colo., with breathtaking views of
the San Juan Mountains, Harvey and Jill Roisman, 54 and 45, have
installed $50,000 worth of machines, including a virtual reality
recumbent bicycle _ with the pedals comfortably in front of the
seat, rather than below _ that simulates an 18-speed mountain bike
traveling through all kinds of terrain. When sand appears on its
screen, the bike becomes sluggish. If it hits a tree, it stops.
</P>
<P>
   Roisman's favorite machine is the WaterRower, which uses a tank
of water for resistance. ``The advantage is that you hear the swish
of water,'' said Roisman, a retired clothing manufacturer. ``It's a
little more realistic. More fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the weight scale, which does just about everything
but hide the cookie jar. It calculates users' ideal weights and
tells them whether they have gained or lost and when they have hit
highs and lows.
</P>
<P>
   But is exercising at home the best way to go? Dr. Richard Stein,
a spokesman for the American Heart Association and chief of
cardiology at the Brooklyn Hospital Center, isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   People who spend their days in tense jobs, like dealing with
irate customers at a complaint desk, might prefer the peace and
quiet of a home gym, Stein said. And many who have home gyms, like
Gold and Cohen, also have personal trainers to motivate them.
</P>
<P>
   But most exercisers seek a social environment, Stein said, where
they ``can talk to people on the exercise floor and locker room.''
He thinks much of the new equipment ends up collecting dust, the
way stationary bikes or treadmills did before them. ``Having a
commitment to meet a friend at a gym gets you over the motivational
hurdle,'' he said. ``Not a home gym.''

A SCHOLARLY SHAREHOLDER ACTIVIST  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Ga., Del., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Charles M. Elson tells it, he had his epiphany in 1991, while
he was teaching a class about proxy rules at Stetson University's
College of Law in St. Petersburg, Fla. He owned some stock in a
beleaguered bank _ he won't say which one _ and he used its proxy
to illustrate some points.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to the section on directors' stock holdings, ``I
stopped cold,'' Elson recalled. ``I owned more shares than they
did. I began to wonder if there was a connection between their not
owning stock and the bank's doing so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Elson, 40, has served on blue-ribbon commissions,
written myriad papers, taught classes and served on boards, all
with an eye toward getting companies not only to pay their
directors in stock, but also to strong-arm them into investing in
the company with their own money.
</P>
<P>
   If he had his way, it would be a legal mandate. And come August,
he will have a formidable soapbox from which to argue his case. He
will be heading a new center at the University of Delaware _ in the
state that is host to the most legal incorporations in the country
_ that will provide a forum for debate on exactly what the laws on
corporate governance should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a place where the Court of Chancery can meet with
finance types, CEOs, corporate lawyers, everyone,'' Elson said.
``And maybe we'll see better laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Elson does more than talk the talk. As a director at Sunbeam in
1996, he spearheaded a move to pay its directors in shares, and to
make them buy stock. He was catapulted to fame when he led the move
to oust Albert J. Dunlap, the chief executive who had brought him
onto the board.
</P>
<P>
   Elson's Sunbeam shares, including the $100,000 worth he bought
with his own money, lost much of their value. ``I guess I'm a
guinea pig for my own theories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Elson joined the board of Nuevo Energy, an oil
company. He has bought $100,000 worth of Nuevo shares, too.
</P>
<P>
   The other Nuevo directors are probably in for some serious
philosophical debates. ``Charles is polite and warm, but he's not
at all bashful about taking people on,'' said J. Harvie Wilkinson
III, a former professor of Elson's and a judge for whom Elson once
was a clerk.
</P>
<P>
   John Nash, president emeritus of the National Association of
Corporate Directors, said, ``Charles is truly interested in
maximizing shareholder value, and when he takes something on he
goes at it with a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   That is almost an understatement. Ask Elson about corporate
governance _ or about litigation, wines, any of the myriad things
that inspire his passion _ and chances are that you will be treated
to an erudite, immensely entertaining dissertation on what went
before, what's happening now and what the outcome should be.
</P>
<P>
   Elson can tell you why companies stopped issuing shares to
directors in the 1920s, and how chief executives started putting
their friends on their boards soon afterward. And he can deliver a
diatribe on how this has resulted in lackadaisical board oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM, GM, American Express: Their boards all let them blow
tremendous market shares and reputational capital,'' Elson said.
</P>
<P>
   Putting opinions in historical context comes naturally to Elson.
The oldest of three sons of a wealthy Atlanta businessman, he was a
history major at Harvard University and studied law at the
University of Virginia. He had planned to be a legal historian but
was quickly seduced by what he calls ``the drama of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A summer stint at Dewey, Ballantine in New York, combined with
volunteer work defending students against charges of misbehavior,
soured him on that idea. ``I couldn't maintain my professional
detachment defending the students, and at Dewey I was bored to
tears,'' Elson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1986, after a year as clerk for Wilkinson, Elson became a
corporate lawyer for Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell in New York. It was the
height of the takeover era, but Elson never quite bought into the
decade's money culture. In 1990, when he was nearly 30, two job
offers landed on his desk. One was to manage a hedge fund, for
$130,000 a year; the other was to teach at Stetson, for $52,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, `I like teaching, I'm not married, Florida isn't
expensive, the worst that could happen is I'd hate it and come
back,''' he said. He piled his belongings into his brother's car
and drove south. He soon looked up some friends of his parents,
whose daughter fixed him up with Amy Kemker. They married in 1993
and had their first child, Caroline, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Elson soon began writing about director compensation. Al Dunlap
read one of his articles and invited Elson to visit him. The two
hit it off, and they remained friends until Elson engineered
Dunlap's ouster from Sunbeam. ``He hasn't spoken to me since,''
Elson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap has said he viewed Elson's actions as betrayal, but
others saw them as a demonstration of principle. ``Charles was, and
still is, a voice of reason on our board,'' said Jerry W. Levin,
Dunlap's successor at Sunbeam.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he ousted Chainsaw Al, he became my hero,'' said Nell
Minow, the shareholder activist, using the name Dunlap acquired
because of job and other cost cuts he made. ``If every director was
like Charles, I could go into another line of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Elson's friends say his ethical stances have always been
tempered by a sense of fun. ``There's a joie de vivre about him,
and a sense of caring,'' Wilkinson said. He pointed to an
autographed picture of William Howard Taft that Elson once sent
him. ``It was signed on my birthday, and it was just like Charles
to notice that and send it along,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elson, who serves on several museum and college boards in
Florida, is bringing his put-your-money-where-your-mouth-is views
to the public sector, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's no stock to buy, but trustees should donate
sizable amounts,'' he said. ``The important thing is having
something personal at stake in the decisions you oversee.''

STUDY LINKS INFANT DEATHS TO BACTERIA UNDER NURSES' NAILS
</HEADLINE>
  (mh) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bacteria beneath the long fingernails of nurses have been linked
to the deaths of babies in an intensive care unit in a hospital in
Oklahoma City, federal and Oklahoma health officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Epidemiologists who investigated the outbreak of bacterial
infection at Children's Hospital found that about half of the 16
deaths that occurred from Jan. 1, 1997, to March 12, 1998, were
apparently due to contamination from the long fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths from the bacteria have been reported since the
hospital imposed a number of rules, including requiring nurses in
the neonatal intensive care unit to have short nails, Dr. William
R. Jarvis, who heads the hospital infections program at the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The infections were caused by bacteria known as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. The bacteria thrive in moist environments and find
their way into respirators and similar devices in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   They are a particular problem in neonatal intensive care units
because the sick and underdeveloped babies have weakened immune
systems and needles and tubes in their bodies. The babies are more
susceptible to such infections because they are often given
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis' study, published in the journal Infection Control and
Hospital Epidemiology, found that genetic and environmental
evidence supported, but did not prove, the link between the babies'
deaths and the long fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study could not determine whether the nurses
transmitted the bacteria to the babies, or vice versa, once the
nurses acquired the bacteria, they could spread them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the evidence was strong enough for Jarvis' team to
recommend against the use of artificial and long nails in intensive
care and transplant units where the nature of the patients'
condition increases the risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
   In guidelines issued last year, CDC said workers should not wear
long nails in operating rooms. But there were no recommendations
for other hospital and health care settings.
</P>
<P>
   Some hospitals prohibit having long nails, but there is no
uniform policy, in part because some experts believe that more
evidence is needed before imposing national rules.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald L. Moolenaar, a co-author of the study, said in an
interview that the problem came to attention when the infection
control staff at Children's Hospital noted an increase in the
number of pseudomonas infections. The number of infections trailed
off and then worsened in March 1998, when the hospital called for
help from the health department.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. J. Michael Crutcher, the Oklahoma state epidemiologist, said
in an interview that his team was initially concerned that some
product had been contaminated with pseudomonas. Investigators did
not turn their attention to the long nails until cultures of the
ears and hands of 104 doctors, nurses and other health care workers
showed that three nurses had pseudomonas. Two of the nurses had
long fingernails. One had artificial nails; the other had naturally
long nails.
</P>
<P>
   The finding fit with an earlier scientific report that a health
care worker's artificial nails contributed to the spread of
serratia bacteria among patients who had undergone heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Other surveys had found a greater number of microbes on the
hands of nurses with artificial nails compared to those with
natural nails, both before and after hand washing.
</P>
<P>
   Special studies of the genetic types of the pseudomonas showed a
strong similarity between those in the three nurses and among the
babies.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemiologists studied additional possible variables, but
found the long nails were the only link.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, hospital officials began control measures,
including restricting the use of artificial fingernails, limiting
nail length to short or medium, and emphasizing the importance of
careful hand washing and glove use.
</P>
<P>
   The rules led to a drop in the number of pseudomonas infections,
and new cases were of a different genetic type. But after a lull of
three months, the number of cases began rising, though not to the
same level as before the measures began.

PUTIN SAYS HE WILL USE FORMER KGB COLLEAGUES TO FIGHT CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If he is elected president on Sunday, as everyone
expects he will be, Vladimir Putin says he will use a trusted group
of former colleagues from the KGB to tackle Russia's endemic
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am bringing into my inner circle people from law enforcement
bodies who are in no way connected with the people and structures
which may be associated with any form of corruption,'' the acting
president said. A former officer of the KGB, the Soviet
intelligence service, and later head of Russia's domestic
intelligence service, Putin's ascent in the Kremlin has stirred
some concerns among Russians who fear he may try to roll back the
nation s hard-won freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brief interview with Ted Koppel of the ABC television
program ``Nightline,'' Putin sought to assure the West that his
intelligence connections would be used to build a more fair and
even-handed system. A transcript of the interview, which will be
broadcast Friday, was made available to the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have brought some of them to the Kremlin,'' he said of
his KGB colleagues. ``I have known them for many years and I trust
them. It has nothing to do with ideology. It's only a matter of
their professional qualities and personal relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin did not name the intelligence officials he plans to use in
his ``inner circle.'' The FSB, the Russian successor to the Soviet
KGB, already includes a deputy director who owes his position to
Putin and who has been criticized for persecuting dissidents under
Soviet rule. And former intelligence officials run Russia's
security council and serve as mid-level aides Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Many top positions, however, are held by holdovers from the
administration of Boris Yeltsin and officials with no background in
intelligence. It remains to be seen how that mix may change when,
as virtually everyone expects, Putin is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed during his visit to Nizhny Novgorod, a picturesque city
on the Volga River, the brief interview was one of few that Putin
has given to the Western press. The answers he provided appeared
intended to dispel his image as a wily survivor who is determined
to rebuild Russia's influence and might.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putin insisted that his flight to Grozny, Chechnya, in the back
seat of a SU-27 fighter was not a campaign stunt, designed to
demonstrate his support for a reinvigorated Russian military. It
was, he said, simply the cheapest, fastest and safest way to
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly speaking,'' he said straightfaced, ``the last thing I
thing about is symbols.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rampant corruption has been a monumental problem for Russia and
there have been allegations that it reached into the higher
echelons of the government when Yeltsin was in power. Putin has
taken few steps as prime minister or acting president to combat it.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Putin cast corruption as little more than a
passing phase for a nation still trying to extract itself from the
ruins of the Soviet Union. And he all but pledged to banish bribery
and make Russia safe for foreign investors after he is handed the
reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the period of transitional economy the government often
fails to guarantee equal opportunities for all participants of the
market,'' he acknowledged somberly. ``There are those who take
advantage of their proximity to political, governmental and
regional leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing what actions his government might take, Putin couched
them in the context of strengthening the role of the state:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we will strive for full guarantees for the rights of
owners and investors,'' he said. ``The right of ownership will be
the priority in Russia. We will be striving for the state to
articulate its position well within the realm of law. The state
should be strong enough to guarantee those rights. Thirdly, we will
do our best to put participants in the market on an equal footing.
I hope if those basic rules are followed we will not be forced to
talk next time about the problems of corruption in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's remarks about the KGB and its successors appeared
intended to counter the the dark connotations the intelligence
agency still has in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to an American audience, however, Putin seemed to be at
pains to portray himself as an enlightened former intelligence
official, who was committed to streamlining government and fighting
corruption, not rolling back the clock on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Koppel about a comment he reportedly made at a
gathering of intelligence officers to the effect that they had
``succeeded in our first effort to infiltrate the Kremlin,'' Putin
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was a joke _ though I have to say that a
gathering of employees of intelligence agencies and former leaders
of those agencies is not unusual, even in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to Russian interviewers, he has boasted that he
approached the KGB as a schoolboy in the hope of beginning a career
as a spy. He fulfilled his dream in 1975, when he was recruited
into the KGB, where he reached the rank of lieutenant colonel
before resigning. Putin was named to head the the FSB, Russia's
domestic successor to the KGB, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On becoming prime minister last August, Putin ordered that a
plaque commemorating Yuri Andropov, the former KGB head and Soviet
leader, be restored to the wall of the KGB's old Lubyanka
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``Nightline'' interview approached the eight-minute mark,
one of Putin's aides tugged at his pants leg, apparently a signal
that the acting president had given the American interviewers
enough.

<P>
   NAYLA, India _ The day before President Clinton arrived in this
village for his only visit to rural India during his five-day tour
of the nation, the laminated cards emblazoned with the word
``invitee'' were cherished by those who had them.
</P>
<P>
   A widow, Mohini Devi Gupta, was already wearing her badge. She
is one of the 125 village women who belong to a self-made savings
and loan association. She used her $120 loan to pay for her son's
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one woman who will be garlanding President
Clinton and that's me,'' she said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Gupta did not hang the flower garland around
the president's neck Thursday, but she did tie a rakhi, a woven
bracelet, around his wrist, signifying in the Hindu tradition that
he was her brother.
</P>
<P>
   Then, to her surprise, she actually got a chance to speak with
him. Here he was, the most powerful man on earth, with some of the
flower petals they had showered on him still in his hair, and he
was actually listening to her and other poor women, nodding
sympathetically as though he understood everything they said.
</P>
<P>
   Gupta and a young mother, Pushpa Devi Yogi, told him how they
and other women had banded together, each contributing about $2 a
month to a fund and making modest loans within the group to start
small businesses, among other things. They make rope doormats and
sparkly, colorful bangle bracelets. They also fashion disposable
dishes out of leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The members of a women's milk cooperative described how they cut
out middlemen by selling their milk directly to the Jaipur Dairy.
Women serving on the village council for the first time under a
quota system that has brought a million women into local offices
across the nation spoke of the satisfactions of having a voice.
</P>
<P>
   And one of those council members had a good question for the big
shot from America. People all over the world stereotype Indians as
a backward people, she said. ``Do you think we are backward?''
</P>
<P>
   The president replied with an emphatic ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are proving that democracy can be used to lift the poor;
can be used to end discrimination against women and keep children _
girls and boys _ in school; can be used to bring people of
different tribes and castes together,'' he said. ``That is very
important to me and my family, my wife who has been in Indian
villages, and to our whole administration.''
</P>
<P>
   They were silent and stoic, their reactions to his comments one
measure of the distance these women still have to travel, the
obstacles they face _ and the glimmerings of hope.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton called for a computer in every village and waxed
eloquent on the importance of educating girls here in the
northwestern state of Rajasthan, village men dressed in loincloths
and soft cotton turbans of pink, yellow and white crowded into a
small storefront to watch him on a television perched high on a
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Ram Kishore Sharma, a farmer from the dominant
landowning upper caste of Brahmins, said he disapproved of women
who cannot read serving on the village council. Nor did he like
women emerging from the seclusion of their interior courtyards,
faces unveiled, to walk boldly in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're coming out of their homes,'' he said, ``and because of
that, we're losing our honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharma stood companionably with a few other men, their arms
draped over one another's shoulders. They shook their heads in
agreement, but one, Prabhu Dayal, gently suggested that change was
coming and could not be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big change is in primary education,'' he explained.
``Everyone is sending their girls and boys to primary school.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The village of Naila, population 8,000, is large and prosperous
by Rajasthani standards _ with the attraction of being only about a
half-hour's drive from the opulent Raj Vilas, where the president
and his entourage are staying in Jaipur.
</P>
<P>
   Kalu Ram Meena, the village chief, said he found out that the
president was coming two or three weeks ago. Ever since, he
explained, the villagers have been busy _ repairing the road,
clearing debris and painting the beautiful old mansion where the
president would meet with women and council members.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways the village is typical. The main street is paved,
but the rest are mostly dirt pathways. Bristly haired pigs and
curly tailed dogs roam freely. Carts pulled by camels and petite
donkeys ply the roads. The fragrant, earthy smell of dung hovers in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Women wear brilliantly colored scarves of orange, purple and
green over their heads and some cover their faces, walking
elegantly through town with huge sacks balanced on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Female literacy is low, though it has improved in recent years.
Almost three out of four rural women cannot read or write _ and
only about 5 percent of the women from untouchable castes are
literate.
</P>
<P>
   Govindi Raiger, an unlettered woman, was one of those invited to
the village encounter with Clinton. Because her father had told her
to seek it, she had won a council seat set aside for a woman from
an untouchable caste.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her age, Raiger looked flummoxed. Family members called
out their guesses. ``Thirty,'' said one. ``No, 40,'' said another.
No one seemed to know the ages of her five daughters and son,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Two of her daughters finished five years of school, two had none
and the youngest, about 7, was doing poorly in the second grade and
not attending regularly. Gopal Lal Meena, principal of the girl's
school, which serves mainly low-caste children, said 8 out of 10
girls drop out by the fifth grade, while most of the boys finish.
</P>
<P>
   Raiger said she knew a president was coming to the village, but
not his name or where he was from. ``I will tell him we need a road
in my neighborhood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday the village was cordoned off to outsiders as a
security measure, though a gaggle of children showed a backdoor way
in via a dirt path. At the point where the path ended in the
village, the men were clustered at the storefront to watch
television. They could tell the meeting was nearing an end when
Clinton offered a closing thought. ``I hope you will not lose your
enthusiasm and your spirit when things don't change as fast as you
would like,'' he said. ``I know it's easy to get discouraged. I
know there is still injustice and unfairness. But what you are
doing here is astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   With the show winding up, dozens of villagers began hurrying
down the dirt path away from the village. As a group of women
dashed by, Kamla Devi Sharma paused long enough to explain, ``I'm
going to see the flying machine,'' then rushed on, her long orange
scarf fluttering behind her.

STAFFING SHORTAGES PARTLY TO BLAME IN TEXAS PRISON INCIDENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and JAMES KIMBERLY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ The common threads among the recent spate of
disturbances at Texas prisons, including the December slaying of a
correctional officer, were employee mistakes and a shortage of
staff, state prison board members were told Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Board of Criminal Justice Chairman Alfred ``Mac''
Stringfellow said officials are devising a plan to address the
staffing shortages by increasing the pay for correctional officers.
Stringfellow said legislative and prison leaders want to raise the
annual salaries of the state's 27,377 correctional officers to near
the national average over the course of the next two years. Last
year, Texas' correctional officers earned $26,724. The national
average annual salary for a prison guard last year was $34,404.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked with the governor's office, we've talked with the
speaker's office, the lieutenant governor's office, the legislative
leaders. I think they're all very supportive of it. And we're just
now working out some of the details,'' Stringfellow said. ``We have
not reached a final decision yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The pay raises could arrive as early as September by borrowing
from next year's appropriation, Stringfellow said.
</P>
<P>
   Stringfellow's remarks came as a subcommittee of the Texas Board
of Criminal Justice listened to the results of investigations into
several recent prison disturbances: the Dec. 17 slaying of a prison
guard at the McConnell Unit near Beeville; a Dec. 20 riot at
McConnell; the Feb. 22 hostage-taking of a female guard by two
death row inmates at the Terrell Unit near Livingston; and the
March 14 execution in which a condemned man spit out a handcuff key
as he succumbed to the flow of lethal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Johnson, director of the prison division within the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, acknowledged that staffing
shortages were, in part, to blame for the incidents. The Department
of Criminal Justice is currently short nearly 2,000 correctional
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be less than honest'' to say it played no role,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we have a facility that is running short of staff,
running less than the optimum of their staffing allocation, then it
does have an impact on operations of that facility,'' Johnson said.
``Cell searches become more difficult to do on a frequent or
routine basis because you're not running at 100 percent of your
staffing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the reports presented to the subcommittee Thursday, the
details of how correctional officer Daniel Nagle died proved the
most compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Most surprising is that the 37-year-old Nagle died not from the
three stab wounds to his neck but from a heart attack, according to
the autopsy report prepared by Nueces County Medical Examiner Dr.
Lloyd White.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the stab-puncture wounds ... would ordinarily be
expected to be fatal,'' White's report stated, ``... they
undoubtedly produced death by cardiac dysrhythmia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagle, according to the autopsy report, was mildly obese and
suffered from advanced coronary artery disease. Friends said he
smoked cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still murder,'' said Bee County Justice of the Peace Joe
Lyvers. ``It happened as the result of the beating.''
</P>
<P>
   A 20-year-old Houston-area man already serving a life sentence
for the 1995 slaying of his trailer park neighbor was indicted last
week on a charge of capital murder for Nagle's death.
</P>
<P>
   According to the investigative report, inmate Robert L. Pruett
became incensed when Nagle, who had a reputation for following
prison procedures to the letter, began writing a disciplinary
report on Pruett for trying to bring his dinner outside to the
recreation yard.
</P>
<P>
   As Nagle sat alone at the front desk of a cell block &UR; ,  &LR; Pruett
apparently grabbed the disciplinary report from Nagle and ran into
a nearby bathroom. Nagle chased him inside and was attacked. He was
stabbed with a knife crudely fashioned from an eight-inch piece of
metal and collapsed on the floor, where he laid for nearly 20
minutes before he was discovered by another inmate.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of Nagle's murder, Pruett could receive the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The riot at the McConnell Unit lasted 3 1/2 hours but caused
more than $44,000 dollars in damage to the maximum security cell
block where it occurred. It started when an inmate disabled the
lock on his cell and freed 80 other inmates. The report said the
incident happened, in part, because correctional officers failed to
lock a gate.
</P>
<P>
   A report into how death row inmate Ponchai Wilkerson, 28,
managed to jimmy open his cell door and along with fellow death row
inmate, Robert Guidry, 23, take Correctional Officer Jeanette
Bledsoe, 57, hostage for 13 hours proved less enlightening. Prison
officials were unable to determine how Wilkerson dismantled the
lock in his cell. Bledsoe, however, should not have been escorting
Guidry alone, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Wilkerson who spit out the handcuff key as the flow of
lethal drugs began during his March 14 execution. He muttered,
``The secret, as of Wilkerson'' just before he spit it out. The
report did not determine how Wilkerson obtained the key but
recommended that the cells of death row inmates be searched every
two days to increase the likelihood of discovering contraband.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to quell a political and religious furor
over the selection of the House chaplain, Speaker Dennis Hastert
took to the House floor Thursday and appointed, by fiat, a Catholic
priest who had not been in contention for the job.
</P>
<P>
   In a sober speech laced with bitterness, Hastert stood before
his hushed colleagues and defended his initial decision to select a
Protestant minister over a Roman Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   And he accused Democrats of conducting unseemly political
warfare by portraying him and other Republicans as anti-Catholic.
The House has never had a Catholic chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a more cynical and more destructive
political campaign,'' Hastert said on the House floor, insisting
that his earlier choice of the Protestant minister had been based
on merit, not denomination. ``That such a campaign should be waged
in connection with the selection of the House chaplain brings shame
on this House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a lot like war,'' Hastert added. ``And it has an ugly
face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who
did not know about Hastert's decision until the speech on the House
floor, struck a conciliatory note in his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never said, and never believed, that there was bias of
any kind in the making of this selection,'' Gephardt told his
colleagues on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's decision to name Father Daniel Coughlin, a vicar of
the Archdiocese of Chicago, appeared to be an effort to close an
episode that has dogged Republicans since late last year, exposing
the party to charges of anti-Catholic bias and leaving some members
politically vulnerable in their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict escalated last month when Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, kicked off
his South Carolina campaign by visiting Bob Jones University, an
evangelical college that espouses anti-Catholic teachings. Bush's
visit roiled his campaign and gave House Democrats added ammunition
in the fight over the House chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   For Hastert, the decision to appoint Coughlin follows four
months of handwringing over how to handle the chaplain controversy.
</P>
<P>
   An exit strategy finally emerged this week, when the Rev.
Charles Wright, the Protestant chaplain who had been awaiting final
approval, withdrew from consideration on Wednesday, saying he could
not serve in a ``divided House,'' Hastert said. His withdrawal
cleared the way for Hastert to appoint Coughlin, who had been
recommended by the archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Francis George.
The speaker can, if he chooses, use his unilateral authority to
select the chaplain, whose job it is to deliver the morning prayer
and counsel members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hastert faced considerable pressure from Roman Catholic
Republicans, and Republicans from predominantly Catholic districts,
to resolve the lingering conflict. Some members, fed up with the
partisan brawl, suggested doing away with the position of chaplain
altogether, an alternative that Hastert called a ``grave mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Hastert had decided to appoint a Roman
Catholic drew praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. ``It was
his only recourse under the circumstances,'' said Rep. Marge
Roukema, R-N.J. ``He made the best of an impossible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, though, expressed deep dissatisfaction with
Hastert's attack, saying that he mishandled the process and had
nobody to blame but himself for the controversy. `` I don't care
who is chaplain,'' said Rep. John D. Dingell, a senior Michigan
Democrat who is Catholic. ``If you're going to have a process, you
want it to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, a bipartisan committee, set up by Hastert to
pick the House chaplain, winnowed a long list of candidates to
three, with a Roman Catholic priest, Father Timothy O'Brien,
receiving the most votes.
</P>
<P>
   As agreed, the list of three was forwarded to Hastert, Rep.
Richard Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and Gephardt, without
a vote tally and in alphabetical order.
</P>
<P>
   After a round of final interviews late last year, Hastert
selected Wright, with the support of Armey and, eventually,
Gephardt. Republicans said that other House leaders had played no
role in the choice of Wright.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats on the committee complained, saying they did not
understand why the committee's first choice was not selected. They
also pointed out that during interviews with the panel, O'Brien had
been asked what they described as inappropriate questions about his
clerical collar and his ability to counsel married couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that anti-Catholic bias played into it,'' said Rep.
Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who was on the selection panel. ``Do I
celebrate the fact that history has been made and the House has its
first Catholic chaplain? Yes. Has it been hurtful? Absolutely.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Marina Shurina, a 25-year-old underemployed lawyer, sat
in a small spare room with white walls and empty shelves, waiting
for voters to call the campaign of Ella Pamfilova, one of the 11
people, and the only woman, running in Russia's presidential
election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Shurina's phone was not exactly ringing off the hook. And with
no signs, posters or bumper stickers anywhere in sight _ not on the
street, not on the grubby stairwell, not on the door, not even
inside Shurina's second-floor office _ the chances of voters just
dropping by, looking for information, offering to lend a hand, were
virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
   But from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day this week, Shurina will
remain at her post at the Pamfilova campaign's only public office
in all of Moscow. On a bad day, she fields questions from about
four voters, usually referred by Russia's Central Election
Commission. On a good day, she will see maybe 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see that kind of flow, I try to spread it out so that
I can spend a good long time with each voter, and not just a few
minutes,'' she said cheerfully as a heavy wet snow splattered the
dusty window behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova, a former government minister, longtime member of
parliament and a rare voice for social justice in Russia, is the
no-frills candidate in a campaign that, in the minds of many
voters, never really was a campaign at all.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment former President Boris Yeltsin handed over power
to his chosen successor, Vladimir V. Putin, on New Year's Eve, most
everybody has assumed that victory will belong to Putin. The only
question is by what margin and when _ on the first vote next
Sunday, or in a second round on April 9.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And yet the other candidates have never stopped running, with
the single exception of Yevgeni Savostyanov, a former Kremlin aide
and liberal democrat who this week threw his support to Grigory
Yavlinksy, leader of the Yabloko party, on a late-night political
talk show, minutes before a midnight withdrawal deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Savostyanov's gesture was one of the few moments of drama in an
otherwise monotonous campaign. Just about everything else _ from
the long Russian winter to the early election date that threw all
contenders but Putin off guard _ has conspired to cool popular
participation in Russia's third presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Pamfilova's goal from the start was not to get elected. As
she keeps saying at every stop, she wanted to make the point that a
politician in Russia can be independent and that a woman can run
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that in politics there were more women, smart, good
women,'' she said Thursday during a campaign stop at a
flower-arranging show at Moscow's cavernous Theater of the Russian
Army. ``Now, there are few, but tomorrow there should be more,
which is why I stepped forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova, 46, an engineer by training, was one of the most
visible members of Yeltsin's first reform government, serving as
minister of social affairs. But in 1994 she resigned, disgusted
with the government's neglect of Russia's growing number of poor
people and with the corruption that she said discredited Russia's
young liberal reformers.
</P>
<P>
   After her movement, Civic Dignity, failed to seat any candidates
in parliamentary elections in December, she decided to run for
president and to set an example by refusing to accept any private
contributions. Her entire campaign is financed by the 400,000
rubles _ about $14,000 _ allotted each qualifying candidate by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can safely say that her campaign headquarters are wherever
she happens to be,'' said her press aide, Maxim Leskov. According
to early spending reports, hers is the poorest of the campaigns:
Putin's is one of the richest, with reported spending of 9 million
rubles, about $300,000 _ a figure that does not include the
publicity he gets for performing his official duties as acting
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to get rid of corruption in Russia, then we have to
have more independent politicians,'' she said. ``I am not refusing
to spend money because no one has offered me any. People have
offered, but I have refused because I don't want to be indebted to
criminals or oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show that you can start from nothing,'' Pamfilova
said Thursday. ``I am fulfilling a minimum goal.''
</P>
<P>
   With a small budget and the little time allotted to the
truncated election campaign, Pamfilova has pitched most of her
campaign to television, taking advantage of all the free air time
offered by the competing channels. In the last week, she has filled
her days with talk shows, debates, interviews on foreign television
stations, even an appearance on the Russian version of ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire,'' where she astutely asked help from the
audience _ a move that one TV critic said showed both her wise use
of available resources and her ability to win the sympathy of
Russians.
</P>
<P>
   None of this, however, seems to have increased her popularity
ratings, which still hover between 1 and 2 percent. ``These are of
course relative, subject to the usual fluctuations,'' Leskov said.
</P>
<P>
   Being the sole woman has probably helped Pamfilova stand out in
the pack of candidates hovering at the bottom of the polls. She was
the only politician to show up at the flower-arranging exhibition,
where several women came up to her, practically with tears in their
eyes, promising support. The exhibition's director read her a poem
written in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch her, you can feel her lightness as a person,''
said Yelena Allakhverdova, an artist who had toyed with voting for
Putin until she met Pamfilova. ``I can feel things, and I can feel
that what she says is not a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Pamfilova is determined to hang on to the end. As she posed for
television cameras Thursday, clutching a bunch of daffodils, her
blond hair tied back in a girlish ponytail, she scoffed at the
thought of abandoning her cause and deserting her supporters by
bowing out before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But she also hinted that if the race was to go another round,
she might join the long line of politicians who have jumped on the
Putin bandwagon. ``As someone who has long been in opposition to
the Kremlin, I was skeptical at first,'' she said, ``but now I have
hopes that he will be independent. I am hoping that a process of
consolidation is taking place.''

PERSONAL-FINANCE SITES, IN SEARCH OF NOVELTY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE LEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember a few years ago, when those newfangled Web sites that
allow investors to track their investments online seemed like the
best invention since, well, mutual funds?
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, most any personal-finance site worth its silicon
offers customized portfolio tracking and a seemingly endless array
of news and research. And the number of sites keeps growing: By
some counts, there are now 15,000 devoted to personal finance,
making it a close runner-up to sex as the most popular Web
category.
</P>
<P>
   Amid so much financial advice, many of the new sites are trying
to differentiate themselves by zeroing in on specific investment
subjects, niche strategies and esoteric tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sites are proliferating wildly,'' said Robert F.
Sterling, an analyst at Jupiter Communications. ``We're seeing
people coming in all the time with new niche plays and new ideas.
They're addressing smaller needs to try and target their
marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge has created something of a cottage industry as
companies vie to track the various sites. One of the largest,
Investorama, has links to more than 14,000 sites and plans to add
1,800 links soon, said the founder, Doug Gerlach. OnlineInvestor, a
monthly print magazine based in Oak Brook, Ill., includes scores of
site reviews in each issue; in its first year and a half, it has
offered more than 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a typical month, I learn about 75 new sites; a year ago,
that number was maybe 20,'' said Jan Parr, the magazine's editor.
Practically all the new sites are niche players.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of some recent offerings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Epredict.com. Using the type of polling more commonly
associated with political races, the site surveys visitors on their
feelings about specific stocks. Anyone who fills out the
multiple-choice survey receives the results of the poll the next
day via e-mail. Eventually, the site hopes to use its visitors'
collective wisdom to start a mutual fund, said John Kaminski,
Epredict's vice president for business development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gainskeeper.com. Focusing on one of the biggest problems for
active traders _ completing Schedule D, the federal tax form for
capital gains and losses _ the site helps track holdings and the
associated tax implications. Investors enter their holdings on a
secure site that is updated daily. One of the site's biggest
selling points is that it keeps track of stock splits and other
corporate actions, a niche service with which other sites have
struggled. ``You can't do this with software,'' said Duncan Routh,
co-founder of the site. ``You have to have a staff that's capable
of analyzing each corporate action.''
</P>
<P>
   _ IExchange.com. On this site, amateur analysts can offer
written research, available for purchase, on a variety of stocks.
The better the track record, the higher the price the analysts can
charge, though most reports cost $3 or less. Contributors are asked
to submit a target price for each stock; most also explain the
reasoning behind their picks. IExchange tracks the performance,
paying cash rewards for top picks and splitting proceeds from the
research sales.
</P>
<P>
   _ Validea.com. This site tracks the records of professional
stock pickers and pundits, assigning ratings based on performance.
John Reese, the founder, said he created the site after poring over
various business magazines, Web sites and television programs in
search of stock tips. Investors can track analysts by name or by
publication. The site already has 50,000 recommendations in its
database.
</P>
<P>
   Many personal-finance Web sites, like the Internet sectors they
cover, can have difficulty turning profits. Already, Parr and
Sterling said they had seen a number of innovative sites fold or
sell out to larger players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to drive revenue on these things because nobody
wants to pay for the information, and advertising revenues only go
so far,'' Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both say there is room for more sites _ and they expect
their numbers to keep growing over the next few years.

COLLEGE SAVINGS, MADE EASIER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 26)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Vt.)  (af) 
By JAMES SCHEMBARI  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Starting to save for our children's education seems like
entering an abyss. For parents with several children (I have four),
the required totals are so incomprehensibly huge that many of us
just throw money into different investments and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Many friends in the same situation have asked me about the
college savings plans that the IRS allowed states to set up four
years ago. The plans are popular: 23 states, including New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut, have them, with more expected this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The plans aren't perfect, but they provide substantial tax
benefits. The initial investment choices, different in every state,
are similar to mutual stock, bond or money market funds; the money
is handled by investment companies. But federal taxes on all
earnings are deferred until withdrawal, when they are taxed at the
child's rate.
</P>
<P>
   Some states also defer their own taxes on earnings, but most
waive them entirely. And some states, like New York, even allow
investors to deduct some contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Page, 39, a lawyer for the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission in Washington, set up savings plans for her niece and
nephew in Vermont. ``The tax savings are incomparable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The savings programs are different from so-called prepaid plans,
under which parents pay a predetermined amount, which the state
guarantees will eventually pay for most of their children's college
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The tax benefits are the same as for the savings plans, but some
experts say the prepaid plans are managed so conservatively that
investors could easily accumulate the guaranteed tuition, and then
some, by investing themselves. Most prepaid plans cover only state
schools, while the savings plans can be used anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the newer savings plans don't give you much control over
your money. If your fund's strategy sours, you cannot easily move
your money to another fund. Maine, for example, lets you put all
your money into an equity fund, but who has the guts to remain
fully invested in stocks just before your child begins college?
</P>
<P>
   Try to withdraw the money early, and you'll lose the state and
federal tax savings and pay a penalty. Parents must bite their
nails until they start writing the tuition checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you really want to create your own asset allocation, and
you're really into searching out mutual funds yourselves, you may
not be happy with these plans,'' said Joseph F. Hurley, author of
``The Best Way to Save for College'' (BonaCom Publications, 2000).
``But if you trust that these companies have done their homework,
you should feel very comfortable with these.''
</P>
<P>
   Some states offer plans meant to reduce risks by moving assets
around as your child ages. TIAA-CREF, which runs funds for several
states, invests 75 percent of the money for a newborn into a growth
stock fund and 25 percent into a bond fund. Allocations are
adjusted every two years until, just before the child enters
college, the mix is 10 percent growth, 40 percent bonds and 50
percent in a money market fund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   William Schubart, 54, an executive in South Burlington, Vt., has
invested in his state's plan for his two children. He likes the tax
savings, but realizes that he might be able to get better returns
elsewhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in the market who will invest themselves,
take the risk and make more money,'' he said. ``If somebody had
done that in the last five years, they could send their kids to
school and their neighbor's kids to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors may be able to do better themselves, but college
savings plans didn't do so badly last year. The most aggressive
investment options in the Iowa, New York, and Rhode Island plans
rose 17.3 percent, 17.2 percent and 14.8 percent, respectively,
compared with 19.5 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index. You can shop around among the plans, because most states
don't have a residency requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley recommends the plans, but as part of a broader strategy.
``Look at overall allocation,'' he said. ``Keep your most
aggressive investments in a taxable account and your conservative
investments in the college account,'' to make sure that enough
money will be available for education.
</P>
<P>
   I wish these accounts had been around 12 years ago, when my
oldest child, Marian, was born. But I'm more than willing to
sacrifice some potential returns for the tax savings. I will still
be entering that abyss, but with a lighter burden. &QL;

OSCAR TAKES A CHANCE ON ZANUCKS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year on Academy Awards night, everyone who's watching
 &UR; _ &LR;  an estimated 800 million people worldwide  &UR; _ &LR;  is a movie fan,
drinking in the pageantry of the event and cheering or bemoaning
the winners and losers.
</P>
<P>
   And each year, on the morning after the Oscars, everyone becomes
a TV critic.
</P>
<P>
   They gather around their workplace watercoolers or call in to
talk-radio shows to rail about the length of the broadcast, the
unimaginative music, the silly production numbers, the bad writing
the presenters are forced to recite  &UR; _ &LR;  and that's even before they
get around to grousing about the ballot outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The year 2000, the dawn of a new millennium, seemed as good a
time as any to revamp the Academy Awards, which is the
second-most-popular live broadcast in America each year behind the
Super Bowl. It wasn't a thorough housecleaning (widely acclaimed
host Billy Crystal is back) but the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences took a big risk in turning over the producing reins to
Richard and Lili Fini Zanuck, film veterans who between them had
absolutely no prior experience mounting a live television show.
</P>
<P>
   Under that kind of pressure, the Zanucks should be ready to
crack about now. But less than two weeks before the big night, they
were as cool as the ice sculptures at the Governors Ball,
hobnobbing with the celebrants at the annual nominees' luncheon in
Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't entirely off duty that afternoon. Lili had dragged
along a briefcase crammed with vital papers, and the
husband-and-wife team spent time before lunch conferring with ABC
executives about various details of the show.
</P>
<P>
   The self-confidence they displayed last September when they were
announced as Oscar producers still is evident. They are mindful of
the fact that, with this show, there are no retakes or chances to
fix a gaffe in an editing room, yet they are unruffled  &UR; _ &LR;  at least
in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no perspective since it's our first time,'' Richard
said. ``But everybody tells us we're right on schedule or a little
bit ahead, so that's reassuring to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zanucks know a lot about Oscars, at least from the other
side. Richard, son of Hollywood legend Darryl F. Zanuck, as a youth
attended the gala affairs with his dad. The Zanucks also have gone
to several Oscar ceremonies in their own careers, taking home a
pair of the statuettes for the 1989 best picture winner, ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' as well as Richard Zanuck's Irving G. Thalberg Award
in 1991 for a producing career that includes ``Jaws'' and ``The
Sting.''
</P>
<P>
   Now here they are, creating their own Oscars event and handling
the public's curiosity about it as they would a much-talked-about
film with a surprise ending. They are giving away very little about
the three-hour show itself
 &UR; _ &LR;  as if the set design, how the nominated costumes are shown and
what Crystal has up his tuxedo sleeve are the primary sources of
all the suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is their way of building interest in the show. Or
maybe they don't want the critics to start carping too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what is going to be new and different about this year's
telecast, Lili evaded discussion of the staging, instead going into
the apparent horse race for all the top categories.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Burt Bacharach and Don Was' music portion of the
program, Richard said, ``There's a lot of music in the show, the
nominated songs, and we're doing a little piece on some of the
great songs from the movies of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He forgot to mention that little surprise about Robin Williams
being brought in to perform (and probably to ad lib) ``Blame
Canada,'' the best song nominee from ``South Park: Bigger, Longer
and Uncut.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the costume presentations? Last year, host Whoopi
Goldberg opened the show in a Queen Elizabeth I gown, her face
painted a chalky white, and she returned throughout the program in
other nominated costumes. In previous years, they have been shown
off in dance numbers that tried too hard and even some tableaux
that were like watching grass grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way I can answer that is to just kind of touch on
what we're trying to do thematically, which is represent every
category as is presented to the (movie) audience, not interpreting
anything,'' Lili said. ``So we're not having a fashion show with
costume nominations this year, but obviously there will be a
presentation of them as they appeared in the specific films.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Billy won't be wearing them.''
</P>
<P>
   So what will Crystal be doing if he's not changing from, say,
Jodie Foster's ``Anna and the King'' hoop skirts into Gwyneth
Paltrow's debutante resortwear from ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lips are sealed about Billy,'' Richard said. ``That's one
of the promises he asked us to make to him when he took the job. He
wants to be as spontaneous and surprise the audience as much as he
can. But Billy's in great form and it'll be funny and very
enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I kind of think the fact that he took last year off gave
him a whole year to think up some really good things,'' Lili added.
</P>
<P>
   The academy and ABC have had a whole year to live down last
year's ceremonies, which dragged on for four hours, five minutes.
At that length, they could have set up telephone banks and raised
money for a charity.
</P>
<P>
   When academy president Robert Rehme announced the Zanucks were
taking over from Oscar veteran Gilbert Cates, his statement read,
``The skill, professionalism and creativity of Richard and Lili
Zanuck will guarantee an exciting, interesting fabric into which we
can weave the presentation of our 20-some Oscar awards.'' That
probably translates to ``bring it in well under last year's time or
you, too, can be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's official running time on Sunday's TV logs is 5:30-8:30
p.m. local time, but it would be a minor miracle if the
presentations actually finished in three hours. Advertisers love
Oscar's huge, rapt audience, but they aren't happy about paying
premium rates to air their spots after midnight back East, when
most viewers with day jobs have given up and gone to bed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways the Zanucks are paring down the show is by
limiting the best song nominees to 90-second digests rather than
the full three to five minutes each usually requires. There won't
be a big dance sequence built around the best picture nominees  &UR; _ &LR; 
no pompon girls showered with rose petals for ``American Beauty''
or dreamy Agnes DeMille-styled interpretation of apple picking for
``The Cider House Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   And they promise to use the hook without hesitation. Director
Louis J. Horvitz will signal the musicians to ``play off'' any
winner talking longer than 45 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theme is make it short,'' Richard said. ``No matter what,
it has to be entertaining, and that's the same whether we're making
a movie or doing a live television show. And the fact that there is
a deadline is actually a great relief to us because we know exactly
what to head for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies always can be pushed a little bit, the start dates, and
they can slide around, but this is a definite date that we're
aiming for, and that's kind of a good feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it certainly is a little bit like when you prep a movie,''
Lili said. ``We know that on March 26 certain departments will wish
they had two more days, but it's just the way it goes. We know that
at 5:30 we're going live around the world, but we're still pretty
calm about it. We're having a good time.''

BAD NEWS FOR BRASWELL?
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Final approval on who will be named men's
basketball coach at Oregon State appears to lie with school
president Paul Risser. And that could be bad news for Bobby
Braswell.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell, Cal State Northridge's coach for the past four
seasons, is a finalist for the Beavers job, but the school did not
announce its choice on Thursday, as was expected.
</P>
<P>
   That probably doesn't bode well for Braswell because it appears
OSU athletic director Mitch Barnhart is going to Risser because his
choice will require a large financial commitment.
</P>
<P>
   That means Colorado State coach Ritchie McKay is probably the
leading candidate. Cash-strapped OSU would have to buy out the
final four years of McKay's contract at $250,000 per season, a
decision that would need Risser's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But Braswell is a firm candidate, especially if negotiations
fail with McKay and, possibly, Milwaukee Bucks assistant Don
Newman.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell, who coached CSUN to a 20-10 season and an appearance
in the Big Sky tournament championship game, is being courted by a
Pac-10 school for the second consecutive year. A year ago, he was a
finalist at Washington State, a position that McKay, 34, reportedly
turned down to stay in Fort Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell fits best in OSU's salary structure. The athletic
department is facing a $5.5 million budget deficit, and on top of
the buyout, McKay reportedly wants more than the $200,000 annual
salary the school paid former Beavers coach Eddie Payne.
</P>
<P>
   Braswell, whose CSUN teams have won five of seven games against
teams coached by McKay and Newman, has a base salary of $92,700 for
a contract that ends in June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Newman was successful in his one year as as Arizona State's
interim coach _ the Sun Devils were 18-14 and made the National
Invitation Tournament. The Portland Oregonian reported Thursday
that Newman is a friend of OSU football coach Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State needs to make a decision soon because the late
signing period for men's basketball recruits begins April 5.

TOURIST PRESIDENT PREACHES GOSPEL OF DEMOCRACY 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAIPUR, India _ President Clinton played tourist Thursday but
could not resist a touch of missionary work as he preached the
gospel of democracy, equality and high technology to a group of
poor villagers near this hectic, vibrant Rajasthan city.
</P>
<P>
   Answering a resident of Nayla village, who asked if the world
thought of Indians as backward, Clinton said, ``No.'' And he said
he hoped his weeklong trip to South Asia would help the world see
India ``in a more complete light.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the president said, ``there are many people here who are
poor, but you are proving that democracy can be used to lift the
poor, can be used to end discrimination against women and keep
children, girls and boys, in school and can be used to bring people
of different tribes and castes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the computer ``will make this happen more quickly
if it is used wisely and put in every village in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's stop in the village came as he continued his journey
through north-central India with a tour of Amber, the fortified
mountaintop town that was the ancient capital of Jaipur state until
water ran short and the maharajah and his entourage moved to the
valley below.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was greeted by colorfully painted elephants, and the
president, apparently recalling that the animals are the Republican
symbols, remarked: ``It's nice to be around some friendly
elephants.'' Clinton shopped the local craft stands and was shown a
clay sculpture of his head with a turban.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, Clinton moved on to Ranthambore National
Park in hopes of seeing some of the famous Indian tigers. Reports
abounded locally that personnel in the park, once a shooting
preserve of local royalty, had been trying for weeks to lure as
many of the ferocious beasts as possible into the area Clinton was
to visit.
</P>
<P>
   By luck or not, Clinton and daughter Chelsea spotted two tigers
_ a male and female.
</P>
<P>
   As he often does on foreign trips, Clinton in Nayla cited the
United States as a nation with an imperfect past that can serve as
an example to aspiring people and nations.
</P>
<P>
   After U.S. independence from Britain, Clinton said, it was
almost 150 years before women could vote, 100 years before slaves
were freed and another 100 years before blacks acquired equal
rights under law.
</P>
<P>
   India can give the world the greatest gift it could have now if
``you can prove that people can lift themselves from poverty and at
the same time end discrimination against women and their girl
children and learn to work together across tribal and caste lines
because of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   India, Clinton said, could be an example to nations fighting
tribal, ethnic and religious wars, such as in Africa and Bosnia and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the caste system, illegal but flourishing, assigns
people to social strata as a result of their birth. In a twist, the
current Indian president, K.R. Narayanan, is from the lowest caste,
the untouchables, the first member of that group to rise to head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   En route to Nayla and as the president hit the sightseeing
trail, Clinton's motorcade whisked through streets that had been
momentarily cleared of their usual parade of honking cars, buses
and bicycles as well as camel-drawn carts that serve as a reminder
that much of the province is desert.
</P>
<P>
   Holy cows wander the broad sun-drenched boulevards of the old
Pink City, which was laid out by a French architect for a maharajah
before U.S. colonists had dreamed up the Declaration of
Independence, much less thought of having Pierre L'Enfant design
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Nayla, Clinton was welcomed by more than a dozen women
dressed in the bright colors of Rajasthan, a northwestern state.
Reds, purples, oranges and maroons swirled as women danced and sang
about women's work, including the trendy phrase: ``It's time we
empowered ourselves.'' However, the question that provoked
Clinton's sermonette was posed by a man.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was draped with a garland of flowers and showered with
rose petals before hearing the women discuss their lives, including
the fight for equal pay with men and attempts to marry later.
Clinton commiserated especially with dairy women, telling them he
knew how hard that work was.

BOEING LEADS AIRBUS IN JET ORDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. has jumped to an early lead over Airbus
in new airplane orders this year with the announcement Thursday
that an unidentified customer has reached a firm agreement to buy
50 next-generation 737s.
</P>
<P>
   At list prices, the order would be worth about $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Randy Harrison said the identity of the
customer, at its request, was not being made public at this time.
</P>
<P>
   But other people familiar with the order said the customer is
International Lease Finance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The latest order pushed Boeing's tally for the year to 95. By
the end of February, Airbus had 34 firm orders for new planes,
according to its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The latest orders were quickly posted on Boeing's Web site. In
the past, the company has waited until the end of the month to add
new orders. Harrison said the Web site order tally will now be
updated weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The change is the second in recent months that Boeing has made
in the way new orders are made public, and reflects the intensity
of the order battle between Boeing and its archrival.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Boeing decided to include orders from undisclosed
customers for the first time, something Airbus had been doing.
</P>
<P>
   The change helped Boeing narrow the gap with Airbus in firm 1999
orders, but the European plane maker still ended the year with
significantly more orders than Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time ever that Airbus had beaten the Boeing,
although they tied one year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest 50-plane order from International Lease includes a
mix of 737 models, the -600, -700, -800 and -900.
</P>
<P>
   International Lease had announced at the Paris Air Show last
year that it planned to buy up to 100 next generation 737s. But it
took months for details of the agreement to be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the deal said the additional 50 planes are
not the typical options that a customer converts to firm orders.
Rather, the agreement with International Lease for the first 50
planes gave it the option to cancel the order for the 50 additional
planes, which it chose not to do.

JUSTICE OPENS INQUIRY OF WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has begun a criminal
investigation into whether White House officials illegally
suppressed large numbers of executive office e-mails subpoenaed in
investigations of the White House campaign fund-raising and other
activities, documents filed in federal court disclosed on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking into charges that White House
officials threatened employees of a non-government contractor if
they disclosed any of the missing messages, according to the court
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry by the Justice Department's campaign finance unit
started after Republicans accused the White House of concealing
private electronic communications being sought by investigators in
Congress, the Justice Department and the Independent Counsel's
Office. The investigators had sought White House e-mail messages
dealing with campaign fund-raising, Monica S. Lewinsky and other
matters. The attempts to obtain the electronic messages date as far
back as 1998 in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's court filing, which declared its
intentions to carry out the investigation, provide no evidence as
to the contents of the e-mail messages. But in the papers, the
department contends a criminal investigation is justified because
of the possibility that some of the e-mail messages may have been
relevant to the investigations and may have been deliberately
concealed.
</P>
<P>
   The papers also refer to earlier documents filed in a civil suit
in which employees of Northrup Grumman, the company hired to
maintain the system, say they had been been pressured to remain
silent about the missing messages.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer specialists working for Northrup Grumman have
testified before Congress and said in depositions that they were
threatened with jail by White House officials if they disclosed a
glitch in the system that would make it difficult, if not
impossible, to ever retrieve any messages. The two workers said the
threats were made in June 1998 amid the furor over the Lewinsky
case.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have denied there was any attempt to avoid
compliance with subpoenas and said that the problem was an
inadvertent computer glitch caused by malfunctioning systems that
failed to properly store all electronic messages written to
presidential aides from outside the White House. ``No one attempted
to hide responsive information from this committee or any other
investigative body,'' Beth Nolan, the White House counsel, said in
a prepared statement she had been scheduled to deliver on Thursday
at a hearing on the e-mail controversy before the House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee. Her appearance was postponed until
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also denied threatening anyone in connection
with the e-mail messages but acknowledged an effort to keep the
problem of the missing messages from becoming public.
</P>
<P>
   Although it had been known for weeks that the e-mail messages
were missing, Thursday's opening of a criminal inquiry ratcheted up
the seriousness of the issue. It quickly spread into the
presidential campaign, where Vice President Al Gore has already
come under attack by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for his campaign
fund-raising tactics. Whether the content of the missing e-mails
related to Gore is unknown, but officials said the the computer
server in Gore's office has a separate problem that may have caused
e-mail messages there not to be recorded properly.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida for a fund-raising reception, Bush commented on the
e-mail controversy. ``This is a White House that needs to let the
sun shine in when it comes to campaign funding allegations,'' he
said, adding, ``I look forward to seeing where these e-mails are,
what was in those e-mails.''

 &HT;    Gore aide faces probe by State Department
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department is investigating Al Gore's
campaign chairman Tony Coelho for his role in organizing the World
Exposition in Portugal in 1998, Coelho's attorney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Brand said his client was complying fully with the
inquiry, which arose out of a critical audit of the World Expo in
September 1999. Coelho was the U.S. commissioner general to the
expo.
</P>
<P>
   News of the investigation by the State Department's office of
inspector general is reported in today's edition of National
Journal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rehash of everything that's been reported and talked
about since September,'' Brand said of the Journal article.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said Coelho began cooperating with the investigation in
November and had provided bank records as recently as January.
</P>
<P>
   Brand accused Journal editor Michael Kelly, a frequent Gore
critic, of political motivations in publishing the report just
three weeks after Gore wrapped up the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why all of the sudden is this news?'' Brand said. Kelly could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho is credited with helping re-tool Gore's campaign after it
stumbled early against former rival Bill Bradley. But Coelho has
also been something of a lightening rod for criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho resigned from Congress in 1989 after he failed to report
a loan from a troubled savings and loan institution. The Justice
Department investigated the loan but never filed charges.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho's latest legal problems arose from the nonpaid position
he took with the U.S. Information Agency to spearhead the United
States' exposition at the World Expo in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department audit found that the expo was mismanaged
and overbudget, resulting in U.S. government agencies absorbing 82
percent of the cost when private donations were in fact supposed to
foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   While the audit praised the expo for attracting millions of
visitors, Coelho was faulted for such internal management lapses as
putting his niece on the payroll at $2,500 a month, $900 more than
the office manager was receiving.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign issued a strong endorsement of Coelho when the
audit was made public last fall, and again praised Coelho on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is doing a great job, day in and day out,'' said Chris
Lehane, Gore's spokesman. ``And he will continue to do a great
job.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iraq has spent tens of millions of dollars in
recent months to build a military headquarters for an Iranian
opposition group that the Clinton administration considers a
terrorist organization, senior administration officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, the officials declassified a satellite photograph
of the complex, which covers 2.4 square miles and is in the Iraqi
city of Faluja, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. The officials said
the Iraqis had used profits from the illegal sale of oil to build
the complex for the exclusive use of the People's Mujahedeen, an
Iranian military and political movement whose goal is to overthrow
the Islamic Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The photo is to be made public by the State Department on Friday
in an effort to counter critics who say the sanctions imposed after
the Gulf war cause widespread suffering in Iraq. The administration
will argue that President Saddam Hussein is illegally smuggling oil
to support international terrorism and does not deserve relief from
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a propaganda campaign,'' a senior administration said
about issuing the photo. ``There's no question this is what we are
doing here. This is part of our effort to show the world the danger
Saddam would pose if the controls on the access to his oil revenues
were lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, at an open meeting of the U.N. Security
Council on Friday on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, the United
States will argue in favor of keeping tough sanctions against Iraq,
as well as finding ways to ease the Iraqi people's suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants to continue a carefully monitored U.N.
program that allows Iraq to sell an unlimited quantity of oil and
use the money to buy food, medicine, educational and agricultural
items and spare parts for it oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   Washington estimates that Iraq illegally smuggles 100,000
barrels of oil a month through the Persian Gulf in violation of
U.N. sanctions. At current prices, that translates into more than
$30 million a month.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials insist that the new evidence against
Iraq is not related to the speech by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright on Friday in which Albright announced the easing of some
sanctions against Iran to allow exports of Iranian carpets, caviar,
pistachios and dried fruits to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the satellite photo is quite likely to be welcomed by at
least some Iranian officials, who praised the United States when it
designated the People's Mujahedeen as a foreign terrorist
organization in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was created in the 1960s as an armed Islamic opposition
movement against Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and fought in guerrilla
operations that forced his overthrow. But the People's Mujahedeen
was also avowedly socialist and was cut out of the power structure
built by the ayatollahs.
</P>
<P>
   The group turned against the new government and continues to
wage an armed struggle against the Iranian state from Iraq, which
provides the group with financial and logistical support and
military equipment. The People's Mujahedeen remains the most
powerful opponent of the Islamic Republic, attacking targets in
Iran and assassinating Iranian officials. It is generally believed
to have 15 to 20 bases in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Mujahedeen complex near Baghdad, which is not yet operating,
was begun in late 1998 on the site of an Iraqi military area and is
said to include lakes, farms, barracks and administrative buildings
that can accommodate 3,000 to 5,000 people, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One official described the site as a ``headquarters which will
be used to coordinate Mujahedeen activities throughout Iraq and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials declined to say how they could be certain that the
site was intended for Mujahedeen use, citing the need to protect
intelligence sources.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has used declassified satellite imagery for years in
its campaign against Iraq, showing photos that it says prove that
it is rebuilding factories that could make chemical weapons or
missiles and building sprawling palaces.

COMPANY TO WITHDRAW HEARTBURN DRUG
</HEADLINE>
  (mh)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The manufacturer of Propulsid, a medication for
severe heartburn that has been linked to 80 deaths, said Thursday
that it would withdraw the drug from pharmacies this summer and
instead distribute it free to a limited number of patients for whom
all other medicines have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The action by Janssen Pharmaceutica of Titusville, N.J., a
holding of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, taken with the approval of the Food
and Drug Administration, comes on the heels of the withdrawal of
another prescription drug, Rezulin. Rezulin, a diabetes medication,
was linked to 63 deaths from liver failure; on Tuesday the FDA
ordered it off the market.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has known since 1994 that Propulsid could cause fatal
heart rhythm disturbances in people with cardiovascular disease or
those taking certain other medications, but left the drug on the
market because it believed the benefits outweighed the risks. But
that assessment was changing, officials said. The FDA had scheduled
for April 12 a meeting of a panel of experts who were to discuss
Propulsid, including proposals to ban or severely restrict its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about very restrictive actions,'' said Dr.
Florence Houn, the FDA official in charge of gastrointestinal
medications, ``and the company decided to take this voluntary
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement between the agency and the company,
Propulsid, which had $950 million in sales last year, will be
marketed until mid-July, to give patients and doctors time to
switch to alternative therapies. After that, doctors who want to
prescribe the drug will be required to document that other
therapies have failed and that their patients do not have
conditions or take other medications that would make the Propulsid
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid, whose chemical name is cisapride, was approved in
1993 for patients with heartburn, but is now typically prescribed
``off-label'' to patients with other, more serious conditions.
Within a year of its approval, the FDA began receiving reports of
injuries and deaths. As of Dec. 31, the agency said, Propulsid had
been associated with 341 reports of heart rhythm abnormalities,
including the 80 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had issued new warnings for the drug and changed the
label five times, most recently in January, and Greg Panico, a
spokesman for Janssen, said the company sponsored educational
seminars for doctors and pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
   But it became clear over time, he said, that the agency's
warnings were not being heeded, perhaps because the directions for
how to safely prescribe Propulsid had become too complicated.
``With each new labeling change, the label became more complex,''
Panico said.
</P>
<P>
   Houn said the agency allowed Propulsid to remain on the market,
despite the injuries and deaths, because it had an unusual
mechanism of action and the only other drug that worked the same
way caused serious, and sometimes permanent, neurological damage.
Instead of withdrawing it, she said, ``we have been working to try
to manage the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health
Research Group and a frequent critic of the food and drug agency,
said Propulsid should have been taken off the market long ago. He
described the drug as ``a serious public health hazard,'' and said
the agency had wrongly concluded that it could ``fix the safety
problem'' by changing the label.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30 million patients have taken Propulsid since it came
on the market, although only about 300,000 patients take the drug
today. They include people with gastrointestinal complications of
diabetes and infants and children, who are prescribed the drug when
they suffer severe constipation.
</P>
<P>
   Some stroke patients and people with Parkinson's disease also
take the drug, Houn said, adding that these patients, as opposed to
those with heartburn, are the ones who will probably continue to
receive it under the new limited-use program.

 WASHINGTON: those e-mails.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It remains unclear what, if any, sensitive information is
contained in the thousands of e-mails in question. One of Northrup
employees working on the computer system, Betty Lambuth, has
testified that a colleague told her they were full of evidence
dealing with the Monica Lewinsky controversy and a variety of other
investigations, including Vice President Gore's fund raising. But
the colleague, Robert Haas, denied on Thursday at a congressional
hearing that he had any idea what was in the e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Haas did search the e-mail accounts of several White House aides
to determine whether any messages from Miss Lewinsky had not been
stored properly. He said he found numerous such e-mails, which he
turned over to superiors, but White House officials said all of
them had been discovered by other means and sent along to the
office of then Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department review was disclosed on Thursday in legal
documents filed by the Justice Department's Civil Division, which
is defending the White House in the lawsuit over the e-mails filed
by a frequent White House antagonist, Judicial Watch. The Civil
Division has asked Federal District Judge Royce C. Lambeth to
postpone consideration of the civil case pending the outcome of the
criminal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ray, who replaced Starr as independent counsel, agreed
with the Justice Department's request.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's legal papers, Robert J. Conrad, Jr., the
head of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit, known
internally as the Task Force, said that prosecutors had recently
learned of the charges related to the malfunctioning automated
records system.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of these allegations,'' Conrad said, ``the Task
Force has begun an investigation into whether subpoenas issued to
the EOP (Executive Office of the President) by the Task Force were
fully complied with and whether persons were threatened with
retaliation in order to prevent the existence of the affected
emails from becoming known to the Task Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad did not indicate whether prosecutors had reached any
conclusions about the e-mail issue. Other law enforcement officials
said on Thursday that investigators had not determined the content
of the missing e-mails or established whether anyone tried to
intentionally suppress them.

No. 7 TULSA (31-4) VS. No. 6 MIAMI (23-10)
When: 6:55 p.m. TV: KTVT/Ch. 11
TULSA GOLDEN HURRICANE
<TEXT>
<P>
   COACH: Bill Self, 7th season, 129-79. Self has established
himself as one of the brightest young coaches in the country. In
only his third season at Tulsa, he has built the Golden Hurricane
into the WAC's top team and a legitimate Final Four contender.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS: Tulsa's aggressive defense has averaged 11.8 steals
per game. Opponents are averaging 20.5 turnovers per game.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: The Golden Hurricane plays with a post player
and four quick guards. Tulsa's pressure defense is perhaps the best
in the country. The Golden Hurricane is balanced on offense and
gets a lot of easy baskets because of turnovers, a major reason for
its high shooting percentage, 47.5. Tulsa is also deep. Sixth-man
David Shelton (14 points per game) is the team's leading scorer but
not the only key contributor off the bench. This team can win with
full-court and half-court styles.
</P>
<P>
   WILL WIN IF: The Golden Hurricane's pressure defense can disrupt
Miami's offense and create easy scoring chances.
TULSA STARTERS
G TONY HEARD 6-0 175 Sr. Key stats: 9.7 ppg, 40 pct. 3-pointers G

MIAMI HURRICANES
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Leonard Hamilton, 14th season, 200-209. His teams are
known for tough defense and a grind-it-out offense. Formerly the
head coach at Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS: The Hurricanes shoot 42.8 percent from the field,
27.2 percent from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: The Hurricanes rely on rugged defense, with an
emphasis on pressuring the ball. This is a big, strong team that
prefers to battle in a half-court game. Miami doesn't have a pure
point guard, so it sometimes struggles offensively, especially with
turnovers. Johnny Hemsley is a streaky but dangerous shooter.
</P>
<P>
   WILL WIN IF: The Hurricanes can reduce the game to a slowdown
pace and if they do a good job preventing turnovers against Tulsa's
pressure.
MIAMI STARTERS G VERNON JENNINGS 6-4 203 Sr. Key stats: 7.8 ppg,
6.8 assists G JOHNNY HEMSLEY 6-5 195 Sr. Key stats: 18.2 ppg, 31.6

Hurricane's pressure defense makes the difference.

   No. 8 North Carolina (20-13) vs. No. 4 Tennessee (26-6) NORTH
CAROLINA TAR HEELS
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Bill Guthridge, 3rd season, 78-27. Was a longtime
assistant to the legendary Dean Smith.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: This is not a typically quick Tar Heels team. North
Carolina has only 193 steals, compared with 271 steals recorded by
their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: In most of their losses, the Tar Heels had a
large number of turnovers. Point guard Ed Cota is more effective
when he aggressively looks for his shot. Guard Joseph Forte can
create his own shot while center Brendan Haywood can be a force.
Haywood, who had a lackluster NCAA Tournament a year ago, had a
tremendous regional last weekend against Missouri and Stanford.
Opponents have been able to exploit North Carolina's lack of
defensive quickness.
</P>
<P>
   WILL WIN IF: Cota controls the game, Haywood is dominant in the
middle and the Heels limit scoring by Tony Harris and Vincent
Yarbrough.

TENNESSEE VOLUNTEERS
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Jerry Green, 17th season, 289-202. His teams play an
up-tempo style.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Tennessee has held opponents to 40.3 percent shooting,
31.7 percent on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: The Volunteers have lots of talent, but they
are sometimes undisciplined. Tony Harris has been a clutch shooter,
but he sometimes plays out of control. When Tennessee is patient on
offense, it can be hard to stop. Defensively, the Volunteers have
the speed and quickness to play tough man-to-man defense.
</P>
<P>
   WILL WIN IF: Harris can win the point-guard battle with Ed Cota
and if the Volunteers' deep and talented front line can wear down
the thin Tar Heels.
TENNESSEE STARTERS G JON HIGGINS 6-3 190 Fr. Key stats: 6.3 ppg,

No. 1 DUKE (29-4) vs. No. 5 FLORIDA (26-7) When: 6:38 p.m.
DUKE BLUE DEVILS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COACH: Mike Krzyzewski, 25th season, 571-218. The only coach
with a national title to his credit who still has a team in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STATS: The Blue Devils do an excellent job playing defense
without fouling much. They have made more free throws (601) than
their opponents have attempted (510).
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: The Blue Devils rely on Chris Carrawell's
ability to slash to the basket and Shane Battier's accurate 3-point
shooting. Freshmen Jason Williams (point guard) and Carlos Boozer
(center) have been important contributors. The Blue Devils are able
to get good shots when needed. Defensively, Duke plays a sticky
man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   WILL WIN IF: It can attack Florida's press to score easy baskets
and its defensive pressure flusters the younger Gators.

</P>
<P>
   COACH: Billy Donovan, 6th season, is 108-68. The Rick Pitino
disciple has built Florida into one of the most-talented teams in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Florida is deep and talented and plays an aggressive
defense, forcing an average of 19.8 turnovers per game.
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: Billy Donovan likes to utilize a deep bench to
fuel his full-court pressure defense. The Gators like to fire away
from 3-point range. Sophomore forward Mike Miller is the top
offensive threat while freshman forward Donnell Harvey has emerged
as solid rebounder and inside scorer.
</P>
<P>
   WILL WIN IF: Its superior depth allows it to dictate a fast pace
and if the 3-point shots are falling.

</P>
<P>
   COACH: Tommy Amaker, 3rd season, 52-39. The former Duke star is
making a national name for himself.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: In two NCAA Tournament overtime victories, the Pirates
are 23-of-44 from 3-point range (52.2 percent).
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: The Pirates probably will be without senior
point guard Shaheen Holloway, who injured his ankle in the team's
second-round victory against Temple. Sophomore point guard Ty Shine
scored a career-high 27 points filling in for Holloway and shooting
over Temple's zone. The Pirates rely on the 3-point shot. Amaker
likes to switch defenses to keep the opposition off balance.
</P>
<P>
   WILL WIN IF: The Pirates don't suddenly realize they're just two
victories from a very unlikely Final Four trip.

OKLAHOMA STATE COWBOYS
</P>
<P>
   COACH: Eddie Sutton, 30th season, 658-258. He's looking for his
second Final Four trip as the Cowboys' coach.
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: In their past 11 games, the Cowboys are shooting 44.7
from 3-point range (88 of 197).
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: The Cowboys are a perfect NCAA Tournament team.
They play tough defense, don't turn the ball over much and they
work until they get good shots. Oklahoma State has six seniors, so
postseason jitters aren't a factor. Oklahoma State can get scoring
from every position but point guard, where Doug Gottlieb struggles
to shoot from the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   WILL WIN IF: The Cowboys' perimeter defense can prevent Seton
Hall from going crazy from 3-point range.
WENDELL BARNHOUSE'S PREDICTION: Oklahoma State 73, Seton Hall 65

A SLOW START TO NASCAR SEASON FOR FOYT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A.J. Foyt, who had knee surgery in February,
still is hobbling around. Sort of like his NASCAR Winston Cup race
team.
</P>
<P>
   The 65-year-old Foyt, who is on crutches after having 23 pins
removed from his leg, was at Texas Motor Speedway on Thursday to
help promote the DirecTV 500, which takes the green flag April 2.
Foyt is the owner of a fledgling Winston Cup race team that has
made only two of five races and is without a full-time driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be a tough road,'' Foyt said. ``You've
got 90 percent of the top drivers all under contract. It's sealed
and signed, and you're not going to break them. I knew going in
there like this that it was going to be hard to break in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, when I was going before and owned my own cars, I didn't
care, because I was driving the car and knew what I could do. But I
don't know what some of these other people can do. I knew that it
was going to be the bumpy road. I just wish I was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt, who recently was named driver of the century by ESPN's
``RPM 2Night'', began the season with rookie Mike Bliss as his
driver. But Bliss qualified for only one race, and finished 35th
among 43 cars in the season-opening Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   After Bliss was 47th in qualifying for the 43-car field on March
12 in Atlanta, Foyt switched drivers. He signed veteran Dick
Trickle, 58, to a two-race contract.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle, who has 293 career starts, qualified Foyt's Conseco
Pontiac 12th for the TranSouth Financial 400 at Darlington, S.C.,
last week. He finished 31st.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Dick Trickle,'' Foyt said. ``I knew he had a lot of
experience. I knew he was up in age. I didn't expect him to run all
day like a 20-year-old boy, but I felt like he would be competitive
and help me understand what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt said he has not decided who will be in the car next week or
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm evaluating it,'' Foyt said. ``I haven't gone that far down
the line yet. ... This is my home state. Maybe I'll have to get in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Foyt, who also owns two Indy Racing League teams, said he is
committed to the Winston Cup series. Patience is what won him seven
Winston Cup races and a record 67 Indianapolis-style championship
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you see A.J. Foyt's name on something, I'm 100
percent there,'' Foyt said. ``... I've got a good reputation.
People know that when I go into something I'm not going in there
just to say I've got a team. That's not my way. I go in there
because I love challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I said, I knew it was going to be rough. I told my
partner that it wasn't going to be a bed of roses. I look at next
year as being a lot easier, and then we'll have some points where
we've got provisionals, so if you make a mistake at least you can
start the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he will start worrying about where he finishes. nn

   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ Hal Sutton spent the final day of
practice rounds at The Players Championship warning fellow
competitors about adopting a ``defeatist attitude'' from their
effusive praise of Tiger Woods, the world's hottest and top-ranked
golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton spent Thursday laying a blueprint for others to follow in
trying to cut into Woods' .700 winning percentage over the past
seven months at PGA Tour events. Amid swirling, 30 mph wind gusts
that pushed the average score to 76.2 for competitors at the TPC at
Sawgrass, Sutton offset four bogeys with five birdies and an eagle
to shoot a 69 and take the opening-round lead.
</P>
<P>
   Woods looms two strokes behind, at 71, and said he was
``ecstatic'' to break par on a day when 19 golfers failed to break
80 and two players (Phil Mickelson and Franklin Langham) carded 46s
on the watery back nine.
</P>
<P>
   Before play was suspended because of darkness with 21 golfers on
the course, 41 players, including Woods, splashed tee shots at the
signature 17th hole, which features an island green. If the highest
scores recorded on each hole by opening-round competitors were
added, Thursday's total would have reached 120 at the par-72
layout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything under par is good,'' said Woods, winner of seven of
his past 10 starts at tour events. ``It was hard to pull the right
club because the wind was all over the place. It just depended on
which gust you caught.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Stadler, who soared to an 83, said: ``Actually, it could
have been in the 90s. I was lucky I made some putts early.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, the most outspoken critic of Colin Montgomerie's
assertion that players resigned themselves to being Woods'
runner-up after the first round of last week's Bay Hill
Invitational, used a conservative approach to carve out the lead.
Sutton said he focused on avoiding ``really big numbers,'' like the
matching sevens that Austin resident Bob Estes took at Nos. 10 (a
par-4) and 13 (a par-3). Or the eight that Stadler carded at the
par-4 16th.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton also did not fall prey to the wide-eyed Woods wonder that
seems to grip peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be bad business to take a defeatist attitude
like that,'' Sutton said. ``By praising Tiger all the time, I don't
know what it's doing for Tiger. But it's certainly putting a
defeatist attitude in the guy that is doing all the praising. Tiger
is just as capable of making a mistake as anyone else. And on this
golf course, there are a lot of mistakes to be made.''
</P>
<P>
   The most glaring gaffes resulted in drowned golf balls. John
Daly and Duffy Waldorf each dunked two at No. 17, the same hole
where Sergio Garcia three-putted for a triple-bogey during a round
of 82. Even the guys who persevered, like Lee Janzen (70), said
conditions were ``brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   The key, Janzen said, was adopting the right mental attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear the wind whipping outside, I get excited for the
challenge,'' Janzen said.
</P>
<P>
   More than anyone else, Sutton proved equal to that challenge
Thursday. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks balanced three birdies with
three bogeys in a round of even-par 72, tying Jim Furyk for low
round by an afternoon starter. Asked about the wind, Furyk said:
``We're all hoping it lays down (Friday). That was enough
punishment for one day. For one week, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Steve Elkington, the 1997 TPC champ, withdrew Thursday because
of a stomach virus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lee Janzen, a two-time U.S. Open champ, said Thursday he plans
to compete in the GTE Byron Nelson Classic (May 11-14) and
MasterCard Colonial (May 18-21). Janzen, a Colonial regular, will
be competing at the Nelson for only the second time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   _ With 10 victories in his past 16 starts at PGA Tour events,
Tiger Woods has reached a double-digit win total in fewer events
than any player since Byron Nelson in 1945. Nelson won 10-of-10
during his 11-event winning streak. Ben Hogan won 10 of 19 from
1949-53. Johnny Miller won 10-of-23 in 1974-75. nn

YOU NEED TO `HEAR' HOW TO BET DUBAI RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Casner won't be wearing traditional Arab garb when he races
one of the horses he owns at the Dubai World Cup on Saturday.
Casner, the Southlake resident who's a part owner in Bet Me Best,
didn't a year ago when he went to the races there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very western country,'' Casner said, explaining why he
packed his businessman's wardrobe of a coat and tie.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, racing in Dubai shares some similarities with racing in
the United States. Although the Muslim religion won't allow you to
place a bet in Dubai, you can hide workouts as if you were trying
to score big on a bet.
</P>
<P>
   It happened last year. And let's hope those of us who can bet on
the race at North American simulcast outlets such as Lone Star Park
at Grand Prairie can learn from last year's experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Maktoum family, which rules Dubai and operates horse racing
there, always has a contingent of horses entered in the Dubai World
Cup. Most of the attention last year was centered on High Rise, a
horse who had competed snazzily in Europe's classic races the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser-known horse named Almutawakel also was part of the
Maktoum stable, but he was offered as a separate betting entry.
There were murmurs that Almutawakel had raced well in Dubai in one
of those infamous ``trial'' races conducted at the Maktoum family's
private Al Quoz training facility.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all they were _ murmurs _ because the Maktoums allow
only invited guests to view the trial races. The closest visiting
press can come to viewing the horses is the day after they work out
at Al Quoz, and that viewing session was abruptly canceled this
year. Instead, the press was shown still photos of some of the
horses.
</P>
<P>
   We would love to hear some good murmurs this year, because
Almutawakel won last year at odds of more than 20-1.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum led Almutawakel into the winner's
circle. But if he was a Common Joe, and not the crown prince,
Sheikh Mo would be asked to appear in the stewards' office after
his picture was taken in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, people in this country have to sit down because of
suspicion of falsified workout times. It happened to
Louisiana-based trainer Don Cormier and a racetrack clocker after
they were accused of recording inaccurate workout times during the
off-season at Evangeline Downs.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance is this: They're trying to hide a horse's true
ability in order to cash a big bet at race time.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheikh Mo doesn't need to cash a bet. That $12 million
everyone is running for in Saturday's races comes from his family's
stack of oil money.
</P>
<P>
   No, Sheikh Mo's M-O comes from the chip on his shoulder. That
chip may have been placed there by those who question his operating
methods in the horse business.
</P>
<P>
   It's his bat, his ball, his game, however. And we either don't
bet his races or we learn his tendencies, as we learn any other
stable's tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Almutawakel isn't running in the World Cup on Saturday, but
another one like him is. That's Gracioso, who has won a Group III
race in Europe like Almutawakel. Maktoum family racing manager
Simon Crisford says Gracioso is training smartly and may be capable
of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Crisford has seen the horse race in Dubai. But all that the rest
of us can go by are the pictures.
LATE SCRATCHES ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Nelson Bunker Hunt of Dallas topped one of the sessions of the
Ocala Breeders' Sale Company 2-Year-Olds In-Training auction this
week in Florida when he spent $390,000 on a Montbrook filly named
Tuff Tuc. She'll go to trainer Bob Baffert. Hunt also spent $75,000
on a Lord Carson colt and $35,000 on a Belong To Me colt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Snuck In, who won the Gallery Furniture Texan Juvenile the
last time he raced, makes his return after a 15-week layoff in
Saturday's $125,000 Rebel Stakes at Oaklawn Park. Snuck In, trained
by Steve Asmussen, hasn't started since he suffered a foot abscess
and was scratched out of the Risen Star Stakes last month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arrested Dreams was showing signs of wear and tear when she
bore out in the stretch of her most recent race at Fair Grounds.
And after she was scratched out of the Victoria Lass Stakes last
week in New Orleans, owner Louie Roussel announced he was retiring
the filly. Arrested Dreams was champion 2-year-old filly in 1998 at
Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   _ Although Heritage of Gold (Horse of the Meet at Lone Star Park
at Grand Prairie last year) won her seasonal debut in the Oaklawn
Breeders' Cup Handicap last week, it's unclear if she'll face
Silverbulletday in her next race. That's the $500,000 Apple Blossom
at Oaklawn on April 9, which is expected to include Breeders' Cup
Distaff winner Beautiful Pleasure. Mike Pegram, owner of
Silverbulletday, said he'd rather get a race at Santa Anita before
the filly goes to Churchill Downs for the Louisville Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 500 horses will be auctioned Monday and Tuesday
during the Fasig-Tipton Texas 2-Year-Olds In-Training Sale at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie. This is the same sale that produced
graded stakes winner Dreams Gallore, and this year's event is
offering a horse by 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy and out of an
Argentine graded stakes winner named Indianita. Sales horses will
be working out over the track Saturday and Sunday.
SPOTLIGHT ON ... WORLD CUP FIELD FACES HORSE WITH NAME TO WIN
</P>
<P>
   ``Breakfast at Lone Star'' is back. It's that annual eye-opener
known as Dubai World Cup day, when the parking lot gates at Lone
Star Park at Grand Prairie open at 7:45 a.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The first race from Dubai _ the $2 million United Arab Emirates
Derby _ is scheduled for 8:35 a.m. Three other races are scheduled
before the feature _ the $6 million Dubai World Cup _ goes off at
11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daily Racing Form'' is expected to have past performances for
the races available for sale Friday. Two horses in the races are
owned by Texans. Bet Me Best, who races in the Golden Shaheen, is
owned in part by Bill Casner of Southlake. Behrens, who races in
the $6 million Dubai World Cup, is owned by Bill Clifton of Waco.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a huge betting race, especially if Dubai Millennium
gets beat. Despite the expected field of 14 horses or more, Dubai
Millennium is listed as an odds-on favorite in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Does he deserve it, or is it a kiss-up by bookmakers to Sheikh
Mohammed al Maktoum, the crown prince of Dubai who also owns Dubai
Millennium?
</P>
<P>
   If it's the latter, it couldn't be more bold than the horse's
name. (The sheikh named him in hopes that the Seeking The Gold
horse would win the Dubai World Cup in 2000).
</P>
<P>
   Dubai Millennium may not be worth odds-on, but he is a deserving
favorite. He has won seven of eight career races and shaded two
minutes for the 1 1/4 miles in his last race at Dubai's Nad al
Sheba Racecourse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Behrens, five other horses are from North
America: Ecton Park, Malek, Puerto Madero, Public Purse and Saint's
Honor. nn

RESISTING DRUGS, TB SPREADS FAST IN THE WEALTHY WESTERN NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands _ Deadly strains of drug-resistant
tuberculosis are increasing not just in poor countries but in
wealthy Western ones, according to a new report from the World
Health Organization and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   The report, to be released Friday at a tuberculosis conference
in Amsterdam, says drug-resistant cases have recently increased by
50 percent in Denmark and Germany. While the total number of cases
was small, and most of those analyzed were resistant to only one of
the five most common drugs, doctors at the conference say the trend
is alarming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a message _ `Watch out guys, this is serious,''' said Dr.
Marcos Espinal, the lead author of the report. ``It's a potential
major crisis in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In other parts of the globe, from China to Siberia to Puerto
Rico, strains resistant to at least four of the five common drugs
have emerged. Some cases are fatal; others are curable only at 100
times the cost of standard TB treatment. In Western Europe or the
United States, where some cases of multiple-drug-resistant
tuberculosis surfaced earlier, the cost of curing one can be as
high as $250,000, counting $10,000 worth of drugs plus lengthy
hospitalization, lab work, outpatient care and possible lung
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis, one of the world's leading killers during the 18th
and 19th centuries when it was called consumption, was nearly
conquered after World War II by the discovery of antibiotics. But
in the last decade, largely because of AIDS, it has re-emerged as
one of the world's most devastating diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Eight million people are newly infected each year, and 2 million
people die.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike malaria, which follows mosquito vectors, or AIDS, which
spreads by sexual or blood contact, TB can circle the world at the
speed of a passenger jet and be transmitted by a single cough.
Health officials are seeking $700 million to attack the disease in
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   They are in the awkward position of trying to raise the alarm in
rich countries that don't feel very threatened. At present,
tuberculosis usually remains dormant in healthy people; only about
2 percent of them will progress toward the telltale sign _ coughing
up blood. Most cases in America and Western Europe occur among poor
recent immigrants, or among AIDS patients, cancer patients, drug
addicts and others with suppressed immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The United States recently doubled foreign aid grants for TB
control, to $22 million. It also spends $100 million a year
overseas to fight AIDS, a major underlying factor.
</P>
<P>
   But the international medical community's most powerful weapon
for raising money is the fear that an explosion of cases in the
Third World will let divergent strains merge into something
incurable and highly contagious that will attack the West.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings have already been sounded: In the early 1990s, a
multiple-drug-resistant strain killed about 500 people in New York
City _ most AIDS-infected _and cost $1 billion to suppress. In 1997
a rural area on the Kentucky-Tennessee border fell prey to a
contagious, rapidly growing strain that, luckily, succumbed quickly
to standard drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of drug-resistant strains in Germany and Denmark
is seen as another possible harbinger of a Western epidemic echoing
the one sweeping through Africa and Asia. Denmark has had only
about 500 TB cases; they were analyzed for resistance to standard
antibiotics and were generally found not to resist more than one
strain. Germany has had 10,000 cases, but fewer than 2,000 were
analyzed. What surprised experts was that a small problem had grown
by 50 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
   In each country, about a third of the cases were among
native-born Danes and Germans; two-thirds were among immigrants,
most from Eastern Europe, a few from Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis experts fear a backlash against immigration but say
that would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have this notion that you can wall off your borders
from germs,'' said Kraig Klaudt, a spokesman for the World Health
Organization. ``You can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinal said, ``No screening tools we have will catch the whole
problem in refugees, tourists, workers and everyone else.'' His
solution: ``to help those countries where the situation is so
terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   The report on multiple drug resistance being released Friday,
International TB Day, does not cover the whole world, but 72
``geographical settings'' _ sometimes a whole country, sometimes
just a province _ with about 68,000 patients whose sputum samples
were tested in sophisticated medical laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found nine particularly worrying ``hot spots'' _
places where more than 3 percent of patients seeking treatment for
the first time already had drug-resistant tuberculosis. The nine
were in seven countries: Estonia, Latvia, Russia, China, India,
Iran and Mozambique.

SHELTON GIVES TULSA PUNCH OFF THE BENCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ David Shelton has learned to do the most with
the least. And Tulsa has been a major benefactor of his charity
work.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-seeded Golden Hurricane (31-4) will face
sixth-seeded Miami (23-10) in Friday's South Regional semifinals
largely because of Shelton's efforts in becoming his team's top
scorer. In the second game, No. 4 seed Tennessee (26-6) will face
No. 8 seed North Carolina (20-13).
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Tulsa's season ended with a 41-point loss to Duke in
the East Regional. Golden Hurricane coach Bill Self decided that
his team needed a new blueprint. More quickness and speed was
needed. One of the new pieces to the makeover was Shelton, a
6-foot-6 forward from Independence Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recruited David because we knew he loved to play and we
knew he was a warrior,'' Self said. ``And we had him projected as a
starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Shelton found himself starting the season on the bench
as Tulsa's sixth man. Self decided on a lineup of 6-10 Brandon
Kurtz at center surrounded by guard/wing players Eric Coley, Tony
Heard, Marcus Hill and Greg Harrington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about rotating the guy who would sit out every
game,'' Self said. ``But the season started and we were playing so
well, I decided that, `Man, I like this.' The next thing you know,
David had the attitude that he could care less about starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thinking changed. He trusted the coaches. We convinced
David that he can be the best sixth man in America or just be
another good player who starts. I honestly believe he's as
effective or more effective than any other sixth man in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton is the leading man in an ensemble. Six Tulsa players
average 9.7 points or more per game. Shelton leads the way at 14
points. Of those six players, Shelton's 22 minutes per game ranks
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not playing as much as I'd like, but we're winning so I'm
happy,'' said Shelton, a Cincinnati native and the son of former
NBA player Lonnie Shelton. ``This team has a lot of guys who have
accepted their roles and that's what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelton has a versatile game. He makes 36 percent of his 3-point
shots. He leads the Golden Hurricane in free throws made (162) and
attempted (210). He averages 4.6 rebounds per game and half of his
rebounds come on the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   What those numbers translate to is this: Shelton is hard to
guard. He's capable of scoring from the perimeter, driving to the
basket to score or get fouled and he can scrap around the basket
for rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they need me to be physical, I will,'' Shelton said. ``If
they need me to play a finesse game, I will. I had been a starter
since my freshman year of high school. This is my first year not
being a starter. I'm not going to say I like it, but I've adjusted
to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to get more shots. In high school and junior
college, I shot the ball 25 times a game. Here I'm not the first
option or the second option. I don't have to put up 25 shots for us
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the 6-10 Kurtz, Shelton is the tallest Tulsa player
who receives significant minutes. His ability to play either
forward position plus provide solid rebounding has allowed Self to
play the kind of quick, pressing lineup he envisioned at the
beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Shelton is the reason why we've had such a chance to be
this good,'' Self said. ``He's a terrific player, he's ego-less,
he's a physical presence who can score.'' nn

TAR HEELS CLUELESS ABOUT THEIR UNEXPECTED SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Those who love a good mystery have the perfect
team for which to root in the NCAA Tournament South Regional. Even
its coach has no idea why North Carolina has finally started
playing up to its reputation and pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels entered their 26th consecutive NCAA Tournament
with an 18-13 record. After ending the regular season with a 90-76
loss at Duke and a 58-52 loss to Wake Forest in the first round of
the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, North Carolina had no
momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't expect to be in this position,'' senior point guard
Ed Cota said. ``But we put ourselves in this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   There were questions as to whether the Tar Heels were either
over-seeded at No. 8 or even deserved an at-large NCAA bid. Then
came two victories, including a stunning second-round upset of No.
1 seed Stanford. Now, the Tar Heels are in the Sweet 16, where
they'll play No. 4 seed Tennessee on Friday night in a semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge said ``the switch came on''
for his team. Why now?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know,'' said Guthridge, 78-27 in his third
season after taking over for the legendary Dean Smith. ``I've liked
this team all year and I felt like if we could just get over the
hump, everything might be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, North Carolina was stunned in the first round by
Weber State. Now, the Tar Heels find themselves an unlikely
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regular season means nothing if you come into the tourney
and lose in the first round. We found that out last year'' said
junior center Brendan Haywood. ``The tournament is a new season. We
felt like we could make a statement and make amends for what's
happened this season.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Guthridge, the mother of North Carolina coach Bill
Guthridge, died Wednesday at the age of 96. Guthridge said he will
travel from Austin to Parsons, Kan., for the funeral Monday. ``It's
really a blessing,'' he said Thursday. ``She really hasn't been
with us for the last five or six years.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee senior center C.J. Black made a quasi prediction on
Friday's game with North Carolina: ``If (Brendan Haywood) doesn't
respect my jumper, I'm going to have a career night.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Miami's Vernon Jennings on Tulsa: ``I've seen their
highlights. They haven't been on national television too much. I
saw how bad they were beating teams and I was like, `What's going
on with these guys?' They were beating people by 25 points and I
was wondering if their conference was that bad or are they that
good. They've been going through the NCAA Tournament better than I
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Tulsa senior forward Eric Coley said that his team's travel
schedule should be enough to provide respect: ``When we go to
Hawaii we play on the road the next day. East Coast teams don't
have to do that. We have to go to into those altitudes, fly to
Hawaii and then take a six-hour flight to play back in the states.
People think that's no big deal. We do it and people say we're
supposed to do it. People in the East and Midwest don't give us the
respect we deserve.` nn

AT MEETING OF 3 FAITHS, DISHARMONY IN 3 PARTS
</HEADLINE>
   (With POPE-HOLYLAND, POPE-SURVIVOR) 
(rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ John Paul II has long dreamed of holding an
interfaith encounter during the Holy Year with Jewish and Muslim
leaders to symbolize the religious reconciliation that he has made
a hallmark of his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   The pope initially tried to have it on Mount Sinai, where Moses,
revered by all three religions, received the Ten Commandments. That
fell through. Thursday, in Jerusalem, the religious encounter the
Vatican patched together grew so stormy that it became a symbol not
of reconciliation, but of the deep political divides that are
veining the pope's pilgrimage to the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The pope and his two guests took their seats in an auditorium at
the Pontifical Institute of Notre Dame. Above them was a painted
screen depicting Jerusalem with a dove of peace flying over it and
the word peace in Hebrew, Arabic and Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Ashkenazic chief rabbi, Yisrael Meir Lau, took the
podium first, speaking with intensity about the need, in everyday
life, for peace and dialogue. He then put an abrupt end to both by
thanking the pope for ``your recognition of the Jewish independent
state, the state of Israel, your recognition of Jerusalem as its
united, eternal capital city.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who is trying to get Jerusalem international status as
a holy city, had done no such thing. A man in the audience, made up
of representatives of the Catholic, Muslim and Jewish faiths, along
with others, angrily shouted, ``The pope did not recognize
Jerusalem!''
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Taysir Tamimi, the newly appointed deputy chief justice of
the Palestinian Islamic courts, spoke next. He welcomed the pope in
Arabic as the guest of ``the Palestinian people on the land of
Palestine, in the city of holy Jerusalem, eternal capital of
Palestine'' and was interrupted by loud applause. He had agreed to
take part in the interfaith encounter after the chief Muslim
cleric, the mufti of Jerusalem, backed out, saying he could not sit
with rabbis as long as Palestine was occupied by Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   As Tamimi spoke about justice and the ``usurpation'' of national
rights and ``aggression against people, property and holy places,''
Lau, who does not speak Arabic, stared stonily into space.
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who had an interpreter at his side, held his head in
his hands throughout both speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The sheik mentioned Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish extremist who
opened fire in a Hebron mosque in 1994, killing many Muslims;
occupation; Jewish settlements, and the need to establish an
independent Palestinian state, ``under the leadership of the
president, Yasser Arafat, with its eternal capital Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling in a stunned silence, the moderator, Rabbi Alon
Goshen-Gottstein, raced to the podium and said, ``I would like to
remind everyone of the spirit in which we came here today, as
religious people who can put aside our politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope then delivered prepared remarks that seemed eerily like
a response to moment. ``Religion is the enemy of exclusion and
discrimination, of hatred and rivalry, of violence and conflict,''
he said. ``Religion and peace go together.''
</P>
<P>
   The moderator raced back and said that the conductor of an
interreligious children's chorus that was to perform songs of peace
in Jewish, Arabic and English was asked by his charges to first to
convey their response to the gathering.
</P>
<P>
   He said the children deplored the kind of attitudes that
``derails peace and cost Yitzhak Rabin and Anwar Sadat their
lives.'' Rabin, an Israeli prime minister, and Sadat, an Egyptian
president, were both assassinated by people opposed to the peace
they were pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps still upset by the tone of the meeting, the children's
chorus launched into a jerky, disharmonious concert that drove
schoolchildren in the audience to giggle uncontrollably and may
have been one reason Tamimi suddenly rose from the stage and left.
A Vatican aide said that the sheik had leaned over and told the
pope he had a previous engagement.
</P>
<P>
   The rabbi and the pope stayed in their seats, then poured water
on a potted olive plant that the three leaders were meant to
symbolically plant together.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the Israeli cabinet secretary, Yitzhak Herzog, said,
``Some people perhaps don't understand the atmosphere'' of such a
meeting. ``For the record, we disagree totally with what was
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Israeli present was more blunt, calling the meeting
``hideous.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Edward I. Cassidy, the Vatican official in charge of
interfaith dialogue, tried to be more positive. ``Not everything
was perfect,'' he said. ``But the fact that it was held at all is
important.''

CURTIS SEEMS CONTENT TO BE A RANGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Texas Rangers outfielder Chad Curtis said he
doesn't foresee demanding a trade at the end of the year though he
has that right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not big on demanding a trade or anything like that,''
Curtis said. ``A lot of people asked me in New York if I wanted to
be traded because I wasn't playing as much as I wanted. I said I
signed a contract to play for the Yankees and my obligation is to
fulfill that as long as I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis signed a three-year contract with the Yankees before the
1999 season. By being traded during the middle of a multiyear deal,
Curtis has the right to demand a trade at the end of the season. If
he did so and the Rangers failed to comply, he could become a free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it, but I don't
foresee that happening,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis maintains that stance though his chances of playing time
were reduced when the Rangers acquired switch-hitting designated
hitter David Segui. Curtis is a right-handed hitter and was
expected to get playing time at DH while platooning with Lee
Stevens. But Segui is expected to play against left-handers and
right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to think about it,'' Curtis said. ``Obviously I've
got a better chance of getting (at-bats) with a left-hander at DH
than a switch hitter. I recognized that could be detrimental to my
number of ABs. But I've learned in this game if you prepare
yourself and just see what happens, pretty good things usually
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel I can help this team in different ways; it's a
matter of getting ready to do that.'' ROUGH DAY FOR LAMB
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Mike Lamb continues to struggle in his efforts to be the
Rangers' Opening Day third baseman. Lamb bobbled one grounder for
an error and made what manager Johnny Oates said was a bad throw on
another play in the Rangers' 4-2 loss to the Minnesota Twins on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb has committed five errors this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he can play better than he's played this spring,''
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb was 1-for-4 and is hitting .286. Tom Evans was 1-for-2 as a
designated hitter and is batting .368.
</P>
<P>
   In the possibility that Evans, a right-handed hitter, could win
the job, Oates has had Frank Catalanotto, a left-handed hitter,
increase the work he's getting at third base. BY PRESIDENTIAL
DECREE
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush will throw out the ceremonial first
pitch at the Texas Rangers' home opener Monday, April 3, the team
announced Thursday. The Rangers will play the Chicago White Sox in
the opener, scheduled to start at 2:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the second time President Bush has thrown out the
first pitch at a Rangers' game. He also performed the duty at the
Rangers' home opener in 1991 at Arlington Stadium. The only other
president to throw out a first pitch at a Rangers' home game was
Gerald Ford at the home opener in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand single tickets remain for the opener. LAS VEGAS
MEETING
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are one of six teams expected to be represented at a
meeting in Las Vegas on Monday. Officials from Las Vegas are trying
to convince four to six teams to move their spring-training bases
from Florida in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' lease in Port Charlotte expires after next season,
and the club is considering a move to Las Vegas, Arizona or another
part of Florida. Remaining in Port Charlotte is also an option. A
decision is expected this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, Houston Astros, Kansas City Royals,
Toronto Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles are also looking into Las
Vegas. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Left-handed reliever Mike Venafro, sidelined this spring with
a strained ligament in his left middle finger, made his first
appearance in a spring game Thursday. Pitching against the Twins'
Triple-A team in Port Charlotte, Venafro went one inning, allowing
one run on three hits and a walk. Venafro struck out one and
reported no problems with the finger.
</P>
<P>
   _ John Wetteland threw on the side in camp Thursday and is
expected to pitch Friday against the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bucky Dent's father, Russie Stanford, died Friday. Dent left
the team Thursday and is in Georgia for the funeral. He is expected
back Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gabe Kapler went 0-for-3 Thursday, snapping his nine-game
hitting streak. nn

ABUSE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS CALLED WIDESPREAD AMONG STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Unlike the typical array of drugs available to
college students looking to get high, the only thing illegal about
those that killed Josh Doroff, a Trinity College senior, last week
was that Doroff got them without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The lethal combination he took _ a cocktail of Xanax, Valium,
butalbital and sleeping pills, among other drugs _ may have been
extreme, but the abuse of prescription drugs is an increasingly
common form of drug abuse for college and high-school students
across the country, according to drug experts around the country
and dozens of college students interviewed at eight universities in
the Northeast this week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is stimulants like Ritalin, Aderol and Dexedrine;
painkillers like Percocet, Percodan and Vicodin; migraine pills
like butalbital; nerve relaxers like Xanax and Valium; or even
powerful anti-psychotic agents like Thorazine, the nation's growing
list of prescribed drugs is finding its way out of medicine
cabinets and onto college campuses at a rate that is troubling to
many doctors and epidemiologists.
</P>
<P>
   Most college students, of course, do not take prescription drugs
illegally. But nearly all students interviewed said illicit
prescription drugs were available on campus. Students said they, or
people they know, typically took them to better concentrate on
homework or exams, to stay awake during long nights of drinking or,
by mixing them with other drugs, to find a yet-undiscovered high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it feels bad, it's just that it's something that feels
different,'' said Peter LaBier, an art major at Vassar College in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``There's just this urge with kids my age to
derange your senses.''
</P>
<P>
   One preliminary study last year on the illicit use of Ritalin,
conducted by psychiatrists at the University of Wisconsin, found
that a fifth of college students interviewed had taken the drug at
least once, and that many had tried any number of other
prescription drugs like Dexedrine, a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had reports of students walking about the library asking,
`Does anybody have any Dexedrine I can borrow tonight?''' said Dr.
Eric Heiligenstein, the psychiatrist who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Where students in previous eras relied on over-the-counter
stimulants like Vivarin, No-Doz or plain old coffee, more of
today's students favor are spending as little as $2 to swallow,
snort or inject prescription drugs to study, stay awake or just
feel good.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people take Ritalin to study,'' said a female student
at Vassar who, like many students interviewed for this article,
refused to give her name. ``It makes you feel smart. And I think
good thoughts when I use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ferraro, a senior English major at Rutgers University in
New Brunswick, N.J., said he knew many students who got
prescription drugs illegally. ``Once you get bored with drug X,''
he said, ``you can try something new.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As reports of on-campus prescription-drug mixing and matching
grow, and as more students like Doroff, from Harrison N.Y., die as
a result, school officials are struggling to learn how students are
acquiring and using these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about it in the air now,'' said Dr.
Marvin Geller, a psychologist at McCosh Health Center at Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the illicit use of Ritalin and Aderol, experts
believe, corresponds to the huge increase in recent years in the
amounts of these drugs prescribed by doctors to treat attention
deficit and hyperactivity disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly for Ritalin and Aderol, just the sheer availability
of these drugs makes them a temptation,'' said Dr. Tom Clark, an
epidemiologist at Health and Addictions Research Inc., a nonprofit
organization in Boston. Among young people, he said, ``there seems
to be more indiscriminate pill popping.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the increase in illegal use of Ritalin among
students, though still mostly anecdotal, parallels a more than
eightfold increase in the amount of methylphenidate, the drug's
active ingredient, manufactured between 1990 and this year,
according to data from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.
Oxycodon, the active agent in Percocet and its cousin, Percodan,
two painkillers popular among students, is 10 times as plentiful as
in 1990, DEA data shows.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ritalin was the most popular prescription drug on
Vassar's campus, LaBier, 19, said he had heard of students taking
potent drugs like Thorazine, a powerful anti-psychotic that doctors
say makes most people feel terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Near Columbia University's campus, a 21-year-old student called
Ritalin pills ``the poor man's cocaine'' that, when swallowed or
crushed and snorted, help his friends either study or stay awake
during long nights of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people that do it all the time,'' said the
man, a Columbia senior who spoke only on the condition that his
name not be used. ``I saw my friends crush up 10 pills of Ritalin
and snort it. It's rampant here.''
</P>
<P>
   At New York University, Ritalin and Aderol are as common as
marijuana, some students said. ``Ritalin makes repetitive, boring
tasks like cleaning your room seem fun,'' said Josh Koenig, a
20-year-old drama major. ``I equate it in my mind with a really
strong cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Plyshevsky, 21, a junior from New Milford, N.J.,
majoring in marketing at NYU, said she used Ritalin obtained from a
friend with attention deficit disorder to get through her midterms.
``It was actually fun to do the work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton students interviewed this week said Percocet was
popular, especially in combination with marijuana. ``You sprinkle
it on your weed and smoke it,'' a Princeton senior said. ``Almost
everyone I know has tried it once or twice.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yale University in New Haven, Conn., several students
interviewed on Wednesday described Ritalin as somewhat passe, more
the province of their prep school days than of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here who didn't go to prep school think it's like
cocaine or something,'' said an 18-year-old Yale freshman who uses
Ritalin illegally. During exam week, another student said, the
demand for Ritalin increases and 20-milligram pills sell for $5.
</P>
<P>
   Several students interviewed attributed the abundance of Ritalin
on their campuses to its overprescription by doctors to treat
students, many of whom have taken the drug since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like an awful lot of people I know have been
diagnosed with ADD and have been prescribed either Ritalin or
Aderol,'' Koenig, the NYU drama student, said. ``So if they give
away a few of their pills, it's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have the pills from a past injury and saved them
for a later time,'' said Ferraro, the Rutgers senior. ``It's hard
to get them from a doctor, but some people know other people who
can fill prescriptions. Like any other drug, it's all about supply
and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   At Vassar, a student said she often received at-large pleas for
Ritalin sent by other students over the school's e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To epidemiologists who study drug trends in children and young
adults, the prescription-drug boom among college students, while
alarming, is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, after all, have never been as medicated as they are
today. ``Over 65 and you're averaging about three prescription
medications,'' said James Rothenberger, an instructor at the
University of Minnesota's School of Public of Health. ``Once you
hit 75, you're up to four or five.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the epidemiologist in Boston, said the pharmaceutical
buildup may have sparked a ``supply-side'' problem at college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so accepted,'' he said, ``that they might be spilling
over into the idea that we can chemically alter our bodies on a
whim.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among 12th graders nationwide, the use of barbiturates and
non-heroin narcotics like cough suppressants, anti-diarrhetics and
painkillers has doubled since 1992, said Dr. Lloyd Johnson, the
author of ``Monitoring the Future,'' an annual report on adolescent
drug use nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of illicit prescription drug use also
corresponds with increases in popularity of so-called club drugs,
like ecstasy and gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, an odorless and
tasteless but potent sedative, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing this increase in club drugs virtually across the
country,'' said Dr. Alan Leshner, director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, a federal agency in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts say, if there is any comfort in the rising
illegal use of prescription drugs, it may be that at the least,
their users know what they are getting, Rothenberger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you want someone taking a street drug, or would you
rather have them taking Ritalin that they've stolen from someone's
prescription?'' he asked rhetorically in a telephone interview
Wednesday. ``If you're stealing from your little brother or sister,
at least you're getting a pure product.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger is greatest for students who feel compelled to mix
different drugs, as Doroff did at Trinity College last week. Police
investigators said he had combined prescription drugs with alcohol
and possibly heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the overdoses are extreme behavior problems,'' said
Dr. Henry Kranzler, a psychiatrist at the University of Connecticut
Health Center in Farmington. And with prescription drug use,
short-term risks _ overdoses, sexual indiscretions and impaired
driving _ are the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these kids don't know about these drugs,'' Kranzler said,
``is killing them.  &QL;

 &HT;    Slay is driving force for Volunteers
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ron Slay listens during games. He can't help it
_ most everybody wants to talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents, put off by his evocative personality and refusal
to be intimidated, give it to the freshman. Opposing crowds, goaded
by the way he'll move his hands as if dishing out cards after an
assist, will rain trash talk down on him. At Vanderbilt, where Slay
came off the bench to score 13 points in only 14 minutes in the
Vols' 13-point loss, Slay heard ``everything in the dictionary,
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Slay gives as good as he gets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron is the most unusual player I've ever coached in the fact
he's so outgoing and gregarious,'' said Tennessee Coach Jerry
Green.
</P>
<P>
   Though senior C.J. Black is the Volunteers' main inside threat,
and Tony Harris, their play-making point guard, and Vincent
Yarbrough can put up big scoring and rebounding numbers, Slay is
their heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   From the early preseason practices, when the 6-foot-8-inch
forward from Oak Hill (Va.) Academy came in with game and mouth to
match, he's been the player to galvanize his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to lead,'' he said simply.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player, you have to give him his due,'' Black
said. ``I knew as long as he listened, he'd be a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   Listen? Or talk?
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a little bit of both,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Slay came to Tennessee with strong credentials. During his
senior season he led Oak Hill to a 31-0 record and final USA Today
No. 1 high school ranking, averaging 17 points, nine rebounds and
2.5 blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   Easy to pick out because of his white headband _ ``As soon as I
find another trend, I'll put the headband away'' _ Slay is even
more noticeable for the way he can take over games down the
stretch. In the first-round win over Louisiana-Lafayette, the
Volunteers trailed 40-32 with just more than three minutes gone in
the second half when Slay scored. In the next three minutes he had
an offensive putback and blocked a shot. With eight minutes left
and the Vols still down by four, he took over the game, scoring 11
of UT's next 15 points, including the shot that put UT up 56-54
with 4:07 left, its first lead since early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Slay finished with 15 points and four rebounds as the
fourth-seeded Vols avoided the upset, winning 63-58.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron has always been very explosive off the bench,'' Black
said. ``He keeps us going. He always plays with consistency. When
we need offense, he gives us a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that when things aren't going right, he's always
there to help put us ahead,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Slay is hard to intimidate. Before playing defending national
champion Connecticut in the second-round game, he dismissed any
advantage in experience the Huskies might hold. ``I don't think
anything counts from last year, defending champs or not,'' he said.
``Everyone has the same ammunition. We'll just see who uses it
best.''

   Slay's best may be yet to come. Late in the regular season, as
it became apparent the Vols would enjoy a high NCAA seed, Slay gave
notice.

   ``I'm going to build up to the NCAA tournament and then it's
going to explode,'' he said.

 &HT;    Sutton leads a parade of big numbers
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. _ The tournament that wants to be a
major had all the frustrating feel of one Thursday. Twenty-two
scores in the 80s. World-class players making quadruple-bogeys.
Mis-hit balls rolling into the water as though scooting across a
billiard table.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the TPC at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton has the first-round lead at The Players Championship
by one stroke at 3-under-par 69, and almost everyone else has
reason for a stiff martini.
</P>
<P>
   If it gets any uglier at the TPC at Sawgrass, where the wind is
gusting with such gusto that a Britsh Open might break out, the
world's finest might be climbing to the first tee today with paper
bags over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The average score Thursday was 76.28. Only 13 players are under
par. Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1 player, rinsed one at the
famous island 17th for double-bogey and was happy with a 71. John
Daly (77) and Duffy Waldorf (80) plunked two balls apiece into the
pond, where 19 double-bogies and 10 uglier numbers were recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price (73), who has won three majors, shanked a chip at the
12th hole, then chunked the next one. Five holes later, his ball
became the 36th (of 41) to find the water at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories were as plentiful as windshirts. Sergio Garcia
started with a 43 en route to an 82 in his first Players
Championship. Phil Mickelson, ranked 12th, made the turn in 46 and
eventually shot 83, continuing the nightmare from his final-round
82 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a course you can play when you're not striking it
well,'' said Mickelson, who triple-bogeyed the 13th. ``The misses
just get magnified in such a strong wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Morning tee times, when the wind was slightly down and the
greens less dried out, were as valuable as good parking. All the
70s behind Sutton _ from Kenny Perry, Len Mattiace, Joe Ozaki,
Billy Mayfair, Lee Janzen, Bernhard Langer and Brad Fabel _ were
morning rounds. Tom Lehman and Justin Leonard also were at 71. With
British Isles conditions in the afternoon, how fitting that Nick
Faldo managed a decent 73.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the toughest weather we've had on the whole Florida
swing and then you come to the toughest golf course,'' Faldo said.
``You can't make a mistake out there or you tie yourself in
knots.''
</P>
<P>
   As players left the 18th green with glazed eyes and stunned
expressions, defending champion David Duval sounded almost content
with a 75. Colin Montgomerie managed the same, rallying after an
opening 41.
</P>
<P>
   ``75 is not a great score and I'm certainly not pleased with
it,'' said Duval, ``but it's not terrible on a day like this.''

STARS' LANGENBRUNNER IS FIT AND ON FIRE
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ When Dallas Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner
left practice on Jan. 27, he figured if his season wasn't over it
was pretty darn close.
</P>
<P>
   The pinched nerve in his neck wasn't healing.
</P>
<P>
   The pain was constant.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of cortisone shots wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said surgery looked to be the only remaining option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, actually, I decided it was going to happen,''
Langenbrunner said of what probably would've been season-ending
surgery. ``It still wasn't gone. What else could we do?''
</P>
<P>
   They decided to try one more cortisone shot. A just-to-be-sure,
what-can-it-hurt measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, his neck began feeling better. Better soon
developed into good enough for him to return on Feb. 9 after an
11-game hiatus. He played in four games, getting two goals and two
assists, before pain flared again. He missed another trio of games
before returning on Feb. 23 against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   He has been one of Dallas' hottest players ever since.
</P>
<P>
   How hot? Texas-in-July hot.
</P>
<P>
   He has eight goals and seven assists in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no different than this time last year,'' said Joe
Nieuwendyk, a good friend and former linemate of Langenbrunner's.
``He's the kind of guy you know is going to be there in the end. He
plays hard, he's got a good heart and good work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he had this all season. What he didn't have were the
numbers. In fact, he had fewer goals (7) in the 40 games before the
injury than he has had in the 17 games since (10).
</P>
<P>
   So what sparked the turnaround?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes when you are pressing too hard offensively
you stop working and you lose your foundations, and that's what he
did, lost his foundation,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``He
started to become a worker first and a scorer second.''
</P>
<P>
   Hello, he's killing penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner doesn't kill penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Langenbrunner qualified. ``It's not like I ever have.
I just didn't here. We have so many good players who can do it
better than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries to the Guy Carbonneaus, Blake Sloans and Jere Lehtinens
tossed Langenbrunner into that role. Short-handed goals like the
one he scored on Sunday against San Jose may make it hard for the
Stars to take him out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner laughs.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the year, it seemed as if he could've thrown
a beach ball at an open net and it wouldn't have gone in. Now, he's
leading a one-on-three while short-handed and his shot sails goes
five hole.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, his playoff scoring touch has returned after all.
</P>
<P>
   He should be so lucky. He had 10 goals and seven assists in 23
playoff games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing the same way he did in the playoffs last year,''
Stars winger Brad Lukowich said. ``Someone asked me who's one of
the guys you look to be a player like? Personally, I think he's one
of the guys a lot of the younger guys look up to. Even Hitch says
himself: `Watch this guy, try to emulate what he does on the
ice.'''
</P>
<P>
   Which elicits another chuckle from Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   He figures one of the best things he has done on the ice since
returning is playing on a line with Mike Modano, who has posted the
best numbers in the NHL since Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it easier when you are playing with a guy who's going
that good,'' Langenbrunner demurred as he sharpened his stick
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Stars forward Kirk Muller, who had been listening as
Langenbrunner talked, said, ``You are making him right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Muller, of course, was joking.
</P>
<P>
   But still, not bad for a guy whose season was supposedly over.

</P>
<P>
   First Alliance, a nationwide home equity lender facing a host of
lawsuits accusing it of deceptive sales practices, announced that
it had stopped making new loans to homeowners and that it had filed
for bankruptcy protection. The mortgage company, which had offices
in more than a dozen states, including New York, New Jersey and
California, said that it has closed its loan offices and laid off
85 percent of its work force.

   Riding a surge in trading of stocks and bonds, Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter reported that its first-quarter net income rose 49
percent, making it the fourth big investment bank to post
stronger-than-expected earnings. Morgan Stanley benefited from
investors' seemingly insatiable appetite for the securities of
companies in technology and telecommunications industries. Shares
of Morgan Stanley rose $4.50, to $94.75.

   Ukraine Transactions Scrutinized
</P>
<P>
   An executive of Credit Suisse, the European banking giant,
testified before the House Banking Committee that his institution
engaged in unusual transactions on behalf of Ukraine's central
bank, but he maintained that all of them were legal. Credit
Suisse's activities in Ukraine have come under scrutiny after the
International Monetary Fund revealed last week that Ukraine's
central bank secured IMF loans by misleading the fund about the
country's financial health. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers,
who also testified, said the Treasury department would review
audits of the transactions in question before he supports further
IMF lending to Ukraine.

POPE PAYS HOMAGE TO MILLIONS OF JEWS `MURDERED IN THE HOLOCAUST' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In a moving visit to Israel's Holocaust memorial,
Pope John Paul II on Thursday recalled the horrors of Nazism but
stopped short of apologizing for the silence of the Vatican's
leadership during World War II while millions of Jews were sent to
their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul said the Roman Catholic Church was ``deeply saddened''
by Christians' persecution of Jews through the centuries, and he
urged the two faiths to build a new relationship born of their
common roots.
</P>
<P>
   But the pope did not go as far as some Jews had hoped. He did
not assign blame to the church hierarchy or to Pope Pius XII, the
wartime pope who many Jews say failed to raise his voice when so
many were being killed.
</P>
<P>
   During a solemn remembrance service for the victims of the
Holocaust that was broadcast live on Israeli television, John Paul
said, ``I have come to Yad Vashem to pay homage to millions of
Jewish people who, stripped of everything, especially of their
human dignity, were murdered in the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope added, ``As bishop of Rome and successor of the Apostle
Peter, I assure the Jewish people that the Catholic Church,
motivated by the Gospel law of truth and love, and by no political
considerations, is deeply saddened by the hatred, acts of
persecution and displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews
by Christians at any time and in any place.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any monument in Israel, Yad Vashem literally means ``a
place and a name'' for the Jews who died in anonymity under Adolf
Hitler's Third Reich. The memorial represents one people's
determination to never forget those who perished in the Holocaust
and to avoid such suffering in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Between the German invasion of the Soviet Union in the summer of
1941 and the end of the war in Europe in May 1945, Nazi Germany and
its allies tried to kill every Jew under their domination. Many
historians, though, consider the beginning of the Holocaust era to
be in January 1933 with Hitler's accession to power. About 6
million Jews died during the Holocaust. While 5.5 million Gypsies,
Poles and other prisoners were killed in Nazi death camps during
the war, the Jews were the only group the Nazis tried to destroy
entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, given in English while the eternal flame of Yad
Vashem flickered in the foreground, John Paul recalled the horror
of that era.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this place of memories, the mind and heart and soul feel an
extreme need for silence,'' he said. ``Silence in which to
remember. Silence in which to try to make sense of some of the
memories, which come flooding back. Silence because there are no
words strong enough to deplore the terrible tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's speech Thursday reflected the themes of unity and
interreligious harmony that he has developed during his 21-year
pontificate, years he has worked tirelessly to reconcile Jews and
Christians. He was the first pope to visit the Nazi death camp of
Auschwitz and attend services at a synagogue in Rome. Two weeks
ago, he apologized for the sins of Christians throughout history,
including those against Jews, though he did not mention the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the fourth day of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
the pope met with Israel's two chief rabbis in west Jerusalem and
held an interfaith meeting late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   He also blessed Israel in a meeting with President Ezer Weizman.
The meeting with Weizman is viewed by many Israelis as the Catholic
church's recognition of their state since, in previous centuries,
the church taught that Jews were exiled and condemned to be
dispersed from their homeland because of the death of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's official presence in Israel was equally significant
because the last pontiff to visit was Pope Paul VI. He came to the
Holy Land in 1964 for a brief tour and never once mentioned Israel
by name.
</P>
<P>
   In his address Thursday, John Paul emphasized the common roots
of the two faiths and his personal experiences of the Holocaust.
``Let us build a new future,'' he said, ``in which there will be no
more anti-Jewish feeling among Christians or anti-Christian feeling
among Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel, accompanied John Paul to
Yad Vashem. When it was Barak's turn to speak, he said the pope's
visit will be recorded ``as a moment of truth, as a victory of
justice and hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak, whose grandparents perished in the Treblinka death camp
in Nazi-occupied Poland, spoke of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the darkness of Nazism descended,'' he said, ``and my
people were led from all over Christian Europe to the crematoria
and the gas chambers, it seemed that no longer could one place any
hope in God or man. That in the words of the prophet Joel, `The sun
and the moon darkened, and the stars withdrew their luster.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And the silence was not only from the heavens. During that
time, here in the land of Israel, the poet Natan Alterman wrote
these searing, tormented verses: `As our children cried under the
gallows, the wrath of the world we did not hear.'''
</P>
<P>
   A letter was read during the service. It was written by a
Polish-Jewish mother to her gentile friend, asking her to look
after her 7-year-old son: ``I am sure that you can find it in your
heart to love him. Every day I pray to God that, on account of my
suffering, he will be happy in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Genia Kleptish-Yudska, and her son, Michael, both
died at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The service at Yad Vashem lasted more than an hour, and during
the ceremony, the pontiff often stood, slightly trembling, his eyes
downcast toward the floor where the names of death camps are
inscribed.
</P>
<P>
   For the 79-year-old John Paul, who was born in Wadowice, Poland,
the Holocaust remains a personal tragedy, and he spoke Thursday of
his ``Jewish friends and neighbors, some of whom perished, while
others survived.'' He was 19 when the Nazis invaded.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 Holocaust survivors from in or near Wadowice were on
hand for the pope's address, and he spoke to several, gently
patting the arm of one woman who began crying as he greeted her.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Tzirer, now in her 60s, lives in Israel today, but she
grew up in Krakow. At the beginning at the war, her family fled
their home, but they were eventually captured by the Nazis. By the
time she was 11, she was alone and interned in a Nazi labor camp.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1945, when the camp was liberated, the 14-year-old
girl was lying next to the camp fence, exhausted and suffering from
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   A young priest came to her aid, she said Thursday, giving her a
piece of bread and a cup of hot tea. The priest then carried her
two miles on his back to a place where she joined other Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   That priest, she said, was Karol Wojtyla, later archbishop of
Krakow and today pope of the world's 1 billion Catholics.

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman Solomon Page
was arrested Thursday in Morgantown, W.Va., and charged with
disorderly conduct and obstructing police.
</P>
<P>
   Page, who was released after posting a $200 bond, will contest
the charges, his agent Angelo Wright, said. A hearing was set for
April 12 in Morgantown Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said the team was aware of the
situation and is in the process of gathering information. ``There
is nothing more to say at this time,'' Dalrymple said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the arrest report, Morgantown police officers were
responding to a fight complaint about 3 a.m. when they saw Page
throwing punches. Police said he refused to stop and then jerked
away when an officer grabbed his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Wright said has hasn't talked to Page, the Cowboys' second-round
pick in 1999. But Wright talked to Page's mother, who told him his
client was breaking up a fight when police came.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the biggest guy and they sprayed him (with Mace),''
Wright said. ``And then he put up his arms because he couldn't see.
He'll probably fight this.''
</P>
<P>
   Page, who played at West Virginia in Morgantown, started six
games for the Cowboys last season as a rookie. He is expected to
compete with Tony Hutson for the team's starting right-guard
position in 2000. nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Opening a new window into the mysteries of animal
design and the nature of life, biologists described here Thursday
how they had decoded almost the entire genetic rule book for making
the Drosophila fruit fly, an organism whose study is deeply
interwoven with the progress of modern biology.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement closes a cycle in scientific history that began
in 1910, when Thomas Morgan of Columbia University chose Drosophila
as the experimental animal with which he and his students would
work out many of the basic principles of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Thursday is a milestone in the effort to
sequence the human genome, because it seems to validate a high-risk
decoding strategy adopted by Dr. J. Craig Venter of Celera Corp.,
which is competing against a public consortium of university
centers to be first to decode the human genetic inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rivalry in decoding the human genome, the work
described here was a collaboration between a team of scientists led
by Venter and another led by Dr. Gerald M. Rubin, the University of
California biologist who directs the public consortium's work on
the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Celera reported in December that it had sequenced the fruit-fly
genome. But the results are only now being made public, both in
lectures given here at the annual meeting of the world's fly
biologists and in articles in this Friday's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because fly cell biology and development have much in common
with mammals, this sequence may be the Rosetta stone for
deciphering the human genome,'' two biologists not connected with
the sequencing, Dr. Thomas B. Kornberg and Dr. Mark A. Krasnow,
write in a commentary in Science. They call completion of the fly
genome ``a monumental technical feat.''
</P>
<P>
   Celera chose the fruit-fly genome as a pilot project for
tackling the human genome, which is 30 times as large. The Celera
approach with which the fly was sequenced involves assembling the
genome from millions of small fragments in a single giant
computation. The public consortium, by contrast, follows a more
cautious strategy of collecting the small pieces into segments and
then joining these into a complete genome.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving for an afternoon session Thursday, 1,300 fly biologists
at their annual meeting found on their chairs a gift from Celera, a
CD-ROM of the genome sequence of their favorite organism. Venter
was given a standing ovation after the president of the fly
biologists' association, Dr. Gary Karpen of the Salk Institute,
said of the Drosophila genome that ``we are about to be handed an
incredible tool that many of us only dreamed about for many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the marketing language of computer programmers,
the Venter-Rubin teams termed today's version of the fly genome
``Release 1,'' meaning that perfected editions would be published
in the future. At present there remain 1,299 gaps in the 120
million chemical units of DNA that have been decoded. The gaps are
small and are expected to be closed within a few months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some biologists say the Drosophila work does not guarantee that
the Venter approach will meet with similar success with the human
genome. ``Though a major accomplishment, I don't think it proves
they can assemble the human genome,'' said Dr. Richard Durbin,
deputy director of the Sanger Center in Britain, a leading member
of the public consortium
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview earlier this week, Venter said, ``We are 100
percent certain that there are no problems in assembling the human
genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Celera has come under pressure from President Clinton and Prime
Minister Tony Blair of Britain to make its swelling collection of
human genome data public daily, as the public consortium does. A
joint statement by the two leaders sent the stock of Celera, along
with that of other genomics companies, reeling last week, when
investors mistakenly interpreted the statement as meaning that
human genes could not be patented.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement, scheduled long before the tumult in
biotech stocks, was a morale booster for Celera, which eventually
plans to operate a database of human and other genomes, charging
fees for use of programs that search and analyze genetic data.
</P>
<P>
   Venter said that with the release of the fly genome, his company
had made more data public than any of its rivals, and that Celera
would publish its version of the human genome when finished,
probably later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   As fly biologists emphasize with the slightest prompting, the
fly's genes and proteins have turned out to be surprisingly similar
to those of people. Of the 289 genes known to cause human disease
in mutated form, 177 have direct counterparts in the fly, Rubin and
his colleagues have concluded after reviewing all the genes in its
genome. This means the genes could be manipulated in the fly as a
step toward devising remedies for the human diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Over almost a century of research, the world's 5,000 biologists
who study the fly _ ``fly people,'' they call themselves _ had
found and described about 2,500 of the fly's genes. In one giant
leap, the Venter-Rubin team has now identified a total of 13,601.
</P>
<P>
   Completion of the gene-finding phase of the project frees
biologists to move to the next step, that of figuring out what each
gene does. The new achievement ``tells us what all the cards are in
the deck; it doesn't tell us how they are dealt out,'' said Dr.
Ralph Greenspan of the Neurosciences Institute in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One immediate surprise is that so few genetic instructions are
required for the development and maintenance of a fly, compared
with the number known to be needed by other organisms. The fruit
fly is a complex miniature machine with elaborate behavior and a
courtship ritual that fly experts say closely resembles the human
variety. Yet the fruit fly has only twice as many genes as yeast, a
single-celled fungus, and considerably fewer than the 18,425 of the
C. elegans roundworm, the only other animal whose entire genome has
been sequenced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says you build complexity not by having more genes but by
using them in more inventive ways,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he interpreted the new genome data to mean that
people, with their predicted total of 80,000 genes, acquire their
greater complexity from a more elaborate arrangement of the same
basic parts, resembling a fruit fly much as a supercomputer
resembles a personal computer. ``Once evolution got it right, it
basically made minor tinkerings, he said, referring to the time,
600 million years ago, when flies and people last had a common
ancestor.

 &HT;    Al-Amin protests treatment in Alabama jail
 &HT;    By Ralph Ellis and Dana Tofig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY COUNTY, Ala. _ Three decades after he and others
fought to bring Alabama civil rights into the 20th century, the
former H. Rap Brown stood before a Montgomery County, Ala., judge
Thursday, his lawyers vowing to fight for his freedom in a new
century.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black-and-white striped jailhouse uniform, Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin _ former voting rights advocate turned
revolutionary turned Muslim cleric _ listened as his lawyers said
they would fight plans to bring him back to Georgia to face charges
he killed a Fulton County sheriff's deputy March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, his legs and arms in shackles, said nothing as he stood
in orange jailhouse sandals before Montgomery County District Judge
Lynn Bright. He was apprised of his rights and given the
opportunity to waive extradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in the business of waiving anything,'' said one of his
lawyers, J.L. Chestnut. ``I'm in the business of making waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut and Al-Amin's other lawyers, Rose Sanders and Musa
Ban-Fodio, a Muslim attorney from Stone Mountain, said their client
is being persecuted and mistreated because of his religious faith
and his reputation as a 1960s black radical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider him a political prisoner and he has been treated
like a political prisoner,'' Sanders told the judge during the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers said Al-Amin was being denied religious freedom in
jail and was being treated poorly because he had been a civil
rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery officials say his treatment in jail has nothing to do
with his past and everything to do with the criminal charges
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, is being held in solitary confinement 23 hours a
day. He is confined to a 10-by-10-foot cell with a cot, toilet and
sink. His food is standard jail fare: cold cereal for breakfast,
turkey bologna sandwich for lunch and his only hot meal for dinner.
During the one hour he is allowed outside his cell, he can exercise
and bathe.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Alabama became the first of several states
to re-adopt striped prison uniforms and chain gangs, practices that
had largely disappeared with the advent of civil rights and prison
reform movements. The state has since abolished chain gangs again.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Sheriff D.T. Marshall said, ``I don't care what
(Al-Amin's lawyers) say. They don't run the jail. I run the jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County (Ga.) District Attorney Paul Howard has said he
will seek an indictment against Al-Amin today for the killing of
Deputy Ricky Kinchen and the wounding of Deputy Aldranon English.
The officers were shot as they were trying to serve an arrest
warrant on Al-Amin on March 16.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said a challenge to the validity of the murder charge
will be filed when extradition papers arrive from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said she also will file a petition to complain about how
Al-Amin is being treated in the Montgomery County jail. She
complained to Bright that Al-Aminwants to attend a Friday prayer
service with other Muslims in the county jail, but the sheriff will
not allow him to leave solitary confinement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is treated differently and you have to ask why,'' Sanders
said. ``Do you think any Christian person would be denied this
request?''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Marshall said prisoners in maximum security
are not allowed to leave that section of the jail. He said Al-Amin
was placed in high security because he is considered a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a dangerous person, I don't care how meek his
lawyers say he is,'' Marshall said. ``The deputy who is dead would
probably like to go to church Sunday, too.''

 &HT;    Police doubt bloodstains linked to Al-Amin case
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Blood splatters found near where two Fulton County
deputies were gunned down last week probablyweren't from the former
Black Panther accused in the shooting and may not be related at
all, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators initially believed Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, who
they say shot Deputies Ricky Kinchen and Aldranon English on March
16, was injured when the two officers returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen was killed in the gunfight. English, who was seriously
wounded, told authorities he thought he had shot his assailant in
the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, captured Monday night in White Hall, Ala., has no
injuries, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting investigation is fraught with unanswered questions
and conflicting accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police say they believe Al-Amin was alone when the
deputies, who were trying to arrest him on relatively minor
charges, were shot. English has said no one else was standing
outside Al-Amin's grocery store and no one was inside the black
Mercedes-Benz the suspect was said to be driving the night of the
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The black Mercedes-Benz registered to Al-Amin is still missing.
The car hasn't turned up in Alabama and investigators are trying to
determine how Al-Amin got from Atlanta to White Hall, where he was
arrested by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   As for the blood found outside the house in the West End
neighborhood of Atlanta, police spokesman John Quigley said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The abandoned house is about a block or more from the actual
scene of the shooting. There is no trail of blood that leads from
the shooting scene to the house. The blood starts at the house. It
was checked because it was not dry. Since a shooting had just
occurred a short distance away, it is the investigators' job to
check the blood. It's currently being tested at the GBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Although English said he thought he had shot Al-Amin in the
stomach, the suspect had no bullet wounds or injuries when FBI
agents and U.S. marshals captured him Monday night in a wooded area
of White Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have speculated that English either missed his
target or the suspect was wearing body armor. Al-Amin was outfitted
with body armor the night of his capture, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities never shot at him the night he was seized, said Bill
Imfeld, FBI special agent in charge of the Alabama investigation of
Al-Amin. Earlier reports that Al-Amin had been fired upon by
marshals or FBI agents were incorrect, Imfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama authorities have said Al-Amin was first spotted peering
out from a shed near the home of a friend in White Hall. Yet FBI
officials said Thursday that they searched the shed the day Al-Amin
was arrested and found no trace he had ever stayed there or even
hidden there briefly.

 PITTSBURGH: common ancestor.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Besides the 1,299 small gaps remaining, there is one major
omission from the fly genome: the large DNA regions that form the
central part of the fly's four chromosomes, the giant DNA molecules
in which the genome is packaged. This DNA is thought to contain
almost no genes and to play a largely structural role.
</P>
<P>
   Both the public consortium and Celera seem to agree that the
structural DNA does not have to be decoded to call a genome
complete. When biologists from the public consortium announced in
December the completion of the first human chromosome, No. 22, they
did so without having tried to decode its structural DNA.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the fly, 60 million of the 180 million DNA units
in the genome are structural DNA, and 120 million units are in
regions that code for genes. The structural DNA consists of the
same string of DNA letters repeated thousands of times over, and
cannot be decoded by present techniques. Most of the remaining gaps
in the fly genome occur in the zones where the gene-coding arms of
the chromosomes merge into the central regions of structural DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The sequencing of the fly genome depended largely on DNA data
and computer programming developed at Celera by Dr. Mark Adams, Dr.
Hamilton Smith and Dr. Eugene W. Myers. Myers, a mathematician,
devised an ingenious strategy for assembling genomes, which he
first offered to the public consortium but was told would not work.
He then joined Celera and gave the strategy its first test with the
fly genome, which he successfully assembled from three million tiny
pieces of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   A team of fruit-fly experts and software engineers then met at
Celera's headquarters in Rockville, Md., for a two-week
``annotation jamboree.'' Annotation is the process of analyzing a
genome with the help of computer programs to figure out where the
genes lie and to assign likely biological roles to each gene based
on its similarity to genes of known function.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 or so participants at the jamboree were the first to see
the fly genome and try to define the little creature's complex
genetic programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very exciting event,'' Rubin said. ``We had all these
people together, some experts in biology, others in bioinformatics.
Each needed the other's help to answer their questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The biologists would describe a pattern that should be looked
for, and the bioinformaticists _ a new class of expert who use
computers to analyze genomes _ would stay up all night writing the
appropriate software. ``There was a feeling it was a
once-in-a-lifetime experience that we were going through
together,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Successful completion of the fly genome, Release 1.0, takes
Celera a leap forward in its race to complete the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still optimistic that when people see the Drosophila
results, there will be renewed efforts at collaboration,'' Venter
said, alluding to recently broken-off negotiations with the public
consortium to join forces on the human genome. But the public
consortium, treading piece by piece along the genome, is also
making substantial progress in a race now in its final laps.

RISK-FREE? MORE LIKE A FREE LUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star The latest proposed fix for Social
Security is so misguided its critics say it risks repeating a
financial fiasco akin to the savings and loan crisis.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The reform offered by House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer,
a Texas Republican, and Rep. Clay Shaw, chairman of the
subcommittee on Social Security and a Florida Republican, would
have government cover market risk if workers are allowed to invest
their Social Security taxes in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is a compromise. The administration wants to let
government invest payroll tax revenue in private financial markets.
The GOP-controlled Congress is pushing to allow individuals to put
at least part of their Social Security taxes into personally
managed investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The problem created by protecting individual investors from
market risk, however, is what economists call ``moral hazard.'' It
results from knowing you won't have to pay for your mistakes, that
somebody else will. Someone with a gambling problem, for instance,
might be more prone to gamble if they know a friend or relative
will bail them out if they get into financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Economists generally contend that insurance protection
encourages moral hazard. It's not as if people intentionally have
auto wrecks or burn down their homes because they carry auto and
homeowner's insurance. It's just that human nature being what it
is, people aren't as careful when they're covered against risk.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;L analogy offered by critics of Archer-Shaw plays off how
government encouraged the savings and loan industry to take risks
that devastated many thrifts. The resolution of the resulting mess
cost taxpayers upward of $150 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The debacle occurred because the interest rates S&AMP;Ls were paying
to lure deposit money rose far above the rates on old mortgages,
which were the S&AMP;L's primary income source. Regulators responded by
allowing S&AMP;Ls to move beyond making home loans. This prompted
riskier initiatives to enhance profits. Meantime, deposit insurance
coverage was raised from $40,000 to $100,000 to encourage
individuals and institutions to chase high-yield CDs. Moral hazard
resulted because eager depositors knew they'd be covered even if
their S&AMP;L went broke making bad moves.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer-Shaw proposal would create the same type of moral
hazard. If individuals were to pursue risky investments because of
Uncle Sam's promises to cover their losses, government's liability
might eventually become unmanageable. Meanwhile, as individuals saw
the value of their private Social Security accounts decline, they
would probably chase riskier investments in hopes of a big score to
make up losses. They would do so knowing that if their risky bets
went sour, Uncle Sam would bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   They would discover, however, that government will only do so
much. Those involved in the S&AMP;L collapse certainly did.
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis by the Cato Institute summed up the challenge
by noting the need for the sharing of both profit and risk. Only if
workers have a stake in both gains and losses can a partly
privatized Social Security system work.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer-Shaw bid makes the concept an easier sell
politically, but it would lead to financial disaster for government
and workers alike.

 AGGREGATE PROFIT DECLINES FOR KANSAS CITY HMOs  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Health maintenance
organizations in the Kansas City area suffered an aggregate decline
in profit last year, though results among individual plans varied
widely.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A representative group of 11 area HMOs showed aggregate earnings
of $11.3 million in 1999, according to reports filed with the
Missouri Department of Insurance. That represents a 49 percent
decline from 1998, when the group posted earnings of $22 million.
</P>
<P>
   The overall drop occurred despite rising insurance premiums that
have bedeviled employers and individual consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Heese, acting chief financial examiner for the Missouri
Department of Insurance, said much of the financial decline
occurred because health care costs are rising faster than premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely concerned with the trend of HMO earnings
being significantly less than the prior year,'' Heese said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the effect on consumers will be even higher
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premiums were inadequate in the past and are now coming in
line with what they need to be,'' said Michael B. Wood, executive
director of the National Center for Managed Health Care
Administration at the University of Missouri-Kansas City. ``I think
they'll continue to go up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Many managed care companies and industry experts say rising
prescription drug costs are cutting into HMO bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a national basis, probably two out of three HMOs lost money
last year,'' said Mark B. Whiting, a principal with the Kansas City
office of the William M. Mercer Inc. benefits consulting firm.
``Pharmacy costs were tough on everybody last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But HMOs are apt to get little sympathy from consumers, who
sometimes lock horns with their health plans, said Richard Hellman,
a physician and president of the Metropolitan Medical Society of
Greater Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman said he understood that it was ``incredibly difficult''
for an HMO ``to predict the true cost of health care for a
community for the next year. But I wouldn't want patients to suffer
because the HMOs set their premiums at the wrong level or didn't
spend enough of premium money on patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   HealthNet's HMO business posted a loss of $9.8 million last
year, even as HealthNet's HMO revenue rose from $127.1 million in
1998 to $183.1 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   HealthNet spokeswoman Cheryl Dillard blamed the 1999 net loss on
rising drug costs and one-time expenses related to upgrading
HealthNet's computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster its finances, Dillard said HealthNet had raised
premiums and implemented a pharmacy co-pay plan that encourages
members to use less-expensive generic drugs and drugs from a
preferred list.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Insurance said membership in
HealthNet's state-regulated HMO plans rose from 76,000 in 1998 to
91,000 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect improved performance this year,'' Dillard said.
</P>
<P>
   Humana Kansas City Inc. posted a strong bottom-line result of
$13.1 million last year. But Dennis A. Matheis, president of
Humana's Kansas City area operations, said that Humana operated
several plans in the Kansas City area and that together they about
broke even last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting a double-digit increase in drug costs, like
every other plan,'' Matheis said. ``Part of the increase in
premiums in 2000 reflects that.''

AMERICAN CENTURY INVESTMENTS CREATES FUND TO INVEST IN NEW
BUSINESSES 
</HEADLINE>
 CENTURY-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mutual fund giant
American Century Investments on Thursday announced the formation of
a $100 million fund to invest in new businesses in Kansas City and
around the nation.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the same time, American Century Ventures Inc., the new
venture capital fund, announced a $2.5 million investment in Kansas
City-based RecordsCenter.com. RecordsCenter is an Internet-based
business that provides a secure way to exchange large legal
documents online.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture capital fund arrives amid a venture capital boom
in the Kansas City area. At least six new venture capital funds are
operating or about to begin operations in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Older venture capital groups such as Kansas City Equity Partners
and Commerce Bank-affiliated Capital for Business also are adding
to their portfolios of business investments.
</P>
<P>
   With $100 million in its pocket, American Century Ventures will
be among the largest such firms based in the area.
</P>
<P>
   American Century Ventures isn't a mutual fund in which
individuals can invest. All of the money is coming from American
Century's own resources, rather than any of its mutual funds or
from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists traditionally invest in young or start-up
companies with an eye on blockbuster rewards. They know many of the
deals won't pan out, but expect to reap enough rewards from the
winners to more than make up for the losers.
</P>
<P>
   Such financial rewards won't be the driving force behind
American Century Ventures, said Harold Bradley, president of
American Century Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in it for the financial pop,'' Bradley said. ``It's
not that financials aren't important, they're just not primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's principal mission is to help build businesses that
will develop products and services that American Century can use to
do a better job investing and running its mutual funds, he said.
American Century not only will invest in these emerging companies
but also use their products, helping to develop or enhance them and
generate ideas for new products.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the emerging company can roll out the new or improved
products to a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   Such products might take many forms, Bradley said. He said they
could include broadband and wireless communications, data-mining
technologies and others that many kinds of businesses and
industries would use.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we were looking for in investors, a strategic
investor who has more than just a checkbook,'' said Brad Davis,
president of RecordsCenter.com.
</P>
<P>
   RecordsCenter.com has a similar relationship with C3 Holdings of
Kansas City, Davis said. C3 Holdings had provided ``seed'' money
for RecordsCenter.com, which began in 1997, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   RecordsCenter's products include DoxNet, Virtual BoardRoom,
Virtual Minutes and Virtual DataRoom.
</P>
<P>
   Such strategic thinking already had led American Century to
invest $38 million in seven venture deals. Among them are W.R.
Hambrecht &AMP; Co., an online investment banking firm in San
Francisco; TradePoint Financial Networks, an electronic stock
exchange in London; Archipelago in Chicago, an electronic stock
trading system; and Optimark Technologies in New Jersey, an online
trading system for large block trades among institutional
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Those investments have been added to American Century Ventures,
but aren't included in the $100 million yet to be invested, Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley heads the venture after having managed the American
Century Heritage Fund for two years and having been head of
equities trading at American Century before that. He was
instrumental in arranging the seven early strategic investments,
and serves as a director in some of those ventures.
</P>
<P>
   American Century Ventures also has hired Diane Mulcahy as vice
president. She had been with a Boston-based venture capital firm
called Bessemer Venture Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kansas City is gaining more venture capital funds, the
investments aren't limited to Kansas City area companies. That will
be true of American Century Ventures, though its first announced
deal is with RecordsCenter.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley said American Century's connections to W.R.
Hambrecht in San Francisco and J.P. Morgan in New York, which owns
a large piece of American Century, could bring more venture capital
to Kansas City businesses. Bradley said he would pass along to
these partners any deals he saw potential in, but which he didn't
consider as strategic investments for American Century Ventures.

 &UR; BOFA _  &LR;  Bank of America fired far more employees than it
originally projected in the 16 months after North Carolina's
NationsBank took over the San Francisco bank, according to a
just-filed regulatory document.
</P>
<P>
   From October 1998, when NationsBank bought the old BofA and took
its name, through December 1999, 12,600 bank employees qualified
for severance packages, meaning their jobs were eliminated and no
comparable positions were offered, the bank said earlier this week
in its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange

the Shrine Auditorium. There, he will wait anxiously to find out if
the startling illusions he helped craft for ``The Matrix'' will win
the Academy Award for best visual effects.

   For a small special effects company removed from Hollywood's

<P>
   Its creative director took home an Oscar last year for ``What
Dreams May Come,'' and the firm designed effects in this week's Jet

veteran as its president and announced a new eight-figure infusion
of capital.
</P>

attention. An Alameda County Superior Court judge will hear
allegations that the man who's been running Manex for the 21/2,

 Napster Hopes Update Ends College Bans  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Napster Inc. of San Mateo and Indiana University will test a new
system tomorrow that allows students to use the popular music
retrieval software without clogging the college's Internet
connections.
<P>
   If the two-week test is successful, it may help lift
restrictions against the program made by Indiana University and
about 100 colleges around North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have made a significant step working with them to
reduce the problem,'' said Eddie Kessler, Napster's vice president
of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Napster has created a furor on both college campuses and in
recording company boardrooms with its software that gives users an
easy way to search and download hundreds of thousands of popular
songs over the Internet for free.
</P>
<P>
   So many college students were using Napster to download their
favorite MP3-compressed songs from other Napster users that it
caused digital traffic jams on their school's high-speed Internet
connections. Napster fans at Indiana University's Bloomington
campus, for example, were taking up to 60 percent of the school's
bandwidth before administrators blocked the program in February.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the test, Indiana University's Internet equipment
will now automatically give academic programs a higher priority
than recreational programs like Napster, said Mark Bruhn, the
college's information technology policy officer. So, for example, a
student using a Web browser to research a history project will get
that information before a student using Napster to download the
latest Dr. Dre song.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Napster's server software has been upgraded to first
search for songs located on the hard drives of computers tied to
Internet2, a new high-speed Internet network that connects Indiana
University and about 200 colleges and educational institutions.
This step keeps traffic off the busier World Wide Web. But if the
requested song is not on Internet2, Napster will search the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Bruhn said he wanted a solution not only to the Napster problem,
but to other similar bandwidth-hogging music and video sharing
programs that figure to crop up in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Napster has spawned similar programs like Macster,
Wrapster, iCrave and Gnutella.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to look ahead,'' Bruhn said. ``If it wasn't Napster,
maybe in four months time we'd have had another application we
would have trouble with.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Paulson, a sophomore at Indiana University who started an
organization called Students Against University Censorship to fight
the Napster bans, was pleased with the test but suspicious that
university officials would use the results to banish Napster for
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to quit until all the schools have resolved
this issue,'' said Paulson, who has gathered 14,000 signatures on
an online petition at www.savenapster.com.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Berkeley, which capped access to
off-campus Web sites like Napster, is monitoring the test, said
Cliff Frost, the school's director of communication and network
services.

HULL HAS TOUCH, STAGE TO PUSH PAST HIS DAD (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD AND JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The questions have started again. Two months
later than expected, but in earnest nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants to know how Stars winger Brett Hull feels about
being two goals away from tying his father's career mark of 610.
</P>
<P>
   Well, considering he was nine goals away on Dec. 31, he says he
feels relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like there is light at the end of the tunnel,'' Hull
said. ``It's been frustrating at times.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he now has two goals in the past two games. Always a
streaky shooter, Hull has a tendency to score goals in bunches. He
also has demonstrated from time to time in his career a flair for
the dramatic. For example, his 600th and 601st goals came on New
Year's Eve, the last goal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So wouldn't it be just like Hull to score 610 against his
father's old team, the Chicago Blackhawks, tonight, or Sunday
against the Colorado Avalanche, when ABC has a lot of the country
watching?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on that streak. He's scoring during practice. Everything
is going in now,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``If he keeps
going like this, he's going to be a scary guy to play against
because he's unloading from anywhere and everywhere.'' NHL CLAMPS
DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Scott Thornton's three-game suspension for hitting San Jose's
Marco Sturm in the face with his forearm proved the NHL is taking a
no-tolerance stance on blows of any kind to the face or head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timing is everything. It probably couldn't come at a worse
time with everything that's been going on in this league for the
last month,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``Hitting someone in the
face with anything is not a good idea right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's suspension came a day after the NHL suspended New
Jersey defenseman Scott Niedermayer for 10 games for his clubbing
of Florida winger Peter Worrell on top of the helmet with his
stick, and one month after Boston's Marty McSorley was suspended
for the final 23 games of the regular season for hitting
Vancouver's Donald Brashear near the temple with his stick.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's penalty was not as severe. He looked to have hit
Sturm with his forearm, but the referee called him for high
sticking and ruled it a match penalty, which automatically takes it
to the league for review. It was Thornton's first match penalty of
his 10-year career, and consequently, his first suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed and surprised,'' Thornton said. ``Even Marco
Sturm's agent, who spoke on his behalf (during Thursday's review),
admitted that I didn't hit him with my stick. I'm a first-time
offender after 10 years, and they did not even take that into
account.'' TOUGH DECISIONS
</P>
<P>
   It could get difficult for Ken Hitchcock to select his 20-player
roster come playoff time. The Stars will soon have an overload of
front-line talent, and someone will have to sit. Winger Blake Sloan
(ankle fracture) could return next week, and winger Jere Lehtinen
(ankle injury) still appears to be on track for an early April
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the younger guys are now vying for that starting
position in regard to the playoffs,'' Hitchcock said. ``I think
some guys, in particular people like Aaron Gavey, have earned the
right to stay in the lineup even if we do get healthy.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Grant Marshall's right groin seems healthy and Hitchcock
cleared him to play tonight against Chicago. Also cleared to play
is center Guy Carbonneau, who makes his return from a fractured
wrist.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ken Hitchcock said goalie Ed Belfour will likely play in seven
of the final nine regular-season games. nn

 Layoffs at BofA Way Over Estimate  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Bank of America fired far more employees than it originally
projected in the 16 months after North Carolina's NationsBank took
over the San Francisco bank, according to a just-filed regulatory
document.
</P>
<P>
   From October 1998, when NationsBank bought the old BofA and took
its name, through December 1999, 12,600 bank employees qualified
for severance packages, meaning their jobs were eliminated and no
comparable positions were offered, the bank said earlier this week
in its annual 10-K report filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   BofA had estimated that 5,000 to 8,000 people would be dismissed
after the takeover as overlapping positions were cut.
</P>
<P>
   The 12,600 layoffs are part of the 19,000 to 20,000 jobs the
bank has said were cut after the takeover, more than 10 percent of
the bank's total head count. The remainder disappeared through
attrition as employees quit or retired and were not replaced. More
than 1,800 of the slashed jobs were in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The job figures, as well as other sensitive matters such as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Hugh McColl's recently
disclosed $76 million pay package for 1999, were the subject of an
internal bank memorandum, described as a ``Senior Manager Blast
Fax,'' circulated this week.
</P>
<P>
   The document, a copy of which was obtained by The Chronicle,
gives managers guidance on what to tell inquisitive employees and
journalists about job and pay issues.
</P>
<P>
   If asked why the actual number of fired employees is so much
higher than the earlier estimate, the memo instructs managers to
explain that advanced technology allowed the bank to eliminate more
positions, that more opportunities were found to combine functions
and attrition was less than originally expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still some consolidation to go,'' the memo notes.
``However, we are busily engaged in business as usual, including
hiring people to fill openings.``
</P>
<P>
   BofA spokesman Robert Stickler said the documents were authentic
but declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, BofA disclosed McColl's compensation, as well
as similar but smaller packages given to President Kenneth Lewis
and Chief Financial Officer James Hance, in a filing with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   If asked why McColl's pay package was so large, the memo tells
managers to point out that BofA's chief hadn't received a raise
since 1997 and that the bank's profits rose nearly 27 percent in
1999. To explain a $72 million stock and options award for McColl,
the document notes he had built the bank into the nation's largest
and provided shareholders a compounded annual return of 23 percent
before the grant was made.
</P>
<P>
   The memo also points out that the executives got their awards
when the bank's stock price was more than $70. It has since fallen
to near $50, sharply reducing the grants' value.
</P>
<P>
   The bank ``must be expecting some negative fallout,'' said
Michael Stead, chief investment officer of Sife Trust Fund, a
Walnut Creek mutual fund that owns 20,000 BofA shares. ``Employees
are being laid off while McColl gets an incredibly rich
compensation package.''
</P>
<P>
   BofA's memo also addresses the recent departures of three former
directors from the old BofA from the combined bank's board,
including Richard Rosenberg, CEO of the San Francisco bank from
1990 through 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg left because he had reached the board's mandatory
retirement age of 70; retired Nestle executive Timm cq &LR;  Crull cq &LR; 
declined to stand for re-election; and General Motors executive
Shirley Young resigned because her principal occupation had
changed, the memo claims.  &LR; stated.
</P>
<P>
   A recently published report suggested the departures were
engineered to increase McColl's hold on the board, a contention the
memo denied.

BUSH STAKING OUT EDUCATION AS A MAJOR CAMPAIGN ISSUE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Fla., Ohio)   (rk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ In a gesture meant to frame his education
proposals as expressions of concern for underprivileged and
minority children, Gov. George W. Bush plans a special visit on
Friday to the high school here where federal troops had to be
deployed in 1957 to enforce racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush intends to make the case that more than 40 years after
Central High School became an early battleground in the fight for
civil rights, educational opportunities for American school
children of different races and classes are still unequal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we have a great challenge of our own,'' reads an advance
copy of Bush's remarks, which was provided by a senior campaign
official. ``Access is universal, but excellence is not. All can
enter our schools, but not all are learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous gap of achievement between rich and
poor, white and minority,'' the speech continues.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in Bush's brief but carefully honed address adds to the
education proposals that he laid out last year. They call, in part,
for a system of financial rewards and punishments to improve the
performances of public schools in poor areas and of the students
they serve.
</P>
<P>
   But the staging and evocative setting of the event, along with
the tenor of the planned remarks, offer the best proof yet of how
heavily Bush is betting on education as an issue that can expand
his appeal beyond the traditional Republican base and, more
importantly, convince moderate and swing voters that he is a
Republican they can feel good about supporting.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Bush's visit demonstrates anew his eagerness to wrap
himself in the kind of symbolism and place himself in the kinds of
tableaus that Republicans have often ceded to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vice President Al Gore say that such gestures by Bush
are largely hollow, and that the substance of many of his proposals
belie his claims that they are intended to help needy Americans.
These critics say that what Bush is really accomplishing is an
oratorical and political sleight of hand.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's aides say that he is not only laying out initiatives
that would make measurable differences in children's lives but also
showing Americans the kind of tone he wants to set for the country,
and the kinds of words and actions that would be a part of his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public education _ the opportunity it creates _ are still
worth fighting for,'' according to Bush's prepared remarks, which
add that the issue is ``still worth the full attention of a
president.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment Bush essentially secured the Republican
presidential nomination in primaries on March 14, he has faced
perhaps no challenge greater than wooing Americans in the center of
the political spectrum and assuring them that there is as much
emphasis on the first word as the second in his slogan of
compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   And from that moment, Bush has talked about education almost
incessantly. It was the issue receiving the most attention in his
victory speech in Austin, Texas, that night, and it was the subject
of his first general-election television commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in turn, has also focused on education during the last
week and a half, creating a surprising and somewhat unexpected
dynamic: The issue that has attracted perhaps the most debate by
Bush and Gore so far is one in which the federal government's
involvement is limited. Only about 7 percent of the financing for
public elementary and high schools comes from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has consistently said that the president has a power,
through the bully pulpit, that transcends that figure, and he plans
to reiterate that point in Friday's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``A president does not bear responsibility for every policy in
every school in every district,'' the speech says. ``But a
president must be the keeper of our common ideals.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush has proposed that when public schools fail to improve,
federal money should be funneled instead to the parents of
students, so they could pursue other education options, or used to
encourage the growth of charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   Though there is vigorous dispute among education experts about
the wisdom of the remedies, the Bush campaign feels that
emphasizing education works to his advantage. That was clear in his
advisers' willingness to divert attention to what Bush planned to
do in Little Rock even as Bush, in several appearances in Florida
Thursday, hammered Gore on other fronts.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday afternoon in Orlando, where he was
visiting a high school, Bush called Gore ``an obstacle to reform''
of the Social Security system and the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   The governor portrayed Gore as a politician hampered not only by
an investment in the status quo but by questions of ethics and
honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man who said he invented the Internet, and didn't,''
Bush said. ``He's a man who said during a debate he was responsible
for the earned income tax credit, yet it was passed two years
before his arrival in the United States Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at an elementary school in Cincinnati, Gore said Bush
was using ``personal negative attacks against me just as he did
against John McCain in the Republican primaries.''

 No Illusion _ Manex Boss Faces Real Lawsuit  &HT;     By Carolyn Said 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
On Sunday afternoon, a senior visual effects supervisor from Manex
Entertainment of Alameda will be shoulder to shoulder with
Hollywood's brightest stars, promenading the red carpet into the
Shrine Auditorium. There, he will wait anxiously to find out if the
startling illusions he helped craft for ``The Matrix'' will win the
Academy Award for best visual effects.
<P>
   For a small special effects company removed from Hollywood's
power orbit, Manex seems to be soaring high.
</P>
<P>
   Its creative director took home an Oscar last year for ``What
Dreams May Come,'' and the firm designed effects in this week's Jet
Li release ``Romeo Must Die'' and the upcoming ``Mission Impossible
2.'' In February, it hired a respected Industrial Light &AMP; Magic
veteran as its president and announced a new eight-figure infusion
of capital.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the company will bask in a different kind of
attention. An Alameda County Superior Court judge will hear
allegations that the man who's been running Manex for the 21/2,
managing director Robert Bobo, 29,  &LR; defrauded investors and is now
trying to hastily sell the firm for his own profit.
</P>
<P>
   Court papers filed in the lawsuit describe a labyrinth of
promises, financial entanglements and alleged deceptions as
intricately byzantine as the world within a world of ``The
Matrix.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobo, 29, referred calls on the matter to his attorneys, who
said they were ``vigorously defending Mr. Bobo and the companies''
but considered it inappropriate to comment further on the eve of a
hearing. Their court filings in the case said there is insufficient
evidence to support the accusations and claims of ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But those claiming part ownership of Manex _ Michael Van
Himbergen of Santa Rosa, Roger Davis of Novato and Dr. Steven
Gillam of England _ say they have plenty of proof to back up their
assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents reviewed by The Chronicle show letters and
agreements that appear to show Van Himbergen, Davis and Gillam have
stakes in Manex, although the amount and other details are murky.
</P>
<P>
   The story starts in the early 1990s, when a group of special
effects pros in Massachusetts created an f/x  &LR; a special-effects
house called Mass.Illusion, owned by Cinergy, a small independent
movie studio (``Judge Dredd'').
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Cinergy was foundering financially and needed to sell
Mass.Illusion. It asked Van Himbergen and Davis to find investors
to take over the company.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mass.Illusion had almost $1 million in debt, it had
some valuable assets: a ``brain trust'' of highly talented effects
wizards, and a $7.5 million contract to produce the special effects
for ``What Dreams May Come.'' And Mass.Illusion had already
submitted test shots for ``The Matrix'' that had impressed the
movie's co-writers/directors, brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski.
</P>
<P>
   Van Himbergen, who had worked as an executive producer at
Mass.Illusion, said in an interview and in court documents that he
arranged to turn the firm over to Bobo and George Q. Vaile of the
Manex Group of Ohio in exchange for Manex assuming the debt.
</P>
<P>
   For his part of the deal and for helping turn the company
around, court documents state, Van Himbergen was promised part
ownership of up to 30 percent of Manex, while Davis was promised 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But, the lawsuit states, another 50 percent of Manex was
promised to Gillam.
</P>
<P>
   Bobo took over running the company from Vaile in November 1997,
but Van Himbergen said in an interview that he still played a vital
role in Manex. ``Bobo had zero contacts in our industry. I gave him
all of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Himbergen said he had ``invested nine months of my life'' in
Manex, creating a business plan, teaching the new managers from
Manex how to run a studio, and creating other opportunities, first
as an executive producer, then as vice president of strategic
relationships. He said he masterminded its move to the sprawling
Alameda Naval Air Station in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And while two other sources who said they were involved in the
transaction confirmed Van Himbergen's view of events, one noted,
``Everyone's going to tell you something a little inflated. There
were a lot of people who helped'' engineer the deal and ``educate''
the new Manex management.
</P>
<P>
   But as time wore on, Van Himbergen said, he became wary of
Bobo's business practices. ``I watched Bobo time and again lie to
employees, to service providers, to goods providers, to the film
companies we had contracts with,'' he said in court documents.
</P>
<P>
   A disillusioned Davis quit Manex in October 1997. Van Himbergen
hung on until May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to cajole, remind and force (Bobo and Vaile) to make
good on their promises'' about an ownership stake in the firm, Van
Himbergen said in an interview, but were met with ``a whole
cascade'' of obfuscations and excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, according to court documents, Gillam was pressuring
Bobo to repay a $150,000 loan. Bobo offered Gillam something that
might prove more lucrative: majority ownership of intellectual
property created at Manex, the documents said. In exchange, Gillam
agreed to reduce his ownership stake to 15 percent and forgive the
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Like most special-effects houses, Manex uses high-end software
to create its effects but also writes its own custom code or
``special sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Matrix,'' Manex had created breakthrough technologies,
called FloMo and Bullet Time, that enabled the stylish effects
where actors Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss hover in midair
before delivering ferocious karate kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Gillam asked to get copies of the software so he could turn it
into a commercial package, but was rebuffed, according to the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit estimates that Manex racked up as much as $50
million in sales for its work on a string of big-budget Hollywood
features and several smaller projects, but says that Bobo ``has
failed to account for the millions received.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the glamour of creating dazzling effects that awe
millions of moviegoers, most effects firms struggle to survive on
profit margins of about 6 percent, according to Daily Variety.
Firms might underbid to land a high-profile project. Several
special-effects houses, including Manex, are trying to expand their
revenues with plans to produce their own films.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Manex said it planned to launch its own small studio,
along the lines of Miramax or New Line Cinema, and would soon start
producing films at the Alameda base. Those plans have not yet come
to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing their custom technologies _ like Manex's FloMo and
Bullet Times _ is another way special-effects houses can make
money, industry experts said. ``Unless you know how to harvest the
IP (intellectual property), what you have is a service business
that can barely pay its bills even though the cash flow is really
high,'' said a special effects producer describing the
special-effects industry.
</P>
<P>
   Today's hearing asks for a restraining order to prevent a sale
of Manex. The lawsuit claims that Bobo is attempting to sell Manex
for about $20 million in an attempt to defraud Davis, Van Himbergen
and Gillam of their ownership rights.
</P>
<P>
   According to Davis' court declaration, the sale is being handled
by Jed Dumas of Bear Sterns in San Francisco. Dumas, managing
director in the private client service group, said yesterday that
neither Bear Sterns nor he have been engaged to seek a buyer for
Manex.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of the allegations in the lawsuit are true or not, a
wide range of effects professionals agree that Manex has a hugely
talented staff.
</P>
<P>
   Why would they stay at a firm that's under a cloud?
</P>
<P>
   It might be because the lawsuit allegations are unfounded. Or it
might be because of the nature of the people drawn to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effects is very passionate work,'' said one producer. ``People
are much more wedded to projects that are interesting and cool than
to things like ownership of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Another producer said, ``This isn't Silicon Valley. These are
all free-lancers basically; maybe $10,000-a-week free-lancers. As
long as they're getting a paycheck and working on a movie'' they're
happy. ``The gold is the Oscar.''

MANY KANSAS FAMILIES STRUGGLE AFTER LEAVING WELFARE, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONNA McGUIRE  
c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Many former welfare
families in Kansas struggle after leaving cash-assistance rolls, a
yearlong state study has found.
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than a third of the 809 families studied returned to
welfare, most within six months of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half the parents remaining off welfare had jobs _ a
lower work rate than many other states have reported _ and most of
those parents earned wages below poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the families reported trouble paying bills. And
despite financial problems, many eligible families were not
receiving food stamps, Medicaid or state-assisted child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The study findings suggest that families...are subject to
multiple social, emotional, intellectual and other barriers to
successful, long-term employment,'' said Janet Schalansky,
secretary of the Kansas Department of Social and Rehabilitation
Services.
</P>
<P>
   State welfare policies must evolve to address those problems,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas welfare rolls have fallen by nearly half, to 12,152
families in January, since the state implemented work requirements
and changed other welfare rules in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the study's findings, such as low wages, mirrored those
being reported across the country. However, at least six states
have announced much higher work rates, ranging from 61 to 71
percent. And in 1999, The Kansas City Star found that 69 percent of
former Jackson County, Mo., recipients surveyed had jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, slightly more than 40 percent of adults who left
welfare were employed.
</P>
<P>
   SRS hopes to improve work rates by putting additional emphasis
on job retention skills and training to promote job advancement.
SRS also plans to provide on-the-job coaching and mentoring and to
help more former recipients gain access to food stamps or other
services that could help ease their financial burdens. For those
programs, the state for the first time will maintain contact with
families after they leave welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Many states embraced job training and education for welfare
clients prior to welfare reforms of the mid-1990s. Those reforms
set time limits on benefits and instituted a ``work first''
philosophy, which pushed clients to seek work immediately.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the former Kansas recipients surveyed were
earning $7 or less per hour one year after leaving welfare. That
wage amounts to $14,560 a year for full-time work, an income below
poverty for a family of three.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to sustain them,'' said Stacey Herman, an SRS
spokeswoman. ``We need to think about how we can get these people
promoted in their jobs and how we can train them so they can get
better jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings raise many questions, some of which state officials
hope to answer through a follow-up study, Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   State employees conducted the study between December 1997 and
November 1998 from a random sample of cases.
</P>
<P>
   Other results:
</P>
<P>
   About half the families thought they were better off financially
than they had been on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Those unemployed most frequently cited health, transportation
and child care problems as barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after leaving assistance, nearly one in five
parents said they lacked enough money for food. By a year after
leaving, only about one in 12 reported that problem.
</P>
<P>
   One in five families had been evicted from their homes within a
year of leaving welfare, and nearly a third had lost utility
service. About a fourth had sought help from family or friends.
Only about 2 percent had turned to food pantries or other community
agencies for help.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in five families were thrown off welfare for not
meeting work rules, and 7 percent were discharged for not
cooperating with child support enforcement rules. Though parents
said they understood why they lost benefits, some did not realize
they could have qualified for exemptions.

 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shirley Hill Witt has a doctorate in anthropology.
She taught at Colorado College and the University of North
Carolina. She went on to become the mountain states regional
director for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and then the state
of New Mexico's secretary for natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   But for several years, Witt, now retired at age 65 and living in
the hills outside Albuquerque, N.M., felt like a failure because
she could not get the job she coveted most: foreign service officer
with the U.S. Information Agency.
</P>
<P>
   She took the arduous battery of tests in 1981, sat for oral
exams and ``was led to believe that I did very well,'' she recalled
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   She came up short, however, in one area where no amount of
competence or preparation would help: She was not a man. It took
four years to get hired, after which she was assigned to Venezuela,
Somalia, Zambia and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the government paid the price for Witt's four
years in limbo. She was among the 1,100 women who won $508 million,
about $460,000 each, in the nation's costliest sex-discrimination
case ever. After 23 years of litigation against the U.S.
Information Agency and the broadcasting organization it once
oversaw, the Voice of America, the government gave up _ but without
acknowledging that it had routinely discriminated against women in
hiring and promotion. A judge must still approve the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The suit asserted that the agencies had manipulated the hiring
process to exclude women, in some cases resorting to fraud,
altering test scores and destroying personnel and test files.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice of America has consistently denied the accusations,
and no disciplinary action was ever taken against the agencies'
managers as a result of the claims. The information agency no
longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Thursday, several of the women who were part of
the suit recounted the jolts of inexplicable rejection. Many of
them had been achievers in school and in their early careers, and
they said that in applying for the jobs in question in the 1970s
through the mid-1980s, they had taken all the right steps. But
while often assured they would be hired, they said they waited and
waited while transparently less qualified men were hired.
</P>
<P>
   They said they were ecstatic about the size of the settlement,
large enough to compensate for the wages they might have earned.
But they also spoke of the pain of feeling they had failed to
measure up to the needs of a government they trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could be compensated for the desperation and sense of
worthlessness I had then,'' said Teri Schaefer, 45, an education
reporter for Fox 4 News in Kansas City. She passed the tests to
join the Voice of America in 1983 but could never land a job, while
men were hired routinely. ``The money doesn't make up for that,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer said she was newly married in 1983 and bent on finding
a job when she took a written test for a news writing or news
announcing job. ``I was told I passed, but was told there were no
openings,'' she recalled. ``There were never any openings.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of months, Schaefer said, she found a full-time
job for a small broadcasting company. ``But I continued to call
VOA,'' she said, because jobs there were more stable and had good
benefits. Oddly, she noticed, the agency was hiring, but mostly
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never said, `We have too many girls here,''' Schaefer
said, ``although the person who interviewed me did say, `We don't
have many girls here.'''
</P>
<P>
   A decade earlier, in 1972, Dilara Hashem rapped on the same
doors. Then a refugee from Karachi, Pakistan, and living in London,
she applied for a visa. In Karachi, Hashem, now 64, had been a
radio news reader. She had also written two novels, and she spoke
nearly flawless English.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to join the Voice of America, whose broadcasts she had
admired back in Pakistan, she applied for a job and passed the
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Hashem recalled that once she was settled in Washington with a
visa, ``They said, `OK, we can take you part time.' No benefits, no
leave.'' Then she saw three men, one from Calcutta and two from
Bangladesh, sail into full-time jobs. All, she said, were far less
experienced.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1976, she lost the the part-time job. She said the
agency told her it was because of budget pressures, but at the same
time, VOA hired a man from Bangladesh to do just what she had been
doing. ``He had no broadcasting experience,'' she said. ``I felt so
humiliated when they let me go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hashem now has a full-time job broadcasting at the agency, and
her programs on American music and American life are heard
throughout Bangladesh. She has written 17 more books, mostly
novels.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Woolf said she was smitten by her father's career as a
foreign service officer. She lived abroad with her family until she
was 14, and she speaks French and Arabic. ``I liked the lifestyle,
the career, and felt I was fully grounded for it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Woolf, now 54 and editing news for an Internet communications
company, sought her niche in the information agency in radio and
television. In time, the agency gave her a three-year assignment to
NATO in Brussels, Belgium, as director of the organization's
broadcasting operation.
</P>
<P>
   There, she said, ``I was encouraged by senior colleagues to
apply for lateral entry into the foreign service,'' which she said
would have opened more opportunities to use her expertise in the
media. She took all the tests, she said. ``I thought I had
passed,'' she recalled. ``Lo and behold, I was told I had failed. I
was told I was too much of a specialist.''
</P>
<P>
   She stayed for six more years, but after repeatedly failing to
get the work she felt she was qualified for, Woolf gave up on the
information agency in 1991 to become media services director for
the Agency for International Development.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went right to the core of my self-esteem,'' she said. For
the women who spent 23 years fighting back, Woolf said, ``it was
the shaking down of your self-confidence that kept us all together,
all fighting.''

TUG OF WAR OVER CUBAN BOY IN MIAMI HEATS UP AGAIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK BRAGG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As Cuban-Americans here discussed possible strategies to
keep the authorities from returning 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
his father in Cuba, Sen. Connie Mack of Florida moved to block
immigration officials from taking Elian from his Miami relatives
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, a Republican who has sponsored a bill to grant the
boy American citizenship, has formally requested that the
Immigration and Naturalization Service delay any action on Elian's
return to Cuba until Congress acts on that legislation or until the
end of the congressional session, said Nancy Segerdahl, a
spokeswoman at Mack's Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Segerdahl said Mack's request was intended to prevent government
officials from ``acting drastically'' and ``give pause to any
immediate efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge K. Michael Moore of U.S. District Court here
dismissed a lawsuit requesting a political asylum hearing for the
boy, concluding that only Attorney General Janet Reno could grant
him asylum.
</P>
<P>
   That did not prompt any immediate protests from Cuban-Americans
here, who account for more than 700,000 of Miami-Dade County's 2.1
million people. But leaders of more than a dozen Cuban exile groups
began plans for a protest in the streets of Miami that police fear
could become violent.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said after the judge's ruling that she would not allow
asylum for Elian, who was found floating on an inner tube off the
Florida coast, and that he should be returned as soon as possible
to his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in Cardenas, Cuba. She has
also said immigration officials could legally take the boy at any
time.
</P>
<P>
   That is not likely, immigration experts said. Lawyers for
Elian's Miami relatives have appealed Moore's decision to the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's return could be deferred until the appeal is ruled on,
but Reno, while still refusing to say exactly when she would send
the boy back, said Thursday she did not have to wait for the
appeals process to run its course. Her words mobilized
Cuban-Americans here, who began surveillance of the house in the
Little Havana neighborhood where Elian lives with his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez. Men patrolled the street in front of the house,
some carrying hand-held radios so they could alert their groups of
any activity at the home.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid such an abrupt departure, Mack requested a report in
the immigration service's action in the case from Sen. Spencer
Abraham, the Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a report is requested, it is understood that no action
would be taken in the case by INS until Congress acts or until the
end of the congressional session,'' said Segerdahl, Mack's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers in Miami called it a last-minute tactic to
buy time, but Mack said he took the action because no one seems to
be acting in the boy's best interests. Elian has repeatedly said he
wants to stay, according to his relatives here, and is aware that
he may be sent back soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every question raised in the federal court process has been a
series of technical legal questions,'' said Mack. ``Not one
question in this process has addressed what is in the boy's best
interests. The only forum in which the boy's best interests can be
considered is in a custody hearing in family state court, where all
can freely speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno has said that state courts have no jurisdiction in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Moore concluded that only Elian's father had the legal right to
speak for him in an asylum claim. Lawyers for Elian's Miami
relatives said immigration laws let even children apply for asylum,
and it is that argument they will raise in their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Miami, those who want Elian to stay are standing
by. Ramon Saul Sanchez, who leads the Movimiento Democracia, said
he hoped that any protest would be peaceful, but that it was hard
to guarantee when addressing such an emotional issue. ``There are
things we can control,'' he said, ``and there are certain things we
can't control.''

major old master drawings sale in London on July 4. The star will
be this Michelangelo drawing, ``Study for the Risen Christ,'' in
pen, and red and black chalk, a study for a marble statue
commissioned for the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome.

   (NYT8) UNDATED -- March 23, 2000 -- ART-NOTES-1 -- With the
important spring and summer auctions approaching, Sotheby's and
Christie's have begun crowing about the big-ticket works they have
to offer. And with all the negative publicity from the continuing
federal antitrust investigation into their practices, both
companies are more determined than ever to put out the word that
business is going on as usual. Christie's says it will have the
season's most important work: ``Still Life With Tulips,'' a 1932
portrait by Pablo Picasso of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter. The
painting, seen here, estimated to go for $25 million to $30
million, is to be auctioned in New York on May 9. (Christie's/The

 &HT;    Bush stomps for cash and votes
 &HT;    in Florida
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Should U.S. Sen. Bob Graham become Vice
President Al Gore's running mate, winning Florida will become more
difficult, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Graham on the vice president's ticket, Bush said he
is not taking Florida for granted and the Sunshine State is vital
to his plans for winning the presidency. ``That's why I'm back
here,'' said Bush, who campaigned in Orlando and West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Graham as a ``respected senator,'' Bush said while
Graham would ``increase the degree of difficulty ... I could still
carry this state.'' Recent polls suggest that Florida is up for
grabs and Gore believes he has a reasonable chance of winning the
state despite the fact that Bush's younger brother, Jeb, is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked about his prospects here during a 20-minute
interview with four Florida reporters. He also said that while he
believes the United States needs to increase its domestic oil
exploration to decrease the nation's dependency on foreign imports,
he would oppose exploration off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating his charge that Gore ``will say anything to get
elected,'' Bush said that Democrats are trying to portray him as a
failed governor who has led his state to the brink of
environmental, educational and social disaster. He said Texans
would not have overwhelmingly reelected him if he was doing a poor
job.
</P>
<P>
   While he often criticizes Gore for a ``Washington mentality,''
Bush said that Washington experience will not disqualify someone
from becoming his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke favorably about U.S. Sen. Connie Mack but said he has
not given any thought to potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hilton, Bush met privately with many of his major
contributors before giving a brief speech in a banquet room
occupied by elected officials and people who gave at least $1,000
to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's staff said the campaign raised about $750,000 during this
trip.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bush's first trip to Florida since locking up the
Republican nomination. He was greeted at the Hilton by his brother,
House Speaker John Thrasher of Jacksonville and local GOP
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bring a new attitude to Washington, D.C.,'' Bush
told the crowd. ``Let's get rid of the ugliness and the name
calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County Commissioner Warren Newell came with a note
for Bush from his three children.
</P>
<P>
   Newell said he gave a similar note to former President George
Bush and Newell's kids got a nice letter from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to get a response the same way they got one from
his dad,'' said Newell.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush spent a couple of hours at Colonial
High School in Orlando where he talked to about 400 students in the
school gym for about 30 minutes before answering about a dozen
questions on topics ranging from relations between China and Taiwan
to whether Social Security will be available when they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   The question that got the loudest applause and cheers was about
increasing gas prices, which hurt the pockets of high school
drivers who usually earn only minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like we have a lot of drivers here,'' said Bush as the
applause died down. He told the students that if he were president,
he would force OPEC ``to open the spigots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush left West Palm Beach around 7 p.m. for a campaign trip to
Arkansas.

PUTIN SAYS HE WILL USE FORMER KGB COLLEAGUES TO FIGHT CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Replaces 14th graf with 2 new grafs refining translation of
Putin's statements) 
 (bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If he is elected president on Sunday, as everyone
expects he will be, Vladimir Putin says he will use a trusted group
of former colleagues from the KGB to tackle Russia's endemic
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am bringing into my inner circle people from law enforcement
bodies who are in no way connected with the people and structures
which may be associated with any form of corruption,'' the acting
president said. A former officer of the KGB, the Soviet
intelligence service, and later head of Russia's domestic
intelligence service, Putin's ascent in the Kremlin has stirred
some concerns among Russians who fear he may try to roll back the
nation s hard-won freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brief interview with Ted Koppel of the ABC News
television program ``Nightline,'' Putin sought to assure the West
that his intelligence connections would be used to build a more
fair and even-handed system. A transcript of the interview, which
will be broadcast Friday, was made available to the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have brought some of them to the Kremlin,'' he said of
his KGB colleagues. ``I have known them for many years and I trust
them. It has nothing to do with ideology. It's only a matter of
their professional qualities and personal relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin did not name the intelligence officials he plans to use in
his ``inner circle.'' The FSB, the Russian successor to the Soviet
KGB, already includes a deputy director who owes his position to
Putin and who has been criticized for persecuting dissidents under
Soviet rule. And former intelligence officials run Russia's
security council and serve as mid-level aides Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Many top positions, however, are held by holdovers from the
administration of Boris Yeltsin and officials with no background in
intelligence. It remains to be seen how that mix may change when,
as virtually everyone expects, Putin is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed during his visit to Nizhny Novgorod, a picturesque city
on the Volga River, the brief interview was one of few that Putin
has given to the Western press. The answers he provided appeared
intended to dispel his image as a wily survivor who is determined
to rebuild Russia's influence and might.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Putin insisted that his flight to Grozny, Chechnya, in the back
seat of a SU-27 fighter was not a campaign stunt, designed to
demonstrate his support for a reinvigorated Russian military. It
was, he said, simply the cheapest, fastest and safest way to
travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly speaking,'' he said straightfaced, ``the last thing I
thing about is symbols.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rampant corruption has been a monumental problem for Russia and
there have been allegations that it reached into the higher
echelons of the government when Yeltsin was in power. Putin has
taken few steps as prime minister or acting president to combat it.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Putin cast corruption as little more than a
passing phase for a nation still trying to extract itself from the
ruins of the Soviet Union. And he all but pledged to banish bribery
and make Russia safe for foreign investors after he is handed the
reins of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the period of transitional economy the government often
fails to guarantee equal opportunities for all participants of the
market,'' he acknowledged somberly. ``There are those who take
advantage of their proximity to political, governmental and
regional leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing what actions his government might take, Putin couched
them in the context of strengthening the role of the state:
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we will focus on guaranteeing the full rights of owners
and investors,'' he said. ``The right of ownership must become a
priority in Russia. We will strive to make the position of the
state crystal clear in its legislation. We will need to make the
state strong enough to guarantee implementation of these rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And finally, '' he added, ``we will do our best to ensure
equal opportunity for all the participants of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope that if these fundamental principles are observed,'' he
told Mr. Koppel, ``we will not have to bring up the issue of
corruption in Russia the next time we meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's remarks about the KGB and its successors appeared
intended to counter the the dark connotations the intelligence
agency still has in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to an American audience, however, Putin seemed to be at
pains to portray himself as an enlightened former intelligence
official, who was committed to streamlining government and fighting
corruption, not rolling back the clock on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Koppel about a comment he reportedly made at a
gathering of intelligence officers to the effect that they had
``succeeded in our first effort to infiltrate the Kremlin,'' Putin
replied:
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it was a joke _ though I have to say that a
gathering of employees of intelligence agencies and former leaders
of those agencies is not unusual, even in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to Russian interviewers, he has boasted that he
approached the KGB as a schoolboy in the hope of beginning a career
as a spy. He fulfilled his dream in 1975, when he was recruited
into the KGB, where he reached the rank of lieutenant colonel
before resigning. Putin was named to head the the FSB, Russia's
domestic successor to the KGB, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   On becoming prime minister last August, Putin ordered that a
plaque commemorating Yuri Andropov, the former KGB head and Soviet
leader, be restored to the wall of the KGB's old Lubyanka
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``Nightline'' interview approached the eight-minute mark,
one of Putin's aides tugged at his pants leg, apparently a signal
that the acting president had given the American interviewers
enough.

<P>
   ANNAPOLIS, Md. _ Amid growing public and political pressure for
stronger gun control laws, the Maryland Senate put aside
legislative tradition on Thursday to bypass a critical committee
and bring to floor debate Gov. Parris N. Glendening's proposal for
mandatory locks on all new handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which had been stalled in committee until some unusual
parliamentary maneuvering on Thursday morning, would enact one of
the toughest laws in the country, mandating attachable trigger
locks this year and built-in locks in three years, with an eye
toward monitoring technology and eventually requiring ``smart
guns'' operable solely by lawful owners once the technology is
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has reached a point of real frustration that is on
the verge of turning to anger,'' Glendening said in an interview.
``What the public is saying is: no more,'' he added, citing strong
public polling support for the proposal, which includes a mandate
that manufacturers provide ballistic signatures for each new gun to
aid in tracking gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recorded this forever,'' Glendening, a Democrat, said in his
Statehouse office after monitoring and downloading the debate with
his laptop computer and hearing gun-control opponents, caught
short, rising to demand points of order and vowing to fight further
through filibusters.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the governor predicted passage of the bill by both
houses now that the measure had been forced by a Senate majority
from the powerful Judicial Proceedings Committee, a panel where the
proposal had earlier been pronounced dead by most members, many
from rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was brought to the floor in the
Democratic-controlled Senate on a 26-19 vote, with five Democrats
joining the Senate's 14 Republicans in opposition. Glendening
predicted that the 32 votes needed to end filibusters in the
47-member Senate would be found within a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, no one gave us a chance on this,'' Glendening
said of the proposal, emphasizing that in his view, the opposition
lawmakers saw the ground cut from under them in the last week by
Smith &AMP; Wesson's agreement with President Clinton to begin
marketing ``smart guns'' within three years. Statehouse opponents
here had sought to put off the subject of gun control by arguing
that ``smart gun'' technology, one of the features in the
governor's proposal, was totally impractical.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a key psychological breakthrough,'' Glendening said
as he also cited growing public disgust with repeated instances of
sensational gun violence, including the harrowing disruption of a
Baltimore suburb this week when a suspect in four gun deaths held
hostages and was finally shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the excesses of the National Rifle Association in
personally attacking the president are producing a very negative
reaction in the public,'' the governor added. ``In a moderate to
progressive state like ours, all the NRA is doing is solidifying
people and making them stronger in their resolve to control gun
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor cited in particular the ``courage'' of the Senate
president, Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., a Prince George's County
Democrat, in finally deciding to bypass the traditional committee
process in a floor maneuver that had not been used in decades.
Miller, whose district includes the Beretta U.S.A. gun factory,
described Thursday as ``D Day'' on the deadlocked gun control
issue. He agreed that trigger lock legislation favored by many
could reach the floor for debate once the smart gun question had
been deferred by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than an immediate endorsement of smart guns that
Glendening originally proposed, technological progress toward the
gun would be monitored annually by the Legislature instead. This
was a concession the governor quickly made once Smith &AMP; Wesson made
its commitment to market smart guns nationally on the same
three-year timetable he sought in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Glendening had campaigned strongly on gun control promises in
both his winning campaigns for governor. He made the state the
first in the nation to adopt legislation that prevents individuals
from buying more than one gun a month. The measure, adopted four
years ago, has since been passed in other states. He also took the
lead in the smart gun proposal, deferring that when legislative
leaders agreed to bypass the committee and to a compromise package
that protects the rest of the governor's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond gun locks, the measure would bar anyone with a record as
a juvenile offender from buying firearms until the age of 30 and
would require training lessons for new handgun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest state opinion polls showed 67 percent support for
approving smart guns, the governor noted, and _ for the first time
_ a 54 percent majority favoring an outright ban on handguns, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more willing to do something about this,''
Glendening said. ``People are saying if you can't do something
about it, such as smart guns, then let's get rid of it all
together.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The governor has been citing the problem of gun violence in
virtually every speech lately, emphasizing that more than 7,000
state residents have been killed by guns in the last decade. A
natural disaster costing 7,000 lives in Baltimore would summon
furious demands from the public to take action, he tells audiences.
``Yet because we kill one another one at a time, there's not the
same sense of outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   Constantly updating a list of vivid national incidents of fatal
shooting sprees, Glendening regularly tells constituents, ``Think
about what you have seen in the news for the last two months and
ask whether we're going to live the rest of our lives this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from shying from the controversial gun issue, Glendening has
built his career around it, beginning with 12 years service as the
elected chief executive of Prince George's County, a Washington
suburb with a history of substantial gun violence. ``I buried eight
police officers in my 12 years there,'' he grimly noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be the first state in the country to mandate that every
new gun must have an integrated lock system,'' he said, predicting
that other states would follow suit in the face of what he
described as a growing public resolve to press the gun-control
issue upon reluctat politicians.

REACTION TO TAIWAN CALM, SO CHINA GAINS IN TRADE TALKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A rare burst of moderation on both sides of the
Taiwan Strait has fortified proponents of granting China permanent
trading rights in the United States as a Senate committee formally
took up the trade measure Thursday. Clinton administration
officials said prospects for passage had improved.
</P>
<P>
   Several key members of Congress said that China's low-key
reaction to the election of Chen Shui-bian of the
independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party as Taiwan's new
president had offered some reassurance that Beijing would take a
``wait and see'' attitude toward the new government. China
maintains that it has sovereignty over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. lawmakers said they had feared after last weekend's
presidential vote that China might take military action against
Taiwan, following through on threats made shortly before the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, so far at least, has returned the moderate overtures.
Chen has said repeatedly in recent days that he thinks Congress
should normalize trade relations with China and that both Taiwan
and China should join the World Trade Organization as soon as
possible, signaling that whatever their political differences they
should move forward on strengthening economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some members were expecting China to put its worst foot
forward,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a strong supporter of
granting China permanent trading rights. ``That's not been the case
so far, which is very encouraging for the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is pushing Congress to discontinue
its annual review of China's trading rights and grant China
permanent low-tariff access to the U &UR; . &LR; S &UR; . &LR;  market, the same
treatment most other trading partners receive.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said the vote was crucial if U &UR; . &LR; S &UR; . &LR; 
companies were to benefit from a sweeping trade accord it
negotiated as part of China's drive to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has said that a no vote would be devastating
for United States-China relations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that would extend permanent normal trade relations was
formally introduced in the Senate Finance Committee Thursday, where
it is expected to pass easily before proceeding to a tougher test
in the House, which is not expected to vote before May.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of permanent normal trade relations are ceding
nothing. Several freshman members of Congress declared this week
that they planned to vote against extending permanent trading
rights to China.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unions and consumer groups that are fighting the
measure said they had scheduled a series of large public
demonstrations during the Easter congressional recess, when they
plan to take aim at scores of uncommitted lawmakers in their home
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton administration officials were markedly more
upbeat about the vote this week than they were earlier this month.
They said their own intensive lobbying efforts combined with
China's restrained response to Taiwan had helped them line up some
wavering Democratic and Republican lawmakers in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought they we would get this through in the end,
but I'm more optimistic now than I was a few weeks ago,'' said
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman.

Dean Witter &AMP; Co. reported Thursday that its first-quarter net
income rose 49 percent, making it the fourth big investment bank to
post stronger than expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, the biggest firm on Wall Street measured by
market value, benefited in various ways from investors' seemingly
insatiable appetite for the securities of companies in technology
and telecommunications industries. As an investment bank, the firm
is a leader in underwriting stock offerings for high-technology
companies; as a brokerage firm and mutual fund manager, it feeds
demand for those stocks from individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   All of those businesses have been running at record levels so
far this year, fattening profits for all of the established
securities firms.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley earned $1.54 billion, or $1.34 a diluted share,
in the quarter ended Feb. 29. That was 5 percent less than the
record $1.62 billion Morgan Stanley earned in the previous quarter
but much more than the $1.04 billion, or 88 cents a share, it
earned in the 1999 period.
</P>
<P>
   The results easily surpassed analysts' forecasts of $1.06 a
share. Shares of Morgan Stanley rose $4.50, to $94.75, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing that Morgan Stanley's executives predicted no
slowdown in stock and bond issuance or merger activity over the
next few months, analysts started raising their estimates of the
firm's earnings for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was another blockbuster result in the brokerage
industry,'' said Richard Strauss, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group. ``Trading, like at the other firms, was huge last quarter,
and our sense is that nothing has changed in that regard in this
early part of the second quarter. Meanwhile, investment banking is
going to really kick in big in the second quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm's revenue from investment banking held steady from the
previous quarter at about $1.34 billion. Included in that amount
are the fees the firm received for advising companies on takeovers,
like the German telecommunications company Mannesmann's $33 billion
acquisition of Orange PLC. But the firm is still awaiting receipt
of fees for several other huge mergers and acquisitions that have
been announced but have not been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The backlog of deals is higher than it was a year ago and the
flow of IPOs looks like it will continue to be robust,'' said
Robert Scott, the firm's chief financial officer. Scott said
commissions at the Dean Witter brokerage unit hit new highs,
despite the firm's efforts to switch more of its individual
customers to paying annual fees instead of commissions on their
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Trading revenue doubled from the previous quarter, to $2.28
billion, and commissions rose 32 percent, to $1.04 billion.
Overall, the firm's net revenue _ revenue after interest expense _
was $7.41 billion, up 39 percent from $5.34 billion in the first
quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Scott also said the firm had postponed for several months its
plan to raise prices for customers of its original online-trading
system, which was called Discover Brokerage. The firm is rolling
that operation, which charged a basic commission of $14.95 a trade,
into its new service, which charges $29.95 a trade. Morgan Stanley
has not disclosed how many online accounts its customers have
opened or how much trading they do. To attract online traders, the
firm has opened two branches exclusively for them, one on Park
Avenue in Manhattan and one in San Francisco, Scott said.

SMUGGLING OF IRAQI OIL IS RISING, U.N. IS TOLD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Steeply rising oil prices have brought a huge
increase in the smuggling of Iraqi oil, the U.S. coordinator of the
international fleet that patrols the waters off Iraq told a
Security Council committee Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinator, Vice Adm. Charles Moore, told the committee on
sanctions against Iraq that much of the oil passes through Iranian
waters, diplomats said after the closed briefing. The admiral
coordinates a small fleet from more than a dozen nations that
polices the Persian Gulf, looking for ships that violate an
international embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and his team from the Pentagon told the committee that a
political or diplomatic overture to Iran was necessary if the
smuggling was to be curtailed, according to the representative of
the Netherlands, Peter van Walsum, who is chairman of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not discussed anything of that sort yet,'' van Walsum
said after the meeting. He said the subject could be raised at the
panel's next meeting, for which no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said that Moore, briefing the committee the
day before a debate on the sanctions, reported that at current
rates of oil shipments, Iraq could earn up to a billion dollars
this year in illegal sales. Diplomats said the profits go directly
to Saddam Hussein or those he chooses to reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of smuggling is at record levels,'' a Western
diplomat said. The oil, often bought and sold by private brokers
using ships with fraudulent papers, goes to many destinations,
including Iran, Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians skim part of the profit, diplomats said. It is not
known whether the Iranians enriching themselves by allowing tankers
to use their territorial waters are backed by the government in any
way. But twice in the past _ in March and September of 1998 _ the
Iranians were able to shut down the trade, diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   According to Western diplomats who heard Moore's briefing, Iraq
was able to illegally export 1,868,466 barrels of oil in 1996,
10,497,000 barrels the following year, 13,296,000 barrels in 1998
and 7,557,838 barrels in 1999. If current prices stay high, it is
estimated that Iraq will sell about 4.8 tons of illegal gas oil _
akin to diesel fuel _ this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the trend continues,'' a diplomat said, ``more oil will be
smuggled out of Iraq this year than the total smuggled out in the
last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that the oil comes from fields at Basra and is
exported on vessels from the Iraqi port of Abu Flus. This port is
not authorized for exports by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   All smuggled Iraqi oil is by its nature outside the control and
surveillance of the ``oil for food'' program, in which the United
Nations allows Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil so it can buy
food and other necessities.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Bush stumps for cash and votes
 &HT;    in Florida
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Should U.S. Sen. Bob Graham become Vice
President Al Gore's running mate, winning Florida will become more
difficult, Texas Gov. George W. Bush said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Graham on the vice president's ticket, Bush said he
is not taking Florida for granted and the Sunshine State is vital
to his plans for winning the presidency. ``That's why I'm back
here,'' said Bush, who campaigned in Orlando and West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Describing Graham as a ``respected senator,'' Bush said while
Graham would ``increase the degree of difficulty ... I could still
carry this state.'' Recent polls suggest that Florida is up for
grabs and Gore believes he has a reasonable chance of winning the
state despite the fact that Bush's younger brother, Jeb, is
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked about his prospects here during a 20-minute
interview with four Florida reporters. He also said that while he
believes the United States needs to increase its domestic oil
exploration to decrease the nation's dependency on foreign imports,
he would oppose exploration off Florida's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating his charge that Gore ``will say anything to get
elected,'' Bush said that Democrats are trying to portray him as a
failed governor who has led his state to the brink of
environmental, educational and social disaster. He said Texans
would not have overwhelmingly reelected him if he was doing a poor
job.
</P>
<P>
   While he often criticizes Gore for a ``Washington mentality,''
Bush said that Washington experience will not disqualify someone
from becoming his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke favorably about U.S. Sen. Connie Mack but said he has
not given any thought to potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   At the Hilton, Bush met privately with many of his major
contributors before giving a brief speech in a banquet room
occupied by elected officials and people who gave at least $1,000
to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's staff said the campaign raised about $750,000 during this
trip.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bush's first trip to Florida since locking up the
Republican nomination. He was greeted at the Hilton by his brother,
House Speaker John Thrasher of Jacksonville and local GOP
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to bring a new attitude to Washington, D.C.,'' Bush
told the crowd. ``Let's get rid of the ugliness and the name
calling.''
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County Commissioner Warren Newell came with a note
for Bush from his three children.
</P>
<P>
   Newell said he gave a similar note to former President George
Bush and Newell's kids got a nice letter from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to get a response the same way they got one from
his dad,'' said Newell.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush spent a couple of hours at Colonial
High School in Orlando where he talked to about 400 students in the
school gym for about 30 minutes before answering about a dozen
questions on topics ranging from relations between China and Taiwan
to whether Social Security will be available when they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   The question that got the loudest applause and cheers was about
increasing gas prices, which hurt the pockets of high school
drivers who usually earn only minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like we have a lot of drivers here,'' said Bush as the
applause died down. He told the students that if he were president,
he would force OPEC ``to open the spigots.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush left West Palm Beach around 7 p.m. for a campaign trip to
Arkansas.

COWBOYS PLAN TO KEEP PIRATES FROM SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Doug Gottlieb of Oklahoma State was asked
whether age and experience would help his veteran Cowboys against
the young and injury-depleted Seton Hall Pirates here on Friday
night in the semifinal of the East Regional of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope age plays well, because I'm the oldest guy, I think, in
college,'' said Gottlieb, a senior guard who is 24 years old and
began his college career five years ago at Notre Dame. Turning
serious, Gottlieb said that after the first 5 or 10 minutes of the
game, ``Once you get playing, it's just hoop.''
</P>
<P>
   He said experience counts more in the final minutes of a tense,
close game ``when every decision counts and every play is
magnified.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (26-6) and the Pirates (22-9) play in the second
game of Friday's doubleheader, starting at about 10 p.m. in the
Carrier Dome. In the first game, starting at 7:38 p.m., Duke plays
Florida. The winners will meet Sunday afternoon for a berth in the
tournament's Final Four the next weekend in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State starts four seniors. Seton Hall, because of the
ankle injury to Shaheen Holloway, will probably start only one
senior, Rimas Kaukenas, who is recovering from an illness that
might be strep throat. Seton Hall has played close games so far in
the tournament, beating Oregon and then Temple in overtime last
weekend in Buffalo. Holloway's replacement, Ty Shine, a sophomore,
made 7 of 11 3-point attempts and Seton Hall hit 15 of 30 over all
to beat the Owls. So the Cowboys said they hope to nullify that
aspect of Seton Hall's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Mason, the Oklahoma State senior forward, said he and
his teammates would ``make them put it on the floor and dribble,
not let them spot up and shoot the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Glendon Alexander, a senior guard, said: ``In our program,
defense comes first. We've taken teams out of what they want to do,
make guys be dribblers instead of shooters.''
</P>
<P>
   While Holloway and Seton Hall Coach Tommy Amaker said it was
doubtful that Holloway would play, Oklahoma State was not so sure.
Holloway sat out practice Thursday, watching from the bench and
shouting encouragement while his bandaged left ankle rested high on
a chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling Holloway will play,'' Gottlieb said. ``I'm
sure he'll give it a go.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Sutton, the coach of Oklahoma State, agreed. ``I'd be
surprised if Holloway doesn't play some,'' he said. ``If he doesn't
play, it certainly does hurt their ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   Holloway and Kaukenas are Seton Hall's co-captains. Holloway,
the point guard, severely sprained his left ankle, with a partial
tear of a ligament, during the first half against Temple when he
stepped on the shoe of an Owl while driving in for a layup. He said
that Thursday was the first day he had been able to walk without
crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's a nice, little progress,'' Holloway said.
``It's up in the air. I've got confidence in Ty and Darius Lane, if
I don't play.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane, discussing what he has learned of Oklahoma State, said:
``Gottlieb likes to push the ball up and catch you while you're
sleeping. We've got to get back on defense as soon as we shoot the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane said he liked the advantage of playing here on a Big East
court, where the Pirates have won before this season, although
against another team, the Syracuse Orangemen. Seton Hall is seeded
No. 10 in the East Regional; Oklahoma State is No. 3. The game site
is about a five-hour drive from Seton Hall and the Pirates, serious
underdogs, might have fan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope so,'' Lane said. ``We're Big East family. It would be
nice. We need all the support we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oklahoma State might also feel like a home team. Sutton said
he had kept most of his players in upstate New York after Sunday's
game ``because the NCAA was not able to get our charter out of
Buffalo until an ungodly hour.'' He said it was probably
advantageous that his team did not have to go back home and then
return. ``Most coaches I'm sure would tell you they would much
prefer to keep them under wraps, away from the co-eds and fellow
students back on campus,'' Sutton said.

EDITORIAL: JOHN PAUL'S MIDEAST JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 24:
</P>
<P>
   There has been a poignancy to the televised images of an
elderly, enfeebled Pope John Paul II indomitably pressing ahead
through windswept Masses and candlelit prayers on his pilgrimage to
the Holy Land this week. But the impression of infirmity belies the
nimbleness he has shown in making his way through one of the most
complex and combustible corners of the world. John Paul has
skillfully blended the sacred and the secular in a delicate
balancing act. The only disappointment has been his reluctance to
acknowledge more explicitly the Vatican's failure to confront the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In his visit Thursday to Jerusalem's Yad Vashem Holocaust
memorial, John Paul paid eloquent homage to the 6 million Jewish
victims of the Nazi genocide. He noted his own memories of the Nazi
occupation of his native Poland and of Jewish childhood friends and
neighbors who perished in the concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has done more than any modern pope to end the
estrangement between Catholics and Jews. He was the first pope to
pray in a synagogue, the first to acknowledge the failure of
individual Catholics to deter the Holocaust and the first to call
anti-Semitism a sin ``against God and man.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yad Vashem he echoed the church's recent apology for past
errors, saying he deplored ``the hatred, acts of persecution and
displays of anti-Semitism directed against the Jews by Christians
at any time and any place.'' These steps seemed to bring John Paul
to a point where he could address Pope Pius XII's failure to
galvanize the church against the Holocaust, and Yad Vashem was the
natural place to do so. It now seems likely that he will leave the
matter, including the divisive debate over canonization of Pius
XII, to his successors.
</P>
<P>
   As a political act, the pope's visit to Israel was the
culmination of his effort to build durable relations between that
state and the Vatican. In 1994 he extended full diplomatic
recognition to Israel. This week's trip, the first official papal
visit to Israel, is a historic Christian affirmation of the Jewish
right to a sovereign homeland. Prime Minister Ehud Barak emphasized
that affirmation as the most important aspect of the week's events.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul carefully devoted time and attention to the
Palestinians as well. He spent almost all of Wednesday in territory
controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority, which includes
Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus. In a visit to the crowded
Dehaisheh refugee district near Bethlehem, he decried the hardships
of refugee life. With Arafat at his side, he told Palestinians they
had ``a natural right to a homeland,'' and he added, ``no one can
ignore how much the Palestinian people have had to suffer in recent
decades. Your torment is before the eyes of the world. And it has
gone on too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his presence in Palestinian-controlled territory
amplified his remarks, the pope's support for the creation of a
Palestinian homeland was consistent with established Vatican
positions and in line with the current direction of negotiations
between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   There is a valedictory quality to the pope's actions and travels
as the church approaches its third millennium. He seems determined
to trace the birth of Christianity in this epochal year, to right
the wrongs of the church and to bring a spirit of conciliation to
the Middle East. Not long ago he went to Egypt and visited Mount
Sinai, where Jews and Christians believe Moses received God's law.
This week he stood atop Mount Nebo in Jordan and looked across the
Promised Land. He prayed in silence near the places where Jesus was
born and baptized. Most people as infirm as John Paul would not
dare make such strenuous trips. But he seems to be a man on a
mission, and the world is better for it.

TWO FRESHMEN: YOUNG, GIFTED AND (YES!) UNUSUAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   North Carolina and Tennessee meet Friday night in the South
Regional in Austin, Texas, as two odd teams in: underachievers
turned gladiators, once selfish teams that transformed into united
and spirited clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams also feature a freshman as the odd player in.
</P>
<P>
   For Carolina, forward Julius Peppers is the football player
turned hoop monster. For Tennessee, forward Ron Slay is the
on-court comic, a flamboyant, active player.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are reserves, yet both are pivotal.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (20-13) and Tennessee (26-6) beat higher-seeded
teams to advance to the Round of 16, with the Tar Heels defeating
No. 1 Stanford and the Volunteers beating No. 5 Connecticut. In the
other South Regional game tonight, Miami (23-10) will play Tulsa
(31-4). On Sunday the winners will meet to decide the region's
Final Four entrant.
</P>
<P>
   Peppers played 24 minutes, scored 6 points and grabbed three
rebounds against Stanford. Slay played 29 minutes, scored 8 points
and earned 4 rebounds against Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Peppers, at 6 feet 7 inches and 270 pounds, is not even in the
Carolina basketball media guide. He joined the team four games into
the season after leading the Tar Heels' football team in tackles
and sacks as a defensive end. Now he throws that punch into
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually shoot in one of the gyms on campus and a couple of
the basketball guys saw me there and told me I should come out for
the team,'' Peppers said. ``Ed Cota used to see me there all of the
time, and he is the one who went to tell the coaches about me. The
coaches called me in; they liked me and the rest is history. I'm
not just a football guy who's trying to play basketball. Right now,
I'm a basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   A basketball brute.
</P>
<P>
   Cota, a point guard, said: ``Everybody respects Julius because
he's earned a role on our team and we are stronger with him. He
works hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppers places his 270 pounds under the basket, next to
Carolina's 7-foot center Brendan Haywood, and serves as a space
eater. He creates extra room for Haywood to operate, and he
rebounds effectively. His shooting touch is soft, especially for a
big man. His season-high in points is 14 and in rebounds it is 13.
</P>
<P>
   Slay is, well, unconventional.
</P>
<P>
   You might see him after a score run upcourt with his arms moving
like a pinwheel, cajoling the crowd; or take a charge and simply
lay flat on the floor until a teammate pulls him up; or blow smoke
from his index finger after shooting an imaginary pistol; or make
funny faces and gestures to reporters and cameras at sidecourt
after a Tennessee dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called everything and I've called people
everything,'' Slay said. ``I'm in your face and they're in my face.
I call it passion. I'm out there having fun and working hard. Just
call me the emotional leader. I have an outgoing personality and I
get it from my mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Slay, 18, is the oldest of seven children. He played three years
of high school basketball in Nashville and used to enjoy playground
games against local basketball stars such as Carlos Rogers and
Anthony Mason, now National Basketball Association players. Slay
played his senior season at Oak Hill (Va.) Academy. He has a
football background, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played safety and wide receiver in high school in
Nashville,'' Slay said. ``I broke my arm as a junior, and it was
right before I was supposed to try out for Oak Hill. I went there
and shot with my left hand because my right one was in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaches took a gamble; they said if I could shoot that
good with my left, the right must be OK. We went 31-0 last year and
won the national championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he arrived at Tennessee, Slay injured his knee and
underwent knee surgery. Nearly four weeks later, he played in
Tennessee's season opener against Elon and scored 17 points in his
debut.
</P>
<P>
   Slay is a quick 6-8, 225 pounds, a player who averaged 9.6
points and 4.3 rebounds a game this season. In Tennessee's last 10
games, he has played at least 20 minutes a game. He is athletic,
can drive past defenders, has a quick, soft shot, is a good leaper
and a solid defender.
</P>
<P>
   Slay's style earned him trouble late in the season in a game at
home against Georgia. Slay taunted the Georgia bench during
Tennessee's 110-83 victory. Later he had to apologize. His coach,
Jerry Green, told him to have fun but to calm down.
</P>
<P>
   Slay rolled on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has been criticized for inconsistent play and not
having a killer instinct,'' Slay said. ``They say we're soft and
then they say we're hard-headed and out of control. People say a
lot. And we started listening and losing, like in our game in the
Southeastern Conference tournament against South Carolina. We
learned from that to be ourselves and that's why we're playing
relaxed, fun team ball now. I expect that to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   All the way to Final Four?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta go there,'' Slay said.
</P>
<P>
   And, one day, even the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta go there, too,'' he said.  &QL;

 EMOTIONS INTACT, RAINES ENDS a 21-YEAR CAREER  
(jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ One dollar represented the stakes in the bet
between Tim and Virginia Raines, and the wife was sure she would
win the cash and a lifetime of bragging rights on this question:
</P>
<P>
   Would Tim Raines cry on the last day of a major league career
that began 21 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   A friend with a Camcorder followed Raines around the Yankees'
clubhouse to capture his final moments as a player in baseball and
to document conclusively, for the Raines family archives, whether
he shed tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't so far,'' he said after a morning news conference,
laughing his high-pitched cackle, but knowing he still would have
to say goodbye to teammates who revere him.
</P>
<P>
   After 2,561 career hits, 1,548 runs and 807 stolen bases, Raines
hoped to make the Yankees' opening-day roster, at age 40, about
eight months after being told by doctors that he had lupus _ an
incurable immune system disorder.
</P>
<P>
   He had performed better than anybody expected here in camp,
batting .292, but Raines did not feel right. Raines found he had to
force himself to prepare mentally, and he knew that after an
off-season of medical treatment, he was not in optimal condition.
</P>
<P>
   Raines came to camp wanting to prove to himself that he could
play the game even after the onset of lupus; he wanted to leave on
his own terms. Raines walked into the office of Yankees Manager Joe
Torre on Monday to ask about his standing.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre offered no assurances he was going to make the team,
Raines told his manager he was going to retire in three days, after
the Yankees had a day off Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Raines left Torre's office, called his wife and told her he had
retired, a possibility the couple discussed the night before.
``Baby, I went in and did it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you OK?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said. ``Did you cry?'' she asked, and with a chuckle, he
assured her there were no tears.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, commonly known as Rock by his teammates, was in the
lineup for the game Monday night, facing Pittsburgh's Kris Benson.
With the count of 2 balls and 1 strike, Benson threw a belt-high
fastball _ the type of pitch Raines once feasted on, as in 1986,
when he led the National League in hitting with a .334 average.
Raines fouled the ball straight back and accepted this as a sign
that it probably was a good time to retire. He struck out on the
next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He told a few teammates, Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill and Tino
Martinez, of his plan to retire, but most of the others were
oblivious to his intentions. Raines was not in the lineup for
Tuesday night's game, and he sat in the dugout, looked around and
absorbed the experience. It was a perfect setting for his last
game, he thought, a beautiful evening for baseball. He loved
playing on nights like this.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning that night, the Yankees were losing to
Toronto, 8-3, and Torre turned and asked Raines if he wanted to
pinch-hit. Raines declined, the first time he could remember
turning down an opportunity to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to turn down the at-bat, something had to be wrong,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raines returned to his locker after the game, sat and savored
the moments. He broke into the majors with the Expos in 1979, when
Willie McCovey and Gaylord Perry were still in the National League,
when Jeter was 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   While a rising star in 1982, Raines entered drug rehabilitation.
His first child, Tim Raines Jr., was 2 years old and Raines felt
his choices were clear-cut. He was an example, he said Thursday ,
of someone from a small town who made a bad decision to begin using
drugs in a big city. ``It never should've happened in the first
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many addicts, Raines recovered his life, playing another
17 seasons, with a career that nearly overlapped with that of his
son. Tim Raines Jr. has played two years in Baltimore's minor
league system and may reach the majors in another two years, and
father and son had dreamed of playing together in the big leagues.
But the father had called the son earlier this week to tell him he
was retiring, and the son said he was proud.
</P>
<P>
   Raines joined the Yankees in 1996, his joyous personality making
him a favorite among teammates. Even in the worst of days, in the
most miserable of slumps, Raines seemed to find humor. He was
perhaps the only person, teammates said, who could tease the
intense O'Neill during a bad game and make O'Neill smile just a
little.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the ability to have a lot of fun,'' O'Neill said.
``Certain guys represent the personality of a team, and he was one
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines intended to tell the rest of his teammates about his
decision this morning, but was delayed by traffic on Interstate 4
and arrived late. (``If you're not retiring, then you're fined,''
Torre said, joking).
</P>
<P>
   But he told them in a meeting and he was attacked with hugs. He
and O'Neill had always done paper-rock-scissors to see who would
retrieve a ball to play catch before batting practice, and for
old-time's sake, they did it again, Raines prevailing, O'Neill
whipping his head around in mock fury.
</P>
<P>
   Raines threw out the first ball before Thursday's exhibition,
surrounded by the other eight position players, and each hugged him
again, Jeter the last. Raines had been his favorite teammate, ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the best,'' Jeter said into his friend's ear.
</P>
<P>
   Raines walked off, without falling tears, his eyes glistening.  &QL;

EDITORIAL: A WISE RULING ON STUDENT ACTIVITIES FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, March 24:
</P>
<P>
   By a surprisingly lopsided margin, the Supreme Court this week
rejected an effort by conservative Christian law students to
prevent the use of their student activities fees to support groups
whose views they find objectionable. The 9-0 decision against the
students was a ringing and heartening affirmation of the right of
universities to establish forums for the free exchange of
contending ideas as part of the educational process. It also dealt
at least a temporary setback to groups intent on ``defunding the
left'' and on pushing universities in a more conservative
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The suit had been brought against the University of Wisconsin by
three students who objected that mandatory student fees collected
by the university were being used in part to support groups that
espoused gay rights, women's rights, environmental action and other
liberal causes with which they disagreed. The students argued that
using their money for such purposes violated their own First
Amendment rights of free speech and free association. A federal
district court and a federal appeals court found in favor of the
students, relying on Supreme Court precedents in other areas that
that court has now judged to be irrelevant to this case.
</P>
<P>
   In overturning the appellate ruling, Justice Anthony Kennedy
made a compelling case for the importance of a free and open
exchange of ideas among students in higher education. He noted that
the hundreds of student organizations at the University of
Wisconsin include a wide range of views, and that it is thus
inevitable that part of the student fee money goes to support
speech and activities that some students will find objectionable or
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   But the overriding point is that a university has the right to
determine that its mission is well served by having students engage
in vigorous philosophic, religious, scientific, social and
political discussion in their extracurricular activities. If a
university reaches that conclusion, Kennedy said, ``it is entitled
to impose a mandatory fee to sustain an open dialogue to these
ends,'' provided the money is given out under neutral criteria that
do not favor some viewpoints over others.
</P>
<P>
   The court did take issue with a minor element of the Wisconsin
system, a method of determining whether to finance or withhold
funds from student organizations through a referendum of the
student body. The court rightly worried that such referendums might
allow majority views to suppress minority views, and it asked the
appeals court to examine that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's ruling on student fees covers only public
colleges and universities, but it ought to serve as a guideline for
similar struggles at private institutions as well. Unfettered
debate is the hallmark of any great university, whether it is
public or private in nature.

KATHARINE WASHBURN, 57, EDITOR KNOWN FOR POETRY ANTHOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Katharine Washburn, an essayist, editor, anthologist
and translator whose legacy includes a cornucopia of verse from the
dawn of civilization to the present, died March 22 at her home in
Brooklyn. She was 57.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent cause was a heart attack, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn was editor, with John S. Major, of ``World Poetry: An
Anthology of Verse From Antiquity to Our Time'' (W.W. Norton,
1998), an updated and expanded version of Mark Van Doren's 1928
``Anthology of World Poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1,338 pages, including the index, the volume contains 1,600
poems ranging over more than 4,000 years, from ancient Sumer and
Egypt to the late 20th century. The editors organized it in eight
chronological parts from the Bronze Age forward, with each section
subdivided by language.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the poems were translated into English for the anthology
by other poets. Its English-language verse sampled the best from
Chaucer to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn herself translated poetry from classical and modern
European languages. Among her earlier work was a 1986 translation
from the German of poems by Paul Celan (North Point, 1986). At her
death, she was working on a novel, ``The Translator's Apology.''
</P>
<P>
   She was co-editor of ``Dumbing Down: Essays on the Strip Mining
of American Culture'' (Norton, 1996). It presented the worried
views of observers from many vantage points of the present state of
American life, art and thought.
</P>
<P>
   She co-edited ``Tongues of Angels, Tongues of Man: A Book of
Sermons'' (Doubleday, 1999). It was filled with the ringing words
of preachers addressing the vagaries of the world, from the Sermon
on the Mount to Savonarola's contempt for the vanities of
Renaissance Florence to the anti-Nazi defiance of the theologian
Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn was a graduate of Pembroke-Brown University and earned
an M.A. at Columbia University, where she also received a Ph.D. in
classical Greek. In the 1980s she was on the editorial staff of the
Book-of-the-Month Club, and her articles appeared in The New York
Times Book Review, Partisan Review, Parnassus and New Republic,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Sherwood; her parents, Calman
Winegarden of Toledo, Ohio, and Margaret Winegarden of Rochester; a
sister, Mary Hoyle of San Francisco; and three sons, Andrew,
Michael and Will, of Brooklyn.

<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The Kentucky Derby campaign looks a little
different after Sunday's San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita. It
sounds a little different, too.
</P>
<P>
   If San Felipe winner Fusaichi Pegasus goes on to win the May 6
Kentucky Derby, he'll be the first champion with a foreign-language
name since 1982 (Gato del Sol) and perhaps the most mispronounced
since the first in 1875 (Aristides, properly said as
air-is-TIE-dees).
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi is pronounced foo-saw-EE-chee. It's a combination of
his Tokyo-based owner's name, Fusao Sekiguchi, and ichi-ban, which
is Japanese for ``No. 1.'' Sekiguchi, a retired high-tech
executive, names many of his horses in that fashion, including 1996
Japan Derby winner Fusaichi Concorde.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to the name. Fusaichi Pegasus is indeed No. 1 in most
3-year-old rankings and deservedly so after his deceptively narrow
three-quarter-length victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby picture came into focus as Fusaichi Pegasus came to
the wire with Kent Desormeaux on the cruise control, The Deputy
under Chris McCarron's whip to keep up, and Anees a respectable
third.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, two of the season's major players hadn't been
tested: Anees, the 2-year-old champion, who was making his first
start since winning the Breeders' Cup Juvenile in November; and
Fusaichi Pegasus, the $4 million yearling who hadn't faced
stakes-quality competition while winning two of his first three
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus looked like a million bucks, at least, in the
paddock, and was in command on the track in the deepest 3-year-old
race of 2000. The performance placed the son of Mr. Prospector and
a Danzig mare at the top of the list of those who have displayed
the ability to win the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Charismatic, the one-time claimer, didn't emerge as a
classic-caliber colt until April, following a lackluster fourth-
place finish in the Santa Anita Derby with a victory in the
Lexington Stakes two weeks before the Kentucky Derby. But that kind
of career arc is rare for a Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   Almost always, the eventual Derby winner has proved his quality
before the final round of major preps, which this year include the
April 8 Santa Anita Derby and the April 15 Blue Grass at Keeneland
and Wood Memorial at Aqueduct.
</P>
<P>
   Based on who's beaten whom, by how much and how quickly, this is
the Kentucky Derby ``A'' list (in no particular order): Fusaichi
Pegasus; WarChant, trainer Neil Drysdale's !ital!other colt; Anees;
Mighty, the stretch-running Louisiana Derby winner; Captain Steve,
the Bob Baffert-trained Hollywood Futurity winner, and The Deputy,
the Irish-bred Santa Catalina winner.
</P>
<P>
   The ``B'' list: Hal's Hope, trained by octogenerian Hal Rose,
and HighYield, from the D. Wayne Lukas barn, 1-2 finishers in a
low-rated Florida Derby; Surfside, Lukas' dominant filly; Red
Bullet, the Gotham winner at Aqueduct; Aptitude, Bobby Frankel's
lightly raced Gotham runnerup; Acres, a freak at Laurel but a
troubled sixth in the Gotham; Archer City Slew, the San Vicente
sprint winner; Chief Seattle, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile runnerup
now based in Dubai; Frankel-trained Cocky, who hung around for
third in the San Rafael; Commendable, the Lukas-Bob Lewis colt
who'll have to pull a Charismatic; Lukas-trained Exchange Rate, who
beat Mighty in their Louisiana Derby prep, and More Than Ready, who
couldn't hold on at 1 1/16 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Anita Derby field shapes up as Anees, Captain Steve,
Cocky, Surfside, The Deputy and War Chant. Fusaichi Pegasus is
going to the Wood or Blue Grass.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hello, Dubai: Saturday's $6 million Dubai World Cup _ the
planet's richest horse race _ has drawn nine U.S. jockeys and
nearly as many American horses to Nad Al Sheba racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 14 horses entered for the 1 1/4-mile race are Behrens
(Jorge Chavez), Malek (Alex Solis), Puerto Madero (Laffit Pincay),
Ecton Park (Chris McCarron), Public Purse (Corey Nakatani), Saint's
Honor (Kent Desormeaux), Running Stag (Shane Sellers), Strudel Fitz
(John Velasquez) and Dubai-based 1999 Kentucky Derby runner Worldly
Manner (Jerry Bailey).
</P>
<P>
   Dubai Millennium (Frankie Dettori), a 4-year-old son of Seeking
the Gold who has won seven of eight starts in Dubai, England and
France, is the local favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Anita will take bets this afternoon and Saturday morning
on the World Cup. It's scheduled for about 9:30 a.m. Pacific time.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Only Pincay is expected back from the United
Arab Emirates in time to ride Sunday at Santa Anita in the $150,000
Santa Ana Handicap for fillies and mares. Pincay rides Virginie,
with whom he teamed to win the Beverly Hills last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Happyanunoit, the Matriarch winner, assigned a race-high 121 for
the Santa Ana at 1 miles on turf, will be ridden as usual by Brice
Blanc. But most of the field will have new riders.
</P>
<P>
   __ Antley off: Jockey Chris Antley told Santa Anita stewards he
won't compete again until April while he clears away off-the-track
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   It's more evidence that Antley, who has done well in the stock
market and can live without his racetrack income, has trouble
staying focused on his job.
</P>
<P>
   Steward Tom Ward said the rider of 1999 Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner Charismatic reported no personal problems in a
Thursday morning meeting. Antley wasn't tested for drugs after
taking off his mounts on short notice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Ward said Antley acknowledged trouble making weight since
returning from a break, during which he had knee surgery, following
the Breeders' Cup in November. He has ridden three winners in 30
starts at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The 34-year-old said he plans to continue exercising horses at
Santa Anita. He'll be replaced by Garrett Gomez aboard San Vicente
winner Archer City Slew in the $600,000 Spiral Stakes (formerly the
Jim Beam) at Turfway Park in Kentucky on Saturday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SANTA ANITA LEADERS &QL; 
Jockeys (through Wednesday): Corey Nakatani, 59 wins; Kent
Desormeaux, 53; Laffit Pincay, 48; Alex Solis, 41; Victor Espinoza,
41. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 27; Bill Spawr, 21; Bobby Frankel and
Ron McAnally, 18; Vladimir Cerin, 16. &QL; 
PINCAY WATCH &QL; 
All-time wins leader Laffit Pincay increased his total to 8,894
with a pair of victories Wednesday at Santa Anita. Pincay is in
Dubai to ride Puerto Madero in the $6 million Dubai World Cup on
Saturday but is scheduled to return in time to ride Virginie in the
Santa Ana Handicap on Sunday. &QL; 
ON THE STAKES SCHEDULE &QL; 
At Santa Anita: Saturday, $75,000 San Pedro Stakes, 3-year-olds, 6
1/2 furlongs; Sunday, $150,000 Santa Ana Handicap, fillies and
mares 4 and up, 1 1/8 miles on turf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Golden Gate Fields: Wednesday, $125,000 Berkeley Handicap,
3-year-olds and up, 1 mile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Turfway Park, Florence, Ky.: Saturday, $600,000 Spiral
Stakes, 3-year-olds, 1 miles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Fair Grounds, New Orleans: Sunday, $600,000 Explosive
Bid, 4-year-olds and up, 1 miles on turf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
Santa Anita is promoting ``50 Cent Fridays'' for the rest of the
season. Parking, general admission, soft drinks and hot dogs will
cost 50 cents. . . . With Pat Day committed to Surfside in the
April 8 Santa Anita Derby, Victor Espinoza has been named to ride
Cat Thief in the Oaklawn Park Handicap in Arkansas the same day. .
. . Bob Baffert said 2-year-old fillies champion Chilukki will get
a rest after her weak performance in the Fair Grounds Oaks. . . .
After Sonny Hine died of cancer at age 69 last week in Florida,
Carolyn Hine said she will sell the couple's horses. Sonny was best
known for training 1998 Horse of the Year Skip Away, owned by
Carolyn. He also trained 1981 champion sprinterGuilty Conscience. .
. . Jorge Chavez led the jockeys for the second straight year and
Bill Mott topped the trainers for the seventh time in eight years
at the Gulfstream Park meet that ended last week. Attendance
declined 4 percent. . . . Santa Anita Handicapwinner General
Challenge remained No. 1 in the NTRA media poll. He breezed 5
furlongs in 59 seconds on Wednesday to stay on target for the April
9 San Bernardino Handicap. . . . Bay Meadows' season ends Sunday
and San Francisco Bay Area racing moves to Golden Gate Fields
starting Wednesday. . . . Del Mar released a $6.1 million stakes
schedule for its July 26 to Sept. 13 meet, including the $1 million

<P>
   &LR; VANCOUVER _ Another night, another crucial game for the Mighty
Ducks, who should know the drill well by now. After all, they've
been fighting for their playoff lives for weeks now.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, ninth-place Anaheim (31-32-12-2) takes on 10th-place
Vancouver (26-34-14-8). The Ducks hope to end a Canadian losing
streak at seven games and possibly move back into a tie for the
eighth spot in a Western Conference playoff race that seemingly
becomes more muddled every day. Heading into Thursday's play only
seven points separated seven teams battling for the final five
postseason berths.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tired flock: It was an exhausted group of Ducks who arrived
in British Columbia early Thursday morning after beating the Kings
Tuesday night in Los Angeles and losing in Edmonton on Wednesday
after overnight plane flight. But Ducks coach Craig Hartsburg said
nobody should be complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be exciting for everybody to be playing in these big
games,'' he said. ``You want to be involved and play in these types
of situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a day to rest our minds and bodies. These are like
playoff games, so this should be easy if you want to win and be the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks are in the midst of playing eight games in 13 days and
four in six nights before getting five days off next week to rest
up for the final five games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a lot of games in a short period of time, but
we have to find the energy,'' said Anaheim defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky. ``There is no time to feel sorry for ourselves. If we
keep focused, we will be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Limited success: The Ducks are a combined 1-5-2 versus their
next two opponents _ 0-1-2 against Vancouver and 1-4 versus the
Phoenix Coyotes, who they play on Sunday at The Pond.
</P>
<P>
   However, Anaheim is a combined 7-0-3 against Nashville, Chicago
and the Kings, the teams they play in the final five games of the
season. Ducks are 2-0 against the Predators, 2-0-2 versus the Kings
and 3-0-1 versus Chicago. Anaheim plays Nashville and Los Angeles
twice and Chicago once.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OPENS INQUIRY OF WHITE HOUSE E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (CHANGES, updates, additions throughout)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department has begun a criminal
investigation into whether White House officials illegally
suppressed large numbers of e-mail messages subpoenaed in
investigations of Clinton administration campaign fund raising and
other activities, documents filed in federal court disclosed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking into accusations that White House
officials threatened employees of a non-government contractor if
they disclosed that the messages were missing, according to the
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry by the Justice Department's campaign finance unit
started after Republicans accused the White House of concealing
private electronic communications sought by investigators in
Congress, the Justice Department, and the Independent Counsel's
Office. The investigators wanted White House e-mail messages
dealing with campaign fund raising, Monica Lewinsky and other
matters. The attempts to obtain the electronic messages date as far
back as 1996 in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's filing in U.S. District Court here,
which declared the department's intentions of carrying out the
investigation, said nothing about the contents of the e-mail
messages. But in the court papers the department contends a
criminal investigation is justified because of the possibility that
some of the messages may have been relevant to the investigations
and may have been deliberately concealed.
</P>
<P>
   The papers also refer to earlier documents filed in a civil suit
in which employees of Northrop Grumman, the company hired to
maintain the system, say that they had been pressured to remain
silent about the missing messages.
</P>
<P>
   Two computer specialists working for Northrop Grumman have
testified before Congress and said in depositions that they were
threatened with jail by White House officials if they disclosed a
glitch in the system that would make it difficult, if not
impossible, to ever retrieve any messages. The two workers said the
threats were made in June 1998 amid the furor of the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have denied there was any attempt to avoid
compliance with subpoenas and said that the problem was an
inadvertent computer glitch caused by malfunctioning systems that
failed to properly store all electronic messages written to
presidential aides from outside the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one attempted to hide responsive information from this
committee or any other investigative body,'' Beth Nolan, the White
House counsel, said in a statement she had been scheduled to
deliver Thursday at a hearing on the e-mail controversy before the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. Her appearance was
postponed until next week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also denied threatening anyone in connection
with the e-mail messages but acknowledged an effort to keep the
problem of the missing messages from becoming public.
</P>
<P>
   Although it had been known for weeks that the e-mail messages
were missing, Thursday's opening of a criminal inquiry raised the
seriousness of the issue. It quickly spread into the presidential
campaign, where Vice President Al Gore has already come under
attack by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for his campaign
fund-raising tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The content of the missing messages related to Gore is unknown,
but White House officials said that the computer server in his
office had a separate problem that might have caused e-mail
messages there not to be recorded properly.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida for a fund-raising reception, Bush commented on the
e-mail controversy. ``This is a White House that needs to let the
sun shine in when it comes to campaign funding allegations,'' he
said. ``I look forward to seeing where these e-mails are, what was
in those e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear what, if any, sensitive information is
contained in the thousands of e-mail messages in question. One of
the contractor's workers on the computer system, Betty Lambuth, has
testified that a colleague told her they were full of evidence
dealing with the Lewinsky controversy and a variety of other
investigations, including Gore's fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   But the colleague, Robert Haas, denied Thursday at a hearing of
the Government Reform and Oversight Committee that he had any idea
what was on the e-mail messages. The chairman of the committee is
Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind..
</P>
<P>
   Haas said he did search the e-mail accounts of several White
House aides to determine whether any messages from Lewinsky had not
been stored properly. He said he found numerous such e-mail
messages, which he turned over to superiors, but White House
officials said all of them had been discovered by other means and
sent along to the office of Kenneth Starr, then the Independent
Counsel.

</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department review was disclosed Thursday in legal
documents filed by the department's civil division, which is
defending the White House in the lawsuit over the e-mail. The suit
was filed by a frequent White House antagonist, Judicial Watch. The
civil division has asked Judge Royce C. Lambeth of U.S. District
Court to postpone consideration of the civil case pending the
outcome of the criminal inquiry. Robert Ray, who replaced Starr as
the independent counsel, agreed with the Justice Department's
request.
</P>
<P>
   In the government's legal papers, Robert J. Conrad Jr., the head
of the Justice Department's campaign finance unit, known internally
as the Task Force, said that prosecutors had recently learned of
the accusations by the contractor related to the malfunctioning
automated records system.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result of these allegations,'' Conrad said, ``the Task
Force has begun an investigation into whether subpoenas issued'' to
the executive office of the president by the Task Force ``were
fully complied with and whether persons were threatened with
retaliation in order to prevent the existence of the affected
e-mails from becoming known to the Task Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad did not indicate whether prosecutors had reached any
conclusions about the e-mail issue. Other law-enforcement officials
said Thursday that investigators had not determined the content of
the missing e-mail or established whether anyone intentionally
tried to suppress it.
</P>
<P>
   At the congressional hearing Thursday, a panel of Northrop
Grumman contractors who were hired to maintain the White House
computer system said the problem was caused when a server was
mislabeled ``MAIL2'' instead of ``Mail2.'' That simple error in
capitalization caused e-mail messages not to be recorded properly
for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors said they had fixed the problem so that all
incoming e-mail messages are now recorded in a form that makes them
searchable. But they have yet to find a way of searching through
all the e-mail messages from September 1996 to Nov. 20, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Barry, a White House computer specialist, said he first
discovered a problem in January 1998 when he found that some e-mail
messages from Lewinsky, who was working at the Pentagon, to a White
House aide, Ashley Raines, had not been properly recorded by the
computer server. He said he filed a routine incident report.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, contractors realized that the problem was more
serious. All the incoming e-mail received by about 500 White House
officials were not being picked up by the Automated Records
Management System, which is the system used to search computer
records by code words to determine whether they comply with
subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Top White House officials learned of the computer problem almost
immediately. On June 18, 1998, Virginia M. Apuzzo, assistant to the
president for management and administration, wrote a memorandum
describing the glitch to John D. Podesta, who was White House
deputy chief of staff at the time but has since become chief of
staff. Charles Ruff, who was White House counsel at the time, was
also notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically had two choices,'' said Burton. ``They could
face up to the problem _ tell the Justice Department and Congress
what happened _ and get it fixed. Or they could throw a blanket
over the whole problem, ignore it and hope nobody found out.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House says it did not cover up the problem but
believed that it had been resolved without affecting the
administration's response to subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the counsel's office knew in June 1998 that a
configuration error had existed, it believed that the problem was
fixed and did not, until recently, understand the scope and
possible effect on e-mail records searches of this error,'' Nolan
said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Nolan said she had discussed the problem with
various people investigating the White House. She briefed Ray's
office, and also provided information to Ralph I. Lancaster Jr.,
the independent counsel investigating Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's Campaign Finance Task Force contacted
the White House on March 10, Nolan said. The White House provided a
written explanation to prosecutors on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said she has directed Charles Easley, associate director
of the Office of Administration's Security Division, to investigate
whether any contractors had been threatened by White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Hass testified Thursday that Laura Crabtree Callahan, a former
White House computer specialist, had told him that there would be a
jail cell with his name on it if he talked to anyone about the
problem. Two contractors who were at the same meeting recalled the
conversation but two others said they did not recall the jail
remark.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan and Mark Lindsay, who served as general counsel and
then director of the Office of administration, denied Thursday that
they had tried to cover up the matter or had threatened the
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not threaten anyone,'' Callahan said. ``I advised them
of the standard procedures for handling sensitive situations.''

2 BROKERAGES SETTLE WITH NEW YORK STATE ON BIAS COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ending a three-year inquiry into accusations of
racism and sexual harassment at Wall Street firms, the New York
state attorney general announced a settlement with two affiliated
brokerages Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage firms, Garban LLC and Garvin Guy Butler, agreed to
pay a $200,000 fine and agreed to allow employees _ even some whose
legal claims had expired under the statute of limitations _ to
recover lost pay and damages in state-monitored arbitration,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's investigation began in 1997 shortly after
three female employees filed separate complaints accusing the
companies of sexual and racial discrimination that dated back to
1984.
</P>
<P>
   The original plaintiffs, Donna Weber, Suzanne Taylor-Bernstein
and Toni Oliveri, all worked at the company's offices at 120
Broadway in Lower Manhattan. They maintained that supervisors
condoned or were involved in making racist, anti-gay and harassing
comments and made unwanted sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
   The workers also charged that their supervisors retaliated
against them for making complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints contended that pornographic material was
regularly displayed on computer screens and walls on the company's
trading floor. It also said that pornographic magazines were often
in open view on desks.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints said that company meetings were often held in
strip clubs like Scores, and one complaint said that at a Christmas
party, the company hired two female strippers who performed sexual
acts on each other in front of the employees.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement could lead to significant punitive damages,
because it would allow the complaints of discrimination to be taken
to independent mediation instead of going to industry arbitration,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry arbitration panels are generally dominated by older
white men and have been criticized as being too sympathetic to
brokerage managers, particularly in matters relating to sex and
race discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case should send a strong message to all of Wall Street
that we will not tolerate an old boys' club or frat house
atmosphere in the workplace,'' said the state attorney general,
Eliot L. Spitzer. ``It is wrong, it is discriminatory and it is
illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which ends a three-year investigation by the
attorney general's civil rights bureau, must be approved by a judge
in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Telephone calls to officials from Garban and Garvin Guy Butler
in New York and England were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer called the settlement ``an important step toward
ensuring that women and minorities are treated equally on Wall
Street'' and said that at least 31 current and former employees
could recover lost pay and benefits, as well as lawyers' fees and
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The two firms have about 600 employees combined. If the current
and former employees choose to take their cases to arbitration,
they are precluded from filing state or federal lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints by the three women were settled individually
shortly after the attorney general filed suit, law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard J. Schulman, the lawyer for Oliveri, said that like most
brokers at the firms, she signed an agreement when she was hired
that precluded her from filing a lawsuit and forced her to accept
the decision of a panel from the National Association of Securities
Dealers. Schulman said Oliveri was the first to file her
complaints. The other two women testified at her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Schulman said that Oliveri won an undisclosed judgment from the
NASD panel, but that the other two women settled, also for
undisclosed amounts, because ``they saw the tough time my client
was given.''

THE NET AT WHAT PRICE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Repeating)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States Supreme Court deeply honors its
traditions, but Lawrence Lessig, a clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia,
found one of them just too onerous to stomach. There was simply no
reason, Lessig felt, for the court to keep using an archaic
word-processing system like Atex.
</P>
<P>
   And so, working with several other clerks, Lessig used his
computer skills to install new software and write programs to meet
the special needs of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lessig's grasp of software could have a far bigger impact
on the Supreme Court _ and on the future of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Now a 38-year-old Harvard law professor, Lessig has become one
of the most prominent commentators on law and cyberspace, thanks to
his academic writing, a column in the trendy magazine The Industry
Standard and a new -- and largely pessimistic -- book about the
future of privacy and free speech on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's chief message is aimed at those who view the Internet
as some kind of democratic wonderland, a place of unfettered free
speech, business competition and creativity. Set the euphoria
aside, he warns. Government and industry are already stripping
privacy, free speech and other liberties from the Internet in order
to suit the needs of online commmerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to believe that the grounding for liberty
in cyberspace will simply emerge,'' he said. ``Quite the opposite
is the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessig's profile has risen lately because of the respect he has
won from one man in particular: Thomas Penfield Jackson, the judge
presiding over the Microsoft antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual move late last year, Jackson asked Lessig to
provide guidance on one of the government's most important charges:
that Microsoft improperly merged its Web browser into the Windows
operating system. Lessig turned in a a 45-page brief that,
according to analysts, lays out a strategy for how Jackson can rule
against Microsoft and survive any appellate reviews.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft and the US Justice Department made their final
court arguments on Feb. 22, Jackson asked several questions that
showed that the Harvard professor's arguments are already part of
his deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence Lessig's issues are the live issues of the day,''
said Thane Scott, who heads the antitrust practice at the Boston
law firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge. ``He's at the confluence of big money
and big government, and there's no thinker quite at the top of the
pyramid like him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, Lessig's goal was not just to comment on law but
to shape it as a politician. The son of a Pennsylvania steel plant
owner, the young Ronald Reagan fan headed the state's Republican
teen group. In 1980, he was elected a delegate to the GOP national
convention. While an undergraduate at the University of
Pennsylvania, he managed a campaign for the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, Lessig describes himself as a liberal. ``That
doesn't mean I'm any less skeptical of what government does,'' he
said recenlty by phone from Berlin, where is on sabbatical. ``I'm
concerned about the protection of individual rights.'' He decided
Democrats were more devoted to protecting those liberties than
Republicans. His politics made for lively debates when he clerked
for the famously conservative Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of battles at times. . . But it was great fun,''
Lessig recalled. ``There are obviously some issues we disagreed on,
but it was a lot of fun working with someone who took seriously
trying to get to the right answer.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1989 graduate of Yale Law School, Lessig also clerked for
Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Chicago. Now both men now have a special role in the Microsoft
case, with Posner working at Jackson's request to negotiate a
settlement between the company and the government. Lessig said he
had talked to Posner about Microsoft during an earlier case but not
since either man was pulled into the current trial.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig drew attention as a specialist in the new field of
cyberlaw in the mid-1990s, when he was teaching the subject at the
University of Chicago. His new book, ``Code and Other Laws of
Cyberspace,'' is only boosting his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The book is partly a rejoinder to the popular view that any
attempts to regulate the Internet will fail because the network is
so vast that no government can control it.
</P>
<P>
   The notion was famously summed up by Internet theorist John
Perry Barlow in a 1996 declaration of Internet freedom:
``Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh
and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind . . . You
are not welcome among us. You have no sovereignty where we
gather.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lessig notes that the Internet is made up of software, and
software writers make deliberate choices about whether or not to
build anonymity, privacy, open access and free speech into the
online experience. As the Net evolves to suit the demands of
commerce, he argues, software writers and government will make
going online a more stifling journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frustrated me that people thought (civil liberties) would
just take care of themselves,'' Lessig said. ``What motivated me to
write the book was to get people to understand that there was
something to defend here.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, Congress has passed a broad law that makes it
illegal to build devices or software that defeat copyright
protections. And courts have used that law to rule against computer
users, even though they were not using the devices to make illegal
copies of tapes or movies. One set of defendants in a recent case
merely wanted to play DVD movies on their Linux computers, Lessig
said, which cannot play the discs without overriding copyright
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig sees these developments as early steps toward a world
where movies, books and music are controlled even more than today.
Currently, a person who buys a book or CD can read it over and over
again or loan it to friends. But soon, Lessig predicts, people will
be charged every time they read a piece of text, or copy it, or
each time they listen to a piece of music.
</P>
<P>
   And just as they regulate copyrights, government and business
will control who can go where online. Because businesses need to
identify their customers by age and home state, Lessig predicts
that people will be encouraged to carry a ``digital ID'' with them
online, possibly built into their Web browsers. It may not be
illegal to go online without an ID, but people who fail to carry
one will be barred from so many Web sites that most will comply.
</P>
<P>
   When digital IDs become pervasive, companies and the government
will be able to control who can do what online. ``Cyberspace would
go from being an unregulable space to, depending on the depth of
the (digital ID) certificates in the space, the most regulable
space imaginable,'' Lessig writes. And because nations will enforce
each other's laws, people will find it impossible to evade the law
by operating overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig has been writing about the online world for several
years, but he has no idea how he came to Judge Jackson's attention.
He almost tossed out Jackson's request for help, thinking it was
one of the thank-you notes that judges send to professors who
recommend potential clerks. ``But it was the wrong timing'' for
that kind of note, Lessig said, and so he opened it.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief, Lessig urged Jackson not to be afraid to
scrutinize the way Microsoft designs its software. Courts regularly
rule on the design of drugs, tires and other products in antitrust
cases, but somehow they are timid when it comes to software, Lessig
said. ``I believe it is a mistake to fetishize code in this way,''
he wrote, adding that software is too important to society for
courts to turn away.
</P>
<P>
   Lessig then took up the government's argument that Microsoft
illegally ``bolted'' its Web browser to its Windows operating
system. The government says Microsoft combined the two products so
that customers would have no reason to use browsers from a rival
company, Netscape Communications Corp. And if Netscape disappeared,
the government says, customers would lose out on the benefits of
competition between browser makers.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say the government's argument is weak. They
point to a 1998 federal appeals court decision in a prior Microsoft
case that seemed to say the company could tie the browser to
Windows as long as consumers benefitted in some way.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief, Lessig told Jackson that under the appeals court's
test, the government's charge would fail. But he offered a new
standard under which judges could look not only at whether
consumers benefit from a company's design decisions, as the appeals
court dictated, but also balance that against any possible harms.
</P>
<P>
   Without saying so explicitly, Lessig was warning Jackson he
would be overturned on appeal if he found that consumers gained no
benefit at all from a combined browser-operating system, said
William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington University in
Washington, who has followed the case closely.
</P>
<P>
   ``For somebody who is not a witness, for someone who is truly an
outsider, those 45 pages represent a big contribution'' to the
case, Kovacic said.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Lessig says he is not optimistic about the nation's
ability to focus on how the Internet is changing and to debate
which civil liberties to protect. ``I would be grateful to be
proven wrong,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   But he does have one suggestion: Publish the software code that
controls the Net so that everyone can see it, and prevent it from
being owned and kept secret by companies.
</P>
<P>
   A move to this so-called open source software would make it
easier for people to find ways to remain anonymous or express
themselves freely. Government and industry would find it harder to
build regulations into the software of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments like that have won Lessig a big following in some
parts of the software industry. ``He's a hero of mine,'' said
Robert Young, chairman of Red Hat Inc., a provider of the open
source Linux software. ``His gift is to take complex technology
issues and simplify them so they can be explained to the general
citizenship, and that's very helpful.''

NEW CAMPUS HIGH: ILLICIT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Unlike the typical array of drugs available to
college students looking to get high, the only thing illegal about
those that killed Josh Doroff, a Trinity College senior, last week
was that Doroff got them without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   The lethal combination he took _ a cocktail of Xanax, Valium,
butalbital and sleeping pills, among other drugs _ may have been
extreme, but the abuse of prescription drugs is an increasingly
common form of drug abuse for college and high school students
across the country, according to drug experts around the country
and dozens of students interviewed at eight universities in the
Northeast this week.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is stimulants like Ritalin, Aderol and Dexedrine;
painkillers like Percocet, Percodan and Vicodin; migraine pills
like butalbital; nerve relaxers like Xanax and Valium; or even
powerful antipsychotic agents like Thorazine, the nation's growing
list of prescribed drugs is finding its way out of medicine
cabinets and onto college campuses at a rate that is troubling to
many doctors and epidemiologists.
</P>
<P>
   Most college students, of course, do not take prescription drugs
illegally. But nearly all students interviewed said illicit
prescription drugs were available on campus. Students said they, or
people they know, typically took them to better concentrate on
homework or exams, to stay awake during long nights of drinking or,
by mixing them with other drugs, to find a yet-undiscovered high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it feels bad, it's just that it's something that feels
different,'' said Peter LaBier, an art major at Vassar College in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``There's just this urge with kids my age to
derange your senses.''
</P>
<P>
   One preliminary study last year on the illicit use of Ritalin,
conducted by psychiatrists at the University of Wisconsin, found
that a fifth of college students interviewed had taken the drug at
least once, and that many had tried any number of other
prescription drugs like Dexedrine, a stimulant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had reports of students walking about the library asking,
`Does anybody have any Dexedrine I can borrow tonight?''' said Dr.
Eric Heiligenstein, the psychiatrist who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Where students in previous eras relied on over-the-counter
stimulants like Vivarin, No-Doz or plain old coffee, more of
today's students favor spending as little as $2 to swallow, snort
or inject prescription drugs to study, stay awake or just feel
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people take Ritalin to study,'' said a female student
at Vassar who, like many students interviewed for this article,
refused to give her name. ``It makes you feel smart. And I think
good thoughts when I use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ferraro, a senior English major at Rutgers University in
New Brunswick, N.J., said he knew many students who got
prescription drugs illegally. ``Once you get bored with drug X,''
he said, ``you can try something new.''
</P>
<P>
   As reports grow of on-campus mixing and matching of prescription
drugs, and as more students like Doroff, from Harrison N.Y., die as
a result, school officials are struggling to learn how students are
acquiring and using these drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk about it in the air now,'' said Dr.
Marvin Geller, a psychologist at McCosh Health Center at Princeton
University. The increase in the illicit use of Ritalin and Aderol,
experts believe, corresponds to the huge increase in recent years
in the amounts of these drugs prescribed by doctors to treat
attention deficit and hyperactivity disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly for Ritalin and Aderol, just the sheer availability
of these drugs makes them a temptation,'' said Dr. Tom Clark, an
epidemiologist at Health and Addictions Research Inc., a nonprofit
organization in Boston. Among young people, he said, ``there seems
to be more indiscriminate pill popping.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of the increase in illegal use of Ritalin among
students, though still mostly anecdotal, parallels a more than
eightfold increase in the amount of methylphenidate, the drug's
active ingredient, manufactured between 1990 and this year,
according to data from the federal Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Oxycodon, the active agent in Percocet and its cousin, Percodan,
two painkillers popular among students, is 10 times as plentiful as
in 1990, DEA data shows.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ritalin was the most popular prescription drug on
Vassar's campus, LaBier, 19, said he had heard of students taking
potent drugs like Thorazine, a powerful antipsychotic that doctors
say makes most people feel terrible.
</P>
<P>
   Near Columbia University's campus, a 21-year-old student called
Ritalin pills ``the poor man's cocaine'' that when swallowed or
crushed and snorted, helped his friends either study or stay awake
during long nights of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people that do it all the time,'' said the
man, a Columbia senior. ``I saw my friends crush up 10 pills of
Ritalin and snort it. It's rampant here.''
</P>
<P>
   At New York University in Lower Manhattan, Ritalin and Aderol
are as common as marijuana, some students said. ``Ritalin makes
repetitive, boring tasks like cleaning your room seem fun,'' said
Josh Koenig, a 20-year-old drama major. ``I equate it in my mind
with a really strong cup of coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Plyshevsky, 21, a junior from New Milford, N.J.,
majoring in marketing at N.Y.U., said she used Ritalin obtained
from a friend with attention deficit disorder to get through her
midterms. ``It was actually fun to do the work,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton students interviewed this week said Percocet was
popular, especially in combination with marijuana. ``You sprinkle
it on your weed and smoke it,'' a Princeton senior said. ``Almost
everyone I know has tried it once or twice.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yale University in New Haven, Conn., several students
interviewed on Wednesday described Ritalin as somewhat passe, more
the province of their prep school days than of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here who didn't go to prep school think it's like
cocaine or something,'' said an 18-year-old Yale freshman who uses
Ritalin illegally. During exam week, another student said, the
demand for Ritalin increases and 20-milligram pills sell for $5.
</P>
<P>
   Several students interviewed attributed the abundance of Ritalin
on their campuses to its overprescription by doctors to treat
students, many of whom have taken the drug since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like an awful lot of people I know have been
diagnosed with ADD and have been prescribed either Ritalin or
Aderol,'' Koenig, the NYU drama student, said. ``So if they give
away a few of their pills, it's not a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Some students save painkillers they receive for injuries and use
or sell them to other students later, said Ferraro, the Rutgers
senior. ``It's hard to get them from a doctor,'' he said, ``but
some people know other people who can fill prescriptions. Like any
other drug, it's all about supply and demand.''
</P>
<P>
   At Vassar, a student said she often received at-large pleas for
Ritalin sent by other students over the school's e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   To epidemiologists who study drug trends in children and young
adults, the prescription drug boom among college students, while
alarming, is not surprising. Americans, after all, have never been
more medicated than they are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 65 and you're averaging about three prescription
medications,'' said James Rothenberger, an instructor at the
University of Minnesota's School of Public of Health. ``Once you
hit 75, you're up to four or five.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, the epidemiologist in Boston, said the pharmaceutical
buildup might have sparked a ``supply-side'' problem at college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so accepted,'' he said, ``that they might be spilling
over into the idea that we can chemically alter our bodies on a
whim.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among 12th graders nationwide, the use of barbiturates and
nonheroin narcotics like cough suppressants, anti-diarrhetics and
painkillers has doubled since 1992, said Dr. Lloyd Johnston, the
author of ``Monitoring the Future,'' an annual report on adolescent
drug use nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of illicit prescription drug use also
corresponds with increases in the popularity of so-called club
drugs, like ecstasy and gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, an odorless
and tasteless but potent sedative, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing this increase in club drugs virtually across the
country,'' said Dr. Alan I. Leshner, director of the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, a federal agency in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if there is any comfort in the rising illegal use of
prescription drugs, it may be that at the least their users know
what they are getting, Rothenberger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you want someone taking a street drug, or would you
rather have them taking Ritalin that they've stolen from someone's
prescription?'' he asked rhetorically in a telephone interview on
Wednesday. ``If you're stealing from your little brother or sister,
at least you're getting a pure product.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger is greatest for students who feel compelled to mix
different drugs, as Doroff did at Trinity College last week. Police
investigators said he had combined prescription drugs with alcohol
and possibly heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the overdoses are extreme behavior problems,'' said
Dr. Henry Kranzler, a psychiatrist at the University of Connecticut
Health Center in Farmington.
</P>
<P>
   With prescription drug use, short-term risks _ overdoses, sexual
indiscretions and impaired driving _ are the greatest.
</P>
<P>
   ``What these kids don't know about these drugs,'' Kranzler said,
``is killing them.''  &QL;

AS ALBANY BUDGET DEADLINE NEARS, NO BUDGET IS WITHIN SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With eight days before the deadline for a new
state budget, Gov. George Pataki and leaders of the Legislature
remain divided over how much money is available to spend for the
coming year, making it all but certain that the budget will be late
for the 16th year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Republican-led state Senate and
Democratic-controlled Assembly are seeking significantly more money
than the $76.8 billion that the governor proposed in his budget
earlier this year. But the governor has said that he wants to keep
a tight lid on spending and has not signed on to the proposals of
either house.
</P>
<P>
   The three sides are so divided at this point that it is unclear
what will happen next. The two houses were scheduled to convene
conference committees a few weeks ago to work out their
differences. But that has not happened yet, spurring legislative
leaders from both houses to blame one another for the delay.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the negotiations could be held up by issues that
have little to do with the budget. For example, the Democratic
speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, wants money to build a
Second Avenue subway running the full length of Manhattan, and he
has said that there will be no budget unless he gets his way.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, though, Silver is seeking assurances from
Pataki, a Republican, that he will not try the kind of wholesale
vetoes he made in 1998, when the governor cut more than $1 billion
in programs, mostly Democratic, from the budget that the two houses
sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has refused to give such assurances, making Silver very
reluctant to pass a budget with Senate Republicans this year, lest
he leave Democrats vulnerable to another round of painful vetoes.
So far, Silver has refused to convene conference committees to work
out a detailed budget, a move that Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate
majority leader, has been demanding for some time.
</P>
<P>
   The main sticking point in the budget negotiations is coming up
with a spending figure that all three sides can agree on. The
Senate Republicans have proposed a spending plan that is $900
million larger than the governor's, not including $400 million in
tax cuts that they are seeking. The Assembly Democrats have
proposed a plan that is $1.8 billion above Pataki's.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has not said how much of an increase he is willing to
support. But people involved in the negotiations say he is willing
to consider up to $1 billion, something that may still be
unacceptable to Silver.
</P>
<P>
   Once an overall budget figure is reached, the two houses can
convene a conference committee to decide how the available money
should be spent. But that will create a new set of problems this
year, because the two houses have different spending priorities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Assembly Democrats are calling for a $1.3 billion
increase in state aid to schools, compared with the $900 million
that the Senate Republicans requested in their budget proposal. At
the same time, the $400 million in tax cuts that the Republicans
are proposing would severely restrict what can be spent on benefit
programs supported by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is due on April 1, the start of the new fiscal year.
As it did last year, the deadline brings a new wrinkle because of a
1988 law that calls for withholding state legislators' pay when a
state budget is late. But whether that will lead to a relatively
timely budget is unclear.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last year, the law fell far short of the result its supporters
desired: adoption of a budget on time. Instead, lawmakers adopted a
budget on Aug. 4, 126 days into the fiscal year, tying the record
for lateness.
</P>
<P>
   Before last year, the latest state budget was in 1997, also 126
days overdue, when the Assembly Democrats refused to negotiate
until Pataki and Bruno agreed to preserve the state's rent
stabilization laws.
</P>
<P>
   The budget was 104 days late in 1996, when Pataki refused to
enact a budget until the Legislature agreed to changes in the
state's workers' compensation law to save employers money.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats justify the spending increases they propose this
year by saying that the governor's budget underestimated the
state's revenue between now and the end of the next fiscal year by
$1.4 billion. It also overestimates expenses by $400 million, they
said, for a total difference of $1.8 billion. The Senate
Republicans argue that the governor underestimated the state's
revenue by $1 billion and overestimated expenses by $400 million,
for a total difference of $1.4 billion.

JEAN HOWARD, 89, HOUSE PHOTOGRAPHER FOR HOLLYWOOD'S GLAMOR SET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Howard, who rode the comet of her extraordinary beauty,
ethereal glamour and insouciant intelligence to become a Ziegfeld
girl, a Hollywood starlet, a legendary hostess and the house
photographer of the film colony, died at her home in Beverly Hills,
Calif., on March 20. She was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Howard's circle included Tyrone Power, Vivien Leigh, Laurence
Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Jennifer Jones, Merle
Oberon, Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Judy Garland
and Marilyn Monroe _ impressive company for the daughter of a
traveling salesman. She thrived in a bygone era when stars
socialized for purposes other than publicity, including simply
enjoying each other's company.
</P>
<P>
   They played croquet in matches that lasted years (with timeouts
for rest, refreshment and the occasional movie), played on
California beaches and hung out in Palm Beach, Palm Springs and the
south of France. They also mingled at Howard's Spanish-style home
on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills; she and her first
husband, Charles K. Feldman, who used his success as the first
super-agent to become a producer, bought it for $18,000 in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, Howard snapped pictures. One shows Gene Tierney,
then a top star at 20th Century Fox, in pigtails, looking longingly
into the handsome face of the mysterious millionaire Howard Hughes.
Another shows a tipsy Richard Burton kissing everyone in sight,
including a less-than-charmed Clifton Webb.
</P>
<P>
   Still another shows Dietrich almost touching heads with Ann
Warner, wife of Jack, the studio head, as they intensely discussed
never-to-be-known secrets over a smoky table at the Trocadero
nightclub in Los Angeles. Linda Christian can be seen being fitted
for her wedding gown to marry Tyrone Power.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these photographs were stored in shoe boxes. Meanwhile,
Howard studied photography and began to get assignments taking
pictures for magazines like Life and Vogue. Years later, the idea
coalesced to combine her snapshots and professional work in a
picture book.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Harry N. Abrams published ``Jean Howard's Hollywood: A
Photo Memoir.'' James Watters wrote the text, which is delivered
through Howard's first-person voice. The book evokes a lost world
where stars lived lives that were breathtakingly glamorous, but
still somehow life-sized.
</P>
<P>
   In the pictures, everyone, it seems, is smoking. Everyone is
holding a drink, everyone is dressed in black tie or cocktail
dress. People gather around the piano and sing. Conga lines end up
in swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``These photographs bring back memories of a time and a place
that have long since faded,'' Howard wrote in the book's
introduction. ``Hollywood has changed and things don't happen as
they once did. Never mind. The people who crowd these pages are
clear as snowcapped mountains on a bright sunny day.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard was born Ernestine Hill in Longview, Texas, and grew up
in Dallas. She became acquainted with a local photographer, who had
discovered several child stars, including Ginger Rogers, and
believed she had a bright future. So she changed her last name to
that of the photographer, Mahoney, even though her father continued
to foot the bills for her fashion shows and beauty contests.
</P>
<P>
   Her father took her to Hollywood one summer in the late 1920s.
``I was his coverup while he was on a two-week toot with a
girlfriend behind my stepmother's back,'' she said in the book.
</P>
<P>
   She soon returned to Hollywood and checked into the all-girl
Studio Club, founded by Mary Pickford to help young hopefuls
working toward movie careers. In 1930 she landed a contract with
Metro Goldwyn Mayer, appearing first as a chorus girl in
``Whoopee,'' Eddie Cantor's Broadway musical hit.
</P>
<P>
   Florenz Ziegfeld, who had produced the Broadway show and was a
partner in the film, asked her and three other showgirls to go to
New York for his next musical, ``Smiles.'' Ziegfeld cast her under
the name Jean Howard, which he deemed less cumbersome than
Ernestine Mahoney. She got a part in the last ``Ziegfeld Follies,''
where one review cited her ``pulchritude, figure and charm.''
</P>
<P>
   As an MGM contract player she had small roles in a number of
movies in the 1930s and 1940s, including ``Broadway to Hollywood''
and ``The Prizefighter and the Lady.'' The studio chief Louis B.
Mayer, passionately attracted to her, proposed marriage and
promised to divorce his wife. She said later that when she rejected
him he got drunk and tried to throw himself out of a window.
</P>
<P>
   She became engaged to Feldman, a lawyer and film agent, who is
credited with being the first to sell director, actors and other
talent as a single package. According to The New York Times of Aug.
26, 1934, the two had attended a Friday night dinner party at the
Colony restaurant in New York and decided to get married
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer's jealous threat to torpedo Feldman's career did not
materialize, and the agent went on to play an increasingly
prominent role in Hollywood, eventually producing ``A Streetcar
Named Desire,'' in 1951, among other films.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had a famously tempestuous relationship, which
resulted in a divorce in 1948. But they continued living in the
same house, with its tortoise shell pedestals and Chinese porcelain
lamps and a garden room where Judy Garland belted out songs on many
occasions. They called it their ``can't live with you, can't live
without you postmarital relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune, Howard
said she ``wanted to be the other woman in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Howard traveled extensively, often with her friend Cole Porter.
That resulted in another picture book, ``Travels With Cole
Porter,'' published in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, she felt seasick on a Mediterranean cruise and got off
the yacht in Capri. She went to a nightclub called Number Two,
where a band called the Shakers was playing. She asked a band
member, Tony Santoro, if he would play a song she had written. He
did, though not necessarily because of its quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more interested in this beautiful woman than the
music,'' he said in a telephone interview. They lived together for
nine years, mainly in Capri and Rome, and were married in 1973. He
is her only immediate survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Howard once said that ``glamor is flimsy.'' She knew the stars
as people, including one of her favorite subjects, Marilyn Monroe.
``She didn't know who she was or who she belonged to,'' Howard told
the San Diego paper. ``The marriages never gave her anything to go
on. There was the ballplayer (Joe DiMaggio) and Arthur Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miller was a very good writer and all of that, but I have
never seen him in anybody's living room, and I have been in a few
living rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the party she gave for John F. Kennedy during the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, at which he won his
party's nomination. After everyone had left and she was cleaning
up, she heard someone scratching at the window screen, according to
a 1993 article in Town &AMP; Country.
</P>
<P>
   She looked out and saw Kennedy, who said, ``I'm starving and
nothing's open at this hour.'' She led him to the kitchen and fed
him scrambled eggs. She said Kennedy then pulled her to him and
kissed her. She told the magazine that people would have to read
her autobiography to find out what happened.
</P>
<P>
   But she never published one.

NEW YORK'S DAILY NEWS REPLACES ITS TOP EDITOR AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Kosner, the former Newsweek editor drafted 16
months ago to revamp the slumping Sunday edition of The Daily News,
has been named the newspaper's editor in chief, the publisher,
Mortimer B. Zuckerman, announced in a news release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kosner, 62, becomes the newspaper's fourth top editor in four
years. He replaces Debby Krenek, who was promoted to the top job in
October 1997, after the seven-month editorship of Pete Hamill. In
an interview Thursday, Zuckerman called Krenek ``an absolute
princess of a person'' who ``made a terrific contribution to the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Krenek ``told me that she wanted to consider
other alternatives for various reasons, and she was kind enough to
give me the time to put together the team that we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goodwin, who as editorial page editor presided over
commentary that won the newspaper major national awards two years
in a row _ a Pulitzer Prize in 1999 and a Polk award earlier this
year _ was named the newspaper's senior executive editor,
effectively Kosner's No. 2 newsroom executive.
</P>
<P>
   Krenek's 6 p.m. farewell speech to the newsroom Thursday gave
form and substance to the rumors that had consumed the nation's
sixth-largest newspaper since Monday, when a gossip item in The New
York Post predicted the ascension of Kosner and Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Zuckerman nor Kosner were on hand for Krenek's remarks.
Likewise, according to journalists who were present, Krenek made no
reference either to the publisher or to her successor as she stood
in the center of the newsroom and told colleagues, ``I love The
Daily News.'' As she left two hours later, Krenek's colleagues rose
in a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday whether the reshuffling at the top would
mean changes in the current lineup of senior editors, including the
senior managing editor, Arthur Browne; the executive editor, Robert
Sapio; and the two managing editors, Bill Boyle and Richard Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the role those editors would play in the new lineup,
Zuckerman said: ``I think they hopefully will remain with the paper
in positions of serious responsibility. There will be some time in
which Ed and Michael will review, not the staff so much as the
paper, and they'll all work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached Thursday evening, Kosner said: ``It's a wonderful paper
and I think we're going to try to make the paper even smarter. With
all due respect to The New York Times, we're going to try to make
it the smartest paper in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooperation has not always been in evidence between the staff of
the daily newspaper, under Krenek's command, and the Sunday
department controlled by Kosner.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, a cover article in The News about Bruce Teitelbaum,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's campaign manager, was written by a
journalist who is not on The News staff. The reporters who
regularly cover the mayor and Teitelbaum were not involved.
</P>
<P>
   A senior staff member, Joe Calderone, who heads the
investigative reporters, said of Krenek, ``She gave us the time and
the space and the encouragement to do really good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the frequent turnover at the top ranks of his
newspaper, Zuckerman said: ``My objective is always to try and
improve the paper. We won three Pulitzers under Debby and many
other awards. We are going to go for more. Debby had other plans to
fulfill. And _ I know this is going to be a shock to the system _ I
made mistakes in some of my choices. I was also learning this
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very happy with what Debby did with the paper and I'll
be happy with what these people do.''

   NEW YORK _ A long-forgotten actor, the toast of 1900s Broadway

the Times Square theater that bore his name for decades. And,
fittingly, he'll be in drag.

Street, moviegoers will buy their tickets beneath a huge mural
showing three female muses in long flowing robes. Lost for 60 years
under layers of paint, the mural has been painstakingly restored at
the insistence of historic preservationists.
</P>
<P>
   And those who did the restoration are fairly certain that all
three women are in fact the same man, Julian Eltinge, the
once-famous female impersonator for whom the theater was first
named in 1912. ``We think the faces were done from publicity
stills,'' said Harriet Irgang, the director of Rustin Levenson Art
Conservation, which restored the mural.
</P>
<P>
   Irgang admits that there is no documentation to prove the
connection, but she said old photographs of Eltinge as a woman
strongly resemble the faces on the mural. ``The makeup, the wigs
and the gestures looked like Julian in costume,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Eltinge never performed at the theater that bore
his name, but he played nearby, starring for four years in ``The
Fascinating Widow'' at the Liberty Theater just to the east on 42nd
Street. Pooling profits from that show, Al H. Woods, the producer,
and Eltinge built the Eltinge Theater with a third partner, Sol
Bloom, who later served in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The actor grew rich performing in plays, reviews, silent films
and even a few talkies, sometimes playing both male and female
parts in the same production. But he was mostly noted for his
depiction of women.
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly known today, he was popular enough in the early
part of the century to have his own magazine and his own line of
cold cream. At the height of his fame, he played at Windsor Castle
for King Edward VII, who presented him with a white bulldog.
</P>
<P>
   He was born William Dalton in 1883 in Newtonville, Mass., and
his life's work seemed to be set at age 10, after he played a girl
in an annual revue in Boston. He was such a hit, he told
interviewers, that the next year a female part was written for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julian Eltinge, as virile as anybody virile, contributed to
the gaiety of nations by playing fascinating widows more
fascinatingly than if fascinating real widows played them,'' the
actress Ruth Gordon wrote in The New York Times on Aug. 31, 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Others were not so complimentary. ``Women went into ecstasy
about him,'' the comedian W.C. Fields once remarked. ``Men went
into the smoking room.''
</P>
<P>
   His antics were a staple in the press: his frequent
pronouncements that he was hanging up his gowns (all 64 of them)
for good, his arrest at the Canadian border with liquor during
Prohibition and a 1931 boating accident in which, The Times
reported, ``a marlin swordfish lunged through the bottom of the
boat and wounded him in the abdomen.'' Even his appendectomy
received notices.
</P>
<P>
   He also shared some secrets: ``If I shave just before the
matinees, that takes me through the performance reassured, but by
the time the night performance is over, I've got a heavy beard,''
he told The New York Press in 1914 while he was appearing in ``The
Crinoline Girl,'' one of his best-known roles. ``My life is one
close shave after another.''
</P>
<P>
   As his looks faded, Eltinge lived many years in seclusion with
his mother on his California ranch. But when he died of a kidney
ailment in 1941, he had been performing again at a New York
nightclub, The Times reported. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   His theater _ renamed the Empire Theater in 1954 _ will reopen
on April 21 as the ticket lobby of the new AMC Empire multiplex.
Moviegoers riding escalators to the screening rooms will pass under
the mural, reinstalled between the top of the old stage opening and
the gloriously detailed, domed ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Broadway theaters whose audiences dwindled in the
Depression, the Eltinge was turned into a burlesque hall. The Roman
and Greek mythology behind the mural, which includes pastoral
scenes and a satyr playing the pipes, seemed out of keeping with
strippers and bawdy comedians, so the mural was hidden under a coat
of brown paint about 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Architects and others involved in the renovation had seen the
mural in photographs. Restorers carefully scraped several areas and
found the canvas was still there.
</P>
<P>
   The Historic Preservation Committee of the New York State's 42nd
Street Redevelopment project insisted on its restoration. Time had
not been kind to the mural, which was painted by a French artist,
Arthur Brounet, and glued to the plaster wall. Among other
problems, there was a round hole where the canvas was cut out to
install a heating duct. ``It was a happy moment,'' Irgang said,
when the restorers discovered that the hole had missed the face of
one of the muses by inches, removing only some of her hair _
another close shave for Julian Eltinge.
</P>
<P>
   After reinstalling the mural this month, restorers repainted the
missing hair of the central figure and did other touch-up work,
with the twin goals of making it look as old as the original and
easy to change if later conservationists have a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   With the restoration completed and the mural back in place,
Julian Eltinge's image is once again where he surely would have
wanted it to be, overlooking audiences coming to see a show.

   THE REPUBLICANS: NEW JOB FOR QUAYLE
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months after dropping out of the race for the
presidency, former Vice President Dan Quayle is back in business.
But this is real business, with Quayle having announced that he has
joined an investing banking firm, JD Ford and Co. which arranges
small mergers and acquisitions. The firm has 12 employees and is
based in Denver, but Quayle, who is a lawyer, will be opening an
office in Phoenix. ``He's certainly not going to be window
dressing,'' said Joseph M. Durnford, who founded the company four
years ago and is its chief executive. ``He's already working on a
specific transaction and said he didn't want to be window
dressing.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE DEMOCRATS: A BUMPY ROAD TO REFORM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a bit of unfortunate timing for the Gore campaign, Vice
President Al Gore was raising hundreds of thousands of dollars
Thursday at three events just as his Republican rival, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, was calling him ``an obstacle to reform.'' Bush
told The Washington Post that Gore has ``a major credibility
problem'' on his desire to overhaul the campaign finance system and
was too partisan to find a consensus on shoring up Social Security.
Gore attended a fundraising luncheon in Cincinatti and two
fundraising receptions in Detroit, all for the Democratic National
Committee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE VOTERS: ENTHUSIASM FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's supporters are more likely to feel
strongly about their support than are voters who favor Vice
President Al Gore, according to the latest poll for Hotline, the
online political tip sheet. The poll of 1,000 voters taken on March
16 through March 19 by a Democratic pollster, Jef Pollock, and a
Republican, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick, found that 59 percent of Bush
supporters held that position strongly, as against 49 percent of
Gore backers. The poll also found that voters who said Sen. John
McCain was their first choice for president were evenly split when
asked to choose between Bush and Gore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE MEDIA: FREE AIR
</P>
<P>
   Candidates in Congressional and gubernatorial contests will be
provided with five minutes of free air time this year on the 18
television stations across the country owned by the Belo Corp., the
company's chairman, Robert W. Decherd, said Thursday. Expanding an
initiative it began in 1996, Belo, which also publishes the Dallas
Morning News and the Providence Journal, will turn over a
five-minute block of news programming to each qualified candidate
during the final 45 days of the campaign. In the pilot project four
years ago, six of Belo's stations provided 73 candidates with more
than six hours of free air time. The company has stations in, among
other places, Dallas, Houston, Seattle and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   THE HOUSE: CROWDED FIELD
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Sanford, a Republican from the coastal district of
South Carolina, became a well-known figure around the state earlier
this year because of his maverick support for Sen. John McCain. But
rather than exploit his popularity, he is, at least for the moment,
leaving politics in keeping with a promise to serve no more than
three terms. The prospect of filling a rare open seat has attracted
seven Republicans to the June 13 primary. The leading contenders
are H.B. Limehouse, the former transportation commissioner who has
the backing of the state's Republican establishment, and state Rep.
Henry Brown. The winner will likely face Andy Brack, chairman of
the Charleston County Democratic party.
THE REFORM PARTY: OUSTER CONDEMNED
</P>
<P>
   Jack Gargan, the ousted chairman of the Reform Party, told a
federal judge Thursday that he had been improperly removed from the
job in a ``raw power takeover'' at a raucous meeting last month.
The testimony came on the second day of a hearing before Judge
Norman K. Moon of U.S. District Court in Lynchburg, Va., to decide
who controls the party and millions of dollars in federal campaign
money. Gargan is an ally of Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota. The
current chairman Pat Choate is an ally of the party's founder, Ross
Perot. Gargan testified that the meeting was invalid because proper
notice of it had not been given to party members and those who
attended were not properly credentialed as outlined in the party's
constitution. He also said he had not called the gathering to
order. Dale Cooter, Choate's lawyer, tried to paint Gargan as a
tyrant who wanted to rule the party by himself, going against the
executive committee's wishes and overturning its decisions. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to quell a political and religious furor
over the selection of the House chaplain, Speaker Dennis Hastert
took to the House floor Thursday and appointed, by fiat, a Catholic
priest who had not been in contention for the job.
</P>
<P>
   In a sober speech laced with bitterness, Hastert stood before
his hushed colleagues and defended his initial decision to select a
Protestant minister over a Roman Catholic priest.
</P>
<P>
   And he accused Democrats of conducting unseemly political
warfare by portraying him and other Republicans as anti-Catholic.
The House has never had a Catholic chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a more cynical and more destructive
political campaign,'' Hastert said on the House floor, insisting
that his earlier choice of the Protestant minister had been based
on merit, not denomination. ``That such a campaign should be waged
in connection with the selection of the House chaplain brings shame
on this House.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks a lot like war,'' Hastert added. ``And it has an ugly
face.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leader, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, who
did not know about Hastert's decision until the speech on the House
floor, struck a conciliatory note in his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never said, and never believed, that there was bias of
any kind in the making of this selection,'' Gephardt told his
colleagues on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's decision to name the Rev. Daniel Coughlin, a vicar of
the Archdiocese of Chicago, appeared to be an effort to close an
episode that has dogged Republicans since late last year, exposing
the party to charges of anti-Catholic bias and leaving some members
politically vulnerable in their home districts.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over the chaplain's selection _ a seemingly
innocuous procedure _ also helped dredge up just the sort of
partisan animosity that Republicans hoped to leave behind after
President Clinton's impeachment. It was in this spirit of
conciliation that they elected Hastert as speaker in 1999 to
replace Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fade away with time, as Republicans had hoped, the
conflict escalated last month when Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, kicked off his
South Carolina campaign by visiting Bob Jones University, an
evangelical college whose leaders have made anti-Catholic
statements. Bush's visit roiled his campaign and provided House
Democrats with added ammunition in the fight over the House
chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   For Hastert, the decision to appoint Coughlin follows four
months of hand-wringing over how to handle the chaplain
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   An exit strategy finally emerged this week, when the Rev.
Charles Wright, the Protestant chaplain who had been awaiting final
approval, withdrew from consideration on Wednesday, saying he could
not serve in a ``divided House,'' Hastert said. His withdrawal
cleared the way for Hastert to appoint Coughlin, who had been
recommended by the archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Francis George.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin (whose name is pronounced COG-lin) was offered the job
only Thursday. After accepting, he flew to Washington, where he was
sworn in just after Hastert's speech.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker can, if he chooses, use his unilateral authority to
select the chaplain, whose job it is to deliver the morning prayer
and counsel members.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hastert faced considerable pressure from Roman Catholic
Republicans, and Republicans from predominantly Catholic districts,
to resolve the lingering conflict. Some members, fed up with the
partisan brawl, suggested doing away with the position of chaplain
altogether, an alternative that Hastert called a ``grave mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Hastert had decided to appoint a Roman
Catholic drew praise from Republicans and Democrats alike. ``It was
his only recourse under the circumstances,'' said Rep. Marge
Roukema, R-N.J. ``He made the best of an impossible situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, though, expressed deep dissatisfaction with
Hastert's attack, saying that he mishandled the process and had
nobody to blame but himself for the controversy. `` I don't care
who is chaplain,'' said Rep. John D. Dingell, a senior Michigan
Democrat who is Catholic. ``If you're going to have a process, you
want it to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, a bipartisan committee, set up by Hastert to
pick the House chaplain, winnowed a long list of candidates to
three, with a Roman Catholic priest, Father Timothy O'Brien,
receiving the most votes.
</P>
<P>
   As agreed, the list of three was forwarded to Hastert, Rep. Dick
Armey of Texas, the majority leader, and Gephardt, without a vote
tally and in alphabetical order.
</P>
<P>
   After a round of final interviews late last year, Hastert
selected Wright, with the support of Armey and, eventually,
Gephardt. Republicans said that other House leaders had played no
role in the choice of Wright.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats on the committee complained, saying they did not
understand why the committee's first choice was not selected. They
also pointed out that during interviews with the panel, O'Brien had
been asked what they described as inappropriate questions about his
clerical collar and his ability to counsel married couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that anti-Catholic bias played into it,'' said Rep.
Anna Eshoo, D-Calif., who was on the selection panel. ``Do I
celebrate the fact that history has been made and the House has its
first Catholic chaplain? Yes. Has it been hurtful? Absolutely.''

TEXAS MAN, 35, STALKED TEEN BEFORE CHURCH SHOOTING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH RENDON 
and CARLOS ANTONIO RIOS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Oscar Castillo's obsession with a teen-ager almost
half his age was no secret at the small Pentecostal church both
attended in nearby Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned parishioners had stayed after regular services
Wednesday night to discuss the situation with both Castillo, 35,
and the 18-year-old high school student, Esly Alicia Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   The parishioners heard Castillo profess his love, and they heard
Contreras comparing her feelings for him to that of a brother.
Castillo left, but only briefly. The next thing parishioners heard
was gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, a native of Nicaragua who had become an active member
of the Iglesia Cristiana Esposa del Cordero after kicking a drug
habit, had returned with a gun _ a type so unusual that police were
still trying to determine the make late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He shot not only Contreras, but her mother, their minister, and
another parishioner before going outside and killing himself.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Contreras' condition was upgraded to good and she
was expected to be released from the hospital. However, her mother,
38-year-old Angela Contreras, and pastor Carlos Matamoros, 49, were
in critical condition at Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston. The
fourth person wounded, Jose Luis Dones, 32, of Pasadena, was grazed
by a bullet and treated at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo died in the parking lot outside the single-story,
aluminum-sided church, which is a few blocks from Pasadena's City
Hall and police department.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena, a petrochemical city of nearly 134,00 people, is about
10 miles west of downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Esly Contreras' 15-year-old brother, Robert, said his mother had
asked for the meeting after Wednesday night's services, seeking
guidance from church elders. About 20 other parishioners stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed his love for her, and she told him in front of
the witnesses and elders that she liked him like a brother, but she
did not have a romantic interest in him,'' Pasadena Police Lt. M.P.
Jackson said. ``Apparently that led up to his emotional instability
and caused the shooting. That's the best information at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   One witness, Concepcion Montana, told her husband, Jose Montana,
that Castillo entered the church, grabbed Esly Contreras by the
hair and shot her. He then shot the mother and pastor before
running out of the church, the husband said. One of the bullets
fired at the others apparently grazed the other wounded man.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo at first had romantically pursued Angela Contreras,
according to her son.
</P>
<P>
   When the single mother of five, who works as the church
secretary, did not return his affection, Castillo turned his
attention to Esly Contreras.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, Castillo stalked Esly Contreras, a student at Sam
Rayburn High School, her brother said. Castillo would park near the
school bus stop in the mornings and afternoons and watch her get on
and off the bus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo also would often drive by the family's apartment
complex and had threatened the young woman, her brother said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no information late Thursday to indicate that the
family had reported the stalking to police.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Martinez, 28, manager of the apartments where the
Contreras family lives in a two-bedroom unit, said the family was
close-knit and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Contreras usually took her children to church with her
for evening service. On Wednesday, however, she had left Robert in
charge of his three younger siblings while she and her oldest child
went to the church.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors described Esly Contreras as quiet, noting that though
she does not participate in any extracurricular activities at
school, she is active at her church.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Lewis, a spokesman for the Pasadena school district, said
counselors were working with students on an individual basis
Thursday to talk about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, church members, many who had witnessed the shooting
and were kept inside the building until police completed their
investigation, were holding a vigil at Memorial Hermann Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, a native of Managua, Nicaragua, had been in the United
States for about seven years and was a supervisor for Flori-Tex
Landscaping in Pasadena, said an acquaintance, Alvaro Espino.
</P>
<P>
   Espino said Castillo had been a drug user but had cleaned up
about three years ago and become religious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting his life in order,'' Espino said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Castillo's mother died several months ago and that
Castillo had been saddened that he was unable to attend the funeral
in Nicaragua. On Thursday, authorities were trying to find a sister
to tell her about his death.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication that he had been married or had
relatives in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County court records show Castillo was sentenced to 20
days in jail in June 1997 for a conviction of assault bodily
injury. Details were not available.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Pasadena police were trying to identify the weapon
used in the shooting rampage. The department called in agents with
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms to help try to
determine the type of semiautomatic pistol Castillo used.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun used is a particularly unusual caliber and a
particularly unusual brand that we don't recognize. The serial
numbers appear to have been ground off,'' police Lt. M.P. Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what kind it is. It's one we've never seen
before. It's not a caliber we use here in the United States. It
could have been imported from South America or Europe.''

CHASE SEEKS TO BUY ONE OF BRITAIN'S LAST PRIVATELY HELD BANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Chase Manhattan Corp. is negotiating to acquire the
British asset management and investment banking firm Robert Fleming
Holdings, the companies said Thursday. A deal would end the
independence of Fleming, one of Britain's last privately held
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the talks said that an announcement of a
purchase could come within a week, though the companies might still
decide to abandon the effort. While a price for the British bank
has yet to be fixed, the executives said, it is expected to exceed
3 billion pounds, or about $4.75 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A purchase of Fleming would follow Chase's $1.35 billion
acquisition of the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Group last year, which helped
strengthen Chase's high-technology investment banking business.
</P>
<P>
   It would also give Chase, of New York, the third-largest
American banking company, a powerful presence in Asia, where
Fleming has a successful asset management practice, but not much
more in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Fleming said, ``Discussions are at an early
stage and no further announcement will be made unless and until
appropriate.'' Unusually, Chase also confirmed the talks, but said
it did so ``at the request of Robert Fleming Holdings.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said a successful deal would still not give Chase the
size to join the upper echelon of investment banks like Goldman
Sachs Group or Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are definitely getting a strong presence in Asia,'' said
Tom Rayner, an analyst at SG Securities. ``But it's not going to
help them compete much in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said a more logical purchase for Chase would be
Dresdner Bank's Kleinwort Benson unit, which would give Chase an
immediate investment banking presence in Europe at a time when
mergers and acquisitions are occurring at a rapid pace. ``There are
better propositions around,'' Rayner said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Chase rose $6.9375 Thursday, to $98.50. News of the
talks was first reported in The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, which is not a publicly traded company, is 29.4
percent-owned by the Fleming family, which included Ian Fleming,
the late writer who created James Bond. The company operates a
joint venture with T. Rowe Price Associates, which has about $35
billion of managed assets. The bank also owns Jardine Fleming,
which was once Hong Kong's biggest broker. In all, the bank manages
$137.4 billion for its clients. Robert Fleming has about 7,800
employees with offices in more than 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   If Chase acquired Robert Fleming, the deal would bring a
near-end to Britain's privately held banks. It would leave only
Cazenove &AMP; Co. as the last major British-based investment banking
business.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Citigroup bought the Schroders investment
banking business for $2.21 billion.
</P>

CREDIT SUISSE DEFENDS WORK FOR UKRAINE AS AUTHORIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head of the emerging markets business of Credit Suisse, the
European banking giant, said Thursday that his institution engaged
in unusual transactions on behalf of Ukraine's central bank, but he
maintained that all of them were legal and were undertaken only at
the central bank's request.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the House Banking Committee, the Credit Suisse
executive, James P. Healy, said that, among other things, his bank
received $705 million from the Ukrainian central bank from 1996 to
1998, which Credit Suisse then lent to banks in Ukraine. The
central bank guaranteed any losses Credit Suisse might incur on the
loans and paid Credit Suisse commissions for distributing the money
_ essentially paying it to conduct risk-free activities.
</P>
<P>
   In most countries, central banks do not rely on intermediaries
to distribute loans to domestic banks. Healy said the maneuver was
necessary in Ukraine, however, because the central bank there
wished to ``avoid the domestic political pressures it would face if
it engaged in direct lending of U.S. dollars to Ukrainian banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse's activities in Ukraine have come under scrutiny
after the International Monetary Fund disclosed last week that
Ukraine's central bank secured loans by misleading the fund about
the country's financial health. The IMF said the central bank used
nearly $1 billion to conduct banking transactions that allowed it
to double-count its foreign currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators in the United States said last week
that some of the transactions that artificially inflated the
Ukrainian central bank's reserves were conducted with the help of
Credit Suisse's investment banking arm, Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Healy said Thursday that while there had been accusations that
some part of the $705 million the central bank deposited with
Credit Suisse ``may have been used to mislead the IMF,'' his bank
``does not know of any such conduct, nor has it ever been in a
position to know.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Credit Suisse was unaware of exact
``performance criteria'' outlined by the IMF to Ukraine's
government as a condition for receiving IMF funds.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who heads the House Banking Committee,
said it was his understanding that most investment and commercial
banks make it a point to familiarize themselves with such criteria
in emerging markets _ a view that some Western bankers confirmed in
interviews Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the transactions Credit Suisse engaged in for the
Ukrainian central bank were conducted through Cyprus, an offshore
financial haven favored by many Eastern European countries and
Western financial institutions. Healy said Thursday that it was
Cyprus' favorable tax climate, not its bank secrecy laws, that
makes the Mediterranean island so attractive to financiers.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss Banking Commission, the country's leading bank
regulator, said earlier this week that it was investigating Credit
Suisse's activities in Ukraine because of the IMF's disclosures
about how its loans were handled by the country. Credit Suisse
declined to comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, who also testified
Thursday, said he was ``deeply concerned'' about the accusations of
improprieties involving IMF loans to Ukraine. Summers said that the
Treasury Department would review audits of the transactions in
question before he supported further IMF lending to the country. He
said he considered the possibility of misuse of the funds to be ``a
matter of especially serious concern.''

ADVERTISING: NEW MARKETING EFFORT TRIES TO RAISE FT.COM'S U.S.
PROFILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FT.Com, the Internet venture of The Financial Times, the
London-based financial newspaper, is embarking on its first
consumer marketing campaign to raise its profile in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, with the theme ``The world doesn't turn on a
dime,'' emphasize the importance of a global perspective in today's
business environment. The $35 million campaign features Dan Aykroyd
in a series of humorous television commercials, in addition to
print, outdoor and online ads.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which begins Sunday, is the first from BBDO New
York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, since
the agency was awarded the account in November. The commercials are
the first that Aykroyd, the actor known for his work in the early
years of ``Saturday Night Live'' and in many films, has done, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The humor in the commercials, said Paul Waddington, marketing
communications director for FT.com in London, ``helps us to get
away from any perhaps connotations of stuffiness that the parent
brand has.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first commercial, Aykroyd portrays Kopeky, the chief
executive of a leading American foam rubber company, who is
negotiating with three Italian businessmen over the sale of his
company. After intense price negotiations being passed back and
forth on paper, Kopeky thinks he has pulled a fast one on the
Italians by agreeing to sell his company for what he believes to be
the astronomical price of 11 million lire, which a subtitle notes
is just $5,741. After shaking hands to seal the deal, the three
Italians raise their glasses to Kopeky and offer felicitations in
Italian that are translated in a subtitle as `idiot, moron and
chowderhead.`
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent commercials with Aykroyd portray him in similar
predicaments where his ignorance of global business also hurts him.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Sann, co-chief executive and chief creative officer at BBDO
New York, noted that this sort of inept businessman has always been
part of Aykroyd's repertory, ``so, it seemed like a natural fit and
you get more spin and noticeability of having a celebrity of his
stature.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of a celebrity, in addition to the campaign's quirky
humor, is indicative of many Web publishers' attempts to attract
attention in a media category that has quickly grown cluttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're late to the party,'' said Sue Haxager, senior vice
president and senior account director on the FT.com account at BBDO
New York. ``There are already a variety of business news services
and the dot-com noise in general.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective,'' she added, ``we are trying to say that
we are a dot-com and that FT, which has a very conservative image,
is doing something radically different, and we felt if we
approached it to somberly the `Internetness' of it wouldn't come
across.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which was introduced in 1995, was revamped last
month and is now being offered as an international business portal
with news, views and archives. The target is a broader business
audience in middle management ages 25 to 54.
</P>
<P>
   FT.com says it has 1.2 million users every month. About 12
percent of those users come from the United States; 56 percent come
from Britain; about 20 percent from Europe, with the remainder from
the rest of the world. It competes with several financial Web news
sites, including MarketWatch.com, TheStreet.com and WSJ.com, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to build upon the growing reputation of the newspaper
in the U.S. and broaden it to increase the audience for the
Financial Times brand over all,'' said Stephen Hill, group chief
executive at FT.com's parent the Financial Times Group unit of
Pearson PLC in London. ``What we want to is get people's minds to
integrate the two services of the Financial Times Group.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, the 11 print ads for FT.com use the distinctive
salmon-pink color of The Financial Times as the backdrop. One
headline proclaims: ``Greeks, Chinese, Germans, Russians, Italians,
Uzbeks, Namibians, Turks, Japanese and Americans all speak the same
language. Money.'' Another ad directs readers to FT.com's Markets
and Portfolio channel by promising, ``Learn so much about Charles
Schwab, you can call him Chuck.'' A third headline states, ``Phrase
often heard by FT.com users: Cha-ching!'' And, ``When your company
does business in countries you can't spell.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper and magazine ads will begin appearing next week in
publications including The Economist, Forbes, The New York Times,
The Wall Street Journal and USA Today. The online advertising
portion of the campaign, created by (AT)tmosphere in New York, a
digital branding agency started by BBDO New York last year, will be
on various media properties including MSNBC.com, MSN.com and
Hotmail.com.

NEW YORK BEGINS ATTACK ON VIRUS-CARRYING MOSQUITOES
</HEADLINE>
 (mh) 
By By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Until last summer, the presence of mosquitoes in and
around New York City was about as consequential as the presence of
pigeons _ and far less obvious. Then came West Nile, a
mosquito-borne virus that killed seven people in the metropolitan
region, caused brain infections in 62 others and prompted
widespread spraying of insecticides in the city and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the chances of a sequel to last year's outbreak,
health officials from the state, the city and counties around the
region began Thursday the first part of a three-step attack on
mosquitoes, specifically a city-loving species, Culex pipiens, that
breeds in puddles and old tires, seeks meals in back yards and
bedrooms and is the link known to carry the West Nile virus from
birds to people.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Queens, close to the epicenter of last
year's outbreak, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the state health
commissioner, said people should not panic and, for the most part,
should embrace the coming warm months, not fear them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not destroy your summer,'' she said. ``Trust our system.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan consists of three strategies: disrupting the
mosquitoes' reproduction, monitoring mosquitoes and birds for signs
of the virus and, finally, instituting new procedures at hospitals
to catch the earliest hint of human cases.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials from the region joined Novello to describe
similar efforts in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The health officials said pesticide spraying would occur only as
a last resort, if clear signs emerge that the virus threatens
people.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, their plan earned the endorsement of some private
environmental groups. William Cooke, a spokesman for the National
Audubon Society, said the program was a reasonable approach that
could prevent an outbreak and minimize the use of pesticides. He
said it was particularly important for the public to become
involved, eliminating stagnant water where the mosquitoes breed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people do in their back yards may help prevent
spraying,'' he said. ``We need to work aggressively now so we don't
see the planes, the helicopters, the trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   But other environmental groups criticized the control plan,
saying that any spraying at all would be ill-advised and largely
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The mosquito-control project gained some urgency last week after
scientists reported that the virus had survived the winter in a
sample of dormant adult mosquitoes and in a red-tailed hawk that
died in February.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Novello described the first part of the control
program, which will use television advertisements, pamphlets and
volunteers like the Boy Scouts to encourage residents of the
metropolitan region to make mosquito control part of their spring
cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Once those control efforts are well under way, the next phase
will begin: weekly testing of trapped mosquitoes, dead birds and
captive flocks of chickens to pick up any early signs that the
virus is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the watch will begin at hospitals for human cases.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the first phase, health officials said, is to reduce
the mosquito population by interrupting the breeding cycle at its
weakest link, when larvae emerge from eggs and wriggle in pools and
puddles for several days before the new mosquitoes emerge and take
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Novello urged people to discard used tires, remove pails or
other containers that hold water, invert children's swimming pools
and frequently change the water in bird baths. People with pools
are being advised to be sure that the water is chlorinated and that
any water trapped in pool covers is removed. ``Most important of
all,'' she said, ``clean clogged gutters.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, Novello said the effort to prevent the
recurrence of West Nile had produced a system that should help
promptly signal future outbreaks of this and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, officials around southern New York state scrambled to
find laboratories capable of identifying the virus, shipping some
samples as far as California and Wisconsin. This year the state
Health Department has set up its own testing centers.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all of the preparations, Novello said, some mosquitoes
may still end up carrying the virus and pose a threat to people.
The chances of being bitten by a Culex mosquito are greatest at
dusk and dawn, she said, and if residents of the affected areas
need to be outside at those times, they should wear long sleeves or
use insect repellent.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast majority of people infected with West Nile, there
are almost no symptoms, or at most a flulike reaction or aches,
virus experts say. In a few cases, particularly in the elderly, the
virus can cause potentially fatal brain swelling, called
encephalitis.
</P>
<P>
   At the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which is
responsible for managing the use of pesticides, officials said they
were investigating some complaints by environmental groups that
pesticides were improperly used last fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Stephen L. Johnson, the agency's deputy assistant
administrator for pesticide programs, said his staff had analyzed
the plans for fighting the mosquitoes this year and found they were
likely to minimize the use of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear to utilize spraying of a chemical as the last
resort, and that's the approach we think is appropriate,'' Johnson
said.

LAKERS KEEP THEIR GUARD UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ As the Los Angeles Lakers ponder a possible
extended rest for veteran guard Ron Harper, coach Phil Jackson will
rest easy knowing his offense can survive the absence.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Harper, playing on bad knees and old legs, is
probably heading for the injured list to recharge for the playoffs.
Jackson said a decision will be made soon. Harper would have to
miss five games.
</P>
<P>
   Harper's experience directing the triangle offense was
indispensable in November, but the Lakers are now equipped to play
without him, thanks to the development of both Kobe Bryant and
Brian Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has matured as the initiator of the offense and no longer
needs Harper to calm him down. Shaw, 34, has adapted to the
offense, has the size (6-foot-6) Jackson likes and has become a
consistent producer off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has averaged 21 minutes over the last seven games, the most
consistent playing time he's received this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way he's playing. He's doing a good job,'' said
Jackson. ``We're just trying to use our guard corps in a way that
gives us a mixture of things _ speed, defense, ability to set up
the offense, the ability to make it run a little bit quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw has already supplanted Derek Fisher as the third guard most
nights and looks forward to doing more if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just kind of take it as it comes,'' he said. ``Whatever
happens, just try to keep what we have going, going. And whoever
gets the minutes, be productive and try to do as well as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The additional minutes help, Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can relax a little bit more. You don't have to press as
much, because you know that you're going to get the minutes.
Sometimes you feel like if you come in for a short period of time,
you have to make something happen within that period of time, real
quick . . . or you're going to come out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw figures that Fisher, who started while Bryant was out in
November, will take Harper's starting position, but he's
comfortable with any role.
</P>
<P>
   ``(If) we can take care of our business and lock up the top spot
(in the West) and rest Harp at the same time, then that's great,''
Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Sympathy: The Phoenix Suns come to Staples Center tonight
without All-Star guard Jason Kidd, who will miss the rest of the
regular season after breaking his left ankle on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel bad for anybody who suffers an injury, but especially
Jason, me growing up with him and knowing how much he loves to be
on the floor and play basketball,'' said Shaw, a fellow Oakland
native.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw and others were surprised to hear that popular ex-Sun Kevin
Johnson is coming out of a two-year retirement to take Kidd's
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be interesting,'' Shaw said. ``I think it would be
hard. There have been some rules changes that have occurred since
the last time he played.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' injury woes _ all five starters have missed
significant playing time _ stands in stark contrast to the Lakers,
who haven't had a player go down since Bryant returned from a
broken hand in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the name of the game, basically, is how do you prevent
that. You don't,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But he lauded the work of conditioning coach Jim Cotta and
trainers Chip Schaefer and Gary Vitti and said the players have
been dedicated to their weight training and conditioning work. &QL;

SPARTANS CONQUER FEAR, ORANGEMEN
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-SYRACUSE-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ When the Syracuse Orangemen had finally
been vanquished, 75-58, Michigan State guard Mateen Cleaves was
asked how the Spartans felt, staring at double-digit deficits in
the second half, with time ticking away on their season.
</P>
<P>
   Was it fear?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' Cleaves said after Thursday night's victory. ``I
don't say it was fear ... a sense of urgency, probably. I mean, you
do think about it maybe being your last game. Well, in a way, I
guess you could say it was fear, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves and his teammates overcame any fear by outscoring
Syracuse 17-0 in the last 5:55 of the game, turning a 58-58 tie
into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   When Cleaves is afraid, he seeks comforting companionship and
calm, reasoned verbal discourse. So, when he walked into the locker
room at halftime with the Spartans trailing by 10 points, he cut
loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``I can't repeat what was said. Let's just
say I got in some people's faces. I didn't think we were playing
hard, and it was about time we started.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he saved coach Tom Izzo the trouble of
delivering the sermon himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I got to the locker room, Mateen was just
finishing up,'' Izzo said. ``There was nothing left for me to do
but pick up the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know that in the second half, we reached deep down,
after being really badly beaten up to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a complete turnaround that Cleaves _ held scoreless to
that point _ launched with a 3-point shot with 17:43 remaining.
That basket brought the anguished, green-clad crowd at The Palace
to its feet with a roar. The Spartans (29-7) _ the top-seeded team
in the Midwest Regional _ were on their way to victory over the
Orangemen (26-6), who had held leads up to 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves' shot merely closed the gap to 42-32, but it was quickly
followed by a 3-pointer from Morris Peterson, who wound up 5-of-9
from beyond the arc and scored 16 of his 21 points in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that one,'' Peterson said, ``I told Mateen to keep
feeding me the ball because I felt hot. And he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves hit another 3-pointer, Peterson two more, and the
Syracuse zone, that had befuddled the Spartans in the first half,
began to unravel. The Orangemen recovered briefly and still held a
49-38 lead with 15:13 remaining. But they scored nine points the
rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   After MSU surged into the lead, the last Syracuse basket came
with 5:46 remaining, tying the game at 58-58. From there to the
finish, the Spartans went on their run to finish off the game. They
shot 68 percent in the second half, including 9 of 15 from
three-point range.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't really a 17-point game,'' Izzo said. ``In the first
half, they had 14 points off the break and they were killing us.
They outshot us, outran us, and beat us in every way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they still fought hard in the second half, but it
seemed like we hit a few key baskets and the roof caved in.''
</P>
<P>
   That was pretty much the way Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim saw it,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were active in our zone and played well for 30 minutes,''
he said. ``Then they came out hit nine of their first 13 from
3-point range in the second half. That's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a bit wearing on Cleaves, who finished with 10
points and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we finally started playing aggressively,'' he said.
``But I'm getting tired of these halftime speeches.'' nn

`BAND' FEEDS FRENZY FOR BOY GROUPS, REALITY TV 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 
(UNDATED) - The ABC network apparently be lieves our thirst for
reality TV is undying.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC apparently is right. Its Making the Band, which pre mieres
tonight, could be the guilt iest pleasure since that other ABC show
. . . what's it called? Stars Regis somebody.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it's car-wreck tele vision _ the gawk factor is what
attracts you even if you don't want it to do so. Making the Band
chronicles the creation of a boy band called O-Town, put together
by Lou Pearlman, the guy behind the Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync (so
blame him).
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 guys audi tioned for the five positions. We see
them singing their guts out, in that vocal-gymnastics way boy bands
favor. The first episode shows Pearlman whittle the group down to
25, who are whisked away to Orlando for a more thorough
auditioning.
</P>
<P>
   We get to know guys like Kiaika Kahoano of Hawaii, who cries
when he's selected. Actu ally, several cry _ they're the sensitive
type.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't call, I'm going to be crushed,'' one hopeful
says. Hard to say which one _ most have the angular features,
fresh-scrubbed faces and moussed hair of boy-band chart-toppers;
they tend to run together.
</P>
<P>
