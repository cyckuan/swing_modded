   CHINA-LIBERALS (Beijing) _ China's leaders are attempting to
rein in a growing and increasingly self-assertive liberal
intellectual movement, criticizing prominent academics in speeches,
forbidding newspapers from running their articles and punishing
publishers who have brought out their work. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

   SPAIN-IMMIGRANTS (El Ejido, Spain) _ The life of immigrants in
this tense town in southern Spain throws light on Europe's perhaps
most pressing social problem: how to deal with a massive influx of
labor from other climes and continents. By Roger Cohen.

   EURO (Frankfurt, Germany) _ The euro was supposed to unify the
economies of 11 European nations and be a symbol of stability to
rival the dollar, the yen and even the British pound. But so far it
has been a boon to the very currencies with which it was supposed
to compete. Now Americans brandishing dollars are finding bargains
from Amsterdam to Vienna. By Edmund L. Andrews.

   SCI-PREEMIES (Undated) _ It has been more than 20 years since
doctors began saving extremely premature infants, and about a
decade since advances in neonatology vastly improved the survival
of babies of very low birth weight _ those weighing less than 1,500
grams, or 3 pounds 4 ounces. Thousands of these children are now
well into their school years. The conventional medical wisdom had
been that those who were not seriously disabled physically would
catch up to other youngsters by age 5. Many do. But as the first
large group of tiny babies grows up, new research is showing that
academic and behavioral problems often surface in the school years.

   CALIF-BOWLING-ALLEY (Los Angeles) _ For the last five years,
Jacqueline Sowell has loved to go to the Holiday Bowl, a faded
bowling alley on a faded street in a faded district of Los Angeles.
Walking into the Bowl renewed her faith. It showed her day after
day just how well people of diverse backgrounds and races can get
along. But early Saturday morning, after 42 years, the Holiday Bowl
was closed. And a few hours after the last balls thundered down the
lanes, a group of Sowell's neighbors, co-workers and friends were
standing outside, holding signs, declaring the Bowl ``A Landmark of
Diversity'' and urging the new owners and the city to ``Preserve
Not Destroy.'' By Don Terry.

   ECON-POLITICS (Washington) _ This week offered a stunning
contradiction in numbers: a 3.9 percent unemployment rate, the
lowest in 30 years, and two major national polls showing Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas leading Vice President Al Gore by 5
percentage points. To put that contrast in perspective, the last
time a president's party lost the White House in good times was
1920. So why isn't the booming economy blowing Bush away? By Adam
Clymer.

<P>
   UTAH-REPUBS (Salt Lake City) _ Utah is one of the most
Republican states in the country. But in Utah, there are
Republicans and there are Republicans. At the Republican state
party convention, even Sen. Orrin Hatch was greeted with a healthy
mix of boos and jeers. So was Gov. Michael Leavitt, who is running
for a third term against three challengers and failed to reach 60
percent in any of three ballots, putting him in a primary for the
first time since 1992. ``These conventions are the political
version of hazing,'' Leavitt said. ``You have to expect it as a
two-term incumbent.'' By Michael Janofsky.

   CLINTON-SCHEDULE _ There are fewer than 6,000 hours left in the
Clinton presidency, a dwindling block of time that many people want
to share. Putting together Clinton's schedule in these final months
is a delicate balancing act that involves squeezing together
fund-raising dinners, presidential speeches and photo ops with golf
games, foreign trips and overnight stays in Chappaqua, N.Y. By Marc
Lacey.

micro-electromechanical systems, have already made their way by the
millions into products like automotive air bags, ink jet printers
and disposable blood pressure analyzers. But this is the year that
MEMS seem poised for their first central role in computing and

KIDD SLOWED BY BRYANT, ANKLE INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jason Kidd emerged from his shower, walked slowly
to his locker then turned and faced the music.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of reporters forming a circle around the Phoenix
Suns guard seemed appropriate. After all, Kidd was crowded, swarmed
and pressured for 39 minutes Sunday in the Lakers' 105-77 victory
over Phoenix in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   The postgame scene was just more of the same, only instead of
Kobe Bryant's slender body and long arms, Kidd was staring at
microphones and notepads.
</P>
<P>
   It was a forgettable game for Kidd, who finished with more
turnovers (five) than points (three) while making just 1 of 6
field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The game started badly when Kidd tweaked his right ankle coming
down awkwardly after a first-quarter layup - the same ankle he
fractured March 22 and that sidelined him until the Suns'
series-clinching victory over San Antonio in the first round five
days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd played cautiously the rest of the way Sunday, afraid he
might make the injury worse, and that contributed to his
difficulties. He's at his best when he's free-wheeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to gain more confidence,'' Kidd said. ``This is
only my second game back so I'm going to be a little rusty, a
little uncertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Players don't miss five weeks then come back sharp, especially
when the intensity kicks up a notch in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's struggles set the tone for the Suns, who turned the ball
over 23 times and shot 36.4 percent from the field. The Lakers made
Phoenix pay for the turnovers, burning the Suns for 28 points.
</P>
<P>
   They may play smarter, but will Kidd play with more confidence?
He laughed when he heard people say it looked as if he hadn't
missed a beat on his return against the Spurs, knowing full well
how absurd that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely feel a lot different on the court,'' Kidd said.
``The big thing is I have to gain confidence every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd played well against San Antonio, getting nine points, 10
assists, three steals and two rebounds. But he wasn't playing
against Bryant, who was voted to the NBA's All-Defensive first team
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, unsure how much he could push off his right foot,
struggled against Bryant's constant pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe is a great defender no doubt about that,'' Suns coach
Scott Skiles said. ``I thought Jason had great energy and he also
had some opportunities when he kicked (the ball) out. But guys
missed shots.''

LAKERS DEFENSE STOPS SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anyone remember defense?
</P>
<P>
   The swatted jump shot, the leap into the passing lane, the hand
in the face? A few days ago, it all seemed so passe, so last
millennium, as the Lakers went fashionably offensive to beat the
shoot-happy Sacramento Kings.
</P>
<P>
   But a new series brought the return of an old ally.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Suns, meet Laker defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took advantage of 23 Phoenix turnovers Sunday and
cashed them in for a 105-77 blowout in front of 18,997 at Staples
Center in Game 1 of the best-of-seven conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came with all the usual, stylish accessories - 37
points from Shaquille O'Neal and 25 from Kobe Bryant - but on a day
when the Lakers sputtered early, their third-quarter suffocation of
the Suns' attack won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good,'' said Bryant, who locked up Suns playmaker
Jason Kidd. ``I told Coach Frank (Hamblen) on the bench, I said,
`Damn, this looks good.' It gives us a chance to strap up.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked familiar, and should have. This was the way the Lakers
won most of their 67 games in the regular season, turning endless
deflections and rebounds into points. That was difficult in the
first round, when they had to simply outscore the Kings while
allowing an average of 96.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   The 77 points and 36.4 percent shooting by the Suns were more
reflective of the Lakers' personality this season under coach Phil
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of rewarding to have offense,'' Jackson said. ``It
lulls you into kind of a happy game, scoring, everybody's enjoying
it. It was a struggle out there for us in the first half, and to
actually shoot 43 percent and win by (28) points is really not
indicative of what the game is about.''
</P>
<P>
   From Jackson's perspective, Sunday's game also might be a lousy
barometer of what's to come in this series, which resumes with Game
2 on Wednesday at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   The teams stumbled to an 18-18 tie in the first quarter - the
Lakers perhaps fatigued from Friday's emotional clincher against
the Kings, the Suns apparently too relaxed after a four-day break.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I kind of had a hunch about it, neither team was able to
bring a best game to this opening game of this series,'' Jackson
said. ``That's more of a feel-out game, I think, rather than an
indicator of what this series is going to be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our players looked tired in the first half, but they
got a real good energy boost the third quarter, played a wonderful
third quarter. A.C. (Green) gave us a lift, and (Ron) Harper got a
couple steals and did some things good for us too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns never led after the midway point of the second quarter,
but the rout took longer to develop. Harper picked Penny Hardaway
to open the second half, leading to a Bryant fast-break layup and
three-point play, for a 49-41 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Then an O'Neal block of Clifford Robinson. Then a Bryant steal
and a turnaround jumper in transition. Then another Harper steal,
off Rodney Rogers. Then another Bryant steal.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the Suns had stopped giving away possessions, the
Lakers had built the lead to 72-56 - capped by O'Neal's backcourt
steal of Corie Blount's inbounds pass.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with four blocks, Bryant with three to go with
three steals.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway led the Suns with 25 points, but Phoenix never
recovered from the third-quarter assault and trailed by double
digits the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They turned up the defense a little bit to start the third
quarter, and we didn't handle it very well,'' said Suns coach Scott
Skiles. ``They scored 28 points off our turnovers. We scored 4 off
of theirs - there's the game right there. It's been one of our
weaknesses all year long. We haven't handled the ball well on the
break, and just handling and passing the ball from point A to point
B is one of our weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a fairly simple Laker game plan was hatched: stand between
point A and point B, wait for errant pass, cruise to easy basket.
It netted 14 steals, with a team-high four by Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the style that they play,'' Bryant said. ``They're so up
and down, they like to take risks, take chances, throw lobs. ... We
just wanted to help them out. Seriously, we just wanted to put a
little pressure on them. Not to the point where we're constantly
gambling, but just playing solid defense and see what we can come
up with.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal started slowly, missing 6 of his first 7 shots, but he
soon found an easy rhythm against the undersized Suns and made 14
of 21 the rest of the way. He also regained his free-throw touch,
making 7 of 10 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   No other Lakers scored in double figures, but no one needed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense is definitely going to be the cornerstone for us,''
said Glen Rice. ``The defense has saved us many, many games. ...
You can best believe the game Wednesday night, they're not going to
turn the ball over that much. They're going to take much better
care of the ball, and they're going to come out and they're going
to be a different team Wednesday.''

FASSERO IN A GOOD STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ All of Jeff Fassero's pitches were working Sunday. He
was able to locate his fastball, slider, and splitter well,
surrendering no walks. So solid was the lefthander's outing, he did
something he hadn't done all season.
</P>
<P>
   He worked six innings in a start.
</P>
<P>
   Five innings has been a cinch for the nine-year veteran. Sunday
was his longest outing of the season, as he overcame a two-run
first to hold the Devil Rays to one run and six hits over the next
five frames.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left in the sixth (his plea to manager Jimy
Williams to return for the seventh was turned down), Fassero had an
8-3 lead, and the Red Sox withstood Tampa Bay's four-run eighth to
preserve his third consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to get stretched out a little bit. Six innings was
good today,'' said Fassero, who improved to 4-1 and has won three
straight for the first time since 1998, when he pitched for
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up nine hits and three earned runs, and added a
season-high six strikeouts. It marked the first time he pitched at
least six innings since Aug. 1 of last season, against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got past it; the thing I hated was seeing the bullpen get up
early in the game,'' Fassero said. ``It's not like I'm giving up
rockets or something like that. I got double plays when I needed
them, and as long as I don't walk guys I'm not going to get into
any trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering Sunday's game, righthanded hitters were batting .400
against Fassero, the second-highest average against a starter in
the league (former Red Sox Ron Mahay, now with Oakland, is first).
</P>
<P>
   Fassero faced a mostly righthanded-hitting team Sunday, and got
in trouble from the outset. Gerald Williams led off with a single
and Miguel Cairo followed with a bunt single to the mound, then
reached second on a throwing error by Fassero, with Williams
advancing to third.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out Greg Vaughn, Fassero gave up a double to Jose
Canseco, scoring Williams and Cairo. But he got out of the inning
by retiring Fred McGriff and Vinny Castilla on grounders. In the
third, he gave up a single to McGriff that scored Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a single in each of the next three innings, but the
only Devil Ray who got past first was Cairo, who stole second and
third in the fifth. But he was stranded when Fassero struck out
Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had some tough luck early,'' said catcher Jason Varitek
about Fassero. ``Those three runs were tough luck, they really
were. He made good pitches and stayed within himself from there. He
gave us a chance to get our bats going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could throw my slider for a strike when I needed to,''
Fassero said. ``I didn't try to overthrow anything, and I think
that helped, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt that the Red Sox, who averaged 8.2 runs when
Fassero pitched, scored eight for him Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've fallen into a good slot this year,'' said Fassero. ``We
score a lot of runs the day I go out there and pitch, and that
makes it easier to go out there every inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassero worked five innings in each of his previous five starts.
In his only defeat, a 1-0 loss to Oakland April 17, he got one out
in the sixth. After a no-decision his first outing of the season,
he has worked on his mechanics and it is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the last start and this start, I've worked on keeping
my back leg straighter and trying to keep that downhill plane,''
said Fassero. ``I want to keep getting the ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a lot of grounders and they're not hitting the
ball exceptionally hard. That means I'm getting late movement at
the end of the pitch and I'm happy with that.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Friday night they banged out 10 hits, including six for
extra bases. In Sunday's 9-7 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at
Fenway Park, they had 12 hits, including three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The aberration came Saturday, when they could only come up with
three hits against Steve Trachsel in a 1-0 loss that ruined a
17-strikeout performance by Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox will tell you their production Sunday was more
indicative of their skills and potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't hit on all cylinders yet,'' said Trot Nixon, who
blasted his fifth home run (his first at Fenway) into the
right-field stands in the third inning that was followed one out
later by a Troy O'Leary blast to the same vicinity. ``But we're not
far off. Troy had a great game, and Offie (Jose Offerman) is
starting to do the things he does best, which is getting on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Add the production of Carl Everett, who banged his 10th home run
of the season, a three-run shot to center in the fifth, and you
have a team that can produce runs in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary is the latest Red Sox to get as hot as the weather,
which turned summerlike over the weekend. The left fielder had his
first three-hit performance since an opening-week effort at Anaheim
by ripping his fifth homer of the season in the third and banging
two more hits.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to indicate the end to a mini-slump for the quiet,
shy outfielder who entered amid a 4-for-19 stretch when nothing
seemed to be falling for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy's a very good hitter,'' said manager Jimy Williams. ``He
was before I got here. To me, he's going to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone did Sunday, with only shortstop Andy Sheets and
center fielder Darren Lewis going hitless.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox took note of the difference a day made. ``Everyone
hit the ball hard today,'' said Everett, who has been doing that
all season. ``Troy hit the ball hard, Trot hit it hard. It was
quite a difference from (Saturday).''
</P>
<P>
   The encouraging news for the Red Sox is that, as Nixon pointed
out, the players have not all hit their offensive stride at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our best hitters have not had the best of starts,''
said catcher Jason Varitek, who contributed two hits and a run
batted in. ``That's the encouraging part.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said maybe the arrival of warm weather means a change is
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just so frustrating,'' he said of Saturday's game. ``To
have a guy get 17 strikeouts and not win. (Saturday) we couldn't do
a thing, and today balls were flying left and right. I think once
things start to warm up, this club will start to hit and do some
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett says it doesn't matter where the power comes from,
whether it is from Offerman (who has had five hits in the last
three games) at the top of the lineup, or third baseman Wilton
Veras at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   And the center fielder doesn't care about numbers. ``I don't
think about stats at all,'' he said, although in three games as a
designated hitter this season he has five hits in 10 at-bats, with
three doubles, a home run, five runs scored, and eight runs batted
in. ``If they didn't put it in front of my face, I wouldn't know
what my stats are. Numbers don't tell the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they do, but Everett's point is that the number that
counts the most is games won, which they did twice in the
three-game series with Detroit and twice in the three-game series
with Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   He knows there will be times when all the Boston bats are
stopped like they were Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the way the Red Sox feel about themselves and what they have
shown in the first month suggest that games like Sunday's will be
more the rule than the exception.

REVOLUTION LIKE VIEW FROM THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After four years pursuing D.C. United, the Revolution
have finally overtaken the three-time MLS Cup champs _ at least
temporarily. And, instead of playing the role of the self-deluded
challenger, the Revolution are preparing for Saturday's visit to
Washington as the Eastern Division leader.
</P>
<P>
   The role reversal resulted from a drastic downturn in the D.C.
defense and some steady performances by the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams made a breakthrough Saturday. United took a 5-2
victory at Colorado, reconfirming the team's explosiveness but
doing little to dispatch doubts about the defense. D.C. could pull
into a tie for the division lead by winning in Miami Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, meanwhile, were sparked by Mauricio Ramos in a
2-1 win over San Jose, but possibly lost Leonel Alvarez (left
ankle) and Wolde Harris (shin) along with John Harkes (calf).
</P>
<P>
   The situation has reaffirmed some of coach Fernando Clavijo's
assessments of his team. But Clavijo is treading the line between
outright confidence and cautious optimism. Clavijo, in his first
season with New England, does not carry the baggage of coaching a
team that has never finished better than second-to-last place.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Revolution have never been in first place two
months into the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I didn't know that,'' Clavijo said Sunday.
``Everyone wants to be in first place every season. Unfortunately,
some teams have never achieved those goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``(D.C.) scored five goals on Colorado, which shows they have
the power to do it. They did not go from a great team to a bad team
overnight, but they were going through some hard times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played well against them at home (a 2-1 overtime win April
15) and if we have everyone back we should be all right. They are
the defending champions and they think they need to rebound. We
need to hold our ground. And if everyone stays confident, plays
smart, and sacrifices for the good of the team, we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo hopes to continue with the 3-5-2 alignment that allowed
Ramos to explode against the Earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along I want to play a 3-5-2 formation,''
Clavijo said. ``We haven't been able to do it because we were
looking for a sweeper. But I am more comfortable now with Brian
Dunseth in back, along with Rusty Pierce and Ivan McKinley.''
</P>
<P>
   Clavijo is likely to stay with the formation against United.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say don't change something if it's working,'' Clavijo
said. ``When I thought about it before the San Jose game, I decided
why not try it? Yes, you could lose badly but you could also win
big.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mental part of the game is the most important thing. You
have to stay positive. No matter what happened in the past, there
is nothing we can do about it now. We control our own destiny. If
we are clicking on all cylinders, and we are healthy, and our minds
are in the game, this is one of the deepest teams in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rican midfielder William Sunsing was uninjured but his car
was totaled in an accident in New York Sunday . . . The Revolution
now have 38 3-point victories in 138 games. Their home record is
25-32-12 (102-100 goal differential); their road record is 13-47-9
(85-144).

RELIVING RICE'S ALLEY-OOP OOPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The most memorable vision of Glen Rice on Sunday
wasn't exactly one for the highlight file: Rice, tripping over the
Phoenix Suns' Shawn Marion while attempting a rare alley-oop dunk,
turning his left ankle in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The ball sailed harmlessly out of bounds on the unusual play.
And as the Lakers rolled to a 105-77 victory, Rice settled for a
quiet contribution of seven points and five rebounds. But he's
figuring on better opportunities as this best-of-seven series
progresses.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns eventually will need to send help toward the paint to
prevent another 37-point night from Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to have to make some adjustments,'' Rice said,
``and the minute they give me a little breathing room, I'm going to
have to make them pay.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't easy Sunday, with Marion draped over Rice for much
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically staying home on me, and any time I get a
little breathing room, it's probably going to be in the transition
offense,'' said Rice, the Lakers' third leading scorer and top 3-
point threat.
</P>
<P>
   With few perimeter opportunities, Rice went for the
unconventional (for him, anyway) - the alley-oop pass from Kobe
Bryant early in the third quarter. All it got him was a sprained
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, that's probably why you don't see me going for too
many,'' Rice said with a laugh. ``My ankle rolled over on me. All I
could do as I was falling is watch the ball sail out of bounds. ...
It's a little swollen now. It's a little sore. But we've got
(today) to get in there and get some treatment. I'm sure by
Wednesday, it'll be all better.''
</P>
<P>
   Role playing: Derek Fisher has been in and out of the rotation,
but he seems to have a clear-cut part in this series: defend Kevin
Johnson. As the Lakers' lone small, quick guard, Fisher spent much
of Game 1 moving on and off the floor when Johnson did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's a great player and always has been,'' said Fisher.
``Growing up in Little Rock (Ark.), Cal actually came down to
Little Rock and played one year. I must have been like 9 or 10
years old and remember seeing him play then. So he's been doing
this for a long time. At the same time, competing against him and
wanting to beat him as my opponent, but also respecting him and
learning from how he plays the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Slow start: The Lakers' shooting percentage of 43.5 was
deceiving, dragged down by a 5 for 23 first quarter. They traced
the slow start in part to the quick turnaround from Friday's Game 5
clincher against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was tough on us mentally making the adjustment to
now, OK, it's a new team, we have to play pick and roll a new way,
there are new matchups, you have to do things differently,'' Fisher
said. ``We didn't have shootaround this morning, so we didn't
really have a chance to get the legs going. I believe a lot of that
had to do with the slow start, especially shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bryant: ``Our legs were just a little heavy. I think the
(four) days off kind of helped (the Suns).''

NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP FOR PHOENIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Jell-O was jiggling, the butter was getting
hard, Game 1 was in the refrigerator for the Lakers. Because a
sellout crowd had turned up at the Staples Center and a network
television audience had tuned in, they played out the final three
quarters of their second-round playoff opener against Phoenix
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly didn't help Jason Kidd's surgically repaired ankle
and the Suns' collective psyche to sweat and stagger through 36
minutes more, just to wind up on the embarrassing end of the 105-77
final score.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Lakers' 28-point margin of victory, the game's most
telling numbers were contained in the first quarter statistics: The
Lakers shot 21.7 percent from the field, went more than eight
minutes before pulling down their first offensive rebound, had two
measly assists and looked up at the scoreboard after 12 minutes to
find the score knotted at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. If the Suns can't carve out a lead on the
Lakers when Shaquille O'Neal is missing six of seven shots and Kobe
Bryant is misfiring on three of four attempts and ex-Laker Corie
Blount is controlling the defensive boards, then what does that say
about the Suns' chances of taking four of seven games in the
series?
</P>
<P>
   Not much, if you ask us.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been one thing if the Suns had come out and
wrapped up the Lakers shooters like leftovers in cellophane, and
that's what caused the cacophony of clanks. In fact, the Lakers
were suffocating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix coach Scott Skiles could have credited his starting
frontcourt of Shawn Marion, Cliff Robinson and Luc Longley for
shutting down O'Neal in the early going. Instead he opted for the
truth. O'Neal ``had some decent looks,'' Skiles said, ``and missed
them.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's missed shots were as contagious as a yawn. His
teammates saw his shots bounce off the rim and next thing they knew
they were reflexively misfiring too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed some easy shots,'' starting point guard Ron Harper
said. ``I know because I missed (four) of them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers were just about Bryant's slashes and O'Neal's
slams, it might have been a long afternoon for Los Angeles. But the
Lakers are much more than they appear; behind that bewitching
offense is a blue-collar defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers clogged the Suns' passing lanes and forced 23
turnovers, off which they scored 28 points by Skiles' count.
</P>
<P>
   That's the game right there. That's going to be the series, too,
unless the Suns can find a way to do onto the Lakers as the Lakers
did onto them; that is, prevent the ball from getting inside to
O'Neal by pressuring the perimeter players into bad passes and bad
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Lakers were reading the Suns, they appeared to have
Phoenix's playbook down better than the Phoenix players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did an excellent job defensively, no doubt about that,''
said Bryant, adding, ``I love playing defense.''
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon, it showed. The ball was like a yo-yo in
Bryant's hands; it kept finding its way back to him. He contributed
three steals and three blocked shots along with 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bryant is like a bird dog, sniffing out the
basketball on both ends of the court. The difference in Bryant last
season and now, said Blount, his former teammate, is that there
seems to be a method to Bryant's constant motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I see changed in Kobe is he doesn't force a lot
of shots like he used to,'' Blount said. ``His shot selection is a
lot better and so is his control.''
</P>
<P>
   The scary thing is Bryant's mind moves as fast as his feet. He
caught Kidd limping in the second quarter and started driving on
him. It was as if Bryant was a Porsche and Kidd was parked on the
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, playing in his second game since having his left ankle put
back together with screws, finished with three points and five
turnovers, the latter of which left more of an impression than his
seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was O'Neal, who made 14 of 21 shots over the final
three quarters to finish with a game-high 37 points. O'Neal and
Bryant buried the Suns. Resurrecting themselves in Wednesday's Game
2 isn't going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' Bryant said. ``They have a choice to make. Do
they want to pack in the middle or do they want to double me on the
perimeter?. They can't do both.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns didn't do either on Sunday and they got burned. How
severely, we'll have to wait and see. From where we sat, it didn't
look good.

<P>
   DALLAS _ Coming into Reunion Arena down 3-1 in a best-of-seven
series was tough enough for the San Jose Sharks. But their hopes
for continuing their season were hampered even more when they took
the ice without two of their top skaters.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Bryan Marchment and right winger Owen Nolan were
sidelined last night, and their absences were felt immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Marchment, who suffered a groin injury in Friday's game and
didn't make the trip, had been a crucial defender against the
Stars' Joe Nieuwendyk, who scored twice last night.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan's injury was a little more complicated. He was reported to
be suffering the ``flu'' when he was scratched prior to Game 5. But
after the Sharks were eliminated, Nolan admitted to having a lower
abdominal pull, which he suffered in Round 1's Game 7 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously losing Nolan was a huge loss,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said ``Our players commented that after games, they
noticed him wincing on the ice. That tells you that he had more
than a foot injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan had been pivotal on the Sharks' power plays and scored two
goals in the series.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose coach Darryl Sutter said the decision to scratch Nolan
was made last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we used it as an excuse at all,'' Sutter said
about losing the two players.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks players felt the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not using that as an excuse,'' right winger Todd Harvey
said. ``We've got 20 guys in here that suited up tonight and
expected to win this. We didn't do the job. We didn't put the puck
in the net. Against a team like that, as soon as they get a lead,
it's tough to get goals.''  &QL; 
No early lead
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Sutter had stressed all series that his team had to score
first. But for the fifth consecutive game, the Stars lit the red
light first..
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to play against one of the best defensive teams in
the league when you're behind and playing catch up,'' center
Vincent Damphousse said. ``That was one of the big points that we
mentioned coming into this series, and we didn't do it. It was one
more aspect we weren't able to do. The first 10 minutes of any game
is always important, especially against Dallas. We had our chances.
We just couldn't get the lead.''  &QL; 
Finally, a goal
</P>
<P>
   For 2 1/2 periods, it looked as if the Sharks would leave town
0-for-Dallas last night. They lost all three games at Reunion
Arena, but avoided a third consecutive shutout when Patrick Marleau
scored] on the power play at 8:32 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks had 33 shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of guys not score goals in the playoffs,'' Darryl
Sutter said.
</P>
<P>
   The goalless streak looked as if it might end in the second
period, when the Sharks fired 13 shots at Stars goalie Ed Belfour.
Starting at the 8:17 mark of the second period, the Sharks put a
heavy attack on Belfour, but he squashed all comers.  &QL; 
Sharks don't feel power
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' only goal did come on a power play in the third
period, but they missed several opportunities on their first power
play in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks got off three good shots, but they weren't able to
penetrate Ed Belfour. They also came up empty on another power
play, late in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to put something by them in the series, and we
just didn't, and it cost us the series,'' winger Jeff Friesen said.
``We didn't quit, but we didn't get the big goals at the right time
of the game. It's just an opportunity that we let slip.''  &QL; 
Too many giveaways
</P>
<P>
   After reducing their giveaways to 15 in Game 4, the Sharks
served up 11 in a first period last night that proved to be their
undoing. A giveaway by Patrick Marleau in the Sharks' zone led to
Scott Thornton's goal at 13:34 to give the Stars a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice was real bad,'' rookie defenseman Brad Stuart said.
``At the same time, when you know it's like that, you have to keep
it simple, and we didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jeff Norton had a close call later in the period when
his attempted pass from the Sharks' goal line deflected high off
Guy Carbonneau's stick, hit rookie defenseman Scott Hannan on the
back and nearly trickled into the goal.  &QL; 
Sundstrom a passenger
</P>
<P>
   Sharks winger Niklas Sundstrom did not have a good series. To
steal a favorite term of Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, Sundstrom was a
``passenger,'' a players who is around for the ride but doesn't
contribute much to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   For a team dying to find a goal scorer, Sundstrom, a third-line
winger, had one assist in the series, that came in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   He's not asked to be a major contributor of offense, but during
the season, the Sharks went 19-4-6 when he recorded a point.  &QL; 
Quick shave
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Sharks shaved their playoff facial hair immediately
after the game. Jeff Norton got rid of his goatee, and Scott Hannan
shaved off his side burns that had stretched to his jawbone.

in the net. Against a team like that, as soon as they get a lead,
it's tough to get goals.''  &QL; 
No early lead
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Sutter had stressed all series that his team had to score
first. But for the fifth consecutive game, the Stars lit the red
light first..
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to play against one of the best defensive teams in
the league when you're behind and playing catch up,'' center
Vincent Damphousse said. ``That was one of the big points that we
mentioned coming into this series, and we didn't do it. It was one
more aspect we weren't able to do. The first 10 minutes of any game
is always important, especially against Dallas. We had our chances.
We just couldn't get the lead.''  &QL; 
Finally, a goal
</P>
<P>
   For 2 1/2 periods, it looked as if the Sharks would leave town
0-for-Dallas last night. They lost all three games at Reunion
Arena, but avoided a third consecutive shutout when Patrick Marleau
scored] on the power play at 8:32 of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks had 33 shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of guys not score goals in the playoffs,'' Darryl
Sutter said.
</P>
<P>
   The goalless streak looked as if it might end in the second
period, when the Sharks fired 13 shots at Stars goalie Ed Belfour.
Starting at the 8:17 mark of the second period, the Sharks put a
heavy attack on Belfour, but he squashed all comers.  &QL; 
Sharks don't feel power
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' only goal did come on a power play in the third
period, but they missed several opportunities on their first power
play in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks got off three good shots, but they weren't able to
penetrate Ed Belfour. They also came up empty on another power
play, late in the third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had to put something by them in the series, and we
just didn't, and it cost us the series,'' winger Jeff Friesen said.
``We didn't quit, but we didn't get the big goals at the right time
of the game. It's just an opportunity that we let slip.''  &QL; 
Too many giveaways
</P>
<P>
   After reducing their giveaways to 15 in Game 4, the Sharks
served up 11 in a first period last night that proved to be their
undoing. A giveaway by Patrick Marleau in the Sharks' zone led to
Scott Thornton's goal at 13:34 to give the Stars a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ice was real bad,'' rookie defenseman Brad Stuart said.
``At the same time, when you know it's like that, you have to keep
it simple, and we didn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jeff Norton had a close call later in the period when
his attempted pass from the Sharks' goal line deflected high off
Guy Carbonneau's stick, hit rookie defenseman Scott Hannan on the
back and nearly trickled into the goal.  &QL; 
Sundstrom a passenger
</P>
<P>
   Sharks winger Niklas Sundstrom did not have a good series. To
steal a favorite term of Stars coach Ken Hitchcock, Sundstrom was a
``passenger,'' a players who is around for the ride but doesn't
contribute much to the cause.
</P>
<P>
   For a team dying to find a goal scorer, Sundstrom, a third-line
winger, had one assist in the series, that came in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   He's not asked to be a major contributor of offense, but during
the season, the Sharks went 19-4-6 when he recorded a point.  &QL; 
Quick shave
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Sharks shaved their playoff facial hair immediately
after the game. Jeff Norton got rid of his goatee, and Scott Hannan
shaved off his side burns that had stretched to his jawbone.

HE'S SENDING A FRANK MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In case you were wondering, Frank Robinson says he
was never slapped with a fine or a suspension for getting into a
baseball brawl during his 21-year playing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never fined, never suspended,'' he repeated when asked during
halftime of Sunday's Lakers-Suns playoff game at Staples Center,
where he and his family sat in their usual baseline courtside
seats.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the sport's new big-shot suspension-giver-outer-guy
laughs when asked if all the heavy duty punishment he's been
dishing lately to big leaguers is payback for someone who once
wronged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the case at all,'' said Robinson, who happens to be
third on the all-time list for being hit with a pitch at 198.
</P>
<P>
   OK, there was one time he thought about going out to the mound
as a member of the Cincinnati Reds, against San Francisco pitcher
Ron Herbel at Candlestick Park. But all the while, he was hoping
someone would stop him before he got there. Someone did.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one message the one-time Dodgers and Angels
outfielder wants to get across, it is that today's athletes need to
understand something basic. They're not entitled to go crazy when
someone invades their territory. It's part of the game. And the
managers a job he also once held have to be held accountable as
well.
</P>
<P>
   He compares baseball's problem in this area to the NBA, where
players ``jaw at people, go dunk on other players. In baseball, if
the pitcher throws inside, he's staring at the hitter, the hitter
will jaw back at him. That has to stop.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   -You gotta realize that Tommy Lasorda won't be doing any actual
managing when he's down under with the boys of Sydney, waving the
flag of the U-S-of-A. Press conferences, back-slapping and wearing
out the starting pitcher's arm are his forte.
</P>
<P>
   It'll be up to those who are selected as coaches to do the real
dirty work. ...
</P>
<P>
   -It shouldn't have taken a devoiding injury to Devo for Davey
Johnson to recognize Todd Hollandsworth's value as an everyday
player. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Wonder what Blackjack McDowell thinks of actor Jack Black doing
the Marvin Gaye classic ``Let's Get It On'' in the flick ``High
Fidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, it beats Mills Lane screaming it out. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Tiger Woods, who appears as himself this week at the Byron
Nelson Classic, did a very stand-up thing by disappearing for a
Nike commercial out of respect for the picketing Screen Actors
Guild.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who has made more than $3 mil in just eight Tour events
this year can afford to do it, sure. But The Tidy Bowl guy thanks
you for your support. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Pat Riley tells the New York Times he has sold six screenplays,
``to all of the studios,'' but none have been made into movies.
Yet.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is entitled ``The Seventh Game.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   -And you just know it'll be a Miami-Lakers final, something a
scriptwriter can't help but dream up. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Former NBA great Bill Russell, who got HBO to do a flattering
documentary on his career called ``My Way'' last month, is now
trying to motivate a book publisher to give him the cash to do a
motivational book. ...
</P>
<P>
   -One-time Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Carre Otis appears
in the June issue of Playboy. Without her swimsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, we see no difference. ...
</P>
<P>
   -Jenine Sahadi is one tough filly. ...
</P>
<P>
   -One theory as to why there seems to be more hit-and-run
incidents these days: After a wreck in a NASCAR event, you never
see both drivers pull off to the side and exchange insurance
information.

SHARKS KNEW WHAT TO DO, BUT COULDN'T DO IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Owen Nolan finally acknowledged that he never really
had the flu, and the Sharks confessed the Stars can be vulnerable
if you follow the correct formula.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these revelations came after last night's 4-1 Stars
victory that sent the eighth-seeded and once upstart Sharks home in
five games.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan did not play in the decisive game and told the waiting
world after the game that his mystery illness, which also forced
him out of Game 2, was a lower abdominal pull suffered in Game 7
against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with a lot of pain the last game. I emptied the
tank,'' the Sharks captain said of that wild affair that the Stars
won, 5-4. ``I had nothing left.''
</P>
<P>
   And as far as this vulnerability thing regarding the Stars as
they prepare for a Western Conference finals rematch against the
Colorado Avalanche, well, the Sharks figured out what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get the lead going into the third period, they will
open up,'' Sharks center Vincent Damphousse said.
</P>
<P>
   How to do it is the Avalanche's riddle to solve now. The Sharks
certainly had no luck. They managed one lead this series, that
coming in Game 3 when they took a 2-1 lead into the third period
and made it stand.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Sharks goalie Steve Shields gave up the game's first
goal in the first period for the fifth consecutive game, enabling
the Stars to drop into their suffocating defensive system with only
half the first period expired.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott Thornton slid Stars goal No. 2 through Shields' legs
at the 13:34 mark of the first period, the Sharks were then simply
choked out of humid Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they have everyone playing on the same page, playing the
same way, buying into that program that \RStars coach Ken\S
Hitchcock has them playing, they are a tough team to play
against,'' Sharks veteran Ron Sutter said. ``You have to pay the
price and be accountable at paying that price to give yourself a
chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all 20 guys, not just three or four guys on every
shift, but all five guys together. No individual effort is going to
beat that team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche was almost certainly watching last night, watching
Ed Belfour stop 32 shots, 25 of 26 in the second and third periods.
The second period was the Sharks' to win. They outshot the Stars,
13-4, and applied heavy doses of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize how close we were,'' Sharks winger Jeff Friesen
said. ``If we had some guys step up and score some big goals, we
might be moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, players such as Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic and the
recovering man on a mission, Ray Bourque, almost certainly took
note of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team that plays hard below the circles, that's got the
guys with the guts to do it, can create chances and score goals,''
Sutter said. ``They're the Stanley Cup champs, and I think it's
open. We felt it was open for any team.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps any team that can take a lead into the third period.

WESTERN FINALS A REMATCH OF '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Avalanche is coming.
</P>
<P>
   The highly anticipated matchup is here. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars will meet the Colorado Avalanche with a berth in the
Stanley Cup Finals at stake. The NHL won't release the dates for
the series until at least today, which means the Western Conference
finals will start no earlier than Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stars fans can't wait.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Stars had even wrapped up their semifinal series with
a 4-1 victory against the San Jose Sharks last night, the Reunion
Arena crowd of 17,001 was chanting for the Avalanche. Stars players
were happy for a day off before preparation begins for Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a serious series,'' Stars center Mike
Modano said. ``Everybody has been waiting for this matchup, a
rematch of last year. It's a great opportunity. You are eight wins
away from it, but we're going to have our hands full.''
</P>
<P>
   On their way to the Stanley Cup last season, the Stars defeated
the Avalanche in seven games in the Western Conference finals. With
apologies to the St. Louis Blues, who won the Presidents' Trophy as
the NHL's best regular-season team, the Stanley Cup still goes
through Dallas and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely two of the top teams. I don't know if it's
the two best teams,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``At
this time of the year, everybody's here for a reason. But it's two
great teams in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado was only 30-27-10 before acquiring defenseman Ray
Bourque in a trade with Boston on March 6. The Avalanche is 20-4-1
since, including an 8-2 playoff record, although Bourque missed the
last two games of the semifinal series against the Detroit Red
Wings with an injured left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fooling ourselves,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
``We're playing the hottest team in the National Hockey League. We
were chuckling a little bit because this is the first time in a
very long time that this team \RDallas\S has come in as an
underdog. But we all saw what they did to Detroit, and Detroit's a
hell of a hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were 1-3-1 against Colorado this season, but they
still have their memories of their playoff series against them last
season. Dallas won the last two games in the seven-game series to
advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that they lost last year, they've got that
vengeance in their eyes,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``We
know they're going to come hard. But this team likes to play in
those games.''

STARS RUNNING ON CRUISE CONTROL WITH BELFOUR IN GEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ In the end, the story of these two weeks among the
Sharks wasn't the coaches. It wasn't the sudden resuscitation of
Joe Nieuwendyk. It wasn't Owen Nolan's courageous play amid the,
uh, flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belfour was the story in the series,'' San Jose center Vincent
Damphousse correctly answered.
</P>
<P>
   In the NHL playoffs, it is written, a team is only as good as
its goaltender. And thus far, the defending champions have been
cruising because, indeed, Eddie Belfour has been the answer for
nearly every Stars question.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's second period acrobatics yesterday slammed the final
door on the Sharks. Jeered in San Jose, swaddled in adoration at
Reunion Arena, Belfour came close to pitching his third consecutive
home-ice shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the difference in the series had a lot to do with
Eddie's play,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said after the Stars' 4-1
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was outstanding, especially the game he played in the
second period today.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Stars clutching a 2-0 lead, Belfour withstood a wave of
Sharks chances, including one with Damphousse nearly parked in his
lap. Another save came with Belfour sprawled across the ice, and
still another came when he snared Jeff Friesen's one-on-one chance
with his mitt.
</P>
<P>
   When the visitors went to the second intermission still
scoreless and trailing 2-0, an air of festive inevitability began
to overtake Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cup stays here! Cup stays here!'' the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
   And with seven minutes left and the Stars lining up for a
face-off in their own end, the arena PA began to play the Jimi
Hendrix classic, ``Are You Experienced?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, so they are.
</P>
<P>
   No more so than Belfour, who has been there and _ at long last _
done that. Eddie himself gave a stock answer to the
post-Cup-confidence question yesterday, but in so many ways he's
been answering it all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think throughout the season, he's been our most consistent
over-achiever,'' general manager Bob Gainey said yesterday. ``I
think \RMike\S Modano came on at about the 60 percent point and
from there was like a snowball rolling downhill, whereas Eddie
started with game one and hasn't slipped.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is amazing, considering the, uh, distractions that Belfour
faced in March _ the alleged headlock on the hotel security guard,
the alleged spirited ride to the police station, and the alleged
charm that Eddie exhibited therein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him play this well,'' said the Sharks' Darryl
Sutter, who coached Belfour briefly in San Jose. ``But he plays so
much more in control now. You've all seen it. I think that's the
big secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, in this best-of-seven series cut short, Belfour
laughably outplayed his San Jose counterpart. Sharks goalie Steve
Shields seemed either asleep or oblivious to two of the Stars' four
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be rude, but as much as Belfour was the difference for
the Stars in this series, so, too, was Shields for his team _ in
all the wrong ways.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he felt the Stars were beatable, though, Shields
answered, ``I don't know what they were like in the playoffs last
year, but I feel like they were beatable this time. We played a
couple of one-goal games where, if we would have gotten a few more
breaks, we could have won those games and we would've been right
there with them.''
</P>
<P>
   See? He really was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   But the story was Belfour, Captain Headlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a continuation of what Ed did all year, with all
the injuries we've had,'' defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``He
played exceptional hockey last year when we won the Stanley Cup,
and he's carried it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the best goalies in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The personally acclaimed best in the world, of course, comes up
next. Certain to be discussed in the coming days are the remarks
that Belfour made that reportedly rubbed the ermine fur of
Colorado's Patrick Roy the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like the challenge of playing against Patrick,''
Belfour said, simply.
</P>
<P>
   He knows _ from experience.

LONG BEACH STRENGTHENS POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Somewhere in the Dirtbag locker room sits a
trash can full of baseball caps -- the team's cool gray-top,
black-billed caps, black caps with the white interlocked LB, black
caps with the logo in gold, and some sweat-soaked, funky smelling
practice caps that the Environment Protection Agency might consider
toxic.
</P>
<P>
   They reside in this bucket because 49ers baseball coach Dave
Snow felt the need to give his team a shake, and how better than to
deny them the privilege of wearing a Dirtbag cap? So before the
weekend series with Pacific began, he collected the headgear and
handed his players generic black hats.
</P>
<P>
   Did the psychological ploy work? Well, the Dirtbags beat Pacific
4-3 Sunday to sweep the series and strength its position for a Big
West title and NCAA tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning, catcher Bryan Kennedy stepped up with a
huge defensive play to save the win, the kind of play that has
always distinguished what Dirtbag baseball is about.
</P>
<P>
   But even after the sweep, Snow admits he still doesn't have a
feel for this team. He's had several teams in his dozen at Long
Beach develop a personality late in the season, but never this far
into the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirtbags are 29-20 overall and 16-8 in the Big West, a game
behind their primary rival, Fullerton. They have seven games left,
a Tuesday game at UCLA, a series at third-place Nevada (31-17,
15-9), and then the Titans at home to end the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our opportunities are ahead of us,'' Snow said. ``The whole
hat idea was to just try something different, to shake them up and
send a message. We needed something to rally around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a strange season. We haven't had that one
inspirational leader who's willing to take the team on his
shoulders and not let them bail.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's uncharacteristic of the teams we've had here. When we
hit our rough spot (this season), the players didn't take it as a
challenge to step up. They've let the setbacks and losses drag them
down. It's almost like we gave in to the adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been plenty of that. After winning 15 of 16 games to
improve to 16-4 and a No. 8 national ranking, the 49ers went 10-16
over their next 26 games, including a six-game losing streak, the
longest ever under Snow.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't won a mid-week non-conference win since mid-March,
suffering two losses to sub-.500 Northridge as well as Wednesday's
come-from-ahead 8-7 loss San Diego. They lost two of three to
Sacramento State in April, and followed two wins in three games
against Fullerton by blowing a three-game series to UCSB.
</P>
<P>
   How rare is that? UCSB had a grand total of five wins against
Snow in the previous 11 years. Twenty-two of the 49ers' 42 Big West
losses the previous six seasons had been claimed by two schools,
Fullerton and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's teams have always been resilient. His '91 team staggered
down the stretch (5-6 in its last 11) but won its regional and
advanced to the College World Series. His 1993 team opened 12-12
but closed 26-5, then swept its regional and advanced to the World
Series. His 1995 team was 21-19-1 before winning 13 of their next
14 and coming one misplayed bunt in a regional final of another
World Series trip.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 team opened 6-10 then won 20 of 23 and took LSU to the
title game of a regional. His 1998 team went to the CWS, too. That
squad opened 2-8-1 then won 16 of 17. It had another 2-8 slump,
too, before 11 straight wins and a KO of No. 1-ranked Stanford in
the regional.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Kennedy, outfielder Chuck Lopez and pitchers Jason Berni
and Jeff Leuenberger were members of that '98 team. Kennedy says
the difference between that team and the 2000 team comes down to
the little things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled at times when I was a freshman, but not like
this,'' Kennedy said. ``You can't point to any one thing and say
`that's it,' other than a lot of the little things, like driving in
a runner from third with one out.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The 49ers came into Sunday's game hitting .305, had a
respectable 4.36 earned run average, and was playing good defense,
highlighted by shortstop Bobby Crosby, who has made just three
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a thought: Maybe the pool of potential Dirtbags is
shallow. The nonchalance of pro athletes has infected younger
athletes and turned the ``team'' concept into an anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   Said Kennedy, responding in general to a broad question not
about his teammates: Being a Dirtbag is what I want to be. But I
think there are a lot of guys out there who are results driven.
When you come to Long Beach, coach stresses that you have to put
your own personality aside for the good of the team, because that's
what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow said his pool is still full. But it should be noted that
the 49ers have started three different players at third base this
season, and that last year's third baseman, Lou Dobbs, who hit .376
with 63 RBI, wasn't invited back.
</P>
<P>
   Snow prefers to look forward. Sunday, his team had eight hits
and four runs in the first four innings, but just two hit
thereafter. In Pacific's ninth, a bloop single, balk and sacrifice
put the game-tying run on third. The situation looked too familiar.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy raced up the third-base line to corral a wild throw
from Chuck Lopez after a fly out, keeping the Pacific on third, and
Crosby got a generous hop on a grounder off the mound for the
game's final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time of year, we talk about doing the things in the field
that represents Dirtbag baseball,'' said Snow of Kennedy's save.
``It's the kind of thing which gives character to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of thing which can earn them back their caps, too.

NIEUWENDYK SUPPLIES SPARK TO SECOND LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS_ Call the post office and milk carton manufacturers. The
search for Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk is over.
</P>
<P>
   He's alive and scoring, and looking more and more like the 1999
Conn Smythe Trophy winner.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring the first goal in last night's series-clinching
4-1 Stars victory against San Jose, Nieuwendyk has given the Stars
something that Western Conference finals opponent Colorado has: two
lines that are rolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe elevated his game,'' Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said. ``We
talked before the series about them having two dominant centers,
and both of them showed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 4 at San Jose, however, it was one dominant center:
Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   His line, along with Brenden Morrow and Brett Hull, posted a
streak from Games 1 through 4 where it provided all the offense for
more than 148 minutes. After those games, Nieuwendyk was inundated
with questions about when he thought he was going to break out of a
slump that saw him score one goal in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you miss as much time as I did, you want to come back and
have everything be the same,'' said Nieuwendyk, who had injury
problems this season. ``The last little while I'm starting to feel
the intensity of it, getting involved more and just applying myself
a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   With two goals in the Game 4-victory, Nieuwendyk was back. In
Games 1 through 3, he had one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played very strong tonight,'' Stars general
manager Bob Gainey said. ``It adds a dimension that has only been
there sporadically.''
</P>
<P>
   The dimension is a second productive line. In Games 1 through 3,
the line of Nieuwendyk, Jamie Langenbrunner (who missed Game 3) and
Scott Thornton combined for two points.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the past two games:
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk: Three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner: Three assists.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton: One goal, two assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depended on Modano's line a lot since the beginning of the
playoffs,'' Thornton said. ``But, you need a supporting cast to win
in the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   With Colorado and their center combination of Joe Sakic and
Peter Forsberg, who have combined for 16 points in the playoffs,
the Stars know that to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals, at least
two lines must be producing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to take anything away from \RModano\S, but the further you
go in the playoffs, if you only have one line going, I don't think
you're going to win,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. ``We
showed that last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential problem for the Avalanche is, which line checks
which? Throw defensemen Adam Foote and Ray Bourque at Modano's line
or Nieuwendyk's line? If both are scoring, it can be like choosing
between jumping into a fire or a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think especially against Bourque and Foote, whoever
plays against those guys are going to have their hands full,''
Modano said. ``Hopefully our two lines can push them to the limits
and wear them down and cause them to decide which line they are
going to play against.''
</P>
<P>
   With Nieuwendyk scoring, the decision just got tougher.
</P>
<P>
   This is why one fan in last night's audience had the confidence
to carry a sign that read: ``He's back. I Nieuwy he would be''.

HOLLANDSWORTH MAKING THE MOST OF IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It might be a two-week hitch or a season in center
field, but Todd Hollandsworth is more concerned with the present
than the future.
</P>
<P>
   Playing center and batting leadoff for Devon White, who could
face surgery after tearing the rotator cuff in his left shoulder
Tuesday, Hollandsworth has done well with his new opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   After doing time on the disabled list in four of the past five
seasons, Hollandsworth is the healthy one now. And it shows.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over for White last Wednesday against Atlanta,
Hollandsworth has gone 7 for 17, including a leadoff home run
Sunday in the Dodgers' 14-8 loss to the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holly is a valuable player because he can do so much for us,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``We are encouraged that Devo
is getting better, but it is good to know we have someone of
Holly's skill to step in.''
</P>
<P>
   The home run was critical after the Astros jumped out to a four-
run lead in the top of the first. It also started a five-run inning
for the Dodgers against Houston right-hander Jose Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth came in batting .429 (6 for 14) against Lima, who
had dropped five straight. Hollandsworth also went 2 for 5 Friday
night against the Astros, including a game-winning RBI single in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Big Hurt: Houston outfielder Moises Alou is one of the game's
top players, when healthy. After missing most of last season with a
knee injury, Alou is back on the disabled list with a strained
right calf muscle. It is the eighth time in nine seasons that Alou
has been on the DL, totaling 65 weeks. His father Felipe, now the
manager at Montreal, went on the DL once in his 17-year career.
Moises is set to return Friday against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming: The Dodgers open a three-game series tonight against
the NL West-leading Diamondbacks, who have won five straight.
Former Dodgers right-hander Mike Morgan has taken over for injured
Matt Mantei as the Diamondbacks' closer. Morgan, a career starter,
has four saves, one more than he had in the first 17 years of his
career. Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley is 15 for 36 lifetime against
Morgan with four homers. ...
</P>
<P>
   Arizona CF Steve Finley is among the league leaders with 11 home
runs, and it's no fluke. The once light-hitting Finley, who has
three Gold Gloves, is now one of the NL's top offensive players.
From May 3, 1999, to last Tuesday, Finley has played 156 of
Arizona's 162 games and has a .281 average, 40 homers, 116 RBI, 112
runs scored, 31 doubles and 10 triples. ... Dodgers reserve
infielder Jose Vizcaino is 1 for 11 in his career against tonight's
starter, Omar Daal, a finesse pitcher, but 4 for 10 vs. fireballer
Randy Johnson, who will pitch Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   More Big Unit: Johnson, who is 7-0 with an 0.93 ERA, tied a
major-league record with six victories in April. Last year, when
Johnson won the Cy Young Award, he did not get his sixth win until
May 30. He is on pace for 373 strikeouts, 58 walks and 152 hits
allowed in 287 innings.

VIGILANTE08 (DOUGLAS, Ariz.) _ The U.S.-Mexico border here has
become a tinderbox of resentment as complaints mount over area
ranchers' practice of detaining illegal immigrants who cross their
land and trash their property. Armed with guns, cell phones and
night-vision scopes, some of the property owners for months have
been rounding up between 20 and 80 border crossers a night and
turning them over to U.S. Border Patrol officials. Mexican
officials are bristling at reports that some of the most militant
ranchers have recently moved onto public roads to make their stops.

   SESSION (Phoenix) _ Even as she barnstorms the state to drum up
support for an education sales tax, Arizona schools chief Lisa
Graham Keegan hedges her endorsement as conditional.The condition:
creating a database on students. For five years, Keegan has pressed
for a statewide computer accounting system to track school
enrollment, dropouts and achievement. She believes the system will
better show where the billions of dollars that Arizona spends on
education goes, and whether it is properly applied. By ROBBIE

   TORSO08 (Scottsdale, Ariz.) _ When investigators examined the
smooth, straight cuts left on a torso found in a trash bin in
January, they thought somebody must have used a powerful electrical
saw to dismember the man's body. So detectives searched Ira
Pomerantz's bar, trying to find what they initially figured was a
meat-cutting instrument. Although they found nothing there, they
did find evidence in his wife's purse that she bought a
reciprocating saw late last year, according to a source close to
the investigation. By CHRISTINA LEONARD and BETH DEFALCO. Story

   QUEPASA (Phoenix) _ Arturo Jimenez is one of a growing number of
Hispanics defying the notion that they don't go online.``I use it
frequently for news, entertainment; for what's ever going on in the
Latin world,'' said Jimenez, 31, an account executive at Radio
Unica, a Spanish-language talk-radio station in Phoenix. A 1998
U.S. Department of Commerce study found that less than 13 percent
of Latino households had Internet access, compared with 30 percent
for Anglos. But in the past two years, the gap has narrowed as
increasing numbers of Latinos rush to get online, according to

<P>
   DALLAS _ Beginning this morning, Colorado coach Bob Hartley will
say all the right things about playing the Stars. They're a good
team, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing he can say will say as much as the look on his face when
a camera caught him in the stands at Reunion Arena last night. He
was watching the Stars' 4-1 whipping of the San Jose Sharks in Game
5 that put the Stars in the Western Conference finals against the
Avalanche for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley wasn't smiling. He looked like a man who had seen
something he didn't very much like. A flying Joe Nieuwendyk, a
stifling Stars defense and a focused Ed Belfour will do that to a
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think this is the best we've played all season,'' Stars
general manager Bob Gainey said after watching the Stars dispatch
the Sharks. ``We've got a lot of elements going right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Avalanche are good. They showed it by wrapping up the
Detroit Red Wings in five games on Friday night. The Stars aren't
so bad themselves. They showed that last night.
</P>
<P>
   They're about to find out how good _ playing an Avalanche team
that has won 22 of their past 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fooling ourselves. We're playing the hottest team in
the NHL,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We're chuckling a
little bit because for the first time in a very long time we're
coming in as an underdog. We saw what they did to Detroit, and
Detroit is a hell of a hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the Avalanche were indeed watching, the Stars
gave them something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   So the Avalanche rolls four lines, headlined by Peter Forsberg
and Joe Sakic? The Stars reminded us yesterday that they have four
as well. Last season's Conn Smythe winner, Nieuwendyk, scored the
first goal at 10:31 in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's back. He scored one goal and was on the ice for all
three others, including Scott Thornton's at 13:34 of the first
period. Not bad for a guy said to be struggling. He's a perfect
complement to Mike Modano, who has been playing like Conn Smythe
2000 since the playoffs began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going,'' Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner said of
Nieuwendyk. ``It just hasn't been going in the net for him. When it
doesn't go in the net for you, you start to second guess and you
maybe sit back a little bit. When that confidence comes back, you
start attacking like he has been.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Avs have a hot goalie in Patrick Roy, do they? Well, the
Stars have goalie Ed Belfour, who was every bit as good last night.
Belfour hadn't allowed a goal in 187 minutes, 25 seconds at Reunion
Arena until Sharks forward Patrick Marleau scored at 8:32 of the
third period. The Stars goalie finished with 32 saves, including 13
in the crucial second period where the Stars were outshot, 13-4.
</P>
<P>
   Reunion, coincidentally, is where Games 1 and 2 of the Western
Conference finals will be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with him for almost 10 years so I know how he can
play. When he starts the season, he wants to win the Stanley Cup,''
Stars center Guy Carbonneau said of Roy. ``Fortunately, we have a
guy like Eddie that is in that class and he wants to do the same
thing. So that's why I say it's going to be even better this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sharks coach Darryl Sutter: ``I've seen him play this well,
but he plays so much in control now. We've seen that the last two
years and that's the biggest difference.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Avs have a defense allowing 1.8 goals a game, do they?
Well, the Stars defense hasn't been playing so bad itself. If you
take out a meltdown Game 4, the Stars allowed the Sharks three
goals in the other four games against San Jose. They allowed four
goals at Reunion in the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can play better defensively,'' Stars defenseman
Darryl Sydor said. ``I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Avs have an injured player coming back in defenseman Ray
Bourque? The Stars have two-time reigning Selke Trophy winner Jere
Lehtinen ready to go when the next round begins.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, whatever the Avs showed to prove they're ready for Stanley
by defeating Detroit, the Stars showed they can keep the Cup here
with their showing against the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't watched a second of it,'' Stars winger Brett Hull
said of Colorado's whooping of Detroit. ``I'm sure we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Strains of ``Hey, Hey Goodbye'' began echoing through Reunion
Arena when Hull scored on a 5-on-3 power play with better than 10
minutes remaining and Sylvain Cote added another score 41 seconds
later on the other power play. But Hull's and Cote's were just
finishing touches. The Stars put San Jose in the rear-view mirror
long before, in what was a seemingly easy romp over the Sharks. San
Jose was playing without their captain Owen Nolan (strained
abdominal muscle) and defenseman Bryan Marchment (strained groin).
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I'd like to know what easy is if you guys think that
was,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``I thought it was
a pretty good battle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   What Matvichuk was trying to say _ and his teammates echoed _
was the Avs will be even more difficult to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a serious series,'' Modano said.
``Everybody has been waiting for this matchup.''

 (Subs to correct lede graf; subs 6th graf to clarify; subs 17th
graf for insert) 
(ATTN: N.J., Mich., Minn., Alaska, Ore.)   By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A traveler prints a boarding pass from her office computer,
drives to the airport and walks straight past the snaking line at
the main counter. She drops her bags on a conveyer belt and dashes
to the gate, where the bar code on her boarding pass causes her
photograph to appear on the gate agent's computer screen. Her
entire time in the airport, from curb to gate: less than 10
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, this scenario is little more than a dream for all
but a few elite passengers. Airports are more crowded than ever,
and lines are much longer than they were even a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But in a competition to attract the business travelers who are
responsible for most of the carriers' revenue, major airlines are
spending tens of millions of dollars on new technology.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to whisk passengers through terminals more quickly,
redefining what industry executives glumly call ``the airport
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, Continental Airlines plans to have 300
ATM-like computers across the United States that allow people to
print their own boarding passes and baggage tags. Delta Air Lines
has spent $750 million over the last two years wiring airports and
preparing to introduce similar gadgets. Northwest Airlines responds
to canceled flights at its hubs by rolling out banks of wireless
phones with direct connections to its reservations desk.
</P>
<P>
   And Alaska Airlines, the most aggressive recently in using
technology, has begun to allow people with electronic tickets to
print boarding passes from their home or office computers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a pilot program, it has also scanned the driver's
licenses of about 500 frequent fliers into its computer system. The
bar code on the boarding pass retrieves both the driver's license
and a larger photo, so travelers never have to reach into their
wallets before boarding the plane.
</P>
<P>
   For now, business travelers are the main beneficiaries of the
improvements. Some of the initiatives, such as calling passengers'
cell phones to tell them about a late flight, are available only to
the top tier of frequent fliers, and others, like the kiosks,
appeal mainly to travelers who do not check bags.
</P>
<P>
   Continental has even installed a kiosk in the lobby of AT&AMP;T's
corporate headquarters in New Jersey, so travelers there can get
boarding passes before they arrive at the airport. And Northwest is
testing a program that allows employees of 10 Midwestern companies
to print their own passes off the airline's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike some other recent perks for corporate road warriors _
like expanded first-class sections or the installation of double
beds on overnight flights _ much of the new technology will
eventually be available for all passengers to use, industry experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airports weren't designed for the volumes they're now
getting,'' said Michael L. Zea, a vice president in Mercer
Management Consulting's airline practice. ``There's a lot of strain
on the system, and technology can be very helpful in easing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, automated systems are not always reliable. During a
threatened strike by US Airways employees in March, passengers
holding electronic tickets needed old-fashioned paper tickets to
have any hope of getting a seat on another carrier. And if the
airlines eventually replace agents with the machines, they could
both anger their unions and force passengers to do more work in
order to board a plane, travel experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year in which consumer complaints more than doubled
from their 1998 level, industry executives say that shortening the
lines at their airport counters is a sure-fire way to boost their
carriers' images.
</P>
<P>
   As air travel has surged during the long economic expansion, and
the size of airports and airline staffs has failed to keep up, the
average amount of time that travelers spend on line at the main
counter has reached 16 minutes, up 20 percent from three years ago,
according to Airport Interviewing and Research, a White Plains,
N.Y., company that surveys passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The stricter security standards that the government has adopted
in recent years have added to the lines, as well.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no matter what travelers think of folding
themselves into a middle seat or drinking the airlines' mediocre
coffee, they will generally be happy if their trips take less time
than they have come to expect, airline executives say. ``You can
make up for a lot of coffee sins by having a line that's been
reduced,'' said Dirk C. McMahon, the senior vice president for
ground operations at Northwest Airlines. And at $10,000 apiece, the
machines cost much less than additional employees.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high enough to have led to two recent lawsuits
between airlines with different views about how best to move
passengers through airports. Continental has sued both Delta and
United to force them to remove metal templates on baggage X-ray
machines that prevent passengers, including Continental's, from
carrying large bags onto airplanes at Dulles Airport near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Continental says that its planes' overhead compartments are
large enough to hold the bags and that allowing customers to carry
on luggage instead of checking it reduces delays. Delta and United
say the big bags result in overstuffed bins that cause delays.
</P>
<P>
   Though it is unclear which argument holds the most sway with
passengers, they clearly care deeply about the issue. Bill Harsh, a
management consultant who flies over 200,000 miles a year, said he
has stopped flying United, once his main carrier, because he could
no longer carry on his luggage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bag that fit in every overhead compartment in America
but did not fit through their template,'' said Harsh, who lives in
a Maryland suburb of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for United said the airline has received few
complaints about the templates.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, the biggest attempts to reduce lines involve
technology. Delta and other carriers are putting up computer
screens near gate counters in an attempt to answer easy questions,
such as the reason for a delay, that often clog lines. Northwest's
agents in Detroit and Minneapolis are using hand-held computers to
print boarding passes for passengers waiting in long lines.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative that is the furthest along is the installation of
the ticket kiosks that print boarding passes. Alaska, Continental
and Northwest have put them in dozens of airports across the
country, and British Airways and Alitalia, among others, use them
in Europe. Delta has installed them in Boston, New York and
Washington for shuttle flights, and United is now testing a version
in Aspen, Colo.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives say they have not cut any jobs because of the
machines but probably would have had to hire more new agents
without the kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   Typically about 6 feet tall, the machines allow passengers with
electronic tickets to insert a credit card, print a boarding pass
and sometimes change their seats or get a ticket on an earlier
flight. The machines pose, in text form, the security questions
that gate agents ask passengers who check in in the old-fashioned
way.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is rarely a line, and almost never a long one, at
the kiosks. Mary Anne Smith of Metuchen, N.J., used one of them
last week at Newark International Airport before boarding a
Continental flight on a business trip. ``They're quicker even than
when there are no lines'' at the counters, she said. ``I don't have
to talk to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   They are mainly useful, however, for passengers who have no bags
to check and no questions to ask a gate agent.
</P>
<P>
   Only Alaska Airlines, in Anchorage, Alaska, and Portland, Ore.,
now permits passengers to print their own tags and then drop them
onto a conveyer belt from which the luggage is X-rayed and put on
the plane. The other carriers make passengers using the kiosks wait
in a line _ usually separate from the main one and shorter _ to
check their bags.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines have also not fully explained the policies to
travelers, analysts said. Smith, for example, said she believed she
could not have used the kiosk at all if she had wanted to check a
bag.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the kiosks do not yet give fliers the same control
that talking to an agent does, particularly for frequent travelers
whose requests the airlines often meet, noted Samuel C. Buttrick,
an airline analyst at PaineWebber. ``I can't ask that the seat next
to me be left open. I can't ask about upgrade wait lists. I can't
ask questions about the status of a connecting flight,'' Buttrick
said, adding that he rarely uses the kiosks.

STARS WRAP UP THE SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Beginning this morning, Colorado coach Bob Hartley will
say all the right things about playing the Stars. They're a good
team, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing he can say will say as much as the look on his face when
a camera caught him in the stands at Reunion Arena last night. He
was watching the Stars' 4-1 whipping of the San Jose Sharks in Game
5 that put the Stars in the Western Conference finals against the
Avalanche for the second year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Hartley wasn't smiling. He looked like a man who had seen
something he didn't very much like. A flying Joe Nieuwendyk, a
stifling Stars defense and a focused Ed Belfour will do that to a
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think this is the best we've played all season,'' Stars
general manager Bob Gainey said after watching the Stars dispatch
the Sharks. ``We've got a lot of elements going right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Avalanche are good. They showed it by wrapping up the
Detroit Red Wings in five games on Friday night. The Stars aren't
so bad themselves. They showed that last night.
</P>
<P>
   They're about to find out how good _ playing an Avalanche team
that has won 22 of their past 27 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fooling ourselves. We're playing the hottest team in
the NHL,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We're chuckling a
little bit because for the first time in a very long time we're
coming in as an underdog. We saw what they did to Detroit, and
Detroit is a hell of a hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the Avalanche were indeed watching, the Stars
gave them something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   So the Avalanche rolls four lines, headlined by Peter Forsberg
and Joe Sakic? The Stars reminded us yesterday that they have four
as well. Last season's Conn Smythe winner, Nieuwendyk, scored the
first goal at 10:31 in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's back. He scored one goal and was on the ice for all
three others, including Scott Thornton's at 13:34 of the first
period. Not bad for a guy said to be struggling. He's a perfect
complement to Mike Modano, who has been playing like Conn Smythe
2000 since the playoffs began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going,'' Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner said of
Nieuwendyk. ``It just hasn't been going in the net for him. When it
doesn't go in the net for you, you start to second guess and you
maybe sit back a little bit. When that confidence comes back, you
start attacking like he has been.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Avs have a hot goalie in Patrick Roy, do they? Well, the
Stars have goalie Ed Belfour, who was every bit as good last night.
Belfour hadn't allowed a goal in 187 minutes, 25 seconds at Reunion
Arena until Sharks forward Patrick Marleau scored at 8:32 of the
third period. The Stars goalie finished with 32 saves, including 13
in the crucial second period where the Stars were outshot, 13-4.
</P>
<P>
   Reunion, coincidentally, is where Games 1 and 2 of the Western
Conference finals will be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with him for almost 10 years so I know how he can
play. When he starts the season, he wants to win the Stanley Cup,''
Stars center Guy Carbonneau said of Roy. ``Fortunately, we have a
guy like Eddie that is in that class and he wants to do the same
thing. So that's why I say it's going to be even better this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sharks coach Darryl Sutter: ``I've seen him play this well,
but he plays so much in control now. We've seen that the last two
years and that's the biggest difference.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Avs have a defense allowing 1.8 goals a game, do they?
Well, the Stars defense hasn't been playing so bad itself. If you
take out a meltdown Game 4, the Stars allowed the Sharks three
goals in the other four games against San Jose. They allowed four
goals at Reunion in the playoffs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can play better defensively,'' Stars defenseman
Darryl Sydor said. ``I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Avs have an injured player coming back in defenseman Ray
Bourque? The Stars have two-time reigning Selke Trophy winner Jere
Lehtinen ready to go when the next round begins.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, whatever the Avs showed to prove they're ready for Stanley
by defeating Detroit, the Stars showed they can keep the Cup here
with their showing against the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't watched a second of it,'' Stars winger Brett Hull
said of Colorado's whupping of Detroit. ``I'm sure we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Strains of ``Hey, Hey Goodbye'' began echoing through Reunion
Arena when Hull scored on a 5-on-3 power play with better than 10
minutes remaining and Sylvain Cote added another score 41 seconds
later on the other power play. But Hull's and Cote's were just
finishing touches. The Stars put San Jose in the rear-view mirror
long before, in what was a seemingly easy romp over the Sharks. San
Jose was playing without their captain Owen Nolan (strained
abdominal muscle) and defenseman Bryan Marchment (strained groin).
</P>
<P>
   ``God, I'd like to know what easy is if you guys think that
was,'' Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk said. ``I thought it was
a pretty good battle out there.''
</P>
<P>
   What Matvichuk was trying to say _ and his teammates echoed _
was the Avs will be even more difficult to handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a serious series,'' Modano said.
``Everybody has been waiting for this matchup.''

DODGERS SEE ONE GET AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Diamondbacks were waiting in Arizona, but the
Dodgers had to go extra innings Sunday night before starting their
longest trip of the season against the best team in their division.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been worth it if they had swept the Houston Astros
for the first time since 1994. Instead, after more than 4 hours of
double switches and pitching changes, the Dodgers were rocked for
seven runs in the 10th and now hit the road for 12 games in the
next two weeks after a 14-8 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been playing good baseball,'' said Shawn Green after
the second-place Dodgers lost for just the third time in their
10-game homestand. ``Tonight was frustrating, but we have to put it
behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big series coming up, and it would be nice to win a
few games and pick up some ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Few were left among the sellout crowd of 52,806 at Dodger
Stadium when closer Jeff Shaw hit Richard Hidalgo with the bases
loaded to force home the eventual winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer still could do the math on a lost weekend for Shaw, who
gave up five of the seven runs in the 10th even though the Astros
never really hit the ball hard. He blew a save Friday night by
allowing a ninth-inning home run but wound up with the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he was gone by the time former Dodger Roger Cedeno
capped the evening with a three-run homer against Alan Mills, the
club's fifth pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner (1-1) pitched 1 innings to earn the victory for
Houston. Jose Cabrera allowed an RBI single to Mark Grudzielanek in
the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw (2-2) took the loss, but he was not alone in his
frustration. The Dodgers overcame a 4-0 deficit in the first inning
but wound up blowing a 7-4 lead in the seventh. They left 10
runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   For Houston, catcher Mike Meluskey had five hits. He entered the
game with just 12.
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser also looked like he was headed for a big game. He
received a huge ovation when he came on to relieve struggling
starter Eric Gagne with two outs in the fourth. Hershiser pitched
well into the seventh in his longest relief appearance since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But after retiring the first two batters, he loaded the bases by
giving up two singles and hitting Craig Biggio with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Osuna, sidelined for most of the past two years with
elbow problems, came on for his first appearance since May 16,
1999, and promptly gave up a two-run single to Bill Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the game began at 5 p.m., there were none of the
twilight horrors that usually bother hitters at that hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros jumped on Gagne for four runs in the first inning,
including back-to-back home runs by Ken Caminiti and Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   But Gagne, still winless in five starts this season, caught a
break. He was facing the Astros' Jose Lima, who entered the game
with five consecutive losses. Sunday, Lima, a 21-game winner last
year, gave up five runs in the first, although only two were
earned.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Hollandsworth opened the Dodgers first with a home run, but
most of the damage was self-inflicted by the Astros, who committed
three errors in the inning and four overall.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros and Mark Grudzielanek later added home runs to help
the Dodgers build the 7-4 lead, but Hershiser ran out of steam in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Dodgers boarded their charter for the
one-hour flight to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Their three-game series with the Diamondbacks features a
potentially epic matchup Wednesday between Kevin Brown and Randy
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been overpowering since missing a month with a broken
right pinkie, but Johnson has been unhittable. After becoming just
the third pitcher to go 6-0 in the month of April, Johnson now is
7-0 with a 0.93 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The trip does not get any easier when the Dodgers head to St.
Louis for three games next weekend against the Central-leading
Cardinals.

FIRST CENTRAL AMERICAN STUDIES PROGRAM OFFERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ California State University, Northridge, will open
the nation's first minor program in Central American studies
Monday, a natural for a campus that has the nation's largest number
of students with roots in that region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are doing everything from taking care of other people's
kids to sending probes to Mars,'' said program coordinator Roberto
Lovato, himself the son of a Salvadoran immigrant. ``We feel we're
changing the nature of what it means to be Latino in Southern
California.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1990 U.S. Census, about 310,000 Central
Americans live in Los Angeles. By 2010, Lovato estimates the number
will grow to 2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley, the influx of Central Americans is
evident in restaurants along Van Nuys Boulevard that sell pita-like
(ital) pupusas (ital off) and in the emerging Salvadoran,
Guatemalan and Nicaraguan business communities. At CSUN, Central
Americans constitute about 6 percent of the school's nearly 28,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   As a new demographic snapshot develops of Central Americans in
the United States, students are demanding a program devoted to
their cultural experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a moment where blacks and Mexican-Americans were in
the 1960s,'' said Monica Novoa, 20, a member of CSUN's Central
American United Student Association. ``We're creating our own
space, politically. Before the program we didn't have a voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The minor program, which will offer about 300 students a full
courseload of classes starting in the fall semester, will explore
the Central American experience, including immigration to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lovato said the emergence of a new Central American middle class
in the San Fernando Valley goes hand-in-hand with the establishment
of the minor program. Carlos Alsaro, 27, of Tarzana is a member of
that growing middle class.
</P>
<P>
   Alsaro was 9 years old when his mother, frightened by El
Salvador's civil war, brought him and his older brother to the
Silver Lake district near downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other inner-city Central Americans, Alsaro and
his brother were bused to Valley schools, which were less crowded
than their neighborhood campuses. Eventually, the family moved to
the Valley because it offered safer neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Now he and his brother, Jose, run Alsaro and Alsaro Insurance
Services on Victory Boulevard in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do identify as being from El Salvador but, as far as being
here, I look at it more as finding business opportunities and being
able to work with all communities,'' Alsaro said. ``My mind-set is
a little more roll-with-it, a little more multicultural.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the minor program, students will explore how Central
American immigrants, who bring memories of political unrest and
civil wars, influence Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Better known is how Southern California influences Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   Salvadoran immigrants, who make up the vast majority of Central
Americans in Los Angeles, send so much of their earnings to
relatives back home that the money accounts for an estimated 5
percent of El Salvador's gross national product, according to
various studies done by Southern California colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those kinds of distinctions of here and there are kind
of disappearing as we see people living a binational existence,''
said Jorge Garcia, dean of CSUN's College of Humanities and a
pioneer of its Chicano Studies program, the first of its kind when
it started in 1969. ``Borders don't mean what they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the experiences of Salvadorans, Nicaraguans and
other Central American immigrants are drastically different from
those of their Mexican neighbors. Most Salvadoran students at CSUN
and residents in the surrounding community recall stories of wars
fought less than a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   The different experiences jibe with what Lovato calls the one
constant that will be the program's first lesson: ``Being an
American has always been in flux,'' he said.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
In grade school, those ``How I Spent My Summer Vacation'' theme
papers were often tough to write but usually entertaining to read.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comets guard Cynthia Cooper, if asked to pen a piece about her
vacation from pro basketball over the past eight months, probably
could turn out something that would attract attention from the
editors of Conde Nast Traveller.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's journeys took her around the world, with stops in
Australia, Vietnam and Angola. It was a chance to forget about jump
shots, fast breaks and WNBA scoring titles and recharge her
batteries after enduring a year that included the deaths from
cancer of her mother and of former Comets teammate Kim Perrot.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The past nine months have) been very therapeutic in the sense
that I've busied myself to where I couldn't think about anything
but what I was doing,'' Cooper said. ``I don't know if that was
necessarily a good thing. But I feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken some steps in the grieving process. I've gotten
better. I feel like I've gotten better. I'm not out of the woods,
and it's not totally behind me. But I'm just feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike sponsored Cooper's trip to Australia and Vietnam, where she
and fellow Nike spokesman Carl Lewis got an up-close look at how
the company's shoes and clothes are manufactured. And Cooper also
was able to take several satellite tours and enjoy the beautiful
outlying areas of a country that has been closed to Americans for
many years.
</P>
<P>
   The most intriguing and fulfilling portion of Cooper's
offseason, however, was a trip to war-torn Angola.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa was wonderful,'' Cooper said Sunday following practice
with the Comets at Westside Tennis Club. ``We went on a goodwill
mission. So we brought over some vitamins, toys, basketballs and
basketball goals. We visited orphanages and hospitals, pediatric
hospitals. It was sad, but it was also wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Angola, a country in southwest Africa gripped by the ravages of
civil war, extended through the Eduardo dos Santos Foundation an
invitation for a ``multisectional delegation'' from America. Cooper
and her group spent four days in Angola during February.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more emotional moments Cooper said she experienced
during her trip came during a stop at a pediatric hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one of the nurses in the hospital who came up to me
and said, `I really hate to see the women go through these type of
things,''' Cooper recalled. ``She said, `All we need is some
sheets, just some sheets.' I looked over to my business partner and
said, `You know what? If we don't do anything else, we're going to
send them some sheets.' It may be something very little, but it
means so much to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing firsthand the anguish that accompanies a life filled with
trouble and uncertainty left an indelible impression on Cooper, who
grew up in the poverty-ravaged Watts section of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first went (to Angola), it reminded me of Watts,''
Cooper said. ``It reminded me of my own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hungry children here in America. We don't have to go
all the way over to Africa to find homeless, hungry children or
people in need. But I also saw smiling children. I saw children who
were dying to take a picture (with her). Or they were diving in the
water laughing and having fun. I saw smiles on faces also. I didn't
just see sadness and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The experience over there was definitely sad in some cases.
Definitely, there is a need over there. But more than anything, it
was a positive experience and I definitely want to return. They
live in conditions we probably would not be able to survive in. But
they do it. And for that, I commend them.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the hospitals, Cooper's delegation stopped at
several educational facilities and other institutions geared toward
sports and athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no journey involving Cooper would be complete without
the Comets star sharing some of her knowledge of basketball and the
game of life.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper's swing through Australia and Vietnam ended just before
she reported to the Comets' training camp. While she arrived back
in Houston perhaps a bit jet-lagged, it was an experience she will
always remember.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who has few peers on a basketball court, over the past
three years has become quite the businesswoman away from it. Her
companies and the services and products they provide are as varied
as the shots and moves that compose Cooper's basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Angola, Cooper promised continued support to the
people through any means her companies can provide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do a lot of different things out there,'' she said.
``Just to be able to go over there and help in some way, in a small
way, it was great.''

LOCKERBIE VICTIMS' KIN FEAR DEAL WITH KHADAFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZEIST, Netherlands _ Citing the words of Moammar Khadafy
himself, some relatives of those killed on Pan Am Flight 103 are
charging that the American and British governments have secretly
gone along with a deal that gave the Libyan leader immunity from
prosecution in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives claim the promise of immunity was contained in a
Feb. 17, 1999, letter to Khadafy from UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, which was instrumental in persuading Khadafy to surrender
the two suspects two months later to face trial.
</P>
<P>
   Annan and both governments deny that there was any deal to limit
the investigation to the two reputed Libyan intelligence agents,
Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhima. But
Khadafy fueled suspicions on Tuesday, the eve of their trial here,
when he told a British television reporter that a deal had been
struck between him and Western officials.
</P>
<P>
   While not all, or even most, of the victims' relatives appear to
believe there was a deal, their suspicions and anger flared when
they learned that US State Department officials had visited Libya
at the end of March. The relatives and their supporters in Congress
see that trip as the first step toward lifting the 1981 ban that
bars Americans from traveling to Libya.
</P>
<P>
   More than 11 years after Pan Am Flight 103 exploded 6 miles
above Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 passengers and crew on
board as well as 11 Lockerbie residents on the ground, the two men
accused of planting the bomb went on trial here last Wednesday at a
former US airbase. But even as they applauded the opening of a
trial they had fought long and hard for, some of the relatives said
they do not believe justice will be served.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a show trial,'' said Susan Cohen of New Jersey, whose
20-year-old daughter Theodora was one of dozens of college students
returning home who were killed in the explosion. ``A deal's been
made, and there's money to be made. People say Libya is a great
place to invest now. You don't have to be a genius to figure out
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cohen and several others who lost loved ones, both
the British and American governments are anxious to allow business
to cash in on lucrative oil and aerospace markets in Libya.
</P>
<P>
   While Cohen and her husband Dan are the most outspoken, many
others are skeptical of State Department assurances that no deal
has been struck to grant Khadafy or other high-ranking Libyan
officials immunity if the evidence should point toward them.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat who has
been the staunchest congressional supporter of the families, wrote
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, urging her to clarify what
Annan did or did not promise Khadafy in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   In a Feb. 8 reply, Albright acknowledged the existence of the
Annan letter but insisted that there was no deal. She said the
trial, being held before a Scottish court as part of the elaborate
compromise that led to the suspects' extradition, is not a show
trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me assure you that there are no external or negotiated
limits to the authority of the Scottish prosecutors in the trial or
the lines of inquiry they can pursue,'' Albright wrote to Kennedy.
``The trial will be a genuine criminal proceeding, not a show trial
or an exercise in political propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, she said, ``will have free rein to do what is
necessary and appropriate in their judgment. They have full
latitude to pursue the evidence wherever it leads, including the
possible implication and prosecution of additional suspects
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But several other events have fanned the relatives' suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   In January, former chief prosecutor Lord Andrew Hardie abruptly
resigned, taking a seat on the Scottish High Court.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hardie who last year met with the families and promised
prosecutors would go wherever the evidence took them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen any document, nor would I have been party to
any document, that would inhibit me in the exercise of my duties,''
said Lord Hardie, adding that he had read Annan's letter.
</P>
<P>
   Also last year, the State Department abruptly classified the
Annan letter, which was not initially considered secret. That fact,
and the refusal of UN officials, the State Department, the British
Foreign Office, and Scottish prosecutors to release it, convinces
some families that authorities are hiding something. The Justice
Department, acting on behalf of the families, tried to force the
State Department to release the letter, but failed.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Cohen and Rosemary Wolfe of Alexandria, Va., whose
20-year-old daughter, Miriam, was killed in the explosion, said
portions of the letter were read to them over the telephone earlier
last year by low-ranking State Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   Both said one sentence promised that the trial would not
``undermine the Libyan regime.'' Cohen said another State
Department official confirmed to her that promises were made to
Khadafy that, the official acknowledged, amounted to immunity.
Neither of the officials Cohen and Wolfe named could be reached for
comment last week.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also claims that Fred Eckhard, Annan's spokesman, read her
a portion of the letter over the phone which included the phrase,
``it is not our intent to undermine the Libyan regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that when she pressed him on the matter, he became
irritated and hung up on her.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in New York on Friday, Eckhard said the letter was
written to reassure Khadafy that ``the US and the UK would not pull
a trick on him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This line was not intended to constrain in any way the legal
process,'' he added. ``It will go where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   After the relatives started to complain about the Annan letter,
Cohen said, ``everybody clammed up. Now no one will talk to us and
tell us what is really going on.''
</P>
<P>
   So angry were the relatives' congressional supporters over the
State Department trip to Libya that archenemies Kennedy and Senator
Jesse Helms, along with Democrat Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey,
put aside their ideological differences to co-sponsor a resolution
attacking the visit. It was approved last month.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also called on President Clinton to consult Congress
before changing any policy toward Libya and for the White House to
disclose ``any assurances received by the Khadafy regime.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all of the relatives are worked up over the Annan
letter. Elizabeth Philipps, whose family was living in Newton,
Mass., at the time that her 20-year-old daughter, Sarah, was
killed, believes some relatives are spending too much time and
energy on the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Philipps said the families have no right to see the letter,
which she considers private, diplomatic correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking Nelson Mandela what he told Khadafy,'' she
said, referring to the former South African president's efforts to
get Khadafy to hand over the two suspects.
</P>
<P>
   More important, said Philipps, is making sure that Khadafy
complies with the conditions set out in UN resolutions, namely that
he cooperate fully with the trial, renounce terrorism, and
compensate the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But Philipps said her husband shares the cynicism of other
families. Ervin Philipps, a Jew who spent the first six years of
his life fleeing the Nazis in Europe, ``finds it difficult to
believe in the genuineness of this process,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So cynical is Ervin Philipps, she said, that he would not join
her to observe the first few weeks of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels that there are so many opportunities for the
governments to control information,'' Elizabeth Philipps said. ``He
feels that if the British, Scottish, and Americans don't want
something to come out, it won't come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said she and other relatives would fight to see that the
investigation goes up the chain of command in Libya.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Cohen has already begun to despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khadafy said on TV the other day that he had won. In a ghastly
way, Khadafy is being more honest than our own government,'' said
Cohen Thursday, standing outside the courtroom because she could
not bear to hear grisly testimony describing how the bodies of
victims rained down on the little town of Lockerbie on the night of
Dec. 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're watching at this trial is political theater,'' said
Cohen. ``Our government is betraying us for oil. This is about
money, pure and simple. I think it's disgraceful that our
government has capitulated to terrorism.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 7, moved Saturday, in the `a' category unless
otherwise noted.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   MOTHERHOOD-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Political strategies come
and go, but a few endure: Never underestimate the political potency
of motherhood. The leaders of the Million Mom March for ``sensible
gun control'' next Sunday, Mother's Day, have an appealing web
site, a shrewd media effort and an aggressive grass-roots
organizing campaign. But above all, they are invoking a very old
tradition in politics: Trying to break through ideology and
partisanship and make an appeal based on the moral authority of
women as mothers. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-STOCKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nasdaq gave amateur investors
the impression that the thing to own is the new, new thing.
Meanwhile, the antiques world gave amateur appraisers the
impression that the thing to own is the old, old thing _ eBay
allowed Web surfers to go antiquing over high-speed access lines,
Sotheby's and Christie's arrived on the Internet, and ``Antiques
Roadshow'' became the most popular program on public TV. By Jenny
Lyn Bader.
</P>
<P>
   _ Inside the section:
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Defining national security:
Just when does a big problem turn into a national security threat?
If Eisenhower were alive today, he might be amused or puzzled by
the Clinton administration's linkage of national security to issues
like trade privileges for China, AIDS in Africa and global warming.
But it is possible that after a decade of unchallenged power and
prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms. BY David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTS-JOB-BIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A good job on the night
shift opens up. A mother with young children is not offered the
job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes _
wrongly _ that her family responsibilities prevent her from working
nights. Did the supervisor act properly? Hardly anyone would say
so. Should the supervisor's action be against the law? Absolutely,
in President Clinton's view. Is the problem pervasive? No one
knows. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONES-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the use of
cellular phones as crime-fighting devices. Since the early 1990s,
cell phones have increasingly become the all-purpose, cure-all
solution for individual safety. The notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared shared by both parent and child, salesman
and client, cop and felon. The issue, however, is whether people
are really safe, or merely think they are. By Jason Blair.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-TECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ For believers in technology's
implied promise of an information utopia, in which people can see
or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell or write
whatever they want), the Disney-Time Warner battle over ABC
transmission was an uncomfortable lesson that the more information
available, the more places in which it is available, the more the
logic of economics and egos will come into play to restrict it. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN'S-REALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ A screenplay featuring the
characters of ``Gilligan's Island'' and the new trend toward
``reality-based game programming.'' CBS maroons a group of real
people, contestants, on an island and keeps hundreds of cameras and
microphones pointed at them 24 hours a day to record everything
they say and do. People are voted out of the group one by one.
After a few weeks their small society, a microcosm of the world at
large if you will, devolves into something out of ``Lord of the
Flies.'' CBS awards the final contestant a million dollars or
something. The ``Gilligan' cast enacts the drama. By Jeff
MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   E-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For more than a year, I've been
experimenting with electronic books. The various e-book devices
felt like solid hardcovers in hand, but the first generation seemed
stiff to me, somehow nerdy and bulky. The cold gray screens of text
didn't offer the hypnotic calm of vanilla rag paper. Reading books
on a PC felt too much as if I was working, chained upright to a
desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback revolution. I
was drawn to the devices that offered one of the basic elements of
pocketbook design: portability. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-OBSTACLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The debacle of the Sierra
Leone peacekeeping mission and the awkward U.S. response
demonstrate again that Africa takes more than good intentions. Now,
the likelihood of deployment of even the modest force for Congo
looks very distant. And even as the House approved a trade bill
granting new trading privileges to Africa, there are some doubts
whether many African countries have the economic capacity to take
advantage of it. The fact remains that sub-Saharan Africa is so
poor, that McDonald's cannot find enough of a customer base to open
one outlet in even one nation. By Jane Perlez. (Moving in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A tempest is brewing in
Washington, all because of an 11-inch blond bombshell. Mattel, in
association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced
plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll. Almost immediately the
protests sounded. But why shouldn't American children learn about
civics and the virtues of public service via their favorite
playthings? By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   SWORD&AMP;SANDAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ To mark the opening of
``Gladiator'' and the passing of Hercules actor Steve Reeves,
earlier sword-and-sandal epics are recalled for their memorable
utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from
the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome _ or, more
typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue
frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and
sometimes to the preposterous.

   NATIONAL-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Defining national security:
Just when does a big problem turn into a national security threat?
If Eisenhower were alive today, he might be amused or puzzled by
the Clinton administration's linkage of national security to issues
like trade privileges for China, AIDS in Africa and global warming.
But it is possible that after a decade of unchallenged power and
prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms. BY David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTS-JOB-BIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A good job on the night
shift opens up. A mother with young children is not offered the
job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes _
wrongly _ that her family responsibilities prevent her from working
nights. Did the supervisor act properly? Hardly anyone would say
so. Should the supervisor's action be against the law? Absolutely,
in President Clinton's view. Is the problem pervasive? No one
knows. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONES-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the use of
cellular phones as crime-fighting devices. Since the early 1990s,
cell phones have increasingly become the all-purpose, cure-all
solution for individual safety. The notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared shared by both parent and child, salesman
and client, cop and felon. The issue, however, is whether people
are really safe, or merely think they are. By Jason Blair.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-TECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ For believers in technology's
implied promise of an information utopia, in which people can see
or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell or write
whatever they want), the Disney-Time Warner battle over ABC
transmission was an uncomfortable lesson that the more information
available, the more places in which it is available, the more the
logic of economics and egos will come into play to restrict it. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN'S-REALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ A screenplay featuring the
characters of ``Gilligan's Island'' and the new trend toward
``reality-based game programming.'' CBS maroons a group of real
people, contestants, on an island and keeps hundreds of cameras and
microphones pointed at them 24 hours a day to record everything
they say and do. People are voted out of the group one by one.
After a few weeks their small society, a microcosm of the world at
large if you will, devolves into something out of ``Lord of the
Flies.'' CBS awards the final contestant a million dollars or
something. The ``Gilligan' cast enacts the drama. By Jeff
MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   E-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For more than a year, I've been
experimenting with electronic books. The various e-book devices
felt like solid hardcovers in hand, but the first generation seemed
stiff to me, somehow nerdy and bulky. The cold gray screens of text
didn't offer the hypnotic calm of vanilla rag paper. Reading books
on a PC felt too much as if I was working, chained upright to a
desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback revolution. I
was drawn to the devices that offered one of the basic elements of
pocketbook design: portability. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-OBSTACLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The debacle of the Sierra
Leone peacekeeping mission and the awkward U.S. response
demonstrate again that Africa takes more than good intentions. Now,
the likelihood of deployment of even the modest force for Congo
looks very distant. And even as the House approved a trade bill
granting new trading privileges to Africa, there are some doubts
whether many African countries have the economic capacity to take
advantage of it. The fact remains that sub-Saharan Africa is so
poor, that McDonald's cannot find enough of a customer base to open
one outlet in even one nation. By Jane Perlez. (Moving in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A tempest is brewing in
Washington, all because of an 11-inch blond bombshell. Mattel, in
association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced
plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll. Almost immediately the
protests sounded. But why shouldn't American children learn about
civics and the virtues of public service via their favorite
playthings? By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   SWORD&AMP;SANDAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ To mark the opening of
``Gladiator'' and the passing of Hercules actor Steve Reeves,
earlier sword-and-sandal epics are recalled for their memorable
utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from
the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome _ or, more
typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue
frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and
sometimes to the preposterous.

<P>
   A tempest is brewing in Washington, all because of an 11-inch
blonde bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, in association with two nonprofit women's groups,
recently announced plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll, a
power-suited, high-heeled White House hopeful who comes complete
with a pearl necklace and a Girls' Bill of Rights. Mattel says it
hopes the doll will ``broaden girls' vision of what's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately the protests sounded. Last week in an article
on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, the former Colorado
congresswoman and one-time presidential candidate Patricia
Schroeder assailed the plastic politico as a giant leap backward
for womankind. ``Why should we feel great about a message that says
a woman can go to the White House if she looks like Barbie?''
Schroeder asked. ``I'm sorry, but I just can't get enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why shouldn't American children learn about civics
and the virtues of public service via their favorite playthings?
Rather than jeer at this star-spangled Barbie, let's extend the
concept to other shelves at Toy Barn.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Potato Head
</P>
<P>
   What better way to teach the country's youth about the
versatility of the modern politician than by crossing a U.S.
senator with everybody's favorite synthetic spud? But instead of
the traditional plug-in eyes, nose, lips and limbs, Sen. Potato
Head (Independent of Idaho) comes equipped with interchangeable
position papers, a removable spine and a special ``two-face''
feature that allows the toy tater to talk out of both sides of its
mouth. (Manufacturer's note: On the Dan Quayle model of Sen.
Potatoe Head, the extra ``e'' is sold separately.)
</P>
<P>
   Tickle Me Reno
</P>
<P>
   The events of recent weeks have put a clearly beleaguered
Attorney General Janet Reno back in the national spotlight. Lest
children believe the job of AG is completely joyless, here comes a
fluffy, happy effigy of the nation's top cop that giggles and
chortles on command. This huggable toy was developed after several
failures, notably the ill-fated Tickle Me Zoe and Tickle Me Kimba
dolls, which, despite repeated efforts, never found anything to
laugh at.
</P>
<P>
   GI Joe Lockhart
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the battle fatigues, helmet and rifle. In their place a
tailored gray suit, briefing book and White House podium. Still, GI
Joe Lockhart, a pocket-sized version of the embattled press
secretary, is every bit as prepped for trench warfare as his
fox-holed predecessor _ he's the ultimate spin-controlling war
machine. Roll up his sleeves and let him slug it out with Sam
Donaldson; slip on his windbreaker and breeze him past reporters as
he boards the presidential chopper (not included). This is truly
one ``fighting Joe from head to toe.'' (Coming soon: A special
two-pack that includes a companion Helen Thomas doll.)
</P>
<P>
   Curious George Stephanapoulos
</P>
<P>
   Kids will love this video adaptation of the classic book series
starring the former White House aide as the mischievous monkey. The
first three releases: ``Curious George Goes to Washington,''
``Curious George Writes a Memoir'' and ``Curious George Can't Get
His Calls Returned.'' (James Carville co-stars as the Man in the
Yellow Hat.)
</P>
<P>
   Talking Head Teletubbies
</P>
<P>
   That colorful quartet of cuddlies with antennae on their heads
and TV screens in their bellies now features running political
commentary on the tummy monitors, courtesy of America's leading
pundits. Each Teletubbie is assigned its own talking head _ Tinky
Winky (Tim Russert), Dipsy (George Will), Laa-Laa (Cokie Roberts)
and Po (Matt Drudge) _ which means tykes can play in silence for
hours on end as their adorable Tubbies hash it out among
themselves. (Plans for the Charlie Rose Teletubbie were canceled
when manufacturers were unable to get the doll to stop talking.)
</P>
<P>
   Jujitsu Justices
</P>
<P>
   Step aside, Justice Scalia; take a powder, Justice O'Connor _
there's a new Supreme Court in town. The first Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers to sit on the high bench, this collector's set of robed
action figures metes out justice in ways the Rehnquist court can
only dream about. Miranda warning? Forget about it. First
Amendment? You've got to be kidding. This gang totes lasers, not
gavels. Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemonica
</P>
<P>
   And you thought Pikachu was the coolest member of the gang _
well, here comes the toughest pocket monster of them all. The only
Pokemon character to have survived battles with such nemeses as
Starrmander and Trippleypuff, Pokemonica is available in a variety
of sizes, comes with her own sports car and designer cell phone,
and boasts a wardrobe of more than two dozen dresses. None of them
blue.

THE TECHNICOLOR GLORY THAT WAS ROME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ridley Scott's $107 million epic ``Gladiator,'' now splashed
across movie screens nationwide, is the latest and most opulent
contribution to the sword-and-sandal genre. When the film opened
last week, the timing was uncanny: Steve Reeves, best known for
playing Hercules and other beefcake roles in Italian gladiator
flicks in the 1950s and '60s, had died just days earlier. And
starting Sunday night, NBC is rolling out a two-part production of
``Jason and the Argonauts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because the producers were not up to the lofty
subject matter _ and in some cases maybe it's just the bad dubbing
_ but the earlier sword-and-sandal epics often had a unique way of
yielding, well, memorable utterances. It didn't matter whether the
plots were derived from the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of
ancient Rome _ or, more typically, some unholy mixture of the
three. The dialogue frequently managed to range from the ponderous
to the purple, and sometimes to the plain preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these immortal phrases plumb the great themes of the
human condition. Some classic _ if not exactly classical _ examples
follow.

THE TECHNICOLOR GLORY THAT WAS ROME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ridley Scott's $107 million epic ``Gladiator,'' now splashed
across movie screens nationwide, is the latest and most opulent
contribution to the sword-and-sandal genre. When the film opened
last week, the timing was uncanny: Steve Reeves, best known for
playing Hercules and other beefcake roles in Italian gladiator
flicks in the 1950s and '60s, had died just days earlier. And
starting Sunday night, NBC is rolling out a two-part production of
``Jason and the Argonauts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because the producers were not up to the lofty
subject matter _ and in some cases maybe it's just the bad dubbing
_ but the earlier sword-and-sandal epics often had a unique way of
yielding, well, memorable utterances. It didn't matter whether the
plots were derived from the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of
ancient Rome _ or, more typically, some unholy mixture of the
three. The dialogue frequently managed to range from the ponderous
to the purple, and sometimes to the plain preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these immortal phrases plumb the great themes of the
human condition. Some classic _ if not exactly classical _ examples
follow.

   It's Getting Lean (and Mean) Out There
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of a ``secret plan'' that would bankrupt Social
Security. Intimations of a laxity in the war on drugs. Allegations
that gun lobbyists would be virtual residents of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore went on the offensive again and again
last week, using a series of campaign appearances across the
country not only to advance his own policy initiatives, but to sow
suspicion about the goals of his presumed opponent in the general
election, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he would pick Charlton Heston as the next surgeon
general,'' Gore said in Chicago, referring to the financial backing
Republicans are getting from the National Rifle Association, whose
president is Heston.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's hammering away was a leading indicator of a new, more
aggressive phase of the campaign. The retreat of Elian Gonzalez
with his father to a Maryland estate seems to have opened up space
again on America's front page for campaign machinations, much of
them testier. In California, a conservative group, Shape the
Debate, has begun running anti-Gore commercials; last week, Handgun
Control introduced a spot that said Bush had signed a law that
allows concealed guns in churches and amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   The ammunition for Gore's attack was provided on Wednesday, when
it was disclosed that the nation's gun companies had broken off
settlement talks with 31 municipalities across the nation over
lawsuits relating to gun violence, in hopes Bush would win the
presidency and usher in a more favorable environment. (In other
signs of the changing environment, a panel of Republicans proposed
altering the current primary system, to allow only smaller states
to vote first.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, professed to be unfazed by Gore's jabs,
although he couldn't help expressing some disgust. ``Totally
pathetic,'' Bush said to a reporter after being informed that Gore
tells Hispanic audiences that he had hoped his second grandchild
would be born on Cinco de Mayo.

   Goodbye to the Youths of the '90s
</P>
<P>
   Sex. Drugs. Suicide. Divorce. Alcoholism. Gun violence. Are
these topics relevant to teen-agers? Of course, they are _ always
have been, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   Does it follow that such topics should be splashed all over the
television shows that teen-agers _ and younger children _ watch?
Yes, some say: the shows should reflect reality. No, others
respond: it inundates children, too young, with situations they're
not yet emotionally ready for.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, though, Ozzie-and-Harriet-land has long since
given way to stark dramas on teen-age issues. A pivotal show was
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' which was born 10 years ago and went on to
deal with everything from racism to condoms to school violence. And
though not as big a hit, ``Party of Five,'' arriving several years
later, was also in this tradition.
</P>
<P>
   So it is something of a milestone that these shows, both from
Fox, end this month. To a young audience obsessed with youth, the
shows _ and their stars _ were simply too old.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Dobie Gillis will rush back to fill the void? Not
a chance. The lineup is chock full of ``90210'' wannabes and their
descendants, like ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Felicity'' and ``Popular,''
all frantically tackling every teen-age subject imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Realism has its limits, though; nearly every character is still
absurdly gorgeous.

   An `I Love You' Virus Becomes Anything But  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rogue software program, borne by an e-mail message proclaiming
``I love you,'' propelled itself around the world, jamming and
crashing e-mail systems and destroying data on millions of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a ``worm,'' the program may have been launched in the
Philippines, and it left angry computer users cautiously opening
their electronic mail. The White House, the Pentagon, Congress and
the British House of Commons were among the victims of the program
that swept through many nations' computer networks in less than a

<P>
   In a major realignment, the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges
announced plans for a merger and a tie-in with New York's Nasdaq
exchange. The deal reflected the rapidly changing face of European
markets, where investors are demanding faster and cheaper trading
and an end to national distinctions between the continent's
fragmented exchanges. The announcement created the biggest European
exchange by far. The smaller Milan and Madrid bourses also plan to
join the alliance.

   Chinese Treasures Reclaimed  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chinese antiquities are hot, but as Christie's and Sotheby's
learned in Hong Kong, some may be too hot to handle. The houses'
offer of three bronze animal heads and an exquisite vase looted
from the Old Summer Palace near Beijing in 1860, when it was sacked
by British and French troops, provoked a visceral response from
Chinese officials, who condemned the sale and unsuccessfully tried
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, two Chinese companies bought the items, vowing to
return them to the motherland. The world's art dealers had to
wonder whether a more assertive Chinese government might upset the
lucrative trade in relics _ many of which have shady pasts.

   Nearly 12 years after Pan Am 103 plummeted from the night sky
into the small town of Lockerbie, Scotland, two Libyans accused of
planting a bomb on the plane went on trial in a most unusual venue:
a Dutch air base declared Scottish soil for the occasion. The deal
was worked out so Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, could get
United Nations sanctions lifted while still saving face. The
prosecution plans to call more than 1,000 witnesses over a yearlong

now voluntary.

   But consumer groups, who said the plan does not go far enough,
want the government to require each food to be labeled and

retreated from a public inquiry. Most senators now say the inquiry

   Very few people expected it, but the Census Bureau reports that
65.9 percent of households receiving a census form this year have
returned them, surpassing the rate in the 1990 census and reversing
a three decade-long decline in the level of participation in the
decennial headcount. Census Bureau officials say the results were
fueled by the performance of minority groups, especially Hispanics,
and a surge in mailing from California.

   The Economy, Still Bullish  &QL;

<P>
   The unemployment rate dropped below 4 percent last month for the

of thousands of census takers and restaurant and temporary workers
entered a booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The new numbers _ 341,000 new jobs and a 3.9 percent
unemployment rate _ offered no evidence that the nine-year-old
expansion might be ending or even weakening in reaction to the
Federal Reserve's efforts to slow the economy by raising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted as if it had little to fear. Even though
many analysts expect that the Fed will raise the rates at its May
16 meeting by as much as half a percentage point, the market
shrugged it off and registered healthy gains Friday.

   Killer waves up to 20 feet high could crash ashore in the Middle
Atlantic states if scientists are right about the danger posed by
giant cracks in the seabed some 60 miles off Virginia and North
Carolina. Writing in the May issue of Geology, they said the newly
discovered cracks could mean the continental shelf was unstable and
liable to slide down like an avalanche, inducing the rogue waves.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists are leaving this weekend on a 14-day expedition
to gather more data to assess the risk, which could prove small if
the cracks turn out to be geologically inactive.

again on America's front page for campaign machinations, much of
them testier. In California, a conservative group, Shape the
Debate, has begun running anti-Gore commercials; last week, Handgun
Control introduced a spot that said Bush had signed a law that
allows concealed guns in churches and amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   The ammunition for Gore's attack was provided on Wednesday, when
it was disclosed that the nation's gun companies had broken off
settlement talks with 31 municipalities across the nation over
lawsuits relating to gun violence, in hopes Bush would win the
presidency and usher in a more favorable environment. (In other
signs of the changing environment, a panel of Republicans proposed
altering the current primary system, to allow only smaller states
to vote first.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, professed to be unfazed by Gore's jabs,
although he couldn't help expressing some disgust. ``Totally
pathetic,'' Bush said to a reporter after being informed that Gore
tells Hispanic audiences that he had hoped his second grandchild
would be born on Cinco de Mayo.

   Goodbye to the Youths of the '90s
</P>
<P>
   Sex. Drugs. Suicide. Divorce. Alcoholism. Gun violence. Are
these topics relevant to teen-agers? Of course, they are _ always
have been, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   Does it follow that such topics should be splashed all over the
television shows that teen-agers _ and younger children _ watch?
Yes, some say: the shows should reflect reality. No, others
respond: it inundates children, too young, with situations they're
not yet emotionally ready for.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, though, Ozzie-and-Harriet-land has long since
given way to stark dramas on teen-age issues. A pivotal show was
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' which was born 10 years ago and went on to
deal with everything from racism to condoms to school violence. And
though not as big a hit, ``Party of Five,'' arriving several years
later, was also in this tradition.
</P>
<P>
   So it is something of a milestone that these shows, both from
Fox, end this month. To a young audience obsessed with youth, the
shows _ and their stars _ were simply too old.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Dobie Gillis will rush back to fill the void? Not
a chance. The lineup is chock full of ``90210'' wannabes and their
descendants, like ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Felicity'' and ``Popular,''
all frantically tackling every teen-age subject imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Realism has its limits, though; nearly every character is still
absurdly gorgeous.

by British and French troops, provoked a visceral response from
Chinese officials, who condemned the sale and unsuccessfully tried
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, two Chinese companies bought the items, vowing to
return them to the motherland. The world's art dealers had to
wonder whether a more assertive Chinese government might upset the
lucrative trade in relics _ many of which have shady pasts.

   The new numbers _ 341,000 new jobs and a 3.9 percent

expansion might be ending or even weakening in reaction to the
Federal Reserve's efforts to slow the economy by raising interest
rates.
</P>

   Wall Street reacted as if it had little to fear. Even though

liable to slide down like an avalanche, inducing the rogue waves.

THE U.S. AND AFRICA: EXTENDING A TREMBLING, HESITANT HAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For most of a year now, the United States has been
proclaiming its intention to get more involved in the fate of
Africa _ in calming its wars, in building its economies.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000 men of the U.N. peacekeeping force sent into Sierra
Leone, and the helicopter gunships reinforcing them, were the first
tangible sign that this intention would amount to more than words.
The soldiers were from third-world countries but their assignment
was being paid for in part with $70 million from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And another peacekeeping force has been waiting in the wings to
try to pacify the even more embattled Congo. The Clinton
administration has been hoping that these two forces together would
forever refute the notion that the international community has been
eager to right wrongs in Europe and Asia, but has another set of
rules for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Sierra Leone mission is in trouble. By Friday night,
more than 300 of the force's troops were hostage, four were missing
and presumed dead and rebels were riding in captured U.N. armored
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   That debacle and the hesitant response to it in Washington _
several days of teleconferences among officials of the CIA, the
Pentagon and the National Security Council but no action, no
decisions _ demonstrate yet again that doing good in Africa takes
more than good intentions. Now the likelihood of deployment of even
the modest force for Congo _ 500 monitors protected by 5,000
soldiers _ looks more distant, despite a formal agreement last week
from the Congo leader, Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The second track of the administration's Africa policy _
economic partnership _ was also delivering less than had been
promised. Even as the House of Representatives approved a trade
bill granting some new trading privileges to Africa, there were
doubts whether many countries on the continent have the economic
capacity to take advantage of it. And on the much-discussed subject
of AIDS, the bill sent a singular snub: In the final version,
bowing to American pharmaceutical companies, Congress dropped a
provision intended to make AIDS drugs more affordable by lowering
the licensing fees for African drug manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has experienced two defining moments
in Africa, barely six months apart. The first was the slaughter of
17 U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 1993 and the
dragging of one of the bodies through the streets. The following
spring, the administration remained largely silent as a genocide
unfolded in Rwanda after the United States agreed to the removal of
a U.N. military force there.
</P>
<P>
   After Mogadishu, President Clinton chose to shy away from
risking such casualties or humiliation again; after Rwanda, he said
genocide could not be tolerated again.
</P>
<P>
   But those are incompatible goals, and in its twilight months,
the Clinton administration is strangled by its own constraints as
it contemplates the options in places like Sierra Leone, Congo,
Angola, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse of the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone could
portend far more than just the loss of a military effort in a
small, desperate West African country. At stake, some officials
argue, is the prestige of the United States within the United
Nations. The U.S. representative there, Richard C. Holbrooke, has
worked hard to fix the frayed U.N.-U.S. relationship, lobbying
Congress to restore funding and urging foreign diplomats to
understand the American political mood. Last week he was in Congo
with U.N. colleagues trying to assess whether it is peaceful enough
to send in the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Holbrooke needs the 54 votes of African
nations, many of whom have been willing to suspend their
disillusionment with Washington if the Sierra Leone and Congo
peacekeeping missions can be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   But many also still resent the evident Western view that Africa
deserves to be marginalized because its problems run so deep. They
argue that some hope should be gleaned from democratic elections
here and there, from economic turn-arounds. They point to
Mozambique, strengthened by investment from neighboring South
Africa; to Kenya, where President Daniel arap Moi has taken steps
that could reduce corruption; to Nigeria, whose new president,
Olusegun Obasanjo, has assumed the mantle of a regional leader
(although his troops, which Western countries wouldn't finance,
pulled out of Sierra Leone after being roughed up by rebel thugs).
</P>
<P>
   Most important to hopes for peacekeeping, some African countries
now have armies that are willing to take part in international
forces on the continent. But it is also clear that African states
are not capable of dealing with big crises like Congo or Sierra
Leone. For these, they look to the United Nations, and thus the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in Sierra Leone is that the big powers on the
Security Council won't use their own forces, and this has left the
United Nations relying on frightened soldiers from less capable
armies _ the kind who sometimes give up their armored personnel
carriers when confronted by teen-agers with rifles at a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   The minister of state for foreign affairs of Uganda, Amama
Mbabazi, put it this way earlier this year: ``When it is Kosovo you
are there in one minute and spend billions. When it's East Timor
you are there. When it is Africa, there are all sorts of excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   So the basic problem of what to do about Africa remains, despite
the administration's determination to get more involved. ``There
are huge stakes'' if the Sierra Leone operation fails, said one
official. ``We have to play pretty tough. Otherwise we are going to
walk away yet again.''

JUDGING A BOOK WITHOUT ITS COVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was Tuesday evening on the 6:26 in a Long
Island-bound train crowded with weary commuters lurching in the
aisles, elbow to elbow, briefcase to briefcase. Unfolding a
newspaper was unthinkable. Flipping through a hardcover might form
an instant but awkward book club of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   So I rummaged in my purse in search of something for just such a
literary emergency. Even in a rush-hour commute there was ample
reading room for a novel stored in a Palm Pilot, which is smaller
than a paperback yet mighty enough to carry 12 digital titles.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to the beginning of Stephen King's novel ``The Girl Who
Loved Tom Gordon,'' which glowed from a screen a littler smaller
than a poker card and contained 1,409 miniature pages. The train
rumbling through its stops drowned out the faint cicada-like
clicking _ the digital equivalent of a page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, I've been experimenting with electronic
books in a personal quest to judge a book by its lack of a cover. I
embarked with baggage that would sag a bookshelf: words were made
to be inked. And the ultimate test of pleasure reading was the
plump couch test. Could you curl up with a pillow and good byte?
</P>
<P>
   The various e-book devices felt like solid hardcovers in hand,
but the first generation seemed stiff to me, somehow nerdy and
bulky. The cold gray screens of text didn't offer the hypnotic calm
of vanilla rag paper.
</P>
<P>
   Reading books on a PC felt too much like I was working, chained
upright to a desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback
revolution. I was drawn to the devices that offered one of the
basic elements of pocketbook design: portability.
</P>
<P>
   My first attempt was a mystery about a rakish serial killer,
which Penguin Putnam had offered as a teaser in an early version of
the Rocket eBook. The monochromatic text and page of the reading
device already seems a little primitive given the plans to
transform it by Gemstar. Since Penguin sent out only one chapter, I
still don't know whether the book was a click-turner.
</P>
<P>
   I have ordered titles from Zero Heure in Paris, a new electronic
publisher that delivers books in e-mail attachments, which can be
read on a computer or printed out. The books are the latest from
France and discounted as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I've charged brief works of electronica from the bookseller
Fatbrain.com _ which has now transformed into MightyWords. One was
an illustrated children's book in the Chocolate-Covered Banana
series featuring a monkey named Tyco, which I submitted to a tough
critic, my 3-year-old daughter. There was something gloriously
democratic about ordering a title simply written and posted by
three children from the San Diego area. Anyone can publish on
MightyWorks _ for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Stephen King who forced me to squeeze a book into my
Palm Pilot. His e-novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' was unavailable
from Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and the other booksellers that
were overwhelmed by demand on the first day that the title was
offered free.
</P>
<P>
   To my great surprise, it was not uncomfortable to read a book by
clicking through page after page on the Palm Pilot's tiny screen,
which displays about one paragraph in large type. It takes a while
to grow accustomed to devouring a novel on a device more commonly
used to scan telephone numbers and calendars. The contrast of the
text and page on the screen seemed too dark for hours of reading.
It was also a laborious effort to peck out notes on its tiny
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, I could enlarge the text, making it much
easier on my eyes. By thinking of the small screen of text as
something akin to a newspaper column, I could adjust to the notion
of reading this way. Still, my mind wandered, and at night on the
couch I reached gratefully for a hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Microsoft has splashily released its own
version of an electronic reader, which illustrates the relentless
if not rapid progress taking place in this market. The text is in
color with much clearer resolution than the less expensive Palm
Pilot, but the price is daunting for a charter member of the
paperback generation: $500.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come are Gemstar's new prototypes of the eRocket book
and the SoftBook, which it is manufacturing for the fall in
partnership with the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia.
Henry Yuen, Gemstar's chief executive, is visiting New York
publishing suites with the second-generation prototype of the
SoftBook, a slim 22-ounce version featuring a paperback-sized
screen, color text, a 50-book capacity and a stylus that can jot
down and erase notes. The price hasn't been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   Till then I content myself with Microsoft's offering. Standing
on the train, I set aside my Palm Pilot and check through the
Microsoft bookshelf, clicking through the Hans Christian Andersen's
classics ``The Emperor's New Clothes'' and ``The Match Girl.''
</P>
<P>

CELLULAR PHONES: THE WEAPON OF CHOICE FOR SELF-DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Think of cellular telephones, and you perhaps conjure up
thoughts of the man at the movie whose pocket starts ringing at a
gripping moment of drama, teen-agers chatting in front of their
school or the woman at the video store reading movie titles to her
jaded friend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials in New York City had a different idea.
Responding to the killings of nine livery cabbies this year, they
announced that a program originally designed to distribute cell
phones to potential crime victims would be expanded to include the
drivers. The program, which was first devised for victims of
domestic violence, gave away 500 phones, all programmed to dial
911.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly viewed as a luxury item, these phones have become
commonplace in the last 15 years, and since the early 1990s they
have increasingly been regarded as an all-purpose cure-all for
individual safety. Today the notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared not only by parent and child, but also by
salesman and client, cop and felon. Less certain is whether people
are really connected, really secure, or merely think they are.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the Arizona Foundation for Women is sponsoring a
local drive to give cellular phones to victims of domestic abuse.
In Winthrop, Maine, police have programmed cell phones to dial 911
and the friends and relatives of women who have been attacked by
their spouses and companions. In 1994, the New York Police
Department gave phones to crime-watch volunteers in two dangerous
parks. ``We don't need knives and guns and Mace,'' Michael Julian,
the department's chief of personnel, said at the time. ``We need a
way to call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maryland at College Park offers discounts to
students wanting to buy such phones. In part, the program was
established for the safety of the students, university officials
say. Parents also often give phones to children heading off to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the district attorney's office in
Brooklyn, where a recent rise in murders has been linked to
domestic violence, said such phones were not the answer to every
problem. But, Davitt added, ``For a victim, it removes the
isolation and the terror that often assists the perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these crimes happen one on one,'' he added, ``but this
puts a kind of electronic third person in the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, more than 80 million Americans have purchased cell
phones. A recent federal report noted that the sense of security
offered by cell phones is a major factor in the accelerated growth
of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 calls are placed to 911 and other emergency
numbers through cell phones each month in the United States,
according to industry reports. And nearly half the callers say they
have used the phones to report crime, car trouble, drunk drivers or
medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But to Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York state
Federation of Taxi Drivers, New York City's effort to get the
devices to each livery cab driver is an example of a good idea gone
too far and a waste of energy and resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have someone in the car with a gun to your head,''
Mateo said last week, ``for you to dial 911 and be able to speak
will be pretty tough. By the time the drivers finish answering all
the questions, they will be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, argue that the presence of cell phones in the
cabs might discourage criminals from singling out drivers, who are
being required to install bulletproof partitions that separate the
front seat of the car from the back.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal sociologist at San Diego State University, William C.
Kennedy, said perception in crime fighting is often as important as
reality, noting that cell phones make people feel safer _ whether
on highways and in alleys _ and may make criminals more hesitant to
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that once a crime is under way, the phones often do
little more than create ``a false impression of safety.'' Some
people ``say they would never walk down a certain street without
their cell phone,'' he said. ``Unless you are going to use it has a
hammer, it is probably not going to do you much good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most criminals act quickly, preventing people from using their
phones to call for help, he said. The phones are most effectively
used to report crimes being committed against another person,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   To many young people, a cellular phone is the latest high-tech
toy offering entree into the cool club, much like the beeper craze
of the last decade. But others see it is as essential for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Jaimie Kent, a 21-year-old Duke University junior from River
Vale, N.J., bought her cell phone about four years ago, around the
same time she received her driver's license. ``It was mainly a
safety thing _ just when I was driving on the highways by myself,''
Kent said in an interview last week. ``I could call if my car broke
down.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, 1999, while home on winter break, Kent was driving on
a rural road when, she said, she ``literally got a stomach flu that
came over me as I was driving home and I started to pull over to
stop, and I blacked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing she remembered was the sound of tapping.
``Someone was knocking on my window, I woke up, and she was able to
use my cell phone to call my mom,'' Kent said. It took all the
strength she could muster, Kent added, to give her Good Samaritan
the telephone number to reach Kent's mother, who came to get her.
</P>
<P>
   Kent understands the limitations of her phone, she said. But
regardless of whether it will protect her from a criminal, she says
she sees it, in many ways, as her digital security blanket.

JUDGING A BOOK WITHOUT ITS COVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was Tuesday evening on the 6:26 in a Long
Island-bound train crowded with weary commuters lurching in the
aisles, elbow to elbow, briefcase to briefcase. Unfolding a
newspaper was unthinkable. Flipping through a hardcover might form
an instant but awkward book club of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   So I rummaged in my purse in search of something for just such a
literary emergency. Even in a rush-hour commute there was ample
reading room for a novel stored in a Palm Pilot, which is smaller
than a paperback yet mighty enough to carry 12 digital titles.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to the beginning of Stephen King's novel ``The Girl Who
Loved Tom Gordon,'' which glowed from a screen a littler smaller
than a poker card and contained 1,409 miniature pages. The train
rumbling through its stops drowned out the faint cicada-like
clicking _ the digital equivalent of a page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, I've been experimenting with electronic
books in a personal quest to judge a book by its lack of a cover. I
embarked with baggage that would sag a bookshelf: words were made
to be inked. And the ultimate test of pleasure reading was the
plump couch test. Could you curl up with a pillow and good byte?
</P>
<P>
   The various e-book devices felt like solid hardcovers in hand,
but the first generation seemed stiff to me, somehow nerdy and
bulky. The cold gray screens of text didn't offer the hypnotic calm
of vanilla rag paper.
</P>
<P>
   Reading books on a PC felt too much like I was working, chained
upright to a desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback
revolution. I was drawn to the devices that offered one of the
basic elements of pocketbook design: portability.
</P>
<P>
   My first attempt was a mystery about a rakish serial killer,
which Penguin Putnam had offered as a teaser in an early version of
the Rocket eBook. The monochromatic text and page of the reading
device already seems a little primitive given the plans to
transform it by Gemstar. Since Penguin sent out only one chapter, I
still don't know whether the book was a click-turner.
</P>
<P>
   I have ordered titles from Zero Heure in Paris, a new electronic
publisher that delivers books in e-mail attachments, which can be
read on a computer or printed out. The books are the latest from
France and discounted as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I've charged brief works of electronica from the bookseller
Fatbrain.com _ which has now transformed into MightyWords. One was
an illustrated children's book in the Chocolate-Covered Banana
series featuring a monkey named Tyco, which I submitted to a tough
critic, my 3-year-old daughter. There was something gloriously
democratic about ordering a title simply written and posted by
three children from the San Diego area. Anyone can publish on
MightyWorks _ for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Stephen King who forced me to squeeze a book into my
Palm Pilot. His e-novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' was unavailable
from Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and the other booksellers that
were overwhelmed by demand on the first day that the title was
offered free.
</P>
<P>
   To my great surprise, it was not uncomfortable to read a book by
clicking through page after page on the Palm Pilot's tiny screen,
which displays about one paragraph in large type. It takes a while
to grow accustomed to devouring a novel on a device more commonly
used to scan telephone numbers and calendars. The contrast of the
text and page on the screen seemed too dark for hours of reading.
It was also a laborious effort to peck out notes on its tiny
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, I could enlarge the text, making it much
easier on my eyes. By thinking of the small screen of text as
something akin to a newspaper column, I could adjust to the notion
of reading this way. Still, my mind wandered, and at night on the
couch I reached gratefully for a hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Microsoft has splashily released its own
version of an electronic reader, which illustrates the relentless
if not rapid progress taking place in this market. The text is in
color with much clearer resolution than the less expensive Palm
Pilot, but the price is daunting for a charter member of the
paperback generation: $500.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come are Gemstar's new prototypes of the eRocket book
and the SoftBook, which it is manufacturing for the fall in
partnership with the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia.
Henry Yuen, Gemstar's chief executive, is visiting New York
publishing suites with the second-generation prototype of the
SoftBook, a slim 22-ounce version featuring a paperback-sized
screen, color text, a 50-book capacity and a stylus that can jot
down and erase notes. The price hasn't been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   Till then I content myself with Microsoft's offering. Standing
on the train, I set aside my Palm Pilot and check through the
Microsoft bookshelf, clicking through the Hans Christian Andersen's
classics ``The Emperor's New Clothes'' and ``The Match Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The naked emperor failed to maintain my attention, but perhaps
that story seemed all too familiar. The true test of e-book devices
is whether a reader can plunge into another world with abandon. And
for a few pages that retreat came with the scenes of the little
match girl, who gave me a chill as I imagined her dying on a street
corner, her frozen hands gripping spent matches.
</P>
<P>
   I had forgotten the device in my hand and no longer heard the
burr of strange clicks.

DAMMING THE FLOW OF FREE INFORMATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing like a blank screen to spark one's imagination.
It is the Rorschach test of the information age. And never more so
than last week, when the ABC channel on Time Warner cable systems
in seven markets went blank.
</P>
<P>
   ABC devotees in 3.5 million homes, confronted with a blue screen
and scrolling Time Warner propaganda, may have thought about the
celebrities they would not see. Marketers of satellite dishes
probably contemplated fatter sales figures. And federal lawmakers
and regulators could ponder how to prevent the gatekeepers of the
information castle from pulling up the drawbridge and leaving the
public outside.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, for those who have believed in
technology's implied promise of an information utopia, in which
people can see or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell
or write whatever they want), it was an uncomfortable reminder: the
more information available, the more places in which it is
available, the more the logic of economics and egos will come into
play to restrict it.
</P>
<P>
   As Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said in a
speech to the Mercer Law School in Georgia in March,
``paradoxically, the effect of more information becoming more
available more quickly may be less information being made public at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the evidence for Abrams' paradox. Last week, to gain
leverage in its contract dispute over the terms under which it
could carry ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co., Time Warner
pulled the plug on ABC's signal.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations _ Disney was seeking to make its Disney
Channel part of Time Warner's basic service and to get the cable
systems to carry its Toon Disney and Soap channels _ Disney
sometimes engaged in brinkmanship. In the Houston market, Disney
came within minutes of letting Time Warner's right to carry its
programming lapse. If it had done so, it would have pulled the plug
on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Disney was offering more programming (which in turn would bring
it more advertisements and more revenue). Time Warner's cable
system is capable of carrying scores of channels. But both media
giants, under the terms of the laws, regulations and contracts
governing their business, could serve as gatekeepers and black out
the signal. More information, or less? Or more information and more
choke points where it can be shut off?
</P>
<P>
   In other situations, the promise of open access to free
information has also produced a backlash:
</P>
<P>
   _ APBNews.com, a Web site specializing in covering crime stories
and the legal system, filed a Freedom of Information Act request
for all the financial disclosure statements filed by federal
judges. At first, the financial disclosure committee of the
Judicial Conference of the United States rejected the request,
citing judges' concerns that unstable or unsavory people could
obtain their addresses or the names of family members. In March,
the Judicial Conference ruled that the reports could not be
withheld ``simply because they are going to be placed on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Associated Press, Reuters and three other international
news agencies preparing to cover the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney
were asked in January if they would wait an hour before making
results available to commercial Web sites, including their own, and
if they would credit IBM and Swatch when reporting the results. The
AP argued that the results are raw data, not subject to copyright
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the director of communications and
new media for the International Olympic Committee, withdrew the
requests for the time being. He maintains that copyright
protections extend to ``the tabulation'' of results, if not the
results themselves. ``The agencies want to take the real-time
results and resend it, with no value added, to other Web sites _
and give us no compensation,'' he said. ``And those Web sites would
be competitive with our Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Association of Research Libraries and various teachers'
organizations are fighting legislation that would provide
electronic databases with copyright-like protections. Leslie
Harris, a lawyer who represents some teacher groups, said, ``You
want protections to encourage creation of intellectual property,
but you also want to encourage dissemination of information in a
free society.'' She added, ``As we migrate online, the traditional
ability of my clients to say, `Great article on Martin Luther King
Day; I'll make 15 copies for my class' may not be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, laws governing intellectual property and freedom
of information overlap with the laws governing information
distribution systems and the antitrust laws. Which is not
surprising, since a basic premise of the information age is that
information itself has economic value.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, it is a matter of civic interest if television viewers
are barred from receiving ABC News programming. The issue for the
Federal Communications Commission, though, was not the free flow of
information, but the fact that the plug was pulled during sweeps
month, when stations measure their audiences to determine what to
charge advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   If a city council wants to force a cable carrier to carry any
Internet service provider, it is a matter of business regulation.
(Federal judges in Oregon and Virginia have come to opposite
conclusions on the propriety of such actions.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is a matter of copyright law if the
National Football League objects when a reporter from The St. Paul
Pioneer Press gives real-time coverage on a Vikings game via the
newspaper's Web site. And a matter of competition, since the NFL
also has its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in Release 1.0, Esther Dyson's technology
newsletter, the Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig said: ``The
original architecture of the Net gave great freedom to perfect
competition. But we're seeing an erosion of that freedom now.''

speech to the Mercer Law School in Georgia in March,
``paradoxically, the effect of more information becoming more
available more quickly may be less information being made public at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the evidence for Abrams' paradox. Last week, to gain
leverage in its contract dispute over the terms under which it
could carry ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co., Time Warner
pulled the plug on ABC's signal.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations _ Disney was seeking to make its Disney
Channel part of Time Warner's basic service and to get the cable
systems to carry its Toon Disney and Soap channels _ Disney
sometimes engaged in brinkmanship. In the Houston market, Disney
came within minutes of letting Time Warner's right to carry its
programming lapse. If it had done so, it would have pulled the plug
on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Disney was offering more programming (which in turn would bring
it more advertisements and more revenue). Time Warner's cable
system is capable of carrying scores of channels. But both media
giants, under the terms of the laws, regulations and contracts
governing their business, could serve as gatekeepers and black out
the signal. More information, or less? Or more information and more
choke points where it can be shut off?
</P>
<P>
   In other situations, the promise of open access to free
information has also produced a backlash:
</P>
<P>
   _ APBNews.com, a Web site specializing in covering crime stories
and the legal system, filed a Freedom of Information Act request
for all the financial disclosure statements filed by federal
judges. At first, the financial disclosure committee of the
Judicial Conference of the United States rejected the request,
citing judges' concerns that unstable or unsavory people could
obtain their addresses or the names of family members. In March,
the Judicial Conference ruled that the reports could not be
withheld ``simply because they are going to be placed on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Associated Press, Reuters and three other international
news agencies preparing to cover the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney
were asked in January if they would wait an hour before making
results available to commercial Web sites, including their own, and
if they would credit IBM and Swatch when reporting the results. The
AP argued that the results are raw data, not subject to copyright
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the director of communications and
new media for the International Olympic Committee, withdrew the
requests for the time being. He maintains that copyright
protections extend to ``the tabulation'' of results, if not the
results themselves. ``The agencies want to take the real-time
results and resend it, with no value added, to other Web sites _
and give us no compensation,'' he said. ``And those Web sites would
be competitive with our Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Association of Research Libraries and various teachers'
organizations are fighting legislation that would provide
electronic databases with copyright-like protections. Leslie
Harris, a lawyer who represents some teacher groups, said, ``You
want protections to encourage creation of intellectual property,
but you also want to encourage dissemination of information in a
free society.'' She added, ``As we migrate online, the traditional
ability of my clients to say, `Great article on Martin Luther King
Day; I'll make 15 copies for my class' may not be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, laws governing intellectual property and freedom
of information overlap with the laws governing information
distribution systems and the antitrust laws. Which is not
surprising, since a basic premise of the information age is that
information itself has economic value.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, it is a matter of civic interest if television viewers
are barred from receiving ABC News programming. The issue for the
Federal Communications Commission, though, was not the free flow of
information, but the fact that the plug was pulled during sweeps
month, when stations measure their audiences to determine what to
charge advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   If a city council wants to force a cable carrier to carry any
Internet service provider, it is a matter of business regulation.
(Federal judges in Oregon and Virginia have come to opposite
conclusions on the propriety of such actions.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is a matter of copyright law if the
National Football League objects when a reporter from The St. Paul
Pioneer Press gives real-time coverage on a Vikings game via the
newspaper's Web site. And a matter of competition, since the NFL
also has its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in Release 1.0, Esther Dyson's technology
newsletter, the Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig said: ``The
original architecture of the Net gave great freedom to perfect
competition. But we're seeing an erosion of that freedom now.''

FEEDING AMERICA'S CRAVING FOR VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JENNY LYN BADER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a season of dizzying highs, record lows and amateurs
rushing in.
</P>
<P>
   The public cannot help but be mesmerized by twin roller coaster
rides: the dazzling parallel arcs of the Nasdaq world and the world
of antiques. Both offer the irresistible possibility that, despite
the fact that America has always loved ``The Price Is Right,'' the
price is actually wrong. It's higher.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market gives amateur investors the impression that the
thing to own is the new, new thing. ``Antiques Roadshow'' gives
amateur appraisers the impression that the thing to own is the old,
old thing.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical moment from ``Antiques Roadshow,'' the most popular
program on public television, a woman brought in a glass lamp
purchased for $125. An expert told her the lamp was worth $125,000.
Just like the little companies on the Nasdaq, the little lamp was
suddenly, for no apparent reason, worth 1,000 times what it was
supposed to be. And like the little companies, little lamps could
be traded online: eBay soon let Web surfers go antiquing, and even
Sotheby's and Christie's brought their gavels to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, everyone and his grandmother were buying on margin
and ransacking virtual yard sales. The declining American ability
to focus was colliding with the ascending national economy,
resulting in a new model for success, a little like Horatio Alger
without the attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the nosedives and scandals. The stock market fell. The
auction house giants Christie's and Sotheby's, like the Nasdaq
giant Microsoft, became the subjects of antitrust inquiries by the
Justice Department, which accused them of price-fixing and
collusion. Heart-rending scenes from ``Antiques Roadshow'' were
revealed to be staged. The man who couldn't believe that his Civil
War-era sword was worth $35,000 and said he once carved a
watermelon with it was not the owner of the sword, but a friend of
the appraiser.
</P>
<P>
   The program's producers removed the appraiser from all reruns.
They also spliced out a woman who brought in a $250,000 helmet and
then mysteriously disappeared amid rumors that the helmet was not
hers. And eBay, the spiritual home of a nation of appraisers, is
now the subject of three local and federal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But the bidding continues. Aspiring analysts can play stock
games on Web sites, winning prizes for speculator of the month.
Aspiring appraisers can read trade secrets in Carol Prisant's
``Antiques Roadshow Primer'' and make estimates interactively on
the PBS Internet site. On the cable channel HGTV, they can watch
``Appraise It!'' or ``The Great Antiques Hunt,'' a program that
combines elements of roadshow and game show. Contestants choose
antiques at a fair and win points based on the value of their
selections. They also estimate the cost of estate jewelry, identify
furniture and guess the ages of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to ``The Price Is Right,'' where contestants pride
themselves on knowing what things actually cost, contestants on
``The Great Antiques Hunt'' revel in imagining what things might
bring.
</P>
<P>
   At first the fascination with old-world beauty seemed a reaction
to the high-technology revolution. Technophobes and neo-Victorians
alarmed by life in a cold electronic age grew nostalgic for the
comfort of physical design. Traditionalists perturbed by the mass
of paper wealth and new money yearned for the nobility of good
taste.
</P>
<P>
   The British, who originally gave America Christie's and
Sotheby's, also exported ``Antiques Roadshow,'' ``The Great
Antiques Hunt'' and (after making the questions easier) ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire,'' spreading the reassuring notion that riches
can flow from collecting or knowing arcana.
</P>
<P>
   But strangely enough this obsession with the old has also been
fueled by new technology: the Internet has given collectors novel
and ideal ways of interacting. By reaching mass audiences, the Net
has driven up the prices of some collectibles even as it has driven
down the prices of everyday items.
</P>
<P>
   On eBay, as contemporary alchemists turn Pez dispensers into
gold, those obsessed with the old and those obsessed with the new
exchange bric-a-brac. A Sumerian fertility amulet dating from 3000
B.C. can find new buyers in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, the fascination with old and new are part of
the same mania. Both roller coasters promise accessibility,
immediacy and the wonder of hidden value. With the democratization
of investing, anyone can order shares of Qualcomm while sitting
home in a bathrobe. And the formerly insular antiques world has
come to the public, intimating that those with an eye for talent
can spot the value not only of the next Intel but of the tarnished
teapot in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Professional appraisers on television sometimes take up to
several hours off camera checking a research library. But the
viewers don't see the work involved, only the result, as a moldy
footstool morphs into a small fortune in a matter of seconds. This
is better than reality television: it's television edited to
celebrate reality. In a flash, the pompous owner of a fake Faberge
egg is humiliated; the unassuming bearer of a genuine Regency box
is exalted.
</P>
<P>
   The forces at work here are more poignant than mere greed. The
fantasy of ``Antiques Roadshow'' is that the chair you loved
because your Aunt Tillie gave it to you might also bring in six
figures. It is the fantasy that sentimental value can translate
into market value, that feelings and family bonds can matter in a
material world. It's the fantasy that our old stuff is worth
something and that, by extension, we are, too. Going on ``Antiques
Roadshow'' is like holding an emotional IPO for your garage _ an
expert can tell you that you're worth more than you previously
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Such fantasies reveal how yet another British import, Harry
Potter, has become the best-selling fairy tale of the moment.
Readers cherish the idea that a boy neglected in the everyday world
has magical powers and fancy lineage in a parallel, enchanted
realm. There, eccentricities can turn out to be talents, weird
relatives can turn out to be brilliant wizards and the worthless
can become powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The public wants to be transported to that place, where the
money-losing start-up venture becomes a dot-com to watch and the
rickety armchair in the corner is transformed into a priceless
heirloom. Losers can become winners, not only of net worth but of
self-worth: by all accounts, a happy ending.

SOMETIMES, NATIONAL SECURITY SAYS IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten years after recapturing Europe, Dwight D.
Eisenhower calculated that the lessons of D-Day could be usefully
applied in persuading Congress to lace the land with highways. His
administration dreamed up the National System of Interstate and
Defense Highways and argued that these roads were not only about
economic development, they were about national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case of atomic attack on our key cities,'' he wrote in
1955, ``the road net must permit quick evacuation of target areas,
mobilization of defense forces and maintenance of every essential
economic function.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, the highways he built can barely handle a
5 p.m. crush of commuters in their SUVs, much less a panicky
evacuation of the capital. But if he were alive today, the old
five-star might smile to hear the latest Clinton White House
strategy. The president and his national security adviser, Samuel
R. Berger, have taken up a mantra that granting permanent
``normal'' trading status to China isn't just about profit
opportunities, it's also about national security. At the same time,
the administration has labeled the AIDS crisis in Africa a threat
to national security, and Vice President Al Gore has raised similar
fears with his ``new security agenda,'' which includes global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Without question there is a case to be made that economic chaos,
disease and climatic upheaval can all trigger political nastiness.
So all of this new labeling raises a question: Just when does a big
problem turn into a national security threat?
</P>
<P>
   On trade with China, the Clinton administration argument is that
granting normal trade status would reassure the Chinese that
America isn't trying to hem them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a national security point of view, it would in my view be
a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United
States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or
not,'' President Clinton told an insurance group last week, a theme
he repeated nightly as he tried to win over 40 or so legislators
who were still undecided about the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before, the White House was arguing that the spread of
AIDS in Africa would lead to economic collapse, political
instability and civil wars that might eventually require American
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that we have a short list of national security
threats and East Timor is now off and AIDS is on it,'' Berger said
in an interview. But strife has many origins, he said: ``If it
creates instability, chaos, conflict and war, that has national
security implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, used a foreign policy speech last weekend to
argue for the need for ``forward engagement'' (presumably a
Gore-ism for trying to think ahead). He ticked off _ in no
particular order of priority _ pandemics, economic inequality,
global warming and the digital divide as potential security
problems that had to be nipped in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the political calculation is obvious: he is
trying to portray his opponent, George W. Bush, as a man caught in
what he termed a cold-war mindset that sees national security only
in the most conventional terms.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still unclear whether the new Democratic relabeling of
issues is just shrewd political marketing _ to Democrats who don't
like trade deals, and to Republicans who don't care for foreign
aid, particularly when it involves AIDS _ or a truly new agenda for
an age of new global threats.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell. As the Clinton presidency winds down, the
definition of national security threats has gotten ever fuzzier.
Even some senior members of the administration worry privately that
the White House regularly overplays its hand and should reserve the
national security argument for events tightly linked to the
prospect of the United States becoming involved in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a significant risk of crying wolf,'' one of the
president's top security advisers concedes. ``This isn't Sputnik,''
he added, in another allusion to the Eisenhower years, when appeals
for education funds could be based on fears that the Russians were
well ahead in the race to build the first ICBMs.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there is a strong moral argument for helping the
destitute ravaged by AIDS, in Africa or elsewhere. And no doubt the
disease could lead to political instability. But so can poverty,
and the 1.3 billion people who live on less than a dollar a day
trigger meetings at the World Bank these days, not in the Situation
Room.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bush, eager to portray the current occupants of the
White House as long on butter and short on guns, carry the argument
one step further: by making the list of security threats too long,
they argue, the Clinton administration risks taking its eye off
more imminent threats.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the school of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and one of those
advisers, wrote recently, AIDS in Africa and the environment are
serious problems, but calling them national security threats
carries ``the implication that conventional security is no longer
something we need to worry much about.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-NATIONAL-SECURITY-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: much about.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this is also an administration repeatedly stung by the
criticism that its foreign policy has been a series of belated
reactions, rather than the product of any global strategy. So
Americans may be ready to welcome anything resembling preparation
for new crises, as long as it differentiates between real security
threats, potential threats and social work. And it is possible _
though hardly certain _ that after a decade of unchallenged power
and prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, any serious official who argued that admitting
Communist China into a Western trade regime might change China's
political culture would have been laughed out of the National
Security Council. Today, even some Republicans sound a lot like
Clinton when it comes to talking about the benefits of exposing
China to a Western-designed legal system or fueling the spread of
the Internet. ``China's emergence as a world power is a classic
security issue,'' said Richard Armitage, who has served several
Republican presidents, ``and if getting them into the world trading
system makes them more restrained, a better actor, then I'm for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most potent argument may be the one he hasn't made in
public, chiefly to avoid offending two of America's closest allies
. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany and Japan lashed
out in large part because they felt the world was constraining not
only their military might, but their ability to manufacture and
export. Any global system that reduces trade barriers, the theory
goes, also deflates some of those pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But noneconomic forces also cause wars, and it is a mistake,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers acknowledges, to
``overemphasize the link between economic forces and future
conflict.'' Perhaps that is why Clinton and Berger last week opened
a new front in the China argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than argue the economic and political benefits of getting
China into the tent, they made the case that keeping it out would
court disaster _ that insulting China would strengthen the hand of
the People's Liberation Army in its battle over China's direction
with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the leader of China's move to a
market economy. But if the Chinese economy opens too quickly _
forcing tens or hundreds of millions of workers in inefficient
state-owned enterprises out of work _ Zhu could be blamed for that,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of the logic, Clinton's national security
case for letting China into the World Trade Organization seems to
be winning some converts. ``The AFL-CIO has an answer to the
economic arguments about this deal,'' one undecided congressman _
who asked not to be named _ said last week. ``But they don't have
any answers on the security side.'' On the other hand, the effort
to reclassify AIDS seems to have fallen flat. No one in either
party is talking about reallocating the trillions saved by the
Soviet Union's fall on international AIDS programs, or any other
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   But China trade may be different. Eisenhower's highway system is
now crumbling, and members of Congress want it fixed. A few who are
on the fence about China have suggested that the place to fix the
Interstate System is in their districts before Election Day. That
might make them more amenable to the Clinton view of national
security.

SOMETIMES, NATIONAL SECURITY SAYS IT ALL

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ten years after recapturing Europe, Dwight D.
Eisenhower calculated that the lessons of D-Day could be usefully
applied in persuading Congress to lace the land with highways. His
administration dreamed up the National System of Interstate and
Defense Highways and argued that these roads were not only about
economic development, they were about national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case of atomic attack on our key cities,'' he wrote in
1955, ``the road net must permit quick evacuation of target areas,
mobilization of defense forces and maintenance of every essential
economic function.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, the highways he built can barely handle a
5 p.m. crush of commuters in their SUVs, much less a panicky
evacuation of the capital. But if he were alive today, the old
five-star might smile to hear the latest Clinton White House
strategy. The president and his national security adviser, Samuel
R. Berger, have taken up a mantra that granting permanent
``normal'' trading status to China isn't just about profit
opportunities, it's also about national security. At the same time,
the administration has labeled the AIDS crisis in Africa a threat
to national security, and Vice President Al Gore has raised similar
fears with his ``new security agenda,'' which includes global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Without question there is a case to be made that economic chaos,
disease and climatic upheaval can all trigger political nastiness.
So all of this new labeling raises a question: Just when does a big
problem turn into a national security threat?
</P>
<P>
   On trade with China, the Clinton administration argument is that
granting normal trade status would reassure the Chinese that
America isn't trying to hem them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a national security point of view, it would in my view be
a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United
States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or
not,'' President Clinton told an insurance group last week, a theme
he repeated nightly as he tried to win over 40 or so legislators
who were still undecided about the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before, the White House was arguing that the spread of
AIDS in Africa would lead to economic collapse, political
instability and civil wars that might eventually require American
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that we have a short list of national security
threats and East Timor is now off and AIDS is on it,'' Berger said
in an interview. But strife has many origins, he said: ``If it
creates instability, chaos, conflict and war, that has national
security implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, used a foreign policy speech last weekend to
argue for the need for ``forward engagement'' (presumably a
Gore-ism for trying to think ahead). He ticked off _ in no
particular order of priority _ pandemics, economic inequality,
global warming and the digital divide as potential security
problems that had to be nipped in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the political calculation is obvious: he is
trying to portray his opponent, George W. Bush, as a man caught in
what he termed a cold-war mindset that sees national security only
in the most conventional terms.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still unclear whether the new Democratic relabeling of
issues is just shrewd political marketing _ to Democrats who don't
like trade deals, and to Republicans who don't care for foreign
aid, particularly when it involves AIDS _ or a truly new agenda for
an age of new global threats.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell. As the Clinton presidency winds down, the
definition of national security threats has gotten ever fuzzier.
Even some senior members of the administration worry privately that
the White House regularly overplays its hand and should reserve the
national security argument for events tightly linked to the
prospect of the United States becoming involved in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a significant risk of crying wolf,'' one of the
president's top security advisers concedes. ``This isn't Sputnik,''
he added, in another allusion to the Eisenhower years, when appeals
for education funds could be based on fears that the Russians were
well ahead in the race to build the first ICBMs.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there is a strong moral argument for helping the
destitute ravaged by AIDS, in Africa or elsewhere. And no doubt the
disease could lead to political instability. But so can poverty,
and the 1.3 billion people who live on less than a dollar a day
trigger meetings at the World Bank these days, not in the Situation
Room.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bush, eager to portray the current occupants of the
White House as long on butter and short on guns, carry the argument
one step further: by making the list of security threats too long,
they argue, the Clinton administration risks taking its eye off
more imminent threats.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the school of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and one of those
advisers, wrote recently, AIDS in Africa and the environment are
serious problems, but calling them national security threats
carries ``the implication that conventional security is no longer
something we need to worry much about.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-NATIONAL-SECURITY-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: much about.'' &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this is also an administration repeatedly stung by the
criticism that its foreign policy has been a series of belated
reactions, rather than the product of any global strategy. So
Americans may be ready to welcome anything resembling preparation
for new crises, as long as it differentiates between real security
threats, potential threats and social work. And it is possible _
though hardly certain _ that after a decade of unchallenged power
and prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, any serious official who argued that admitting
Communist China into a Western trade regime might change China's
political culture would have been laughed out of the National
Security Council. Today, even some Republicans sound a lot like
Clinton when it comes to talking about the benefits of exposing
China to a Western-designed legal system or fueling the spread of
the Internet. ``China's emergence as a world power is a classic
security issue,'' said Richard Armitage, who has served several
Republican presidents, ``and if getting them into the world trading
system makes them more restrained, a better actor, then I'm for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most potent argument may be the one he hasn't made in
public, chiefly to avoid offending two of America's closest allies
. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany and Japan lashed
out in large part because they felt the world was constraining not
only their military might, but their ability to manufacture and
export. Any global system that reduces trade barriers, the theory
goes, also deflates some of those pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But noneconomic forces also cause wars, and it is a mistake,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers acknowledges, to
``overemphasize the link between economic forces and future
conflict.'' Perhaps that is why Clinton and Berger last week opened
a new front in the China argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than argue the economic and political benefits of getting
China into the tent, they made the case that keeping it out would
court disaster _ that insulting China would strengthen the hand of
the People's Liberation Army in its battle over China's direction
with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the leader of China's move to a
market economy. But if the Chinese economy opens too quickly _
forcing tens or hundreds of millions of workers in inefficient
state-owned enterprises out of work _ Zhu could be blamed for that,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of the logic, Clinton's national security
case for letting China into the World Trade Organization seems to
be winning some converts. ``The AFL-CIO has an answer to the
economic arguments about this deal,'' one undecided congressman _
who asked not to be named _ said last week. ``But they don't have
any answers on the security side.'' On the other hand, the effort
to reclassify AIDS seems to have fallen flat. No one in either
party is talking about reallocating the trillions saved by the
Soviet Union's fall on international AIDS programs, or any other
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   But China trade may be different. Eisenhower's highway system is
now crumbling, and members of Congress want it fixed. A few who are
on the fence about China have suggested that the place to fix the
Interstate System is in their districts before Election Day. That
might make them more amenable to the Clinton view of national
security.

WORK RULES: GOING EASY ON PARENTS ISN'T SO EASY 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is the problem in theory: A good job on the
night shift opens up. A mother with several children is not offered
the job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes
_ wrongly _ that her family responsibilities prevent her from
working nights.
</P>
<P>
   Did the supervisor act properly?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone would say so. Certainly the mother is the only one
who knows whether she is able to work nights.
</P>
<P>
   Should the supervisor's action be against the law?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, in President Clinton's view.
</P>
<P>
   Is the problem pervasive?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of problem Clinton loves to address _ the way he
has promoted school uniforms to improve classroom discipline and
V-chips to block violent programs on television.
</P>
<P>
   His solutions cost little. They endear him to his admirers. And
his political foes often seem to have been outsmarted.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, with a stroke of his pen, Clinton ordered an end
to discrimination against federal workers because they are parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are
reluctant to hire or to promote employees who have children at
home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His order, he said, sent this message: ``No glass ceiling for
parents. The job they are doing at home is more important anyway,
and if they can do your job, you ought not to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   The key phrase is ``if they can do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would argue seriously, for example, that because an
employee cannot work nights, the government should be required by
law to create a day-side promotion.
</P>
<P>
   A more difficult question is what happens when two people are in
competition for employment or a promotion _ a single person who can
work long hours and a parent who cannot afford to. Is it
discrimination if the long hours are rewarded? Or is it
discrimination if they are not?
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of the executive order on those kinds of
common situations is far from clear. The White House could not
offer a single case of discrimination in the past that the
president's executive order would now prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could the federal workers' union, the American
Federation of Government Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Binion, the president of Local 12, to which Labor
Department employees belong, said, ``I know people don't get
assignments because they have kids, but I can't give you a specific
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff member who developed the policy, Bruce Reed, the
president's chief domestic policy adviser, conceded that he did not
know whether this kind of bias was a problem in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this is not a widespread practice,'' Reed said,
``but we'd like to be on the safe side.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive order was welcomed in some circles as a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good thing the president did, because it's a
marker,'' said Judith L. Lichtman, president of the National
Partnership for Women and Families, a liberal advocacy group.
``This is how you get the conversation to change about what is
acceptable and unacceptable behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But as so often happens here, the president's political
opponents were infuriated. It would be hard to overestimate the
rage Bill Clinton ignites in some quarters nowadays, even over an
executive order that may have no effect whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The response from Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., chairman of the
House Republican Conference, was typical:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the latest meaningless proposal from an administration
desperately searching for a legacy that will endure after the
evening news ends. Having already claimed credit for solving every
problem under the sun, the Clinton-Gore team has apparently taken
to espousing solutions in search of new problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first broached the issue in his State of the Union
Message last year. As part of a long list of proposals involving
children and families, he declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to
hire or promote workers simply because they have children. That is
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   On the president's behalf, Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., introduced legislation last year that
would have prohibited discrimination against parents by all
employers. The bill went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   So, unable to win support for a national policy, the president
issued the executive order, which applies only to federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Its range is narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Parents would not be guaranteed any jobs. Someone who could not
work long hours because of family obligations would not have to be
offered a position that required overtime. A worker who was not
always free to travel could not expect a position that often
required last-minute trips. A supervisor would be free to
discipline an employee who was often late because child-care
arrangements fell through.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to ascertain what the order would do than what it
would not do. White House officials made clear that the order sets
a goal and does not give anyone the right to sue the government.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would certainly not alleviate the stress many
parents face balancing the responsibilities of work and family.
</P>
<P>
   It would not seem to help, for instance, a clerk at the Labor
Department, a single mother who asked when she was interviewed last
week that her name not be used, who said she was sure she had been
denied a promotion recently because of her family obligations. When
pressed, she acknowledged that she had fallen behind in her work
because she had taken so much unpaid leave to deal with a
daughter's illness.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't interfere in any way,'' said Joe Lockhart, the
president's press secretary, ``with an employer's ability to reject
workers who aren't able to perform a job in question. It would
simply ensure that workers aren't discriminated against on the
basis of being a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem may be that this kind of discrimination is simply
too subtle to prove.

<P>
   The camera TILTS DOWN to reveal seven people, castaways perhaps,
sitting on the beach of an uncharted desert island. They seem
stranded. They also look familiar. Gentle trade winds fan the palm
trees behind them.
</P>
<P>
   THEME MUSIC UP AND OUT.
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Now let me get this straight. CBS says we can vote each
other off the island?
</P>
<P>
   THE PROFESSOR: Yes, Skipper, that's right.
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: So we can vote against people we don't like? But why?
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Well, it's part of the new trend toward what you
might call ``reality-based game programming,'' Skipper. They maroon
a group of real people, contestants, on an island like this. They
keep hundreds of cameras and microphones pointed at them 24 hours a
day to record everything they say and do. People are voted out of
the group one by one. After a few weeks their small society, a
microcosm of the world at large if you will, devolves into
something out of ``Lord of the Flies.'' CBS awards the final
contestant a million dollars or something.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Gee, Skipper, a million dollars!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER (Hits Gilligan hard with his hat): Pipe down!
</P>
<P>
   GINGER: I don't think that's entertaining at all!
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: Neither do I! It's just mean. And discourteous.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON HOWELL III: A million dollars? Hah! I carry more than
that folded in my cummerbund.
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY HOWELL: It does seem, well, rather uncharitable.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: It was originally produced in Europe. ...
</P>
<P>
   ALL: Ohhhhhhhhhh.
</P>
<P>
   They sit quietly for a few moments, the only SOUND the WAVES
LAPPING AT THE SAND.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: And television in general is becoming more Darwinian,
I venture, ``survival of the fittest'' now defining both content
qua content and the larger issues of vertically integrated
corporate performance vis-a-vis media gigantism and economies of
relative scale _
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER (interrupting): I vote the professor off the island!
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: But I was just ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Do you have any idea how sick to death we are of your
endless lectures? Of your crypto-intellectual condescension?
</P>
<P>
   ALL: Yeah!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: You're useless to us! You can make a linear particle
accelerator out of two mangos and a clam shell, but in 35 years you
couldn't patch the hole in a wooden boat?
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Yes, well, I tried several times. ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: It's some boards and a hammer, Brainiac.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: And don't think we don't know about you and Ginger
down at the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Oh my. (Takes coconut cell phone and EXITS.)
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: You too, Suzie Floozy, hit the bricks. And leave me
that blue gown with the bugle beads.
</P>
<P>
   GINGER: But, but ... Oh Gillie, help me!
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Pound sand, baby. It's over. (GINGER EXITS.)
</P>
<P>
   As twilight comes to the little island, SKIPPER lights the Tiki
torches.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON: I never liked them. Common, really.
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY: I don't know how to say this, dear, but I think you
should go, too.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON (sputtering): Me? Lovey! Why?
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY: You've been bringing a teddy bear to bed with us for
nearly half a century, dear, and you need to ask why? You packed a
cummerbund for a three-hour tour? You're clinically insane.
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: And he's miserly, don't forget miserly!

   GILLIGAN: Don't ``Little Buddy'' me, you abusive blubbersack.
You touch me with that hat again and I'll kill you. Just how long

still here! Good god, man, we've been visited by four cosmonauts,

SIT RIGHT BACK AND HEAR A TALE OF TV GONE INSANE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 By JEFF MacGREGOR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The camera TILTS DOWN to reveal seven people, castaways perhaps,
sitting on the beach of an uncharted desert island. They seem
stranded. They also look familiar. Gentle trade winds fan the palm
trees behind them.
</P>
<P>
   THEME MUSIC UP AND OUT.
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Now let me get this straight. CBS says we can vote each
other off the island?
</P>
<P>
   THE PROFESSOR: Yes, Skipper, that's right.
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: So we can vote against people we don't like? But why?
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Well, it's part of the new trend toward what you
might call ``reality-based game programming,'' Skipper. They maroon
a group of real people, contestants, on an island like this. They
keep hundreds of cameras and microphones pointed at them 24 hours a
day to record everything they say and do. People are voted out of
the group one by one. After a few weeks their small society, a
microcosm of the world at large if you will, devolves into
something out of ``Lord of the Flies.'' CBS awards the final
contestant a million dollars or something.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Gee, Skipper, a million dollars!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER (Hits Gilligan hard with his hat): Pipe down!
</P>
<P>
   GINGER: I don't think that's entertaining at all!
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: Neither do I! It's just mean. And discourteous.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON HOWELL III: A million dollars? Hah! I carry more than
that folded in my cummerbund.
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY HOWELL: It does seem, well, rather uncharitable.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: It was originally produced in Europe. ...
</P>
<P>
   ALL: Ohhhhhhhhhh.
</P>
<P>
   They sit quietly for a few moments, the only SOUND the WAVES
LAPPING AT THE SAND.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: And television in general is becoming more Darwinian,
I venture, ``survival of the fittest'' now defining both content
qua content and the larger issues of vertically integrated
corporate performance vis-a-vis media gigantism and economies of
relative scale _
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER (interrupting): I vote the professor off the island!
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: But I was just ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Do you have any idea how sick to death we are of your
endless lectures? Of your crypto-intellectual condescension?
</P>
<P>
   ALL: Yeah!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: You're useless to us! You can make a linear particle
accelerator out of two mangos and a clam shell, but in 35 years you
couldn't patch the hole in a wooden boat?
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Yes, well, I tried several times. ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: It's some boards and a hammer, Brainiac.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: And don't think we don't know about you and Ginger
down at the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Oh my. (Takes coconut cell phone and EXITS.)
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: You too, Suzie Floozy, hit the bricks. And leave me
that blue gown with the bugle beads.
</P>
<P>
   GINGER: But, but ... Oh Gillie, help me!
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Pound sand, baby. It's over. (GINGER EXITS.)
</P>
<P>
   As twilight comes to the little island, SKIPPER lights the Tiki
torches.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON: I never liked them. Common, really.
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY: I don't know how to say this, dear, but I think you
should go, too.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON (sputtering): Me? Lovey! Why?
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY: You've been bringing a teddy bear to bed with us for
nearly half a century, dear, and you need to ask why? You packed a
cummerbund for a three-hour tour? You're clinically insane.
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: And he's miserly, don't forget miserly!
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: He treats us all like servants! Capitalist oppressor!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Wall Street lickspittles! They should both go! Eat the
rich!
</P>
<P>
   ALL (chanting now): Eat the rich! Eat the rich! (They advance on
the HOWELLS with sharpened sticks. LOVEY and THURSTON scurry into

INVOKING THE MORAL AUTHORITY OF MOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

   WASHINGTON _ Political strategies come and go, but this one
endures: never underestimate the political potency of motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Million Mom March for ``common sense gun
control'' next Sunday, Mother's Day, have a warm and fuzzy Web site
(www.millionmommarch.com), a shrewd media effort and an aggressive
grassroots organizing campaign. But above all, they are invoking a
very old tradition in politics: trying to break through ideology
and partisanship and make an appeal based on the moral authority of
women as mothers.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, widely credited
with helping to create a fundamental shift in society's attitudes
toward drinking and driving. It worked for many of the women's
clubs in the early part of this century, which historians say
played a key role in passing much of the early social welfare
legislation, like mothers' pensions and child and maternal health
programs. It has been used in peace movements, here and in such
places as Northern Ireland, in pro- and anti-abortion marches, in
environmental struggles large and small.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current climate, in an election year when the gun
control issue is the subject of fierce and intensely partisan
maneuvering _ and when mothers are considered swing voters _ such a
campaign is not without risks. Without more conventional political
follow-up, some analysts say, the march could turn out to be a a
day of powerful television images that will ultimately fade, and
can thus be safely ignored by the legislators and candidates who
are its target. And it casts women in a political role that some
may find dated and limiting: as selfless nonpartisan defenders of
hearth and home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mothers' march, which is open to men and is to be
held in the nation's capital and some 60 other cities, could also
have real power, several historians and analysts say. ``It's a
really good way to bridge differences of ideology,'' said Annelise
Orleck, an associate professor of history at Dartmouth and a
scholar of mothers' movements. ``It makes possible at least a
temporary coalition of a wider range of people than might have been
drawn out by a march that was billed strictly as a gun control
march.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she added: ``It becomes harder to attack. It will be very
hard for the National Rifle Association or others to attack mothers
speaking on behalf of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate O'Beirne, a conservative commentator and Washington editor
of National Review, agreed, predicting that the march will be
``lovingly'' covered by the news media. ``They'll get no skeptical
coverage _  &UR; moms? &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the march, which supports an array of gun control
measures like mandatory safety locks and the licensing of all
handgun owners, was in fact deeply political. But it will define
the argument, she said, so that ``anybody who demurs is clearly
perfectly comfortable with 8-year-olds' risking gun violence in
school cafeterias.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bill Powers, spokesman for the National Rifle
Association, offered a downright decorous response when asked about
the mothers' march. ``We seem to be a lot of people's favorite
target to beat up, but the men and women who are part of the NRA
want their children to be safe just as much as anyone else wants
their children to be safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother who is the main
organizer of the march, said she was galvanized by the image of
children, hand in hand, being led from a Jewish community center in
Granada Hills, Calif., last August, after a gunman's shooting
rampage. She said she took MADD as her inspiration, and found it
easy to mobilize mothers in the wake of a succession of school
shootings, several of them in middle-class suburbia. ``The first
five or 10 women I spoke to about this, we all had the same
reaction to what was going on in the country around guns,'' she
said. ``Our maternal instincts were just kicking in.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some pollsters say that after the shooting last year at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., which left 15 dead,
support for stronger gun laws initially soared, especially among
women. Moreover, there is what Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster,
calls a ``huge gender gap'' on the issue. A poll by CBS News in
March found that 56 percent of the men responding said laws
governing the sale of handguns should be made stricter; 73 percent
of the women did.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the Democratic Party's support for stricter
gun laws could help deliver the middle-of-the-road suburban mothers
both parties are courting. But polls indicate that any such
advantage has yet to materialize. Many Republican leaders have been
arguing that the problem is not the strength of existing gun laws,
but the lack of vigorous enforcement. And that message has appeal,
DiVall said.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said, ``The issue's been
confused,'' but argued that the mothers' march could sway voters.
</P>
<P>
   The march's organizers, of course, say they hope to transcend
any struggle for partisan advantage. ``Everyone truly believes that
until we get the politics out of this, nothing much will get
done,'' said Dees-Thomases, currently on leave from her job as a
part-time publicist for CBS. ``This is a public health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-MOTHERHOOD-POLITICS-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: health issue.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The march's Web site drives home the beyond-politics message
again and again: ``This is personal, not political. We are in this
for one reason alone: to keep our kids safe.'' In a ``Tapestry''
section, typical postings about the march run like this: ``I lose
sleep at night thinking about the future of my 3-year-old child and
my one expected in June.'' ``After watching the Oprah show on
Tuesday, I decided to turn in the only gun I have, a handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   March organizers say elected officials will not be prominently
featured in the day's program in Washington, although two will
speak, both of them women with experience in gun violence in their
own families: Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was
killed and son was severely wounded in the Long Island Rail Road
shooting in 1993, and Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend,
the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at
Harvard, said the march organizers had clearly ``rediscovered a
very traditional formula'' that still had power even though the
status of women has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Skocpol, the author of ``Protecting Soldiers and Mothers: The
Political Origins of Social Policy in the United States'' (Harvard
University Press, 1992), noted that mothers' movements were very
strong in the early years of the 20th century, before women had the
vote, when many women defined the political process ``not as
voting, but as shaping public opinion, creating some kind of moral
consensus, appealing to the reason and the values of public
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she quotes Imogen B. Oakley, a leader in the
General Federation of Women's Clubs, who declared in 1912: ``In
this country, owing to partisan politics, the authorities are prone
to spend so much time wrangling over the spoils of office that they
have little left for civic improvement.'' As a result, she said,
``the initiative in civic matters has devolved largely upon
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Rheta Childe Dorr, the author of a book about clubwomen in
politics, wrote in 1910 that a woman's place was in the home. But
she added: ``Home is not contained within the four walls of an
individual home. Home is the community. The city full of people is
the family. The public school is the real nursery. And badly do the
home and the family and the nursery need their mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The framing of an issue as a mothers' movement still works ``not
because they see women separately, as part of a separate sphere,
but because women are still especially concerned about children,''
Skocpol said. Still, she and many analysts say there are obvious
limitations to these movements. Efforts to recast poverty as a
children's issue _ including a Stand for Children rally in
Washington in 1996 _ did not stop the passage of a welfare reform
law that its organizers deplored. Powerful images are no substitute
for political muscle and continued organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said her movement is keenly aware of that, and
will announce plans for follow-up on the day of the march. In the
meantime, the Million Mom March has competition in the imagery war:
the Second Amendment Sisters, a group of women who plan a
counterdemonstration that day on behalf of gun rights, to
underscore how important guns are to protect hearth and home.

politics, wrote in 1910 that a woman's place was in the home. But
she added: ``Home is not contained within the four walls of an
individual home. Home is the community. The city full of people is
the family. The public school is the real nursery. And badly do the
home and the family and the nursery need their mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The framing of an issue as a mothers' movement still works ``not
because they see women separately, as part of a separate sphere,
but because women are still especially concerned about children,''
Skocpol said. Still, she and many analysts say there are obvious
limitations to these movements. Efforts to recast poverty as a
children's issue _ including a Stand for Children rally in
Washington in 1996 _ did not stop the passage of a welfare reform
law that its organizers deplored. Powerful images are no substitute
for political muscle and continued organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said her movement is keenly aware of that, and
will announce plans for follow-up on the day of the march. In the
meantime, the Million Mom March has competition in the imagery war:
the Second Amendment Sisters, a group of women who plan a
counterdemonstration that day on behalf of gun rights, to
underscore how important guns are to protect hearth and home.

MBEKI TEMPERS AIDS STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA _ Scorned internationally for his baffling response to
an epidemic that is ravaging the African continent, and his own
country, President Thabo Mbeki convened a conference of experts
worldwide to debate whether, in fact, the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are faced with a catastrophe,'' Mbeki told scientists in an
opening address Saturday. ``You can't respond to a catastrophe
merely by saying, `I will do what is routine.' You respond to a
catastrophe in a way that recognizes the fact that you are facing a
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mbeki, reaching beyond the routine has meant challenging the
applicability of Western anti-AIDS drugs to Africa.
</P>
<P>
   For critics, Mbeki's stance has amounted to delay and denial in
the face of an epidemic that has reached millions of adults across
much of southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the first day of debate, in a conference that
brought together some of the world's most respected AIDS
authorities, among them some with dissenting views on treatment,
participants voiced cautious optimism that a consensus was emerging
on the link between HIV and AIDS that would allow Mbeki a way out
of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disease has ever been so well understood. We have the
entire genetic code for this virus,'' said David Scondras, a former
Boston city councilman who took part. ``If this allows Mbeki to
move on, it will have been worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki's response to the epidemic has set the tone across
southern Africa, the center of the AIDS pandemic. More than 2
million sub-Saharan Africans die each year of AIDS, the United
Nations says. In South Africa the virus infects 1,700 new people
each day. By December 2001, the UN estimates, Africa will have 13
million AIDS orphans.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Mbeki instructed every member of his Cabinet to
develop AIDS strategies and wore the AIDS ribbon conspicuously.
</P>
<P>
   But Mbeki stunned even his own health minister in October,
announcing in a speech that AZT, one of the most commonly
prescribed anti-retroviral treatments worldwide, was too toxic for
his government to provide, despite findings from within his own
scientific community that it safely blocked transmission of HIV
from pregnant women to their unborn children.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Mbeki began courting a small and disparate
group of scientists who have rejected the mainstream scientific
view that HIV resulted in AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Defending that position in a letter to Western leaders last
month, Mbeki likened condemnation of that dissident view on AIDS
treatment to persecution by the Spanish Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The health minister, Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, said the purpose
of considering every viewpoint was to find the most suitable
response to the disease in Africa, where malnutrition and poverty
are rife.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics speculate that debates about toxicity and the workings
of HIV mask a different concern: the high cost of anti-AIDS drugs.
It costs abut $20,000 per year to treat one patient with AZT,
according to Scondras, a figure that is far beyond the reach of
African budgets.
</P>
<P>
   There were hints at the conference that the South African
government may be trying to move beyond the controversy it created.
Mbeki's speech, said Malegapuru Makgoba, head of South Africa's
Medical Research Council, included the president's clearest
acknowledgment yet of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki went to lengths to spell out government initiatives to
combat AIDS. Government papers issued to each participant,
meanwhile, dealt less with what causes AIDS than with how to stop
it.
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the conference, which ended Sunday, considered
three areas of discussion: prevention, treatment, and how HIV
spreads in Africa. Over the next six weeks, the participants will
continue a discussion online, with a view to making policy
recommendations when they reconvene in early July.

CANADIANS BASK IN NETHERLANDS' THANKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM _ In Holland, old Canadian soldiers never die. They
just come back here every five years.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, 55 years after he helped liberate Amsterdam and the
rest of the Netherlands, Sam Shore, 79 years old, put on his old
brown uniform, pinned on his medals, and sat in the back of a
vintage Jeep with his old army buddy, Howard Lyons, to be driven
over the winding canals of this great Dutch city.
</P>
<P>
   Every five years, Shore, Lyons, and hundreds of other Canadian
veterans return for a parade on National Liberation Day in the
Netherlands. Dutch people line the streets and applaud as they pass
in open-top military vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch shout ``Thank you!'' and step forward to shake the
Canadians' hands. Middle-aged and elderly women frequently step
from the curb to hand the veterans tulips, and sometimes to kiss
them. Even toddlers in strollers wave at the old men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch people are very gracious and very appreciative of
what we did,'' said Shore, whose father was the cousin of the
Boston Bruins hockey legend Eddie Shore. ``And we're very
appreciative of the reception they give us every five years. It's
important for us to come back here, especially for the young
people, so they'll remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Menno Nelis agrees with that. As the parade began, the
11-year-old boy climbed into the Jeep and sat between Shore and the
79-year-old Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We study the war in school,'' the boy said. ``I know what
these men did, and I am very thankful to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shore beamed at the boy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Canadian soldiers arrived in Amsterdam on May 5, 1945,
Shore's commanding officer in the Seaforth Highlanders regiment
ordered him to seize control of the telephone exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``A German general surrendered to me. I was just a buck
private,'' Shore said, shaking his head, still amazed at the
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Every May 4, the Dutch observe Memorial Day. At 8 p.m., church
bells toll and nearly everyone in the Netherlands stops to observe
two minutes of silence for those who died in World War II,
especially those who perished in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In Amersfoort, southeast of Amsterdam, an old man got off his
bicycle and bowed his head for two minutes Thursday night. His
image, framed in the fading light, was extraordinarily moving.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, the anniversary of the liberation, the mood turns from
solemn to festive. But at the heart of everything is a respectful
commemoration of those who died, and of those who saved others from
dying.
</P>
<P>
   Memories are long in Holland, and often painful when it comes to
World War II. When war broke out, the Dutch declared their
neutrality, but the Germans invaded anyway. When the Dutch
resisted, the Germans bombed Rotterdam. The Netherlands quickly
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Though overwhelmed by the military power of the Third Reich, the
Dutch did not lie down. When the Nazis arrested 450 Jews in
Amsterdam in 1941, dockworkers went on strike. The sculptor Mari
Andriessen commemorates that stand with her famous ``Dokwerker
Monument,'' a revered memorial here on the Jonas Daniel
Meijerplein. At the Verzetsmuseum, the exploits of the Dutch
Resistance are accorded an honored place.
</P>
<P>
   By 1942, the Germans began deporting Holland's Jews to the
concentration camps. Many Jews tried to hide, and some were hidden
by ``righteous Gentiles,'' as they are known.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1942, Anne Frank, her family, and another family of
Dutch Jews hid in a small apartment behind a revolving bookcase at
the rear of a house at 263 Prinsengracht. Anne Frank was 13 when
she began writing her famous diary. She made her last entry in
August 1944, a few days before her family was arrested. She died
seven months later in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Anne
Frankhuis, the museum dedicated to her memory, is also a place of
honor in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans punished the Dutch for their defiance, cutting off
food during 1944 and 1945. Thousands died in what the Dutch call
the ``Hunger Winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Verloop was a skinny, malnourished 13-year-old when the
Canadians rolled into Amsterdam. Every five years, Verloop turns
out to greet and thank his liberators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans had capitulated, but we hadn't seen any allied
troops until the Canadians arrived,'' he said, standing on the
Leidseplein as the old soldiers rode by. ``As a boy, I was so happy
when they came into Amsterdam because it was then that I realized I
would live.''
</P>
<P>
   Verloop said the small parade is something that most Dutch
people hold dear, but it is getting smaller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad, because every five years there are fewer of them,''
he said. ``They're dying off.''
</P>
<P>
   In the back of their Jeep, Sam Shore and Howard Lyons both
acknowledged this could be their last reunion in Amsterdam. Shore
said he is at peace with himself and his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dutch teach their children about the war, about the
suffering and the sacrifice,'' Shore said.
</P>
<P>
   He looked down at 11-year-old Menno Nelis and put a comforting
arm around the boy. The boy smiled up at his 79-year-old hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' the old soldier said, using his other arm
to wave to the crowd. ``We'll never forget these people. And
they'll never forget us.''

 &HT;    Looking for love in all the wrong e-mail
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ You should never, never underestimate the
damage the words, ``I love you'' can do. Didn't your mama ever tell
you this? Didn't your roommate? Hasn't some bleary eyed guy on a
barstool who showed no evidence of having changed his clothes or
bathed for three days?
</P>
<P>
   How many times must experience prove this wisdom true?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, more than a million people all around the world
learned this harsh lesson anew. Everywhere in the global computing
village, computer systems, servers, individual hard drives and
Internet e-mail systems have been messed up and shut down. All
because of a virus _ a worm, actually; a visual basic script, if
you want to get technical _ carrying the alluring words
``ILOVEYOU'' squished together on its subject header.
</P>
<P>
   If you open this e-mail, you will find an attachment that seems
to be a mash note. It says ``LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are using Microsoft Outlook and click on that attachment
_ as some 1.5 million people around the world have _ a tiny,
10-byte series of commands go to work corrupting Outlook, your
Internet browser and your operating system. It will peek into your
address book and send copies of itself to everyone listed there. It
will overwrite the picture and music files on your hard drive. It
will mess with the files that run Windows. It will change your
browser's start page. It will do everything but go into your
refrigerator, drink all the beer and leave the empties for someone
else to throw away.
</P>
<P>
   And this is happening because millions of people think somebody
out there loves them and is finally sharing those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   This is too sad. We are a planet of chumps.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this virus more insidious than its predecessors is
not only sophisticated programming, but good timing and
salesmanship. Past viruses had hokey and unconvincing headers. VERY
IMPORTANT MESSAGE!!! OPEN NOW! LOOK AT THIS! WIN BIG PRIZES! They
looked like junk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   This one, however, aims right at the heart. It exploits the
suspicion that somewhere out there, someone is pining for you. It
preys on the misapprehension that some past meaningless
conversation was actually a come-on. It practices on the deeply
held belief that since it's spring, new action is around the
corner. It exploits the arrogance of those who believe several
people are hot for them.
</P>
<P>
   And since the return address seems to be from someone who has
you in his or her address book, the illusion is even more
convincing. The poor sucker thinks: ``I knew she had it for me, but
why did she e-mail this as an attachment?'' A click of the mouse
and another fool's paradise is shattered.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the unbelievable spread of the virus is that
few people believe virus warnings. The average e-mail inbox is
stuffed with unsolicited advertising, bad jokes, urban myths, and
bogus virus warnings. Roughly in that order. That means many people
who were warned weren't helped. They deleted the advice without
reading it.
</P>
<P>
   A planet of Internet users is looking for love in all the wrong
places. If the worm weren't so destructive _ damage estimates are
as high as $1 billion this would be funny. Or maybe reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   It seems some of the smartest and best-paid people around the
globe are not too sophisticated to avoid falling for The Old Fake
Love Note Trick. Sending a fake love note to engineer a comeuppance
is a prank so old it was shopworn when Shakespeare used it. And
used it and used it.
</P>
<P>
   The best pranks don't grow old, they just go global.
</P>
<P>
   The virus proves that even in our cynical age, many people scan
their e-mail expecting love notes. Stupid, but still sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of the virus claims to be a joke in its heading.
That won't work. E-mail jokes are as common as anti-virus notices.
It doesn't use the magic words. We are willing to take dumb risks
for love. But not for jokes. Not generally.

 &HT;    Children learn good behavior by parents' example
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The Miami Senior High School class of 1951
was the first to hold commencement ceremonies in the new Dade
County Auditorium. My boyfriend Jimmy picked me up in his '39
Mercury coupe. His cap and gown were in the back seat. I wore mine,
and as we headed east on Flagler Street, I swiveled the rear-view
mirror to fiddle with the tassle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep it flat,'' Jimmy reminded me. ``Remember what we were
told in assembly.'' I remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortarboards are to be worn flat _ level with the ground,''
the dean had pronounced. ``Graduation is a solemn ceremony and your
parents will be watching. Walk tall, be proud, and above all, don't
get cute with your cap. It was not designed to be cocked over one
ear or shoved onto the back of the head. It is to be worn with
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   All of us knew the textbook definition of that word. DIGNITY:
bearing, conduct, or speech indicative of self-respect or
appreciation of the formality or gravity of an occasion. But we
were still struggling with the concept.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, football games were not dignified occasions.
Miami's Orange Bowl rocked with our screams as we jumped up and
down, imploring the god of the spheroid to bless us with just one
more touchdown so we could leave arch-rival Lee of Jacksonville,
eating our dust.
</P>
<P>
   After-game ``stomps'' in the east patio were a semi-dignified
affair. When we weren't jitterbugging to Glenn Miller's ``String of
Pearls'' or slow-dancing to ``Moon Over Miami,'' we were drinking
Cokes and checking out the week's newest couples, and generally
goofing around.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers always erupted when the football players, freshly
showered and hyped from another win, strode in from the field
house. That was about as noisy as we got except for the time
somebody tossed Poo Poo Pollack into the tiled fountain in the
center of the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Formal dances and Wednesday morning assemblies called for all
the dignity a teenager could muster. The first because we were
dressed to within an inch of our lives, and the second because we
knew that if we acted up we'd soon be headed for the Dean's office
and kissing our backsides goodbye on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, though they might get goofy with us kids now and then,
mostly behaved with grown-up dignity. We thought it was because
they were ancient and too decrepit to whoop it up. Later, when we
reached that stage with kids of our own, we figured it out.
</P>
<P>
   Dignity is all tied up with self-respect and appropriate
behavior, the latter being the only manner in which folks can
survive in close proximity to one another without throttling the
neighbors over a too-loud stereo, or maiming the kid who
consistently tosses the morning paper behind the holly bush.
</P>
<P>
   My parents used their dignity to teach me values. Mother taught
me it wasn't seemly to pull my dress over my head every time the
kindergarten teacher fussed at me. In like manner, I never saw my
mother do it either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Control that temper,'' my father warned, ``or you'll end up
making a fool of yourself every time.'' He set the example, and
eventually I caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the thou-shalt-nots accumulated, and though I
was often bored and frequently annoyed with the instruction, I
followed my parents' lead. It paid off.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, although I'm not sure exactly when, I sprouted
dignity, and when the time came I was able to pass it along to my
son. He says it serves him well.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida's Broward county, the superintendent of schools is
gearing up for this year's graduation by instructing his principals
to have parents wishing tickets to the solemn ceremony sign a
pledge promising to behave themselves. No more noise toys or
airhorns. No more raucous behavior.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good start Mr. Supe, but while you're at it, why not ask
the parents to consider honoring their graduates by dressing for
the occasion? Red Dog tee-shirts and half-bared butts belong in
bars _ not at their kids' commencements.
</P>
<P>
   It just ain't dignified.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gunning for the White House
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President George W. Bush will be the best buddy guns have had in
the White House in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   We have no less an authority for this intelligence than the
National Rifle Association, which is bragging on its candidate pal
and investing heavily in him and in, it hopes, a Republican
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush himself, this is an awkward moment. With most Americans
favoring the gun controls President Clinton has sought and Vice
President Gore proposes, Bush doesn't want to rasp entirely against
the grain of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But he sure as shootin' doesn't want to risk slowing the money
machine the NRA has cranked up on his behalf or risk giving pause
to the millions of voters the NRA is promising to turn out for him.
</P>
<P>
   So the Bush campaign, by way of trying to show that the
candidate isn't the gun lobby's boy toy, is both touting his
enthusiasm for the Second Amendment and emphasizing a couple of
rare points at which Bush strays from the gunners' party line. He
would raise the age for handgun buyers from 18 to 21 and would ban
imported, high-capacity ammunition magazines.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the lobby easily forgives such trifles,
understanding Bush's need to cling to at least one veil in public.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA's sugar-daddy money, however, speaks louder than Bush's
claims to chastity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 and 2000, the NRA has given $537,500 in ``soft money''
to the GOP. Its ante in the 1996 cycle was just $87,725. No NRA
money in those years has gone to the Democratic Party, though some
has supported invidual Democrats. And NRA Executive Vice President
Wayne LaPierre Jr. recently pledged $250,000 more to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA knows what it is buying. Bush has been close to the
lobby for years.
</P>
<P>
   When he was elected governor, the NRA's magazine crowed, ``Gun
Owners Win Big.'' Bush has delivered the big goods the lobby wanted
-- legislation to legalize concealed firearms and a law barring
Texas cities from suing gun manufacturers, as 31 cities and
counties have done elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Congresses have delivered, too, and hoping Republicans will
retain control and Bush will be elected, the gun industry has
broken off settlement negotiations in those lawsuits. The industry
expects President Bush to enact a national ban on lawsuits against
it.
</P>
<P>
   There is testimony to go with money. The NRA's second-ranking
officer has said that with Bush ``we'll have ... a president where
we can work out of their office.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayne Robinson, NRA first vice president and chairman of the
Iowa Republican Party, added, ``If we win, we'll have a Supreme
Court that will back us to the hilt.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, far more to any candidacy than just one
issue, this one tops no list of voter concerns, and personalities
seem to drive elections more than issues anyway. But in a nation
that annually suffers a civil bloodbath like no other, it is a
queer politics that works to swing a whole election on behalf of
the main instrument of that slaughter.

 &HT;    Computing in style
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long gone are the days when it was cool to set up your
computer in a dank, musty corner of the basement on an
easy-to-assemble wobbly desk from Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more people are getting home PCs, the computer is
attaining the status of the television set in American homes.
Currently, more than half of all U.S. families has at least one
computer somewhere in the house. With that number growing at an
incredible pace, having a computer is like having a TV. The
question now is where do you put it?
</P>
<P>
   Computer owners seem to be doing one of two things. They're
either proudly displaying their desktop on fancy, gadget-filled
desks or they're hiding it deep within the bowels of elaborate
armoire-like furniture pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more people are splitting their time between the home and
office, it's no longer 'Let me just throw it on the kitchen
table','' says local interior designer Jerry Poole. ``People are
getting computer-related furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Although you can still buy plenty of functional computer desks
at discount stores for less than $100, furniture designers have
jumped on the booming popularity of home PCs and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of our furniture lines have specifically addressed
furniture that is strictly for computers,'' says Custer Mayor of
Mayo Wholesale Furniture in northwest Atlanta. While this furniture
may look like a simple entertainment center, chest or desk, it's
specifically designed for computers with room for a tower,
keyboard, monitor and all the wiring, says Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   According to trend guru Faith Popcorn's BrainReserve marketing
firm, the number of at-home workers has increased by 100 percent in
the last five years to 10.5 million people. That number is expected
to double by 2005. While an estimated 40 percent of all employers
now offer telecommuting, one in eight of all households already has
a full time at-home worker.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn _ who coined the term ``cocooning'' and was dubbed the
``Nostradamus of marketing'' by Fortune magazine _ has even
ventured into the home office furniture design business herself.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that women are leaving corporate America and
starting their own businesses at twice the rate of men, Popcorn
designed a line of home office furniture designed specifically for
women. There are two collections in her inaugural line _ the
feminine and traditional La Cocoon and the hipper, clean-lines of
Satellite.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being more attractive than just a basic computer
desk, the lines include special touches designed to appeal to women
including a locking compartment for purses and other personal
items, a built-in bud vase and felt-lined jewelry trays for women
who may take off their earrings when they pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn designed the desks higher than usual because, she says,
women tend to cross their legs while they're sitting. In addition,
there's a stepstool that can double as a child's desk to keep the
tykes occupied when Mom is working at home.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn's furniture ranges from $450 for the stepstool to $4,500
for a desk/credenza. Obviously, these new computer furniture pieces
are far from cheap. Milling Road, a division of the upscale Baker
Furniture Company, for example, offers an impressive leather-top
desk that retails for an even more awe-inspiring $9,262.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customer is often the executive person _ usually between
30 and 50 _ who started his own business out of his home,'' says
Milling Road lead designer Joe McCambridge. ``He doesn't want to
work off a piece of plywood desk. He wants something that will
impress his customers.''
</P>
<P>
   This desk should do the trick. Complete with a drop front
keyboard drawer, hidden space for computer towers and printers, the
maple desk is 18th century Italian design, says McCambridge.
(Milling Road furniture is available locally at Beverly Hall
Furniture Galleries, Matthews and Flack's Interiors.) It's
obviously a step way above the basic metal job you can pick up at
an office supply story.
</P>
<P>
   How much people spend on their computer furniture seems to
depend on where they plan on putting it, designers and retailers
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're putting it in a space in their house where they
entertain _ like the living room _ then they spend more so they can
conceal it,'' says Poole. ``If it's going in their basement or
bedroom where generally people won't see it, then they spend just
several hundred dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who don't want to look at their PC when they're not
using it, a few furniture companies have designed serious
armoire-like pieces to conceal the computer when it's not in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look at it from three feet away you think it's just a nice
piece of furniture,'' says Mayo. ``But then doors come open and
drawers open and trays come out. It's ingenious.''
</P>
<P>
   As people spend more time at home on their computers, they want
their home office to resemble their work office in many respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients want more than just a writing desk. They want a desk
like they would have in their office with all the file drawers,
keyboard trays and other details but with styling that is
appropriate to their home in quality and styling,'' says
Minneapolis interior designer Sue Walling. ``They want their home
office to function just like their office outside the home would.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with beaucoup bucks to spend, designers like Walling
often design a set-up to meet their clients' needs. Some people,
for example, want televisions and stereo equipment built into their
office cabinetry.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, people now want their home offices to be
convenient, comfortable and practical too. Says Walling, ``It is
passe to think a home office only needs to look good.''

 &HT;    NHL Rock the Rink is action packedBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Put a bunch of beer-league WWF drop-outs from the Marty McSorley
School of Hockey up against downsized NHL teams of goons and
power-players and you've got NHL Rock the Rink ($40; www.ea.com;
for the Sony PlayStation), a gloriously over-the-top,
three-on-three version of the coolest game on Earth, where there's
as much action after the whistle as there is during play. Monster
hits and checks, stick swinging and body slams punctuate impossible
play and super moves. Graphics are notably chunky and blotchy, as
we've come to expect on the outmoded Sony console, but the
intensity of gameplay more than makes up for the base presentation.
Riddled with overly enthusiastic color-commentary, Vancouver's
local sports personality, Don Taylor (along with a Don Cherry
sound-alike) keeps the laughs coming with improbable remarks such
as ``ludicrous save!'' or, after a particularly nasty hit, ``Oh!
The athletic protector comes through when it counts!'' Lots of
long-term aggression-letting and a definite ``party game'' for two
players at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In its last incarnation, ``Nemesis'' for the Sony Playstation,
the Resident Evil videogame series was starting to look like it was
on its last, decomposing zombie legs. Leave it to the Sega
Dreamcast and Capcom to pump some new blood into the series with
Resident Evil: Code Veronica ($50, www.capcom.com), a breathtaking
survival horror game that takes the best elements of the series and
adds the horsepower of the Dreamcast. Following heroine Claire
Redfield, you explore dynamically lit environments, gunning through
zombies, rabid dogs and exquisite cinematic scenes. Other
enhancements include the ability to carry more than one weapon for
that John Woo effect, an enhanced map system and, of course, much
better graphics. The best of the Resident Evil games, Code Veronica
has been keeping us up late, itching for more.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Coming in at roughly $1.26 per game, Hasbro Interactive's Atari
Arcade Hits ($20; www.hasbrointeractive. com) offers retro gaming
at its finest. Twelve arcade ``classics'' (some bona fide
masterpieces, some instantly forgettable) in a desktop arcade are
included _ a quick trip down memory lane when games were
simplistic, pure and downright addictive. Blockbuster games like
Asteroids and the superior sequel, Asteroids Deluxe, are emulated
faithfully _ save for the fact that a keyboard cannot, by nature,
offer the same rapid fire of the original hair-trigger buttons.
Likewise, Centipede and its follow-up, Millipede, or the stalwart
Missile Command, were originally designed for a track-ball
interface, though a frightfully fast mouse such as the Razer
Boomslang 2000 does afford speed twitch effect otherwise
unrealized. Other ``hits'' such as the original, vector-beam
Battlezone and Gravitar not only stand the test of time but also
offset the otherwise dreary drudgery of Crystal Castles, Warlords
and the woefully plain Pong.

 &HT;    By Staff Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   You've heard it said of Pokemon that fans ``gotta catch 'em
all.'' Moving with their runaway hit _ which is also the only thing
keeping Nintendo's sales numbers high and mighty above third-rate
game developer status _ the Pokemon craze culminates with Pokemon
Stadium ($60; www. nintendo.com; for the Nintendo 64) by offering a
new way to corral the hard-earned, dutifully nurtured bubble-gum
characters. Essentially useless without the GameBoy Color companion
piece, Stadium comes bundled with a ``Transfer Pak'' and allows for
traded and trained GBC Red, Blue and/or Yellow Poke-characters to
migrate and play together in multiplayer arena games and trading
modes. But without a GBC from which to migrate, Stadium is a
lightweight romp without reward and not conducive to the ``catch,
train and trade 'em all'' phenomenon _ while Nintendo takes your
money in a whole new way. Fans rejoice while everyone else rolls
their eyes and wonders when the craze will end _ or, better said,
if the craze will end: Pokemon Stadium has already sold well over a
million copies.
</P>
<P>
   A MOUSE-HAVE FOR KIDDOS
</P>
<P>
   Kutoka's Mia: The Search for Grandma's Remedy ($40;
www.kutoka.com; for PC and Mac with QuickTime) displays
conscientiousness toward childhood education while still retaining
playfulness. Designed for kids ages 5 and up, players guide a cute
little mouse named Mia through a resplendent 3-D cartoon
environment via simple mouse/cursor control. Mia's simple quest to
fetch a few ingredients is complicated by various puzzles and
simple games encountered along the way. It is always pleasant,
slow-paced and easy to understand. Mia side-scrolls through most of
the adventure, though she also has some freedom of movement through
the foreground and background as she chases the cursor wherever it
may be and interacts with other characters or objects as they are
clicked while talking to and encouraging the game player. The one
flaw might be the lack of distinction between scenery and
interactive icons on the screen, but it's a tiny issue. Yet another
wee scholarly endeavor that makes learning fun.

 &HT;    As download beat goes on, recording industry fights back
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The online music revolution will not be televised.
</P>
<P>
   It's being played out right now on the Web and in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this, thousands, possibly millions, of college
students and other music lovers are downloading recorded music from
the Beatles to the Backstreet Boys from digital download sites such
as MP3.com, or using file-sharing software called Napster
(www.napster.com).
</P>
<P>
   Like Amazon.com, which scored its early success because it was
able to offer a variety of books that no brick-and-mortar store
could stock, the sheer volume of recorded music available on the
Internet is staggering. Digital download fans can pick and choose
and make their own personal music collections.
</P>
<P>
   And every last track, from every last artist, is free _ for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   One student recently told MTV she never buys music anymore, that
she and her roommate just download the songs they want from the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really knows what to do about this. Artists don't want to
alienate their fans, but they do want to make money.
</P>
<P>
   But while music junkies are loading up on their favorite tunes
from MP3.com or Napster, they are bypassing traditional methods of
buying music. They are clogging university networks uploading and
downloading songs. And even though bands like U2 seem to be in the
music business just to fight for human rights and world peace, at
the end of the day, they still want a paycheck. With the digital
download situation as it now stands, that could be endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the parties involved, the Recording Industry Association
of America is the most upset, the most vocal and the most
litigious. The RIAA filed lawsuits against both Napster and MP3.com
for copyright infringement. On April 28, it won a key victory when
a federal judge said MP3.com had violated industry copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is potentially disastrous for MP3.com. The RIAA is
asking for damages that could exceed $6 billion. The New York Post
reported last week that the RIAA is willing to settle with MP3.com
for a cool $100 million. Some reports indicate MP3.com isn't
willing to settle.
</P>
<P>
   But while MP3.com and Napster slug it out in court, users are
still downloading music in higher numbers every day. Lars Ulrich,
drummer for the heavy metal band Metallica, personally delivered a
list of 335,435 Napster users Metallica claims have illegally
obtained the band's music online.
</P>
<P>
   Artists and record companies call this pirating. Users call it
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rosenbloum, an entertainment attorney and vice president
of business affairs for the Web site ArtistDirect (www.
artistdirect.com), says downloading even one song to play while
you're surfing the Web is a violation of fair-use laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four factors of fair use,'' Rosenbloum says. ``The
purpose of the work, the nature of the use, the amount of the work
that was taken and whether the use undermines the market for the
original. Whether (digital downloads) undermine the market for the
original is characterized as the most important factor in these
decisions, and its easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Napster,'' he continues. ``The ultimate goal of that
company is business. One day, there will be an advertising model.
Even though they don't post the files (Napster allows users to
share their digital files with other users who are logged on at the
same time), the creative works that are available would be worthy
of the highest degree of protection under copyright law. Most
people looking at this would say it very clearly undermines the
market potential for the original.''
</P>
<P>
   For the average, normally law-abiding computer user busy
downloading music, it's time to install that cable modem or
high-speed phone line and get moving if you want to get some free
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloum says the major recording labels are working out their
own plans to enter the fray. And once they get online, digital
music is going to cost you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you are going to start seeing over the next six
months is an increasing willingness on the part of the major labels
to compete with what's going on out there,'' Rosenbloum says. ``You
will see continued use of legislation and a combined effort by all
of the major labels to come up with a combined business model to
combat the illegal uses we are seeing now. ``
</P>
<P>
   Even though the RIAA is determined to take its case through the
legal system, Rosenbloum says he's not sure legislation is the
right way to attack this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an outspoken critic of legislation,'' he says. ``Often the
best solution to a conflict is by discussion, negotiation and
mediation. But sometimes legislation is your only option if one
side or the other won't compromise _ especially in this very
complicated area.''

 &HT;    Portable DVD is just grand _ actually, $1,300
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   If you love your DVD collection and can't stand to be without
your movies when you travel, the Sharp DV-L70U ($1,300,
www.sharp-usa.com) is an excellent way to view them in style. With
a 7-inch LCD display that produces clear, vibrant images on an
anti-glare screen and good sound, the DV-L70U will play DVDs, Video
CDs and standard audio CDs. It has inputs and outputs for
displaying from other sources or outputting to your home system
with digital sound if you want to use it as a standard DVD player.
Boasting a battery life of about three hours on a single charge,
the portable player lives up to its main purpose: With headphones,
it's the ultimate in-flight gadget. But with the cost of standard
DVD players dipping below $200, the price just doesn't seem right.
Still, if DVDs are your game, the Sharp portable DVD player is a
phenomenal product and a great way to organize your own personal
screening.

 &HT;    How to remove Explorer 5.5
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I downloaded Explorer 5.5 and tried it. I no longer wish to use
it. Besides reformatting the hard drive, how do I get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   _Jim Huntley, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Others are asking, too. Instead of listing the steps for
uninstalling Explorer 5.5 on a PC, we'll steer you to www.help.com.
Click the Internet Explorer link. You'll find a link to uninstall
using the Add/Remove program from your Control Panel. Microsoft's
Web site (www.microsoft.com) also tells how to use Add/Remove to
delete Explorer. Type Explorer 5.5 in the search bar. At the bottom
of the next page, click on ``Next 10 Results (11-20)  &QR;  &QR; '' link. See
``How to Uninstall Internet Explorer 5.5.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Installing an application can put files everywhere,
making the bits and pieces hard to find. Control panels,
extensions, preferences, etc., may have names you wouldn't
associate with the app.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Look for utilities to help uninstall unwanted apps or to
keep a hard drive lean and mean. For the PC, check out Uninstaller
from CyberMedia or CleanSweep Deluxe. And for our Mac loyalists,
Tri-Cleaner 2.02 or SpringCleaning from Aladdin Systems. There are
more. Do your homework.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm on Windows 95 and use Internet Explorer. I set Explorer to
reject cookies, but an annoying message keeps asking if I want to
allow them. I click ``No'' repeatedly. It's tiresome. Can you turn
it off? How do you reject cookies without getting a message?
</P>
<P>
   _Marie McIntyre, Monroe, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Browsers have preference settings to let you pick between
always accepting cookies, getting a prompt before accepting
cookies, or blocking them. (Newer browsers have more cookie control
options.) Perhaps your browser is set to prompt you, and that's why
it asks permission. Be aware, some sites won't let you visit if you
disable cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: What are cookies exactly? What they are NOT is edible. No
chocolate chips or sugary sprinkles. Cookies are saved to a text
file on your hard drive and contain information a Web site gathers
from you. They help the Web site recognize you the next time you
drop by. Cookies can save you from retyping a user ID or password,
and they remember on-line purchases. They also track surfing habits
and are used for marketing research.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Making Web life easier is one thing, but some think cookies
muck with your privacy. There are steps you can take if you have
privacy concerns or want to trash cookie clutter. You can delete
your cookie file. It's called cookies.txt on Windows and
MagicCookie on a Mac. Of course, your browser creates a new, empty
one each time.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Freeware and shareware are available to manage and filter
cookies, too. We came across Internet JunkBuster Proxy, Cookie
Crusher and Cookie Pal for the PC, and Cookie Monster, Cookie
Cutter and WebFree for the Mac.

 &HT;    Me2Cam forces children out of their seats to play games
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're concerned with the amount of time your
child spends hunched over a mouse or joystick playing computer
games, you might want to take a look at the Me2Cam Virtual Game
System from Intel Play.
</P>
<P>
   To play games with the system, the child stands in front of the
Me2Cam, a small video camera mounted on top of the computer
monitor, and moves his or her body to control the action on the
screen. The Me2Cam picks up the image of the child and inserts the
moving picture into the animated game action.
</P>
<P>
   A snowboarding game, for instance, requires the child to shift
quickly from side to side to guide a snowboard downhill while
steering around some obstacles and jumping over others. A dancing
game encourages vigorous motion by playing the music faster and
faster as the player dances faster.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with the Me2Cam probably won't give a child as much
activity as playing outdoors, but it's a lot more physical than
most computer games.
</P>
<P>
   The Me2Cam game system features Universal Serial Bus (USB)
connectors, so if your computer is an older model that doesn't have
USB ports, you won't be able to use the system without
modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Set-up is easy. After the programming CD-ROM is inserted,
on-screen instructions lead you through the steps to optimize the
game's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game is turned on and a player is selected, the system
is controlled entirely by body movements. A voice prompt tells the

   The Me2Cam Virtual Game System is rated for children 4 years old
or older. The games are simple and easy to learn, but they may not
hold the interest of teens or young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Currently only one CD-ROM containing five games is available,
but Intel Play likely will offer more games in the future if the
system catches on. The video camera that comes with the system is
similar to cameras used for sending video snapshots online, but the
programming CD only includes software for using the camera with the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The system sells online at www.shopmattel.com for $69.95 and is
available at software and office supply merchandisers for about the
same price.

 &HT;    If impact printer makes you happy, just keep using it
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mail from the Windows refuseniks continues rolling in,
both the sweet and the surly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude is typical for the crowd with more money than
sense,'' announces a fellow defending impact printers. He may be
right, but I have so little of either it's hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Panasonic dot-matrix (printer) works with Windows in about
70 percent of the things I need to do, even on graphics without
color. It's faster under DOS than Windows 98, even, and still
faster than Windows driving a HP Deskjet. Please give me a GOOD
reason for discarding it in favor of a slower, more expensive
printer for all my printing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's that other 30 percent that goes unmentioned in
your diatribe. Further, I never suggested you discard anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you have a tech department to keep upgrading your
equipment and to sort out difficulties, so it costs you personally
little to play the `keep up with Joneses' game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not hardly, and I've never been able to keep up with the
Joneses. The Hatfields or the McCoys, perhaps, but not the Joneses.
And insofar as expense goes, I believe we paid about $550 for our
last dot-matrix printer. You can get an inkjet printer that does a
vastly superior job now for $150 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, inkjets are a lot more expensive to run, and if you
need to do a lot of printing, then a laser is the way to go. But if
you've got an impact printer that does what you need to do, then
far be it from me to suggest you trash it.
</P>
<P>
   Another, gentler fellow reports that ``My wife and adult kids
keep after me to get a new setup rather than just upgrade my old
box and to get the latest Microsoft programs. I don't need 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first computer was an Osborne which included SuperCalc,
WordStar and that big database. I now use Q&AMP;A and just keep
upgrading the spreadsheet and the word processor.''
</P>
<P>
   You mean Q&AMP;A is still around? A fine program it was (or is),
too. My first computer was a Morrow, which of course ran the same
miserable operating system as your Osborne _ CP/M. I've never felt
the same about spreadsheets since I found I couldn't get more than
about a dozen rows of eight cells each into its 64K memory.
</P>
<P>
   And you remember that wonderful Wordstar Catch-22? You'd be
typing along on the Great American Novel, tell it to save your
work, and if you had been careless about watching your floppy disk
space (no hard drives then) it would report there wasn't enough
room to save your work.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Put in a new disk, save to that. Oh, WordStar wouldn't let
you do that. You had to use the disk you'd been working with. You,
my friend, were out of space and out of luck, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Microsoft because Windows will not allow me to put my
DOS menu program as the first screen when starting,'' this
gentleman continues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, really. That's like hating ``Frankenstein Meets the
Wolfman'' because Bela Lugosi wasn't in it, or loathing Dvorak's
9th Symphony because it doesn't sound like Beethoven's Sixth. Of
course it doesn't allow you to put your DOS menu in place of the
desktop. It's supposed to replace your DOS menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will use my old DOS WordStar to write most of the copy for
my Rotary Club's 144-page catalog for our upcoming Artists of
America Gala Sale and Exhibition,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   You, sir, are hopeless. But I admire you, just as I have a
sneaking admiration for those hardy souls who not only still smoke,
but roll their own.
</P>
<P>
   From Denver comes a note from a fellow puzzled by the recent
report from a PFS Professional File user who said his current date
function now always produces something in the year 1900. His PFS,
he said, prefers the year '27, in an unspecified century.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes a kind gentleman offering relief to the fellow who
is using a Leading Edge word processing program and was trying to
find an old version of Word for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vandiver says he can probably help you. Get in touch with
him at 76350.1227(at)compuserve.com.

 &HT;    Net is revolutionary, but doesn't change life's basics
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You'd think, from reading the newspaper and listening
to the TV, that the Internet has changed everything. There are new
rules for marketers. The way we communicate with friends and
co-workers is changing. In short, the Internet has been a
combination of the hydrogen bomb, the Salk vaccine for polio and
Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation with any important new technology is to stop
seeing shades of gray and to assume _ because it is new _ that
everything we knew up until then is wrong. So, depending on what
you do for a living, you may think that newspapers as we know them
will vanish, retail stores will become little more than kiosks
where you'll order things from the Internet, doctors will make
house calls by telecommunicating to your computer, and life will
become so virtual that it will be hard to tell if it's Uncle Fred
or Memorex.
</P>
<P>
   Look, the Internet is a big deal. It has changed things, but
it's shortsighted, naive and human to think it has somehow
short-circuited common sense. In fact, there's strong evidence for
the argument that _ now that the hysteria is dying some _ the old
rules haven't been suspended at all.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with e-commerce. Two years ago, you were being told
that starting any kind of a dot-com was like having a license to
print money. And the stock market and venture capitalists bore that
out. Twentysomethings started dot-coms right and left, became
millionaires, and their stunning successes indicated that commerce
was forever changed. Nowadays, you are seeing some of these
companies fall out of favor as Rule One of the marketplace begins
to reassert itself: Sooner or later you have to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the e-commerce boom, there were serious and dark
worries that the Internet would somehow destroy society _ with
mankind crawling back into caves, this time into electronic ones.
Instead of going out to eat, we'd munch cold pizza by the computer
monitor; instead of holding conversations with each other, we'd
have computer chats; and reality itself would blur as the
difference between a real person and a virtual human narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   But the last time I went to a restaurant, I had to wait for a
table. The last time I was at a movie, I saw real people holding
hands. The Internet has become _ as it should have _ just another
way to talk, another way to set a date for the movies. Sure, there
are people who live online, but before the Internet there were
people who lived on the phone. There have always been people who
overdo things, people who don't have healthy lives. It's possible
to get lost in a virtual world, but most of us are still doing fine
living our lives out where the sun shines.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. The Internet is a big deal, is changing
business and society, but _ as during the time of the advent of the
telephone network _ those changes are mostly taking place within
the framework of the world that already existed.
</P>
<P>
   Stop for a moment and tell me one brand new thing the Internet
has delivered. Maybe you download your music from the Internet now
instead of buying a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you order the Fruit-of-the-Month Club from the Web page
instead of the catalog ... but the sounds are just as enticing, the
fruit just as sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Life goes on. You can tell me how the Internet has speeded up
things; you can explain how it has offered new avenues for
commerce, new ways to talk to each other, or how it has made the
world smaller and easier to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you have a brand-new notion that I haven't heard, I
don't expect to hear of any fundamental shift in life as we know
it.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've been worrying that you'd have to reinvent your
business or yourself, stop worrying. Life is still good.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: I took my kids to
<TEXT>
the Backstreet Boys concert. I paid for the tickets but told them
if they wanted a souvenir, they would have to use their allowances.
My daughter bought a necklace, and when she opened it the next day,
it was broken. Who can I contact for a replacement? My daughter is
counting on you!
<P>
   _ S. Sohns
</P>
<P>
   A: Send the necklace and a letter with contact information
explaining the problem to Winterland, Andrea Sitchon, 1951 Fairway
Drive, San Liandro, Calif. 94577. Every effort will be made to find
a replacement necklace.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for burgundy berets for a church youth group. Do
you know where I might find some?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Berets are not just for Basques anymore. From the French
resistance in World War II to followers of Che Guevara, the beret
has become a symbol of rebellion. Berets (cotton, wool, knitted _
even reversible faux animal print) are sold by Village Hat Shop at
www.villagehatshop.com (prices begin at $8.95).
</P>
<P>
   Q: My best friend is getting married in France, and neither one
of us knows local traditions. Her fiance' is from Malataverne,
north of Marseilles. What are the traditions of French weddings and
receptions?
</P>
<P>
   _ Sonja Wooten
</P>
<P>
   A: Bons souhaits! There are some bygone customs such as the
coupe de marriage, a double-handled marriage cup used for a toast,
as well as giving bridesmaids fans with mythological theme in Louis
XVI fashion. Another ancient tradition? Scatter laurel leaves
outside the church for luck. French Consulate press attache
Veronique Lhemann notes that in small French towns the couple has a
civil ceremony at the mayor's office. The wedding party then walks
to a church for a religious ceremony. That evening a large
all-night party is held complete with wine (vin d'honneur), food
and dancing. Lhemann remarks children traditionally attend the
French bride and groom, unlike the adult bridesmaids and groomsmen
in the United States. Q: We have an over-friendly bird that spends
hours each day flying directly into a window. The noise is heard
throughout the house. Can you help us save this bird and our
window?
</P>
<P>
   _ Felicity McKevitt
</P>
<P>
   A: This bird sees its own reflection and either thinks this
other bird is competition or a conceivable mate. Your bird is
defending territory or trying to meet a possible prom date. Cover
the window with cardboard to eliminate the reflection or place a
rubber snake or plastic owl on the ledge. In a week or so the bird
will have moved on to disturb another family.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have heard that shrinking heads involves hot sand, but I
cannot find anything on the process to confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   _ S. Davis
</P>
<P>
   A: Head shrinking is how a conquering tribesman converts the
power of his victim to himself. Currently outlawed, the practice is
historically connected to the Jivaro Indians. The victim's head is
removed and slit down the back to allow the skull to be removed.
The skin is shrunk by placing hot stones or sand in the cavity
until cool. Repeat. The head constricts as the material cools.
During the process, which takes several days, the skin is rubbed
with charcoal dust to keep the victim's avenging soul from
escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for soft winter- wheat flour; it is supposed to
make the lightest biscuits and scones due to its low protein
content.
</P>
<P>
   _ Juliette Miller
</P>
<P>
   A: You can order it from The White Lily Foods Company at (800)
264-5459. A five-pound bag is only $2, plus $5 for shipping. The
soft red winter wheat in this flour is lower in protein and gluten.
Gluten is the protein that makes cakes and biscuits softer and less
gummy.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I swim almost every day. My swimsuits only last three months,
and they are getting more and more expensive. I have tried rinsing
in cold water and in a machine in cold on delicate. I have tried
washing by hand once a week with shampoo. My last suit I never
washed (ugh!!), and it still only lasted a few months. How can the
life of a woman's swimsuit be extended?
</P>
<P>
   _ Francine Rosenstein
</P>
<P>
   A: The durability of a swimsuit depends on fabric, not brand,
say the gurus at Speedo, (888) 4-SPEEDO.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion swimsuits, made of weaker fabrics, are for sunbathers,
not swimmers. Lycra suits are for competitive swimmers seeking
speed, not durability. Nylon is a strong fabric often chosen by
those in aggressive activities such as water polo. In chlorinated
water? A polyester suit may work best. Speedo carries a variety of
nylon and polyester suits. Swimsuit care? Rinse your suit
thoroughly with tap water. If a chlorine odor remains, use a little
Woolite. Dry flat. Do not use detergent. Place a towel between your
suit and rough surfaces to prolong suit life. Contact Jane Greig at

 &HT;    Numerous sites offering legal help
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You needn't have a ski mask and a sawed-off shotgun to
come into contact with the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans have an occasional brush with the law _ whether
it comes from buying a new home, getting a divorce, settling a
small-claims court issue, making a will, incorporating a small
business or forming a business partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawyers would _ understandably and logically enough _
recommend that each of these issues be handled by a legal
professional. But even if you plan to consult a lawyer, it's smart
to educate yourself beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the World Wide Web can offer an astonishing amount
of legal help.
</P>
<P>
   By far one of the best and most comphrehensive legal sites is
called Nolo.com (www.nolo.com).
</P>
<P>
   Especially worthwhile is a section called the Legal Encyclopedia
at www.nolo.com/encyclopedia/index.html. The name is a bit
misleading since, instead of essays and definitions, you'll find
well-reasoned self-help tips divided by categories, such as child
custody, purchasing a car, traffic court, small-claims court, debt
collections and bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the sort of advice you can expect, in this case about
deciding whether to file a lawsuit: ``You need to answer three
fundamental _ and fairly obvious _ questions as part of deciding
whether it's worthwhile to bring a lawsuit: 1. Do I have a good
case? 2. Can I achieve my goal in some other way _ for example, by
proposing a compromise settlement or mediation? 3. Assuming a
lawsuit is my best or only option, can I collect when I win?''
</P>
<P>
   This site takes good advantage of the interactivity possible on
the Web. For instance, if you decide to follow the compromise or
mediation route, you'll be able to read detailed information on
those options.
</P>
<P>
   Mediation is increasingly important these days as a way to
settle a legal issue outside the court system but with the aid of
impartial professionals. There is great information on that topic
at a site called Mediation Issues at adrr.com/adr1/. Among many
other topics on this page, you'll find links that will help you
learn about the ethics of mediation, its pitfalls, the sort of
credentials a mediator needs and mediation's place in family law.
</P>
<P>
   FindLaw.com at www.findlaw.com/ is an especially practical site.
There are links from there to sections that will help you find a
lawyer with the skills needed for your case, as well as sections on
constitutional, intellectual property and labor law. Lawyers can
use the site to learn more about professional development courses
and seminars and to take advantage of the case law and expert
witness sections.
</P>
<P>
   Another rich trove of legal information can be found at a site
called the 'Lectric Law Library Laypeople's Legal Lounge at
www.lectlaw.com/lay.html. While the name may be a little unwieldy,
the information is not.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find more links to topics than can be listed here, but
among them are areas on Civil Procedure Outline, Handling Your Own
Injury Claim, How to Fight Your Traffic Ticket, Lawyers' Billing
Abuses, Keeping Legal Fees Down During a Divorce and Finding a Free
or Reduced-Cost Lawyer. Finally, if you have more than a passing
interest in the law, you'll want to check out the site called

 &HT;    NHL Rock the Rink is action packedBy Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Put a bunch of beer-league WWF drop-outs from the Marty McSorley
School of Hockey up against downsized NHL teams of goons and
power-players and you've got NHL Rock the Rink ($40; www.ea.com;
for the Sony PlayStation), a gloriously over-the-top,
three-on-three version of the coolest game on Earth, where there's
as much action after the whistle as there is during play. Monster
hits and checks, stick swinging and body slams punctuate impossible
play and super moves. Graphics are notably chunky and blotchy, as
we've come to expect on the outmoded Sony console, but the
intensity of gameplay more than makes up for the base presentation.
Riddled with overly enthusiastic color-commentary, Vancouver's
local sports personality, Don Taylor (along with a Don Cherry
sound-alike) keeps the laughs coming with improbable remarks such
as ``ludicrous save!'' or, after a particularly nasty hit, ``Oh!
The athletic protector comes through when it counts!'' Lots of
long-term aggression-letting and a definite ``party game'' for two
players at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In its last incarnation, ``Nemesis'' for the Sony Playstation,
the Resident Evil videogame series was starting to look like it was
on its last, decomposing zombie legs. Leave it to the Sega
Dreamcast and Capcom to pump some new blood into the series with
Resident Evil: Code Veronica ($50, www.capcom.com), a breathtaking
survival horror game that takes the best elements of the series and
adds the horsepower of the Dreamcast. Following heroine Claire
Redfield, you explore dynamically lit environments, gunning through
zombies, rabid dogs and exquisite cinematic scenes. Other
enhancements include the ability to carry more than one weapon for
that John Woo effect, an enhanced map system and, of course, much
better graphics. The best of the Resident Evil games, Code Veronica
has been keeping us up late, itching for more.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Coming in at roughly $1.26 per game, Hasbro Interactive's Atari
Arcade Hits ($20; www.hasbrointeractive. com) offers retro gaming
at its finest. Twelve arcade ``classics'' (some bona fide
masterpieces, some instantly forgettable) in a desktop arcade are
included _ a quick trip down memory lane when games were
simplistic, pure and downright addictive. Blockbuster games like
Asteroids and the superior sequel, Asteroids Deluxe, are emulated
faithfully _ save for the fact that a keyboard cannot, by nature,
offer the same rapid fire of the original hair-trigger buttons.
Likewise, Centipede and its follow-up, Millipede, or the stalwart
Missile Command, were originally designed for a track-ball
interface, though a frightfully fast mouse such as the Razer
Boomslang 2000 does afford speed twitch effect otherwise
unrealized. Other ``hits'' such as the original, vector-beam
Battlezone and Gravitar not only stand the test of time but also
offset the otherwise dreary drudgery of Crystal Castles, Warlords
and the woefully plain Pong.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   You've heard it said of Pokemon that fans ``gotta catch 'em
all.'' Moving with their runaway hit _ which is also the only thing
keeping Nintendo's sales numbers high and mighty above third-rate
game developer status _ the Pokemon craze culminates with Pokemon
Stadium ($60; www. nintendo.com; for the Nintendo 64) by offering a
new way to corral the hard-earned, dutifully nurtured bubble-gum
characters. Essentially useless without the GameBoy Color companion
piece, Stadium comes bundled with a ``Transfer Pak'' and allows for
traded and trained GBC Red, Blue and/or Yellow Poke-characters to
migrate and play together in multiplayer arena games and trading
modes. But without a GBC from which to migrate, Stadium is a
lightweight romp without reward and not conducive to the ``catch,
train and trade 'em all'' phenomenon _ while Nintendo takes your
money in a whole new way. Fans rejoice while everyone else rolls
their eyes and wonders when the craze will end _ or, better said,
if the craze will end: Pokemon Stadium has already sold well over a
million copies.

   A MOUSE-HAVE FOR KIDDOS
</P>
<P>
   Kutoka's Mia: The Search for Grandma's Remedy ($40;
www.kutoka.com; for PC and Mac with QuickTime) displays
conscientiousness toward childhood education while still retaining
playfulness. Designed for kids ages 5 and up, players guide a cute
little mouse named Mia through a resplendent 3-D cartoon
environment via simple mouse/cursor control. Mia's simple quest to
fetch a few ingredients is complicated by various puzzles and
simple games encountered along the way. It is always pleasant,
slow-paced and easy to understand. Mia side-scrolls through most of
the adventure, though she also has some freedom of movement through
the foreground and background as she chases the cursor wherever it
may be and interacts with other characters or objects as they are
clicked while talking to and encouraging the game player. The one
flaw might be the lack of distinction between scenery and
interactive icons on the screen, but it's a tiny issue. Yet another
wee scholarly endeavor that makes learning fun.

 &HT;    Portable DVD is just grand _ actually, $1,300
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   If you love your DVD collection and can't stand to be without
your movies when you travel, the Sharp DV-L70U ($1,300,
www.sharp-usa.com) is an excellent way to view them in style. With
a 7-inch LCD display that produces clear, vibrant images on an
anti-glare screen and good sound, the DV-L70U will play DVDs, Video
CDs and standard audio CDs. It has inputs and outputs for
displaying from other sources or outputting to your home system
with digital sound if you want to use it as a standard DVD player.
Boasting a battery life of about three hours on a single charge,
the portable player lives up to its main purpose: With headphones,
it's the ultimate in-flight gadget. But with the cost of standard
DVD players dipping below $200, the price just doesn't seem right.
Still, if DVDs are your game, the Sharp portable DVD player is a
phenomenal product and a great way to organize your own personal
screening.

 &HT;    Computing in style
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long gone are the days when it was cool to set up your
computer in a dank, musty corner of the basement on an
easy-to-assemble wobbly desk from Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more people are getting home PCs, the computer is
attaining the status of the television set in American homes.
Currently, more than half of all U.S. families has at least one
computer somewhere in the house. With that number growing at an
incredible pace, having a computer is like having a TV. The
question now is where do you put it?
</P>
<P>
   Computer owners seem to be doing one of two things. They're
either proudly displaying their desktop on fancy, gadget-filled
desks or they're hiding it deep within the bowels of elaborate
armoire-like furniture pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more people are splitting their time between the home and
office, it's no longer 'Let me just throw it on the kitchen
table','' says local interior designer Jerry Poole. ``People are
getting computer-related furniture.''
</P>
<P>
   Although you can still buy plenty of functional computer desks
at discount stores for less than $100, furniture designers have
jumped on the booming popularity of home PCs and home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of our furniture lines have specifically addressed
furniture that is strictly for computers,'' says Custer Mayor of
Mayo Wholesale Furniture in northwest Atlanta. While this furniture
may look like a simple entertainment center, chest or desk, it's
specifically designed for computers with room for a tower,
keyboard, monitor and all the wiring, says Mayo.
</P>
<P>
   According to trend guru Faith Popcorn's BrainReserve marketing
firm, the number of at-home workers has increased by 100 percent in
the last five years to 10.5 million people. That number is expected
to double by 2005. While an estimated 40 percent of all employers
now offer telecommuting, one in eight of all households already has
a full time at-home worker.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn _ who coined the term ``cocooning'' and was dubbed the
``Nostradamus of marketing'' by Fortune magazine _ has even
ventured into the home office furniture design business herself.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that women are leaving corporate America and
starting their own businesses at twice the rate of men, Popcorn
designed a line of home office furniture designed specifically for
women. There are two collections in her inaugural line _ the
feminine and traditional La Cocoon and the hipper, clean-lines of
Satellite.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being more attractive than just a basic computer
desk, the lines include special touches designed to appeal to women
including a locking compartment for purses and other personal
items, a built-in bud vase and felt-lined jewelry trays for women
who may take off their earrings when they pick up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn designed the desks higher than usual because, she says,
women tend to cross their legs while they're sitting. In addition,
there's a stepstool that can double as a child's desk to keep the
tykes occupied when Mom is working at home.
</P>
<P>
   Popcorn's furniture ranges from $450 for the stepstool to $4,500
for a desk/credenza. Obviously, these new computer furniture pieces
are far from cheap. Milling Road, a division of the upscale Baker
Furniture Company, for example, offers an impressive leather-top
desk that retails for an even more awe-inspiring $9,262.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customer is often the executive person _ usually between
30 and 50 _ who started his own business out of his home,'' says
Milling Road lead designer Joe McCambridge. ``He doesn't want to
work off a piece of plywood desk. He wants something that will
impress his customers.''
</P>
<P>
   This desk should do the trick. Complete with a drop front
keyboard drawer, hidden space for computer towers and printers, the
maple desk is 18th century Italian design, says McCambridge.
(Milling Road furniture is available locally at Beverly Hall
Furniture Galleries, Matthews and Flack's Interiors.) It's
obviously a step way above the basic metal job you can pick up at
an office supply story.
</P>
<P>
   How much people spend on their computer furniture seems to
depend on where they plan on putting it, designers and retailers
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're putting it in a space in their house where they
entertain _ like the living room _ then they spend more so they can
conceal it,'' says Poole. ``If it's going in their basement or
bedroom where generally people won't see it, then they spend just
several hundred dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who don't want to look at their PC when they're not
using it, a few furniture companies have designed serious
armoire-like pieces to conceal the computer when it's not in use.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look at it from three feet away you think it's just a nice
piece of furniture,'' says Mayo. ``But then doors come open and
drawers open and trays come out. It's ingenious.''
</P>
<P>
   As people spend more time at home on their computers, they want
their home office to resemble their work office in many respects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients want more than just a writing desk. They want a desk
like they would have in their office with all the file drawers,
keyboard trays and other details but with styling that is
appropriate to their home in quality and styling,'' says
Minneapolis interior designer Sue Walling. ``They want their home
office to function just like their office outside the home would.''
</P>
<P>
   For people with beaucoup bucks to spend, designers like Walling
often design a set-up to meet their clients' needs. Some people,
for example, want televisions and stereo equipment built into their
office cabinetry.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, people now want their home offices to be
convenient, comfortable and practical too. Says Walling, ``It is
passe to think a home office only needs to look good.''

 &HT;    As download beat goes on, recording industry fights back
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The online music revolution will not be televised.
</P>
<P>
   It's being played out right now on the Web and in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   As you read this, thousands, possibly millions, of college
students and other music lovers are downloading recorded music from
the Beatles to the Backstreet Boys from digital download sites such
as MP3.com, or using file-sharing software called Napster
(www.napster.com).
</P>
<P>
   Like Amazon.com, which scored its early success because it was
able to offer a variety of books that no brick-and-mortar store
could stock, the sheer volume of recorded music available on the
Internet is staggering. Digital download fans can pick and choose
and make their own personal music collections.
</P>
<P>
   And every last track, from every last artist, is free _ for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   One student recently told MTV she never buys music anymore, that
she and her roommate just download the songs they want from the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really knows what to do about this. Artists don't want to
alienate their fans, but they do want to make money.
</P>
<P>
   But while music junkies are loading up on their favorite tunes
from MP3.com or Napster, they are bypassing traditional methods of
buying music. They are clogging university networks uploading and
downloading songs. And even though bands like U2 seem to be in the
music business just to fight for human rights and world peace, at
the end of the day, they still want a paycheck. With the digital
download situation as it now stands, that could be endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the parties involved, the Recording Industry Association
of America is the most upset, the most vocal and the most
litigious. The RIAA filed lawsuits against both Napster and MP3.com
for copyright infringement. On April 28, it won a key victory when
a federal judge said MP3.com had violated industry copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is potentially disastrous for MP3.com. The RIAA is
asking for damages that could exceed $6 billion. The New York Post
reported last week that the RIAA is willing to settle with MP3.com
for a cool $100 million. Some reports indicate MP3.com isn't
willing to settle.
</P>
<P>
   But while MP3.com and Napster slug it out in court, users are
still downloading music in higher numbers every day. Lars Ulrich,
drummer for the heavy metal band Metallica, personally delivered a
list of 335,435 Napster users Metallica claims have illegally
obtained the band's music online.
</P>
<P>
   Artists and record companies call this pirating. Users call it
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rosenbloum, an entertainment attorney and vice president
of business affairs for the Web site ArtistDirect (www.
artistdirect.com), says downloading even one song to play while
you're surfing the Web is a violation of fair-use laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four factors of fair use,'' Rosenbloum says. ``The
purpose of the work, the nature of the use, the amount of the work
that was taken and whether the use undermines the market for the
original. Whether (digital downloads) undermine the market for the
original is characterized as the most important factor in these
decisions, and its easy to understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at Napster,'' he continues. ``The ultimate goal of that
company is business. One day, there will be an advertising model.
Even though they don't post the files (Napster allows users to
share their digital files with other users who are logged on at the
same time), the creative works that are available would be worthy
of the highest degree of protection under copyright law. Most
people looking at this would say it very clearly undermines the
market potential for the original.''
</P>
<P>
   For the average, normally law-abiding computer user busy
downloading music, it's time to install that cable modem or
high-speed phone line and get moving if you want to get some free
tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbloum says the major recording labels are working out their
own plans to enter the fray. And once they get online, digital
music is going to cost you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what you are going to start seeing over the next six
months is an increasing willingness on the part of the major labels
to compete with what's going on out there,'' Rosenbloum says. ``You
will see continued use of legislation and a combined effort by all
of the major labels to come up with a combined business model to
combat the illegal uses we are seeing now. ``
</P>
<P>
   Even though the RIAA is determined to take its case through the
legal system, Rosenbloum says he's not sure legislation is the
right way to attack this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an outspoken critic of legislation,'' he says. ``Often the
best solution to a conflict is by discussion, negotiation and
mediation. But sometimes legislation is your only option if one
side or the other won't compromise _ especially in this very
complicated area.''

 &HT;    Computer users on high alert
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computer systems around the world were attacked last
week by computer viruses, known as ``worms.'' The viruses, which
attacked Thursday and Friday, spread via e-mail and instant
messages in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   When a computer user opened an infected e-mail and clicked on an
attachment, the virus was unleashed on the user's address books.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was programmed to mail itself to everyone in the
books. The virus also was programmed to attack photo and video
files in the user's computer.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that tens of millions of computers worldwide
were affected by the original bug that arrived Thursday with the
message ``ILoveYou.'' About five copycat viruses appeared on
Friday. Their subject lines claimed to be jokes or about a Mother's
Day gift.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users were told not to open the messages and to delete
them. Police, who believe the ``ILoveYou'' virus started in the
Philippines, were tracking a suspect.

   TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE RAIN CAUSE PROBLEMS IN ETHIOPIA
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal rains finally have come to the African nation of
Ethiopia. But the rains may do more harm than good for the starving
people of this poor country.
</P>
<P>
   For the past three years, Ethiopia has been gripped by a
terrible drought. Little rain has fallen to nourish crops or
livestock. Thousands of animals and hundreds of people have died.
</P>
<P>
   Now rain is preventing aid agencies from sending in food to help
the starving people. Planes cannot land on the muddy runways and
trucks cannot travel on some muddy roads.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the Ethiopian government asked for 836,800 tons of
emergency food to assist an estimated 7.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA'S SMOG RATE RISING
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is becoming more like Los Angeles _ and not just because
you're seeing more stars in town.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you might see fewer stars _ in the sky _ as Atlanta's
air becomes filled with more and more smog.
</P>
<P>
   A report by a Georgia Tech researcher shows that smog keeps
increasing in Atlanta and decreasing in Los Angeles. For years, Los
Angeles has had the nation's most polluted air. In Los Angeles, new
rules in the past several years have helped that city improve its
air quality.
</P>
<P>
   Smog is made up of pollutant gases, such as ozone, as well as
tiny particles of soot, dust and metals. Those materials mainly
come from car exhaust, coal-fired power plants and refineries.

 &HT;    How to remove Explorer 5.5
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I downloaded Explorer 5.5 and tried it. I no longer wish to use
it. Besides reformatting the hard drive, how do I get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   _Jim Huntley, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Others are asking, too. Instead of listing the steps for
uninstalling Explorer 5.5 on a PC, we'll steer you to www.help.com.
Click the Internet Explorer link. You'll find a link to uninstall
using the Add/Remove program from your Control Panel. Microsoft's
Web site (www.microsoft.com) also tells how to use Add/Remove to
delete Explorer. Type Explorer 5.5 in the search bar. At the bottom
of the next page, click on ``Next 10 Results (11-20)  &QR;  &QR; '' link. See
``How to Uninstall Internet Explorer 5.5.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Installing an application can put files everywhere,
making the bits and pieces hard to find. Control panels,
extensions, preferences, etc., may have names you wouldn't
associate with the app.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Look for utilities to help uninstall unwanted apps or to
keep a hard drive lean and mean. For the PC, check out Uninstaller
from CyberMedia or CleanSweep Deluxe. And for our Mac loyalists,
Tri-Cleaner 2.02 or SpringCleaning from Aladdin Systems. There are
more. Do your homework.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I'm on Windows 95 and use Internet Explorer. I set Explorer to

   Sue: Browsers have preference settings to let you pick between
always accepting cookies, getting a prompt before accepting
cookies, or blocking them. (Newer browsers have more cookie control
options.) Perhaps your browser is set to prompt you, and that's why
it asks permission. Be aware, some sites won't let you visit if you
disable cookies.

<P>
   Jacki: What are cookies exactly? What they are NOT is edible. No
chocolate chips or sugary sprinkles. Cookies are saved to a text
file on your hard drive and contain information a Web site gathers
from you. They help the Web site recognize you the next time you
drop by. Cookies can save you from retyping a user ID or password,
and they remember on-line purchases. They also track surfing habits
and are used for marketing research.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Making Web life easier is one thing, but some think cookies
muck with your privacy. There are steps you can take if you have
privacy concerns or want to trash cookie clutter. You can delete
your cookie file. It's called cookies.txt on Windows and
MagicCookie on a Mac. Of course, your browser creates a new, empty
one each time.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Freeware and shareware are available to manage and filter
cookies, too. We came across Internet JunkBuster Proxy, Cookie
Crusher and Cookie Pal for the PC, and Cookie Monster, Cookie
Cutter and WebFree for the Mac.

 &HT;    If impact printer makes you happy, just keep using it
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mail from the Windows refuseniks continues rolling in,
both the sweet and the surly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attitude is typical for the crowd with more money than
sense,'' announces a fellow defending impact printers. He may be
right, but I have so little of either it's hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Panasonic dot-matrix (printer) works with Windows in about
70 percent of the things I need to do, even on graphics without
color. It's faster under DOS than Windows 98, even, and still
faster than Windows driving a HP Deskjet. Please give me a GOOD
reason for discarding it in favor of a slower, more expensive
printer for all my printing.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, there's that other 30 percent that goes unmentioned in
your diatribe. Further, I never suggested you discard anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you have a tech department to keep upgrading your
equipment and to sort out difficulties, so it costs you personally
little to play the `keep up with Joneses' game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not hardly, and I've never been able to keep up with the
Joneses. The Hatfields or the McCoys, perhaps, but not the Joneses.
And insofar as expense goes, I believe we paid about $550 for our
last dot-matrix printer. You can get an inkjet printer that does a
vastly superior job now for $150 or so.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, inkjets are a lot more expensive to run, and if you
need to do a lot of printing, then a laser is the way to go. But if
you've got an impact printer that does what you need to do, then
far be it from me to suggest you trash it.
</P>
<P>
   Another, gentler fellow reports that ``My wife and adult kids
keep after me to get a new setup rather than just upgrade my old
box and to get the latest Microsoft programs. I don't need 'em.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first computer was an Osborne which included SuperCalc,
WordStar and that big database. I now use Q&AMP;A and just keep
upgrading the spreadsheet and the word processor.''
</P>
<P>
   You mean Q&AMP;A is still around? A fine program it was (or is),
too. My first computer was a Morrow, which of course ran the same
miserable operating system as your Osborne _ CP/M. I've never felt
the same about spreadsheets since I found I couldn't get more than
about a dozen rows of eight cells each into its 64K memory.
</P>
<P>
   And you remember that wonderful Wordstar Catch-22? You'd be
typing along on the Great American Novel, tell it to save your
work, and if you had been careless about watching your floppy disk
space (no hard drives then) it would report there wasn't enough
room to save your work.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Put in a new disk, save to that. Oh, WordStar wouldn't let
you do that. You had to use the disk you'd been working with. You,
my friend, were out of space and out of luck, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Microsoft because Windows will not allow me to put my
DOS menu program as the first screen when starting,'' this
gentleman continues.
</P>
<P>
   Now, really. That's like hating ``Frankenstein Meets the
Wolfman'' because Bela Lugosi wasn't in it, or loathing Dvorak's
9th Symphony because it doesn't sound like Beethoven's Sixth. Of
course it doesn't allow you to put your DOS menu in place of the
desktop. It's supposed to replace your DOS menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will use my old DOS WordStar to write most of the copy for
my Rotary Club's 144-page catalog for our upcoming Artists of
America Gala Sale and Exhibition,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   You, sir, are hopeless. But I admire you, just as I have a
sneaking admiration for those hardy souls who not only still smoke,
but roll their own.
</P>
<P>
   From Denver comes a note from a fellow puzzled by the recent
report from a PFS Professional File user who said his current date
function now always produces something in the year 1900. His PFS,
he said, prefers the year '27, in an unspecified century.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Finally comes a kind gentleman offering relief to the fellow who
is using a Leading Edge word processing program and was trying to
find an old version of Word for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Vandiver says he can probably help you. Get in touch with
him at 76350.1227(at)compuserve.com.

 &HT;    Net is revolutionary, but doesn't change life's basics
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You'd think, from reading the newspaper and listening
to the TV, that the Internet has changed everything. There are new
rules for marketers. The way we communicate with friends and
co-workers is changing. In short, the Internet has been a
combination of the hydrogen bomb, the Salk vaccine for polio and
Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   The temptation with any important new technology is to stop
seeing shades of gray and to assume _ because it is new _ that
everything we knew up until then is wrong. So, depending on what
you do for a living, you may think that newspapers as we know them
will vanish, retail stores will become little more than kiosks
where you'll order things from the Internet, doctors will make
house calls by telecommunicating to your computer, and life will
become so virtual that it will be hard to tell if it's Uncle Fred
or Memorex.
</P>
<P>
   Look, the Internet is a big deal. It has changed things, but
it's shortsighted, naive and human to think it has somehow
short-circuited common sense. In fact, there's strong evidence for
the argument that _ now that the hysteria is dying some _ the old
rules haven't been suspended at all.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with e-commerce. Two years ago, you were being told
that starting any kind of a dot-com was like having a license to
print money. And the stock market and venture capitalists bore that
out. Twentysomethings started dot-coms right and left, became
millionaires, and their stunning successes indicated that commerce
was forever changed. Nowadays, you are seeing some of these
companies fall out of favor as Rule One of the marketplace begins
to reassert itself: Sooner or later you have to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the e-commerce boom, there were serious and dark
worries that the Internet would somehow destroy society _ with
mankind crawling back into caves, this time into electronic ones.
Instead of going out to eat, we'd munch cold pizza by the computer
monitor; instead of holding conversations with each other, we'd
have computer chats; and reality itself would blur as the
difference between a real person and a virtual human narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   But the last time I went to a restaurant, I had to wait for a
table. The last time I was at a movie, I saw real people holding
hands. The Internet has become _ as it should have _ just another
way to talk, another way to set a date for the movies. Sure, there
are people who live online, but before the Internet there were
people who lived on the phone. There have always been people who
overdo things, people who don't have healthy lives. It's possible
to get lost in a virtual world, but most of us are still doing fine
living our lives out where the sun shines.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. The Internet is a big deal, is changing
business and society, but _ as during the time of the advent of the
telephone network _ those changes are mostly taking place within
the framework of the world that already existed.
</P>
<P>
   Stop for a moment and tell me one brand new thing the Internet
has delivered. Maybe you download your music from the Internet now
instead of buying a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you order the Fruit-of-the-Month Club from the Web page
instead of the catalog ... but the sounds are just as enticing, the
fruit just as sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Life goes on. You can tell me how the Internet has speeded up
things; you can explain how it has offered new avenues for
commerce, new ways to talk to each other, or how it has made the
world smaller and easier to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you have a brand-new notion that I haven't heard, I
don't expect to hear of any fundamental shift in life as we know
it.
</P>
<P>
   So if you've been worrying that you'd have to reinvent your
business or yourself, stop worrying. Life is still good.

 &HT;    Game over? That's unlikely, even after `Millionaire' cools
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Red hot has to cool down eventually. Even the
sun could burn out in a billion years or so.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' is sure to cool down a lot
quicker, right? In fact, the hotter the show, the faster it cools.
Maybe. That seems logical, but logic doesn't always apply when it
comes to quirky pop culture explosions. Who knew wrestling would
bounce around the ring so long and the Ninja Turtles would go down
for the count in such short order?
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' has been setting ratings records since it
debuted as a summer experiment last year. Its popularity caught
everybody by surprise, including fashionable host Regis Philbin and
a gaggle of network executives. Now on ABC's schedule three times a
week, ``Millionaire'' is soaring. Last Monday's celebrity edition
raked in almost 40 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Can it stay sky-high, soar even higher, or has it peaked?
</P>
<P>
   ``The week by week ratings may be up or down, but it's still
routinely No. 1, 2 and 3,'' says Anne Elliot, vice president of
marketing and communications for Nielsen Media Research. ``It
rarely budges unless there's a really special episode of something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' has bumped it from the top, but that's been about the
only threat since January, when ``Millionaire'' graduated from
occasional special to full-time series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I have a hunch this red-hot hit won't sustain itself much
longer. I think people will get tired of watching ordinary folks
fret over questions that wouldn't win them a penny of Ben Stein's
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' isn't the first series to start at the top.
``ER'' debuted at No. 1, and six seasons later it's still the
highest-rated drama. So why am I suspicious of the game show's
potential? Well, a drama with a large ensemble cast and multiple
storylines is easier to sustain than a gimmicky contest. ``Mork &AMP;
Mindy,'' on the strength of the hysterically gimmicky Robin
Williams, also debuted at No. 1 and was a huge hit its first
season. But it started to fade the next year. That seems a more
likely trajectory for ``Millionaire,'' though it may not disappear
as quickly as it fades. It could linger for several seasons with
considerably cooler ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me (``Millionaire'') is an indicator of the new TV
environment, where all sorts of trial-and-error balloons are
floated,'' says Horace Newcomb, a University of Texas professor and
a leading authority on prime-time entertainment. ``It leapt up in
part ... because it was something that was new again. I think it
will cool off, but I also think it will stay on. Ten years ago a
show would have been canceled when it cooled, but now I think
there's a place for a show like this to cool off.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the increased choices and resulting fragmented
audience have created an environment in which shows don't have to
attract 40 million viewers a week to survive. They can easily get
by with half that.
</P>
<P>
   The cooling process for ``Millionaire'' could start this summer,
when CBS brings on ``Survivor,'' a game show that purports to be a
life-and-death contest with 16 participants living off the land
(and reportedly eating rats and worms) on a Malaysian island. If
nothing else, ``Survivor'' will steal a bit of the buzz from
``Millionaire.'' Fox's cheesy ``Greed'' and NBC's classier but dull
``21'' haven't made a dent in ``Millionaire,'' but they didn't
generate the hype ``Survivor'' is getting.
</P>
<P>
   Whether ``Millionaire'' plummets by September or not, ABC, now
the highest-rated network, is thrilled with the show. Millions of
``Millionaire'' viewers have boosted ``The Practice'' from midway
down the Nielsen chart to No. 9 for the season, and the
weak-performing ``20/20 Downtown'' rose to last week's Top 10. Good
work, Reege.
</P>
<P>
   But by running a potentially fast-burning hit Sunday, Tuesday
and Thursday nights, the network may well have mortgaged its
future. ABC, which will unveil its fall lineup in a couple of
weeks, is considering only five sitcom pilots compared with 15 last
year. The network's eggs are lumped in one Regis-held basket.
</P>
<P>
   If I were the programming tsarina (and, as you know, that's my
true calling), I'd keep ``Millionaire'' as an ``event series'' to
run during sweeps, thus tempering the danger of quick burnout. I'd
look for new, innovative entertainment series to diversify. But
even though I'd keep ``Millionaire'' in a limited capacity, I
wouldn't watch it. I'd stick with the far more challenging ``Win
Ben Stein's Money.'' Less money but lots more fun.

 &HT;    Me2Cam forces children out of their seats to play games
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you're concerned with the amount of time your
child spends hunched over a mouse or joystick playing computer
games, you might want to take a look at the Me2Cam Virtual Game
System from Intel Play.
</P>
<P>
   To play games with the system, the child stands in front of the
Me2Cam, a small video camera mounted on top of the computer
monitor, and moves his or her body to control the action on the
screen. The Me2Cam picks up the image of the child and inserts the
moving picture into the animated game action.
</P>
<P>
   A snowboarding game, for instance, requires the child to shift
quickly from side to side to guide a snowboard downhill while
steering around some obstacles and jumping over others. A dancing
game encourages vigorous motion by playing the music faster and
faster as the player dances faster.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with the Me2Cam probably won't give a child as much
activity as playing outdoors, but it's a lot more physical than
most computer games.
</P>
<P>
   The Me2Cam game system features Universal Serial Bus (USB)
connectors, so if your computer is an older model that doesn't have
USB ports, you won't be able to use the system without
modifications.
</P>
<P>
   Set-up is easy. After the programming CD-ROM is inserted,
on-screen instructions lead you through the steps to optimize the
game's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Once the game is turned on and a player is selected, the system
is controlled entirely by body movements. A voice prompt tells the
player how to move to activate various modes of play; no reading is
required.
</P>
<P>
   The Me2Cam Virtual Game System is rated for children 4 years old
or older. The games are simple and easy to learn, but they may not
hold the interest of teens or young adults.
</P>
<P>
   Currently only one CD-ROM containing five games is available,
but Intel Play likely will offer more games in the future if the
system catches on. The video camera that comes with the system is
similar to cameras used for sending video snapshots online, but the
programming CD only includes software for using the camera with the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The system sells online at www.shopmattel.com for $69.95 and is
available at software and office supply merchandisers for about the
same price.

   VEGETARIANS (San Francisco) _ Dressed in an oversized banana
suit, Rob Schaff spent Sunday afternoon playing tunes with titles
like ``I Got the Blues 'Cuz I Ain't Got No Greens,'' and ``I Left
My Lettuce Hearts in San Francisco.'' He blared out the moody
melodies as hundreds swarmed around tables sampling meat-free
morsels at VegFest 2000, a celebration organized in part by the San
Francisco Vegetarian Society to promote plant-based diets. And to
revel in plenty of puns. By ANATASIA HENDRIX.

   AUTO-SUBARU (Undated) _ Is it a car, or is it a sport-utility

considered buying one of those big trucklike things. By G. CHAMBERS

   AUTO-TIRES (Undated) _ Tires are prone to going flat; all it
takes is a nail, screw or piece of debris to puncture the rubber

   AMERICA'S BLEAK FUTURE MINUS MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS. The supply of
willing Mexican imigris to the United States will shrink in coming
years. Within a decade, the number of Mexicans illegally entering
the United States will diminish to the point of endangering the
production of our food supply. How? Because illegal aliens
constitute the majority of workers who pick the crops. Columnist
Raoul Lowery Contreras writes that a surge in the Mexican economy,
combined with plunging birthrates and a slower population growth
are the cause. He argues for the creation of a viable guest-worker
program that will legalize people who are willing to come North for
better jobs and higher wages. (slugged:

   SPINELESS HYPOCRITES ARE NOW SECURE WITH ALI. In this excerpt
from Emerge magazine, Terence Moore, a sports columnist at The

toward Muhammad Ali. Moore recalls the unfair treatment Ali
received when he changed his name from Cassius Clay to his current
Islamic name, and the indignities Ali suffered when he refused to
be drafted on religious grounds. The columnist asks us to look at
the hypercritical divide between how we treat Ali now, and the way
we treated him then. (slugged:

election, Jose Rivera, chairman of the Republican National Hispanic
Assembly, predicts that the ranks of registered Republicans in the

describes how the book spurred her to search for those ``ghosts who
penned the poetry.'' In doing so, she realized that what she was
really searching for was a better understanding of herself.

 By TERENCE MOORE  
 &HT;    Of all the retrospectives in the weeks surrounding the turn of
the century, there is one that everybody missed: The Hypocrites of
the Century. Such a distinction goes to millions who suddenly are
wrapping their arms around Muhammad Ali to give him a sloppy hug
instead of a deadly choke.
 &HT;    Tributes to Ali are everywhere, and show no sign of ceasing in
the new millennium. The life story of the former heavyweight
champion was the subject of an ABC made-for-TV movie. A second Ali
movie is expected to air on FOX later this year. While many
publications declared Ali the greatest athlete of the past 100
years, ESPN ranked the former heavyweight champion in third place.
 &HT;    There also is the epidemic of glee that Ali creates whenever he
enters a room. Three times in the past two years, I've seen Ali
generate overflow crowds during his appearances. Some mugged with
Ali for snapshots. Others giggled while he kissed them or their
babies. All of these Ali worshippers were different sizes, colors
and religions. They continued a trend that began after Ali rose
from the Atlanta darkness to fight the Olympic flame in 1996. To
the masses, ``The Greatest'' officially became ``The Greatest Back
Then,'' and thus started an explosion of hypocrisy.
 &HT;    Not long ago, Ali was considered worse than the stuff that
fighters spit into containers between rounds, by many of the same
people who said they tingled after his last Olympic moment.
 &HT;    No, it was worse than that. When the former Cassius Clay became
a regular before cameras and microphones in the early '60s, his
critics began to set a foundation for more than two decades of
hatred for the guy. They didn't like his tongue. He couldn't keep
it from flapping, and they fumed even more when his words were a
combination of brash and prophecy. He predicted that he would shock
the world by whipping the invincible Sonny Liston for the
heavyweight title in 1964 _ and he did.
 &HT;    Shortly thereafter, despising Cassius Clay became a national
obsession when he said he wished to change his ``slave'' name to
Muhammad Ali, after his conversion to Islam. During the three years
that he successfully defended his title nine times after his name
change, The New York Times was among those refusing to call Ali
anything but Clay. Although Sugar Ray Robinson was Ali's boxing
idol, the relationship between the two became strained when
Robinson couldn't bring himself to call him Ali.
 &HT;    Therefore, it wasn't surprising that Ali heard howling from much
of the world after he strained his hernia before his scheduled
rematch with Liston in the winter of 1964. The fight was canceled,
but the howling around Ali continued. In fact, the howling
increased when Ali slammed a short right against Liston's temple
the following spring to end the fight in the first round. It was a
punch so quick and potent that it was nearly invisible to onlookers
as Liston slammed backward against the canvas.
 &HT;    A Rocky Marciano or a Joe Louis would have received praise in
the aftermath. Ali just received grief. That's because Ali was
accused of delivering a punch that never touched his suddenly
lambasted opponent, who was accused of throwing this fight, as well
as his first one against Ali, to get more money with a rematch. The
idea in the minds of his critics was to say nearly anything to
diminish Ali ... or Clay ... or simply ``that guy with the big
mouth.''
 &HT;    There also was the ugliness surrounding Ali's fight against
Ernie Terrell in February 1967. Since Terrell joined the others in
boycotting Ali's new name, Ali spent 15 rounds pounding his
opponent along the way to victory and snarling, ``What's my name?''
 &HT;    Then came the draft incident. In 1967, during the peak of the
Vietnam War, Ali refused to enter the U.S. Army for religious
reasons. A federal court followed the overall mood toward Ali by
delivering the stiffest possible sentence. He was fined $10,000 and
given a five-year prison term. He spent no time in prison after an
appeal, but the State Department revoked his passport. And boxing
commissions wouldn't sanction his fights. Ali was reinstated as a
boxer in 1970, and the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his conviction
in 1971.
 &HT;    He later had three classic wars with Joe Frazier. He also
survived a grueling match against George Foreman. Still, the prime
of Ali's career was snatched away by that federal court. By the
time Trevor Berbick embarrassed Ali into retirement in 1981, he was
finished in more ways than one. He had Parkinson's disease after
years of taking mighty lefts and rights from the Fraziers and the
Foremans.
 &HT;    Now, at 57, Ali rarely speaks in public. When he does, his words
are slurred. Only his hands shake more than his head. He's the
equivalent of a massive teddy bear. So many of those who absolutely
couldn't stand Ali in the past, can't get enough of him now. In
their minds, he can't hurt them anymore _ or they just feel guilty.

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS  
 &HT;    They keep coming to the United States _ the men and women from
rural Mexico _ to work in the flower fields, nurseries, avocado
groves and sundry jobs throughout the country. There are an
estimated 2.5 million Mexicans working in the country. Soon,
however, fewer and fewer of them will be coming here to live and
work.
 &HT;    Wishful thinking? No. The supply of willing Mexican emigres to
the United States will shrink in coming years. Within a decade, the
number of Mexicans illegally entering the United States will
diminish to the point of endangering the production of our food
supply.
 &HT;    The steady decline can be attributed to a surge in the Mexican
economy, plunging birthrates and a slower population growth. Mexico
now generates about a million jobs a year, double the amount
available a decade ago.
 &HT;    In 1993, before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
Mexico manufactured about 500,000 automobiles, with over 80 percent
geared for the domestic market. Last year, the number had grown to
1.5 million automobiles, with fewer than 500,000 for the Mexican
market and a million for export, mostly to the United States and
some to Brazil and other countries. It obviously takes more Mexican
autoworkers to build a million more cars than pre-NAFTA days.
 &HT;    The declining Mexico City birth rate is spreading to the rural
areas that have long supplied the young men who immigrated to The
North, El Norte. Statistics from 1996 show that the birth rate
among Mexican mothers was under three children, down from an
average of six births in 1994. This is the result of a 20-year-long
birth-control program hustled in every rural village by the Mexican
government.
 &HT;    Despite superficial opposition from the Catholic Church, the
government has persisted in promoting this program, and the country
will soon reap the double-edged rewards of a declining birth rate.
And Mexican women, who traditionally have not worked outside the
home, have entered the work force, which also contributes to the
drop in national fertility rates.
 &HT;    As Mexico's economy grows and modernizes, more and more jobs are
created. As the number of young people becomes smaller, an
unprecedented situation may come to pass: Mexico will have more
jobs than people. Consequently, wages will rise. Thus, the promise
of NAFTA is becoming real in Mexico. Mexicans will have all the
jobs they can fill in Mexico. They won't need to come here looking
for work. At least, that's the theory.
 &HT;    Mexican demographer Agustin Escobar says that for 15 years, the
number of working-age Mexicans entering the labor force has
remained steady. ``We needed emigration to help our people find
work,'' he says. ``But now we can see that the future is going to
be quite different from what we saw in the 1980s and 1990s.''
 &HT;    Escobar thinks that by 2010 the number of Mexican emigrants to
the United States will decrease to such an extent that it will pose
problems for the American economy _ specifically for California's
agricultural economy.
 &HT;    According to the U.S. Department of Labor, at least 52 percent
of farm workers in California may be illegal aliens. Farm owner
groups, however, think that the percentage might be as high as 80
percent. California depends on illegal-alien labor to pick almost
all crops in the most productive farmland in the country. If
illegals from Mexico aren't there to pick the crops, who will?
 &HT;    Jose Pescador Osuna, a deputy secretary in Mexico's Foreign
Ministry, says that in the next 15 years, Mexicans won't cross the
border just to get jobs. Rather, they will come here to get better
jobs, or to compete for higher wages. The NAFTA agreement contains
a provision to allow 60,000 North Americans per year to work in
Mexico and a similar number of Mexicans to come here every year to
work legally.
 &HT;    In the meantime, who will do the work in California, pack the
beef in Omaha, cut tobacco in Kentucky and pluck the chickens in
North Carolina?
 &HT;    Will we bring in Chinese, like we did to build the railroad? Or
will a new president construct a viable guest-worker program that
will legalize people who are willing to come North for better jobs
and higher wages?
 &HT;    Will a guest-worker program stop the hatred some Americans feel
against illegal aliens that permeates the so-called immigration
debate? No. But the work will get done, and everyone will benefit.

 &HT;    A few moths ago, I came across a book, originally published in
1980, titled ``Island: Poetry and History of Chinese Immigrants on
Angel Island.'' The book is filled with poetry written by hundreds
of Chinese immigrants, who carved their prose into the walls of
barracks at a detention center on Angel Island.
 &HT;    Angel Island is north of San Francisco and has been called the
Ellis Island of the West.
 &HT;    Several prominent politicians _ including New York's Diane
Feinstein and Hawaii's Daniel Akaka _ have worked hard to preserve
the island, and Congress is looking to allot money for the creation
of an immigration museum.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, Angel Island is rarely mentioned today. Few people
know what it is, where it is and what it once held. The island is
now a state park, and its beauty masks the hardship and shame of
its former purpose _ a place to detain nearly 200,000 Chinese
between the years of 1910 and 1940.
 &HT;    I searched for those nameless people who have passed through
this island, the ghosts who penned the poetry, and have realized
that, in part, I am searching for myself.
 &HT;    I have spent countless hours talking with Angel Island
survivors, whose shame has turned into anger. I chatted with a man
in his 80s, who spent three months there. He remembers having his
belongings locked in a warehouse, and seeing the dead bodies of men
who, in the depths of despair, hung themselves in the shower
stalls.
 &HT;    He recalls being grilled for nearly four hours by officers who
asked everything _ from the number of stairs in his house in China
to the number of windows in his cousin's house.
 &HT;    Since leaving the island, he went to Mississippi, where he spent
years working at a grocery store because he couldn't attend school.
In the 1930s, the Chinese were excluded from the white schools and
only the ``colored schools'' were open to the new immigrants.
 &HT;    ``That's unbelievable,'' I found myself repeating like a mantra.
 &HT;    The anger from the old man seems carved on his bones. He fought
in WWII, worked in a grocery, spent many years drawing for an ad
agency and is a law-abiding citizen. Yet he still feels the sting
of history.
 &HT;    I talked with other survivors, who said that even now they still
find it painful to talk about their experiences _ that it has
affected the way they see themselves, and that they do not want to
return to Angel Island to open old wounds.
 &HT;    The poetry of such people, who were locked in loneliness, shame
and uncertainty, still sits on the walls of the barracks, a searing
reminder of how far we have come and yet how far we have yet to go.
 &HT;    One of the poems reads: ``Bored and filled with a hundred
feelings, I am imprisoned in the building. Seeing the surroundings
stirs one who is sad. How can one stop the tears? I recall the ship
starting off for the land of America. Looking back, the moon has
repeated a cycle.''
 &HT;    Recently, I chatted with a 74-year-old woman named Li-king, an
outgoing, extremely optimistic woman, who talked for hours about
her experiences on the island. For much of her adult life she kept
it a secret, and then one day she decided to share her experiences
with her grandchildren, since they are part of their roots.
 &HT;    She spent four hours talking with a producer for ``The American
Tapestry,'' a documentary about the beauty of diversity in America.
 &HT;    ``I thought my story should be told because the younger
generation knows nothing about what the older generation had to go
through,'' she said.
 &HT;    As a first-generation Chinese-American, I will never truly
understand the pain experienced by those who passed through Angel
Island. However, I do think it is important to reopen this chapter
in the history of Asian people.
 &HT;    Only by looking back can we move forward.

 By TERENCE MOORE  
 &HT;    Of all the retrospectives in the weeks surrounding the turn of
the century, there is one that everybody missed: The Hypocrites of
the Century. Such a distinction goes to millions who suddenly are
wrapping their arms around Muhammad Ali to give him a sloppy hug
instead of a deadly choke.
 &HT;    Tributes to Ali are everywhere, and show no sign of ceasing in
the new millennium. The life story of the former heavyweight
champion was the subject of an ABC made-for-TV movie. A second Ali
movie is expected to air on FOX later this year. While many
publications declared Ali the greatest athlete of the past 100
years, ESPN ranked the former heavyweight champion in third place.
 &HT;    There also is the epidemic of glee that Ali creates whenever he
enters a room. Three times in the past two years, I've seen Ali
generate overflow crowds during his appearances. Some mugged with
Ali for snapshots. Others giggled while he kissed them or their
babies. All of these Ali worshippers were different sizes, colors
and religions. They continued a trend that began after Ali rose
from the Atlanta darkness to fight the Olympic flame in 1996. To
the masses, ``The Greatest'' officially became ``The Greatest Back
Then,'' and thus started an explosion of hypocrisy.
 &HT;    Not long ago, Ali was considered worse than the stuff that
fighters spit into containers between rounds, by many of the same
people who said they tingled after his last Olympic moment.
 &HT;    No, it was worse than that. When the former Cassius Clay became
a regular before cameras and microphones in the early '60s, his
critics began to set a foundation for more than two decades of
hatred for the guy. They didn't like his tongue. He couldn't keep
it from flapping, and they fumed even more when his words were a
combination of brash and prophecy. He predicted that he would shock
the world by whipping the invincible Sonny Liston for the
heavyweight title in 1964 _ and he did.
 &HT;    Shortly thereafter, despising Cassius Clay became a national
obsession when he said he wished to change his ``slave'' name to
Muhammad Ali, after his conversion to Islam. During the three years
that he successfully defended his title nine times after his name
change, The New York Times was among those refusing to call Ali
anything but Clay. Although Sugar Ray Robinson was Ali's boxing
idol, the relationship between the two became strained when
Robinson couldn't bring himself to call him Ali.
 &HT;    Therefore, it wasn't surprising that Ali heard howling from much
of the world after he strained his hernia before his scheduled
rematch with Liston in the winter of 1964. The fight was canceled,
but the howling around Ali continued. In fact, the howling
increased when Ali slammed a short right against Liston's temple
the following spring to end the fight in the first round. It was a
punch so quick and potent that it was nearly invisible to onlookers
as Liston slammed backward against the canvas.
 &HT;    A Rocky Marciano or a Joe Louis would have received praise in
the aftermath. Ali just received grief. That's because Ali was
accused of delivering a punch that never touched his suddenly
lambasted opponent, who was accused of throwing this fight, as well
as his first one against Ali, to get more money with a rematch. The
idea in the minds of his critics was to say nearly anything to
diminish Ali ... or Clay ... or simply ``that guy with the big
mouth.''
 &HT;    There also was the ugliness surrounding Ali's fight against
Ernie Terrell in February 1967. Since Terrell joined the others in
boycotting Ali's new name, Ali spent 15 rounds pounding his
opponent along the way to victory and snarling, ``What's my name?''
 &HT;    Then came the draft incident. In 1967, during the peak of the
Vietnam War, Ali refused to enter the U.S. Army for religious
reasons. A federal court followed the overall mood toward Ali by
delivering the stiffest possible sentence. He was fined $10,000 and
given a five-year prison term. He spent no time in prison after an
appeal, but the State Department revoked his passport. And boxing
commissions wouldn't sanction his fights. Ali was reinstated as a
boxer in 1970, and the U.S. Supreme Court overturned his conviction
in 1971.
 &HT;    He later had three classic wars with Joe Frazier. He also
survived a grueling match against George Foreman. Still, the prime
of Ali's career was snatched away by that federal court. By the
time Trevor Berbick embarrassed Ali into retirement in 1981, he was
finished in more ways than one. He had Parkinson's disease after
years of taking mighty lefts and rights from the Fraziers and the
Foremans.
 &HT;    Now, at 57, Ali rarely speaks in public. When he does, his words
are slurred. Only his hands shake more than his head. He's the
equivalent of a massive teddy bear. So many of those who absolutely
couldn't stand Ali in the past, can't get enough of him now. In
their minds, he can't hurt them anymore _ or they just feel guilty.

AMERICA'S BLEAK FUTURE MINUS MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS

 By RAOUL LOWERY CONTRERAS  
 &HT;    They keep coming to the United States _ the men and women from
rural Mexico _ to work in the flower fields, nurseries, avocado
groves and sundry jobs throughout the country. There are an
estimated 2.5 million Mexicans working in the country. Soon,
however, fewer and fewer of them will be coming here to live and
work.
 &HT;    Wishful thinking? No. The supply of willing Mexican emigres to
the United States will shrink in coming years. Within a decade, the
number of Mexicans illegally entering the United States will
diminish to the point of endangering the production of our food
supply.
 &HT;    The steady decline can be attributed to a surge in the Mexican
economy, plunging birthrates and a slower population growth. Mexico
now generates about a million jobs a year, double the amount
available a decade ago.
 &HT;    In 1993, before the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA),
Mexico manufactured about 500,000 automobiles, with over 80 percent
geared for the domestic market. Last year, the number had grown to
1.5 million automobiles, with fewer than 500,000 for the Mexican
market and a million for export, mostly to the United States and
some to Brazil and other countries. It obviously takes more Mexican
autoworkers to build a million more cars than pre-NAFTA days.
 &HT;    The declining Mexico City birth rate is spreading to the rural
areas that have long supplied the young men who immigrated to The
North, El Norte. Statistics from 1996 show that the birth rate
among Mexican mothers was under three children, down from an
average of six births in 1994. This is the result of a 20-year-long
birth-control program hustled in every rural village by the Mexican
government.
 &HT;    Despite superficial opposition from the Catholic Church, the
government has persisted in promoting this program, and the country
will soon reap the double-edged rewards of a declining birth rate.
And Mexican women, who traditionally have not worked outside the
home, have entered the work force, which also contributes to the
drop in national fertility rates.
 &HT;    As Mexico's economy grows and modernizes, more and more jobs are
created. As the number of young people becomes smaller, an
unprecedented situation may come to pass: Mexico will have more
jobs than people. Consequently, wages will rise. Thus, the promise
of NAFTA is becoming real in Mexico. Mexicans will have all the
jobs they can fill in Mexico. They won't need to come here looking
for work. At least, that's the theory.
 &HT;    Mexican demographer Agustin Escobar says that for 15 years, the
number of working-age Mexicans entering the labor force has
remained steady. ``We needed emigration to help our people find
work,'' he says. ``But now we can see that the future is going to
be quite different from what we saw in the 1980s and 1990s.''
 &HT;    Escobar thinks that by 2010 the number of Mexican emigrants to
the United States will decrease to such an extent that it will pose
problems for the American economy _ specifically for California's
agricultural economy.
 &HT;    According to the U.S. Department of Labor, at least 52 percent
of farm workers in California may be illegal aliens. Farm owner
groups, however, think that the percentage might be as high as 80
percent. California depends on illegal-alien labor to pick almost
all crops in the most productive farmland in the country. If
illegals from Mexico aren't there to pick the crops, who will?
 &HT;    Jose Pescador Osuna, a deputy secretary in Mexico's Foreign
Ministry, says that in the next 15 years, Mexicans won't cross the
border just to get jobs. Rather, they will come here to get better
jobs, or to compete for higher wages. The NAFTA agreement contains
a provision to allow 60,000 North Americans per year to work in
Mexico and a similar number of Mexicans to come here every year to
work legally.
 &HT;    In the meantime, who will do the work in California, pack the
beef in Omaha, cut tobacco in Kentucky and pluck the chickens in
North Carolina?
 &HT;    Will we bring in Chinese, like we did to build the railroad? Or
will a new president construct a viable guest-worker program that
will legalize people who are willing to come North for better jobs
and higher wages?
 &HT;    Will a guest-worker program stop the hatred some Americans feel
against illegal aliens that permeates the so-called immigration
debate? No. But the work will get done, and everyone will benefit.

 By AMY WU 
 &HT;    A few moths ago, I came across a book, originally published in
1980, titled ``Island: Poetry and History of Chinese Immigrants on
Angel Island.'' The book is filled with poetry written by hundreds
of Chinese immigrants, who carved their prose into the walls of
barracks at a detention center on Angel Island.
 &HT;    Angel Island is north of San Francisco and has been called the
Ellis Island of the West.
 &HT;    Several prominent politicians _ including New York's Diane
Feinstein and Hawaii's Daniel Akaka _ have worked hard to preserve
the island, and Congress is looking to allot money for the creation
of an immigration museum.

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    The term ``Hispanic Republican'' used to be an oxymoron. Not
anymore, according to Jose Rivera, chairman of the Republican
National Hispanic Assembly (RNHA).
 &HT;    With national polls suggesting that George W. Bush could win as
much as 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in the presidential
election, Rivera predicts that the ranks of registered Republicans
in the Latino community will grow dramatically in the coming years.
 &HT;    Rivera has reason to be upbeat. RNHA's membership has almost
tripled since 1997, increasing from 7,000 to more than 20,000. And
RNHA chapters have started popping up in some unlikely places, such
as Arkansas, Mississippi, Nebraska and the state of Washington.
 &HT;    The demographic trend among Hispanics, soon to be the nation's
largest minority group, also includes a fast-growing
entrepreneurial class with a penchant for limited government and
lower taxes.
 &HT;    Largely funded by the Republican National Committee, Rivera's
group, which was founded in the '70s, is part of a new outreach
effort by the GOP. The party says it's spending about $10 million
in a national ad campaign aimed at recruiting Hispanic voters.
 &HT;    GOP spokeswoman Leslie Sanchez calls the party's effort its
first-ever, comprehensive political marketing strategy``meant to
persuade Latinos that the GOP shares its views.''
 &HT;    ``We have had the right message for many years, we've just had
the wrong messengers,'' says Tomas Bilbao, RNHA's deputy director
and, at the age of 21, one of the party's newest messengers.
 &HT;    Bilbao is talking about former California Gov. Pete Wilson, who
helped pass Proposition 187. critics say Proposition 187, which
most California Latinos strongly opposed, inspired a wave of
anti-Latino sentiment in Congress and across the country.
 &HT;    But times have changed. The Republicans still control Congress,
but worried about losing the Latino vote the GOP has softened its
stance on issues such as welfare and immigration reform. And the
party's collective persona has also been reshaped. Bilbao points to
a new crop of Republican messengers, including Bush and his former
challenger, Sen. John McCain.
 &HT;    The challenge, Rivera says, is to get the word out to the
Hispanic community _ a job made easier since more Latino
Republicans are getting elected to public office. For instance,
Rep. Henry Bonilla is a rising Republican star in Congress and a
major player in Bush's presidential campaign.
 &HT;    In California, Gloria Matta Tuchman, who helped pass that
state's controversial bilingual education reform initiative, is
running for Congress in the fall against two-term incumbent
Democrat Loretta Sanchez. And Texas Railroad Commissioner Tony
Garza could end up in a cabinet post in a Bush administration.
 &HT;    One of RNHA's main goals in the coming months is to boost Latino
representation at the Republican National Convention, which will be
held in Philadelphia in July. The Democrats have already upped the
ante by appointing Lydia Camarillo as CEO of the Democratic
National Convention. Camarillo has pledged to recruit a staff of
employees and volunteers ``that looks like America.''
 &HT;    ``If the Republican Party intends to be the home of Latinos in
the new millennium, it is essential that we are given the
opportunity to represent our interests at the convention,'' Rivera
said recently. ``Not to do so would hurt the convention, the
presidential candidate and the party.''
 &HT;    To spread the word about its activities, RNHA publishes a weekly
electronic newsletter, which the group also posts on its Web site,
www.rnha.org. Not surprisingly, articles about Democratic missteps
are easy fodder for the e-letter.
 &HT;    But the e-letter also has a lighter side. In a recent issue, it
lampooned Gore in its list of predictions for the Academy Awards.
The award for Best Performance in a Foreign Film went to Gore ``for
his role as a deity at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple.''
 &HT;    But the serious business of recruiting Latinos to the GOP
promises to keep Rivera and company busy. Rivera admits it won't be
easy. The Clinton-Gore ticket captured the Latino vote in 1996,
with more than 70 percent of Latinos voting for Clinton. Likewise,
Gore made a strong showing among Latinos in California and New York
in the March 7 primary.
 &HT;    Still, Bush has a strong Latino following in his home state of
Texas and in Florida, where his brother Jeb Bush is governor. And a
national poll conducted earlier this year by the Tarrance Group
showed Bush leading Gore among Latino voters. Observers say the
candidates are likely to split the Latino vote in November, but no
one can predict by how much.
 &HT;    For his part, Bilbao says he is not surprised by the GOP's
growing support among Hispanics and predicts even better times
ahead.
 &HT;    ``We're the party of conservative values, education, limited
government and limited taxes. As a Hispanic, those are values that
are dear to me,'' he said. ``Our message has always been the
same.''

 By JAMES E. GARCIA  
 &HT;    The term ``Hispanic Republican'' used to be an oxymoron. Not
anymore, according to Jose Rivera, chairman of the Republican
National Hispanic Assembly (RNHA).
 &HT;    With national polls suggesting that George W. Bush could win as
much as 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in the presidential
election, Rivera predicts that the ranks of registered Republicans
in the Latino community will grow dramatically in the coming years.
 &HT;    Rivera has reason to be upbeat. RNHA's membership has almost
tripled since 1997, increasing from 7,000 to more than 20,000. And
RNHA chapters have started popping up in some unlikely places, such
as Arkansas, Mississippi, Nebraska and the state of Washington.
 &HT;    The demographic trend among Hispanics, soon to be the nation's
largest minority group, also includes a fast-growing
entrepreneurial class with a penchant for limited government and
lower taxes.
 &HT;    Largely funded by the Republican National Committee, Rivera's
group, which was founded in the '70s, is part of a new outreach
effort by the GOP. The party says it's spending about $10 million
in a national ad campaign aimed at recruiting Hispanic voters.
 &HT;    GOP spokeswoman Leslie Sanchez calls the party's effort its
first-ever, comprehensive political marketing strategy``meant to
persuade Latinos that the GOP shares its views.''
 &HT;    ``We have had the right message for many years, we've just had
the wrong messengers,'' says Tomas Bilbao, RNHA's deputy director
and, at the age of 21, one of the party's newest messengers.
 &HT;    Bilbao is talking about former California Gov. Pete Wilson, who
helped pass Proposition 187. critics say Proposition 187, which
most California Latinos strongly opposed, inspired a wave of
anti-Latino sentiment in Congress and across the country.
 &HT;    But times have changed. The Republicans still control Congress,
but worried about losing the Latino vote the GOP has softened its
stance on issues such as welfare and immigration reform. And the
party's collective persona has also been reshaped. Bilbao points to
a new crop of Republican messengers, including Bush and his former
challenger, Sen. John McCain.
 &HT;    The challenge, Rivera says, is to get the word out to the
Hispanic community _ a job made easier since more Latino
Republicans are getting elected to public office. For instance,
Rep. Henry Bonilla is a rising Republican star in Congress and a
major player in Bush's presidential campaign.
 &HT;    In California, Gloria Matta Tuchman, who helped pass that
state's controversial bilingual education reform initiative, is
running for Congress in the fall against two-term incumbent
Democrat Loretta Sanchez. And Texas Railroad Commissioner Tony
Garza could end up in a cabinet post in a Bush administration.
 &HT;    One of RNHA's main goals in the coming months is to boost Latino
representation at the Republican National Convention, which will be
held in Philadelphia in July. The Democrats have already upped the
ante by appointing Lydia Camarillo as CEO of the Democratic
National Convention. Camarillo has pledged to recruit a staff of
employees and volunteers ``that looks like America.''
 &HT;    ``If the Republican Party intends to be the home of Latinos in
the new millennium, it is essential that we are given the
opportunity to represent our interests at the convention,'' Rivera
said recently. ``Not to do so would hurt the convention, the
presidential candidate and the party.''
 &HT;    To spread the word about its activities, RNHA publishes a weekly
electronic newsletter, which the group also posts on its Web site,
www.rnha.org. Not surprisingly, articles about Democratic missteps
are easy fodder for the e-letter.
 &HT;    But the e-letter also has a lighter side. In a recent issue, it
lampooned Gore in its list of predictions for the Academy Awards.
The award for Best Performance in a Foreign Film went to Gore ``for
his role as a deity at the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple.''
 &HT;    But the serious business of recruiting Latinos to the GOP
promises to keep Rivera and company busy. Rivera admits it won't be
easy. The Clinton-Gore ticket captured the Latino vote in 1996,
with more than 70 percent of Latinos voting for Clinton. Likewise,
Gore made a strong showing among Latinos in California and New York
in the March 7 primary.
 &HT;    Still, Bush has a strong Latino following in his home state of
Texas and in Florida, where his brother Jeb Bush is governor. And a
national poll conducted earlier this year by the Tarrance Group
showed Bush leading Gore among Latino voters. Observers say the
candidates are likely to split the Latino vote in November, but no
one can predict by how much.
 &HT;    For his part, Bilbao says he is not surprised by the GOP's
growing support among Hispanics and predicts even better times
ahead.
 &HT;    ``We're the party of conservative values, education, limited
government and limited taxes. As a Hispanic, those are values that
are dear to me,'' he said. ``Our message has always been the
same.''

CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS TO FIGHT RACISM IN JUSTICE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>

 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<P>
   On May 4, the 50th anniversary of the Leadership Conference on
Civil Rights, the coalition issued a stark report outlining the
ever-growing racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice
system.
</P>
<P>
   The report shows that the color of a person's skin often
determines whether or not the person will be stopped by police;
whether an arrest will be made; how long the person's criminal
sentence will be; what kind of plea bargain, if any, will be
offered; whether or not the person will be jailed for a first
offense; and whether the person is given the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   More than 180 national organizations belong to LCCR, the
nation's oldest and largest civil rights coalition. The day before
the report was released, the coalition's board of directors voted
unanimously ``to work to reform criminal justice laws and practices
at the federal and state levels that compound racial disparity.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``Justice on Trial: Racial Disparities in the
American Criminal Justice System,'' is, unfortunately, entirely
consistent with the devastating report on racism in the nation's
juvenile justice system released last week by Building Blocks for
Youth, an affiliation of organizations that promote fairness in the
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   The LCCR report indicates that civil rights groups are now going
to turn their attention to criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, law professor at Georgetown University Law Center
and author of ``No Equal Justice: Race and Class in the American
Criminal Justice System,'' which is cited in the report, considers
it most significant that the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights
issued the report.
</P>
<P>
   Cole expanded on his statement in an interview last Friday:
``This is the pre-eminent coalition on civil rights organizations,
and I think that the area of racial equality in criminal justice
has, unfortunately, not been a priority at all for civil rights
organizations for far too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many civil rights organizations have avoided the issue. Now
you're seeing, with this report and with the American Civil
Liberties Union's focus on racial profiling in the last year or so,
increasing attention to the criminal justice system from civil
rights and civil liberties groups. That's critically important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've long felt that the inequities in the criminal justice
system are central to the difficulties that minorities face
throughout American society. All the advances we've made in more
traditional civil rights are vastly undercut by the disparities
that exist in the criminal justice system. So, I think it's
important that the civil rights community is beginning to make this
a civil rights issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Henderson, executive director of the Leadership Conference
on Civil Rights, said in releasing the report at a press
conference, ``Today, the civil rights movement turns its attention
to a new battle: reform of the nation's criminal justice system.
The new fight is necessary because the racial disparities in
criminal justice have become so pervasive that they threaten our
hard-fought victories of the last 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The unequal treatment of minorities in the criminal justice
system begins even before any arrests are made. It begins with the
investigation of suspected criminal activity. The report shows that
police disproportionately target minorities as criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling makes black motorists targets of the police.
According to the report, from 1995 to 1997, 70 percent of the
drivers stopped by the Maryland State Police on Interstate 95 were
black, yet less than 18 percent of all the drivers on the highway
were black.
</P>
<P>
   Similar percentages of stops by highway patrol officers were
found in other states, although there was no significant difference
in driving patterns of white and non-white motorists. Very few of
these stops resulted in tickets, and fewer still ended in criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling is based upon the assumption that a random stop
of a member of a racial or ethnic minority will more than likely
yield an arrest for criminal activity. There is no evidence to
support such an assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Racial drug-courier profiling used by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency at major airports to identify drug traffickers targets black
females.
</P>
<P>
   However, a recent report by the congressional General Accounting
Office indicates that white females are twice as likely to be found
carrying contraband as black females.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling is used by police in major urban centers like
New York and Los Angeles as an excuse for temporarily detaining,
questioning and patting down pedestrians. Once again, blacks and
Hispanics are the main targets of stop and frisks.
</P>
<P>
   The report points out the two socially destructive yet baseless
assumptions underlying racial profiling: 1) Most criminals are
members of minority races and 2) most minorities are criminals. No
assumptions could be more destructive to the social fabric of a
diverse nation such as ours. They breed racism, distrust and
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald H. Weich, a Washington, D.C. attorney who co-authored the
report with fellow attorney Carlos Angula, calls racial profiling a
self-fulfilling prophecy. ``We know from federal health surveys
that blacks and Hispanics are no more likely to be carrying drugs
than whites, no more likely to be using drugs than whites. But if
you act on the assumption that they are, and disproportionately
stop and frisk and search and detain minorities, then just as a
statistical matter, if they are carrying drugs in proportion to the
numbers in the population then you end up arresting more
minorities. This fuels the perception that minorities are
disproportionately committing crimes. It's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The disproportionate arrest of Hispanics and blacks has
decimated their communities with disastrous social consequences. It
has led to a deep distrust of law enforcement officials and, as a
result, to less cooperation with them.
</P>
<P>
   In drug cases, federal prosecutors decide whether to take the
case into federal court where mandatory minimum sentencing laws
require much more prison time for those convicted, in general, than
state courts do. For possessing approximately the same amount of
crack cocaine, one can get sentenced to 10 years in prison by a
federal court compared to less than a year by a state court. Not
surprisingly, federal prosecutors are more likely to demand that
blacks and Hispanics be tried in federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Weich says, ``the constant criminalization of race and
racialization of crime fuel the engine of injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The report compiles existing evidence, analyzes it, and
convincingly shows that racism has twisted and distorted the
nation's criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Any promise of civil rights and equality under the law dies when
a nation's criminal justice system acts upon racist assumptions
that target members of minority groups.

TRACEY ULLMAN TRIES A NEW IDENTITY: MOVIE STAR

 (Includes a color slide of Tracey Ullman with Hugh Grant in a scene
from ``Small Time Crooks.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Tracey Ullman's entourage takes up less room than those of most
Hollywood stars.
 &HT;    Actually, they're all her. A hairy New York cabbie opens the
door to her hotel room. A screaming Ricky Martin fan materializes
moments later. And scary Beverly Hills attorney Sydney Kross
practically drips sarcasm as he picks at the fruit plate.
 &HT;    Five minutes into a conversation with the 41-year-old British
comedian, and you've met a parade of people of every race, creed,
gender and sexual preference. But they have one thing in common:
They're all hilarious.
 &HT;    So much for Jerry Lewis' recent comment that women can't be
funny.
 &HT;    ``That comment would hurt if it came from anyone I thought was
funny,'' Ullman says, snapping into her real persona. ``Frankly, I
was burning up when I heard that comment. My first reaction was,
`Why did you say that, you old fool? What about Gilda Radner? What
about Lucille Ball? What about me?'''
 &HT;    Yes, what about her? Ullman burst onto the American comedy scene
13 years ago with her critically acclaimed television series, ``The
Tracey Ullman Show'' (1987-1990), and nowadays has a hit HBO comedy
series, ``Tracey Takes On.''
 &HT;    And now she's starring opposite Woody Allen in the
rags-to-riches story ``Small Time Crooks,'' opening May 19. Ullman
plays Allen's wife, who gets entangled in his scheme to tunnel into
a bank and rob the place.
 &HT;    For years, Ullman recalls, she longed to work with Allen.
 &HT;    ``I remember sitting in my hot tub in America when I was
pregnant and whining to my husband, `Should I stay in America? I
miss London,''' she says. ``But then what changed things for me is
that I watched `Broadway Danny Rose' (1984), and it was so terrific
that I thought I should stay in America just so I could work with
Woody Allen.''
 &HT;    Never one to sit and wait, Ullman immediately took pen in hand.
 &HT;    ``For years I wrote Woody silly letters,'' the comedian says.
``I said things like, `Dear Woody. You use Mia Farrow all the time.
Isn't it time for a change? Let Mia sit in my hot tub and I'll come
to New York and be in your movies.'
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought he would read these lunatic notes and say,
`You know, that's a good idea.'''
 &HT;    For his own part, Allen says in a separate interview, he was
simply confused.
 &HT;    ``She wrote me all these letters, and frankly I never heard of
her,'' Allen recalls. ``Eventually Tracey sent me a tape of her
performances. She was great _ I even went around telling my
friends, `You've got to see this woman. She's amazing.'''
 &HT;    When he was casting ``Bullets Over Broadway'' (1994), Allen gave
Ullman a small role.
 &HT;    ``The previous day I had been asked to do a Christmas special in
Montreal with the Olsen twins,'' she recalls. ``Bless them, they
are sweet little girls. But it wasn't my cup of tea.
 &HT;    ``Plus, I had to ask questions such as, `When are the Olsen
twins going to be nude in Playboy? It might not be good for me to
be associated with them.'''
 &HT;    Ullman landed a bigger part in Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love
You'' (1996), complete with a song-and-dance number. But when the
movie ran 20 minutes too long, the filmmaker was forced to cut out
her role entirely.
 &HT;    ``I had to explain to her that it had nothing to do with her
performance,'' Allen says. ``It was my bad writing.''
 &HT;    When he gave her a co-starring role in ``Small Time Crooks,''
Allen says, he was less worried about her performance than about
his own.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, I was intimidated,'' he admits. ``She's a comic
genius.''
 &HT;    That comic flair was cultivated during a rough childhood spent
in the posh area of Slough, near London, in the 1960s. Her father
died from a heart ailment when Tracey was 6, and Ullman used to try
to distract her mother from her worries by staging nightly shows in
her bedroom.
 &HT;    ``Those were sad years,'' Ullman says. ``I would try to do
anything to cheer up my mum. I would put on her negligees and strut
around the room _ nothing was off limits to make her smile.''
 &HT;    A natural mimic, Ullman won a scholarship to a professional
children's school in London, but she soon realized that
conventional show business was not for her.
 &HT;    ``I hated every minute of it,'' she says, grimacing. ``The other
girls were there because their mothers wanted to make them little,
annoying, blonde stars of toilet-paper commercials. I would sit in
the bathroom at school, smoke and make fun of all the other
girls.''
 &HT;    At 16 Ullman left school to become a dancer, then took a shot at
a singing career. Her first album, ``You Broke My Heart in 17
Places,'' went gold and produced four Top 10 singles in England.
 &HT;    But her heart wasn't in music, and she soon turned to the
theater and, in turn, television work for the BBC. That's where she
met her husband, British television producer Allan McKeown, a
former hairdresser who co-created her early BBC series and also
helms her current HBO show, ``Tracey Takes On,'' as well as helping
raise their two children, Mabel and John.
 &HT;    Defining her unique show-business niche hasn't been easy, Ullman
admits.
 &HT;    ``It is tougher for girls to be funny,'' she says. ``I'm lucky
because I find humor in situations. But I never wanted to be a
stand-up comic _ I could never be one of those girls who gets up in
front of a mike and talks about her Tampax ... I don't get why
female stand-ups feel they have to talk about sex and be bawdy and
brash.''
 &HT;    Women are also harder to make jokes about, she says, because
they're more likely to take offense.
 &HT;    ``Once I did this talk show with supermodel Christie Brinkley,
and I went up to her and said, `It's amazing _ I always heard you
were pretty,''' Ullman recalls. ``She almost burst into tears.
 &HT;    ``It was a joke,'' she says defensively.
 &HT;    ``You have to do selective bitchery,'' the comedian adds.
``There is some bitchery we don't want to say openly, because we
don't want to damage our careers.'''
 &HT;    At the same time, she's adamant in insisting that no topic is
too sensitive to joke about.
 &HT;    ``Everything is comic fodder,'' Ullman says. ``I take on some
serious issues, and I find the humor in them. The poignant/funny
pieces are the ones I like the most. Once I did this skit on gay
golfers kissing _ I thought it broke a bit of ground.''
 &HT;    Ullman is even willing to bite the hand that feeds her, taking
off on two of the top-rated shows on HBO, for which she will soon
begin taping new episodes of her series, ``Tracey Takes On.''
 &HT;    She lapses into a dead-on impression of ``Sex and the City's''
Sarah Jessica Parker.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' she burbles, ``let's talk orgasms!''
 &HT;    To riff on the grueling prison drama ``Oz,'' she assumes the
voice of a blase Noo Yawk television critic.
 &HT;    ``It's a great show,'' she says with a theatrical sigh, ``but
how many gang rapes can you see in two hours?''

AMY SMART: BAD GIRLS HAVE MORE FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Amy Smart in a scene from ``Road
Trip.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and MELANIE SEYMOUR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Amy Smart made a name for herself by playing good girls in
``Varsity Blues'' (1999) and ``Outside Providence'' (1999), but
nowadays she's doing even better being bad.
 &HT;    The 24-year-old blonde with an infectious smile and an easy
laugh can currently be seen on the hit television series
``Felicity'' as Noel's new love who gets pregnant by another guy.
She recently played a second-rate model caught up in drugs and cult
religion in the NBC miniseries ``The '70s,'' and her next
big-screen appearance _ in ``Road Trip,'' opening May 19 _ is as a
girl who likes to videotape her sex life.
 &HT;    Some may recall seeing her in a more risque role in ``Varsity
Blues,'' but they're wrong.
 &HT;    ``People still think I'm the one who had sex with a guy and lots
of whipped cream,'' she says. ``That girl was actually my friend
Ali Larter. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we're
both blonde.''
 &HT;    ``Road Trip'' gives Smart her first topless scene, opposite
hunky Breckin Meyer.
 &HT;    ``I'd never done nudity before, so I was a little nervous,'' she
admits. ``Then the director, Todd Phillips, told me that he would
never forget watching Phoebe Cates drop her top in `Fast Times At
Ridgemont High' (1982). He said it changed his life.''
 &HT;    She pauses and giggles.
 &HT;    ``I guess that made me feel better.''
 &HT;    Smart did check with her mother first, she adds.
 &HT;    ``She said, `If you think it's the right choice, then you should
do it,''' the actress recalls. ``I was just so glad she didn't
become overprotective.''
 &HT;    ``Road Trip'' is a teen comedy of errors which casts Meyer as
Josh, a college student who's cheating on his significant other
with Beth (Smart). The videotape of their amorous encounter is
accidentally mailed to his girlfriend at her Texas college, so Josh
and a few buddies hit the road to the Lone Star State, determined
to intercept the incriminating tape.
 &HT;    Co-starring as Meyer's bizarre roommate is the wildly
unpredictable MTV comic Tom Green.
 &HT;    ``We didn't know what to expect from Tom,'' Smart says. ``We
were all a little nervous that he might be trying to pull some gags
on us during a scene. But he was really very nice and low-key.
 &HT;    ``But after the camera stopped rolling,'' she adds with a grin,
``he'd get a little crazy.''
 &HT;    Most of the rest of the ``Road Trip'' cast are male, but Smart
says that wasn't a problem.
 &HT;    ``Fortunately, there weren't any big egos,'' she says. ``I felt
completely at home, because growing up I was sort of a tomboy. I
was the one skating with the boys. I even played Little League with
them. I was the only girl on the team, and they called me `Smarty
Pants.' So I've never had any trouble getting along with a bunch of
guys.''
 &HT;    She may be a budding movie star with two hits behind her, but
Smart says that so far it's television that has given her whatever
recognition she enjoys.
 &HT;    ``I get recognized a lot for `Felicity,''' she says. ``I guess
people sort of get hooked on their favorite series and watch them
religiously. When fans of `Felicity' see me, it's like they know
me.''
 &HT;    Her character on ``Felicity'' has forced Smart to deal with the
issue of teen-age pregnancy, which she says has been a real
eye-opener.
 &HT;    ``I met some single young women who kept their babies,'' the
actress says. ``I used to wonder how they could make that kind of
mistake and get pregnant. Now I'm much more forgiving, because I
realize the love they feel for that child. I have a lot more
compassion, which was a huge learning lesson in itself.''
 &HT;    So was playing a pregnant character.
 &HT;    ``I had to put on this pregnant suit,'' she says. ``Just looking
down at my big belly was wild and kind of exciting. I want to have
kids eventually, and so I'd go, `Wow, this is what I'd look
like.'''
 &HT;    Smart and her brother, Adam, had a thoroughly conventional
upbringing in Topanga Canyon, Calif.
 &HT;    ``I was actually very shy,'' she recalls. ``I was always
watching one of my friends, Vinessa Shaw, who started acting when
she was very young and, ironically, got the good-girl role in `The
'70s.' First I studied ballet, and when I danced on stage I loved
the attention. Then I finally took the leap and enrolled in an
acting class, and I was hooked.''
 &HT;    Her first career opportunity, however, came as a model.
 &HT;    ``Vinessa Shaw suggested me as a replacement in a photo shoot,''
she says, ``and I got the job. Suddenly I was getting assignments
to travel to places like Italy, France, Mexico and Tahiti. I wasn't
a cover girl, but I was able to pay for my first car and my first
apartment.
 &HT;    ``I never worried about getting pigeonholed as a model,'' she
adds, ``because I wasn't getting that much attention.''
 &HT;    Smart made her acting debut in a small part in an MTV ``Rock the
Vote'' promo, and went on to minor roles in ``Starship Troopers''
(1997) and ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide'' (1997). Then came
``Varsity Blues,'' and the wheels of celebrity began to turn.
 &HT;    ``I'm still close to my parents,'' she says, ``and they help
keep me grounded. But they get a kick out of what I'm doing. For
instance, NBC put a huge `'70s' billboard on a building in Burbank.
It was almost six stories high. My father called me up and said, `I
brought my camera to work. Let's have lunch and take a few
pictures.'
 &HT;    ``He was posing me in front of this billboard with a picture of
me on it,'' the actress recalls, laughing. ``It was so sweet.''
 &HT;    Another grounding influence in Smart's life is her boyfriend,
actor Branden Williams.
 &HT;    ``We've been together for a long time,'' she says. ``It's nice
to be with somebody who understands this business. If you don't, I
think you could become incredibly insecure in a relationship with
an actor.''
 &HT;    Actually, Smart adds, despite the cliche of the neurotic
actress, she considers herself perfectly secure.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes you just have to take charge,'' Smart says. ``I
remember that, when I was doing `Felicity,' it looked like it would
conflict with `The '70s.' I really wanted the chance to play this
wild party girl on the miniseries, but I also knew that getting
pregnant on `Felicity' was something I had to do.
 &HT;    ``Finally I called up J.J. Abrams, the `Felicity' producer, and
I told him I really wanted to do both and I needed him to help
me,'' she recalls. ``That little phone call kept me on the show. I
realized how important it was to speak up and not get caught in
having an agent or somebody else speak for you. I charged ahead,
and I got what I wanted.
 &HT;    ``The other thing I've learned,'' she adds, ``is how the best
people, especially some of the legends, are really just people. You
have this larger-than-life image of them, and then you realize that
they're not trying to be that way.
 &HT;    ``It actually brings up my own confidence,'' Smart says. ``You
realize they're just people, too. And if they can do it, maybe you
can, too.
 &HT;    ``So why not reach for the stars?''

 (Includes a color slide of Frankie Muniz in a scene from ``Malcolm
in the Middle.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before May 28. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This past year has been a blur for Frankie Muniz.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old actor has gone from virtual obscurity to stardom
as the title character of the season's biggest breakout comedy,
``Malcolm in the Middle.'' And Muniz is enjoying his rocket ride to
fame, with one small exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't skateboard any more,'' he says with a rueful regret
that would befit any teen-ager. ``Although I did get hurt a couple
times _ I used to do a lot of extreme stuff. I have to be a bit
more careful now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Broadcasting insists on it, in fact _ the network counts
Muniz as one of its most valuable assets. Since its January
premiere, ``Malcolm'' has become a Sunday-night habit for many
viewers who either identify with the dysfunctional family depicted
therein or at least love to laugh at their foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's family doesn't have a last name, they're not animated,
the parents aren't divorced and, most notably, the series has
managed to be anything but predictable. In short, it's ``The Wonder
Years'' filtered through ``Mad TV,'' and the public can't get
enough.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Muniz dispels the myths about child actors: instead
of being a petulant, snotty brat, he's charming, self-effacing and
friendly. Even more refreshing, in a business in which the Olsen
twins have acted like corporate traders since they could toddle,
Muniz actually acts his age.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he complaining about the added responsibilities that
accompany his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love acting, so whatever comes with it, I'll do,'' he says.
``It's really fun for me. I don't mind traveling all over, living
in a hotel, because I get to meet so many new people. It's just a
lot of fun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun is only beginning. In addition to his newfound fame as
Malcolm, Muniz got a big-screen boost with this spring's
family-themed feature ``My Dog Skip,'' in which he co-stars with
Kevin Bacon. And he's recently started shooting a new film,
``Deuces Are Wild,'' in Los Angeles, alongside Matt Dillon and
Deborah Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I'm doing a cartoon for Nickelodeon called `The Very
Odd Parents,''' Muniz adds, ``and I'm doing a charity event for
Baskin-Robbins.''
</P>
<P>
   Between all of this, Muniz must find time for school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm home-schooled now,'' he says, ``but when I was in regular
school I was always a little ahead in my stuff, and my teachers
would always have to give me extra work, because I would get done
with my math and everything really quickly. So when I was in first
grade, I was doing fourth-grade work.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake him for Malcolm, the television genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a genius,'' Muniz says patiently, ``but just a little
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He never had the trouble that Malcolm does with other children
taunting him about his brains _ though he admits that his
blossoming career has brought problems of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this kid who, it seems every time he sees me, someone
is always asking about the show or about acting and stuff,'' he
says, ``so he's always like, ``Is that all you talk about?''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's a little weird,'' Muniz says. ``But really, before
this show, I never told anyone about my acting. They would just see
it on TV and come up to me, `Were you on that? That's really cool.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But now everyone has seen the show, so they all come up to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the show took off, Muniz, his mother and his 15-year-old
sister have moved from New Jersey to Los Angeles, where the young
star keeps himself busy on his time off by exploring the area's
endless array of golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually play golf,'' he says. ``I've played since I was 5.
My grandpa taught me, and I can now beat him. I have a 13
handicap.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spends time with his ``Malcolm'' castmates, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do hang out together,'' he says. ``We're always in school
together, and then when you're done with school we play football
and just hang out, or play basketball on the set.''
</P>
<P>
   From all reports that set is one of the most laid-back in Los
Angeles, which is saying quite a lot. Bryan Cranston, who plays
Hal, the boys' oddball father, seconds the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real normal kids,'' he says in a separate interview.
``Which is great from my standpoint, because they're not so
callused and business-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 7-year-old daughter myself,'' he adds, ``and she is
crazy about the boys. Crazy about them.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not the only one. ``Malcolm'' has proven to be a ratings
powerhouse for the troubled Fox network, and there are already a
multitude of devoted fan sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz is elated about the show's success, but like many actors
before him is perplexed by his fans, who seem to think that Muniz
is Malcolm and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the confusion may be his own fault, he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to sound real weird, but I hadn't read the
script when I first auditioned, so I was just myself saying
Malcolm's words,'' he recalls. ``I just went in and did how I would
do it if it was me. So I guess I am who I play.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has grown into his character, Muniz has become more aware
of their differences than of their similarities, and he's no longer
sure that he'd even want to hang out with Malcolm himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be friends with him ... like half and half,'' the
young actor says thoughtfully. ``He is like me a little bit, but I
really wouldn't want to be with him because he is always angry.
He's always so mad at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad temper notwithstanding, it looks like Muniz is stuck with
Malcolm for the foreseeable future. The little guy is still
settling into his role as television's top kid, but the actor who
plays him is slowly getting used to those surreal moments that seem
to keep popping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so weird,'' he says, shaking his head. ``Last year I was
watching the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards, and this year I'm
co-hosting. It's just so weird and awesome.''
</P>

BACK TO BRADY: BARRY WILLIAMS REVISITS HIS YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly

 (Includes a color slide of Barry Williams on the set of ``Growing
Up Brady.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It was another Brady moment in a life bursting with Brady
moments.
 &HT;    There stood Barry Williams, who portrayed the ever-wholesome
Greg Brady in ``The Brady Bunch'' and its assorted spinoffs,
watching as actor Adam Brody played Williams playing Greg in a
scene for ``Growing Up Brady.''
 &HT;    Based on Williams' memoirs about his days as a Brady, ``Growing
Up Brady'' will air May 21 on NBC.
 &HT;    ``I think surreal might describe it,'' Williams says. ``There
was an element of deja vu. There were moments when it was plain old
uncomfortable. I felt exposed _ you had 100 people on a soundstage,
dissecting my life, my memories, my dialogue.
 &HT;    ``I'd be standing right there, thinking, `No, Barry wouldn't do
that. Wait a minute, let me tell you what to do,''' he says.
``There had to be a bit of compromise, because the actor playing me
had to interpret the dialogue for himself. I think believable is
better even than accurate.''
 &HT;    Williams, who served as the television movie's co-executive
producer and appears briefly as himself, explains that the story is
told in flashbacks and covers his five years making ``The Brady
Bunch,'' his relationship with co-star Maureen McCormick (Kaley
Cuoco) and the battles between Robert Reed (Daniel Hugh Kelly),
producer Sherwood Schwartz (Michael Tucker) and Paramount Pictures
over money and the quality of the scripts.
 &HT;    Most important, ``Growing Up Brady'' examines the impact of the
show on its six young cast members.
 &HT;    ``It gives you a real clear feeling for the environment of
growing up as pretty normal kids in pretty unusual circumstances,''
Williams says by telephone from his production offices in New York.
``You've got a bunch of kids dealing with all the hype, intensity,
challenges and rewards of being under the microscope as a result of
being on a show, making records, touring, making personal
appearances, being isolated from our friends and counting on one
another.
 &HT;    ``The telemovie, as opposed to my book, shows all of that,
rather than putting it only into words,'' he says. ``The telemovie
has a completely different arc than the book. It's got a beginning,
middle and an end, while the book goes chapter by chapter.''
 &HT;    Nobody, of course, ever foresaw that ``The Brady Bunch,'' which
ran from 1969 to 1974, would endure as it has. It was a sweet,
corny show that never quite went away. Much like ``Star Trek,''
``The Brady Bunch'' entered the realm of phenomenon only after its
cancellation, riding an unending afterlife of reruns.
 &HT;    Soon enough, there was a ``Brady Bunch'' variety hour, then
several reunion telemovies and two short-lived ``Brady'' series.
Then came two feature films, ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' (1995) and
``A Very Brady Sequel'' (1996). Even now, ``Brady'' fever runs so
high that Fox has whipped together its own Brady telemovie, ``The
Brady Bunch _ The Final Years,'' and scheduled it for May 16, a
week before ``Growing Up Brady.''
 &HT;    Exactly why ``The Brady Bunch'' emerged as an icon _ and why it
remains one _ is as much a mystery today as it was 10, 20 or 30
years ago.
 &HT;    ``There are probably 1,000 answers, and I'm certainly no
authority on it,'' says Williams, who is now 45 and a newlywed who
lives with his wife in Connecticut. ``I can tell you what people
tell me, and that is they appreciate the show for not being
preachy.
 &HT;    ``They like the little messages in each show,'' he says. ``They
like that the family communicates, that they get along, that the
parents get along with each other and the kids, and that the kids,
if they have an argument, talk and work things out.
 &HT;    ``There's also an identifiability factor,'' Williams adds,
``because there are boys and girls, and there's a youngest kid, a
middle kid and an oldest kid. Even now, adults can say, `Oh yeah, I
had braces' or `I remember when I got my first pair of glasses.'
 &HT;    ``It could also be the supergroovy fashion statements we made
every week,'' he says with a laugh.
 &HT;    ``All in all, everybody understands that there is no family like
the Bradys, but it is an ideal that just hasn't gone out of
fashion,'' he concludes. ``I'm thrilled that kids today appreciate
the show, and I've got 5- and 6-year-olds coming up to me and
asking for autographs, sometimes for themselves and sometimes for
their parents.
 &HT;    ``What's amusing to me,'' Williams adds, ``is that kids think
they've discovered this new show. And what I find poignant is that
parents tell me that watching `The Brady Bunch' is one of the few
activities they can do together and actually enjoy with their
kids.''
 &HT;    Prior to ``The Brady Bunch,'' Williams was a busy child actor in
Hollywood. He appeared as a boy dying of leukemia on ``Marcus
Welby, M.D.'' and as a young king in a ``Mission: Impossible''
episode. He played brainy boys and kids who talked back.
 &HT;    And then came Greg.
 &HT;    ``I've lived life with `The Brady Bunch' in it, and I'm happy
with my life,'' the actor says. ``But there is a true curiosity on
my part about what it would have been like not to have been
associated and identified with one project so strongly.
 &HT;    ``It would have been fine that I played Greg,'' he says, ``but
the show never left the air. It's been on for 30 years, and that's
a lot of reinforcement.
 &HT;    ``The whole typecasting phenomenon is interesting,'' he says
thoughtfully, ``and it's something I've come to learn a little bit
about. All actors who come on the scene get associated with the
role that made them famous. Sean Connery has a tremendous body of
work, but don't you think of Bond when you think of Sean Connery?
Michael Landon did `Little House' and `Highway to Heaven,' but to a
lot of people he was always Little Joe from `Bonanza.'
 &HT;    ``Look at what Sally Field had to overcome,'' Williams says.
``Sylvester Stallone is an interesting case. He came on the scene
as Rocky and he tried everything, comedies and even musicals, but
people just didn't get him in those other roles. You can't do
anything about typecasting, unless you do something bigger than
that which you became first known for.''
 &HT;    Williams has yet to land a part that will do for him what
``Norma Rae'' (1979) did for Field or ``First Blood'' (1982) did
for Stallone, but he isn't complaining. A couple of years ago he
starred in the national tour of ``City of Angels'' and, more
recently, he released ``The Return of Johnny Bravo,'' a CD of pop
songs which is available through his official Web site,
barrywilliams.com.
 &HT;    ``Here's the thing,'' he says. ``I'm proud of `The Brady Bunch.'
I embrace it. I feel fortunate that I have had a career outside it,
that I've done one-man shows and many musicals, and that I've
performed on Broadway, in Las Vegas, all over the country.
 &HT;    ``So I don't feel threatened by the show,'' Williams concludes.
``People love it, and for that I'm very grateful. It's part of who
I am as a person and as an entertainer.''

TRACEY ULLMAN TRIES A NEW IDENTITY: MOVIE STAR 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Tracey Ullman with Hugh Grant in a scene
from ``Small Time Crooks.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Tracey Ullman's entourage takes up less room than those of most
Hollywood stars.
 &HT;    Actually, they're all her. A hairy New York cabbie opens the
door to her hotel room. A screaming Ricky Martin fan materializes
moments later. And scary Beverly Hills attorney Sydney Kross
practically drips sarcasm as he picks at the fruit plate.
 &HT;    Five minutes into a conversation with the 41-year-old British
comedian, and you've met a parade of people of every race, creed,
gender and sexual preference. But they have one thing in common:
They're all hilarious.
 &HT;    So much for Jerry Lewis' recent comment that women can't be
funny.
 &HT;    ``That comment would hurt if it came from anyone I thought was
funny,'' Ullman says, snapping into her real persona. ``Frankly, I
was burning up when I heard that comment. My first reaction was,
`Why did you say that, you old fool? What about Gilda Radner? What
about Lucille Ball? What about me?'''
 &HT;    Yes, what about her? Ullman burst onto the American comedy scene
13 years ago with her critically acclaimed television series, ``The
Tracey Ullman Show'' (1987-1990), and nowadays has a hit HBO comedy
series, ``Tracey Takes On.''
 &HT;    And now she's starring opposite Woody Allen in the
rags-to-riches story ``Small Time Crooks,'' opening May 19. Ullman
plays Allen's wife, who gets entangled in his scheme to tunnel into
a bank and rob the place.
 &HT;    For years, Ullman recalls, she longed to work with Allen.
 &HT;    ``I remember sitting in my hot tub in America when I was
pregnant and whining to my husband, `Should I stay in America? I
miss London,''' she says. ``But then what changed things for me is
that I watched `Broadway Danny Rose' (1984), and it was so terrific
that I thought I should stay in America just so I could work with
Woody Allen.''
 &HT;    Never one to sit and wait, Ullman immediately took pen in hand.
 &HT;    ``For years I wrote Woody silly letters,'' the comedian says.
``I said things like, `Dear Woody. You use Mia Farrow all the time.
Isn't it time for a change? Let Mia sit in my hot tub and I'll come
to New York and be in your movies.'
 &HT;    ``I honestly thought he would read these lunatic notes and say,
`You know, that's a good idea.'''
 &HT;    For his own part, Allen says in a separate interview, he was
simply confused.
 &HT;    ``She wrote me all these letters, and frankly I never heard of
her,'' Allen recalls. ``Eventually Tracey sent me a tape of her
performances. She was great _ I even went around telling my
friends, `You've got to see this woman. She's amazing.'''
 &HT;    When he was casting ``Bullets Over Broadway'' (1994), Allen gave
Ullman a small role.
 &HT;    ``The previous day I had been asked to do a Christmas special in
Montreal with the Olsen twins,'' she recalls. ``Bless them, they
are sweet little girls. But it wasn't my cup of tea.
 &HT;    ``Plus, I had to ask questions such as, `When are the Olsen
twins going to be nude in Playboy? It might not be good for me to
be associated with them.'''
 &HT;    Ullman landed a bigger part in Allen's ``Everyone Says I Love
You'' (1996), complete with a song-and-dance number. But when the
movie ran 20 minutes too long, the filmmaker was forced to cut out
her role entirely.
 &HT;    ``I had to explain to her that it had nothing to do with her
performance,'' Allen says. ``It was my bad writing.''
 &HT;    When he gave her a co-starring role in ``Small Time Crooks,''
Allen says, he was less worried about her performance than about
his own.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, I was intimidated,'' he admits. ``She's a comic
genius.''
 &HT;    That comic flair was cultivated during a rough childhood spent
in the posh area of Slough, near London, in the 1960s. Her father
died from a heart ailment when Tracey was 6, and Ullman used to try
to distract her mother from her worries by staging nightly shows in
her bedroom.
 &HT;    ``Those were sad years,'' Ullman says. ``I would try to do
anything to cheer up my mum. I would put on her negligees and strut
around the room _ nothing was off limits to make her smile.''
 &HT;    A natural mimic, Ullman won a scholarship to a professional
children's school in London, but she soon realized that
conventional show business was not for her.
 &HT;    ``I hated every minute of it,'' she says, grimacing. ``The other
girls were there because their mothers wanted to make them little,
annoying, blonde stars of toilet-paper commercials. I would sit in
the bathroom at school, smoke and make fun of all the other
girls.''
 &HT;    At 16 Ullman left school to become a dancer, then took a shot at
a singing career. Her first album, ``You Broke My Heart in 17
Places,'' went gold and produced four Top 10 singles in England.
 &HT;    But her heart wasn't in music, and she soon turned to the
theater and, in turn, television work for the BBC. That's where she
met her husband, British television producer Allan McKeown, a
former hairdresser who co-created her early BBC series and also
helms her current HBO show, ``Tracey Takes On,'' as well as helping
raise their two children, Mabel and John.
 &HT;    Defining her unique show-business niche hasn't been easy, Ullman
admits.
 &HT;    ``It is tougher for girls to be funny,'' she says. ``I'm lucky
because I find humor in situations. But I never wanted to be a
stand-up comic _ I could never be one of those girls who gets up in
front of a mike and talks about her Tampax ... I don't get why
female stand-ups feel they have to talk about sex and be bawdy and
brash.''
 &HT;    Women are also harder to make jokes about, she says, because
they're more likely to take offense.
 &HT;    ``Once I did this talk show with supermodel Christie Brinkley,
and I went up to her and said, `It's amazing _ I always heard you
were pretty,''' Ullman recalls. ``She almost burst into tears.
 &HT;    ``It was a joke,'' she says defensively.
 &HT;    ``You have to do selective bitchery,'' the comedian adds.
``There is some bitchery we don't want to say openly, because we
don't want to damage our careers.'''
 &HT;    At the same time, she's adamant in insisting that no topic is
too sensitive to joke about.
 &HT;    ``Everything is comic fodder,'' Ullman says. ``I take on some
serious issues, and I find the humor in them. The poignant/funny
pieces are the ones I like the most. Once I did this skit on gay
golfers kissing _ I thought it broke a bit of ground.''
 &HT;    Ullman is even willing to bite the hand that feeds her, taking
off on two of the top-rated shows on HBO, for which she will soon
begin taping new episodes of her series, ``Tracey Takes On.''
 &HT;    She lapses into a dead-on impression of ``Sex and the City's''
Sarah Jessica Parker.
 &HT;    ``Yes,'' she burbles, ``let's talk orgasms!''
 &HT;    To riff on the grueling prison drama ``Oz,'' she assumes the
voice of a blase Noo Yawk television critic.
 &HT;    ``It's a great show,'' she says with a theatrical sigh, ``but
how many gang rapes can you see in two hours?''

AMY SMART: BAD GIRLS HAVE MORE FUN

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Amy Smart in a scene from ``Road
Trip.'') 
 By JEANNE WOLF and MELANIE SEYMOUR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Amy Smart made a name for herself by playing good girls in
``Varsity Blues'' (1999) and ``Outside Providence'' (1999), but
nowadays she's doing even better being bad.
 &HT;    The 24-year-old blonde with an infectious smile and an easy
laugh can currently be seen on the hit television series
``Felicity'' as Noel's new love who gets pregnant by another guy.
She recently played a second-rate model caught up in drugs and cult
religion in the NBC miniseries ``The '70s,'' and her next
big-screen appearance _ in ``Road Trip,'' opening May 19 _ is as a
girl who likes to videotape her sex life.
 &HT;    Some may recall seeing her in a more risque role in ``Varsity
Blues,'' but they're wrong.
 &HT;    ``People still think I'm the one who had sex with a guy and lots
of whipped cream,'' she says. ``That girl was actually my friend
Ali Larter. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that we're
both blonde.''
 &HT;    ``Road Trip'' gives Smart her first topless scene, opposite
hunky Breckin Meyer.
 &HT;    ``I'd never done nudity before, so I was a little nervous,'' she
admits. ``Then the director, Todd Phillips, told me that he would
never forget watching Phoebe Cates drop her top in `Fast Times At
Ridgemont High' (1982). He said it changed his life.''
 &HT;    She pauses and giggles.
 &HT;    ``I guess that made me feel better.''
 &HT;    Smart did check with her mother first, she adds.
 &HT;    ``She said, `If you think it's the right choice, then you should
do it,''' the actress recalls. ``I was just so glad she didn't
become overprotective.''
 &HT;    ``Road Trip'' is a teen comedy of errors which casts Meyer as
Josh, a college student who's cheating on his significant other
with Beth (Smart). The videotape of their amorous encounter is
accidentally mailed to his girlfriend at her Texas college, so Josh
and a few buddies hit the road to the Lone Star State, determined
to intercept the incriminating tape.
 &HT;    Co-starring as Meyer's bizarre roommate is the wildly
unpredictable MTV comic Tom Green.
 &HT;    ``We didn't know what to expect from Tom,'' Smart says. ``We
were all a little nervous that he might be trying to pull some gags
on us during a scene. But he was really very nice and low-key.
 &HT;    ``But after the camera stopped rolling,'' she adds with a grin,
``he'd get a little crazy.''
 &HT;    Most of the rest of the ``Road Trip'' cast are male, but Smart
says that wasn't a problem.
 &HT;    ``Fortunately, there weren't any big egos,'' she says. ``I felt
completely at home, because growing up I was sort of a tomboy. I
was the one skating with the boys. I even played Little League with
them. I was the only girl on the team, and they called me `Smarty
Pants.' So I've never had any trouble getting along with a bunch of
guys.''
 &HT;    She may be a budding movie star with two hits behind her, but
Smart says that so far it's television that has given her whatever
recognition she enjoys.
 &HT;    ``I get recognized a lot for `Felicity,''' she says. ``I guess
people sort of get hooked on their favorite series and watch them
religiously. When fans of `Felicity' see me, it's like they know
me.''
 &HT;    Her character on ``Felicity'' has forced Smart to deal with the
issue of teen-age pregnancy, which she says has been a real
eye-opener.
 &HT;    ``I met some single young women who kept their babies,'' the
actress says. ``I used to wonder how they could make that kind of
mistake and get pregnant. Now I'm much more forgiving, because I
realize the love they feel for that child. I have a lot more
compassion, which was a huge learning lesson in itself.''
 &HT;    So was playing a pregnant character.
 &HT;    ``I had to put on this pregnant suit,'' she says. ``Just looking
down at my big belly was wild and kind of exciting. I want to have
kids eventually, and so I'd go, `Wow, this is what I'd look
like.'''
 &HT;    Smart and her brother, Adam, had a thoroughly conventional
upbringing in Topanga Canyon, Calif.
 &HT;    ``I was actually very shy,'' she recalls. ``I was always
watching one of my friends, Vinessa Shaw, who started acting when
she was very young and, ironically, got the good-girl role in `The
'70s.' First I studied ballet, and when I danced on stage I loved
the attention. Then I finally took the leap and enrolled in an
acting class, and I was hooked.''
 &HT;    Her first career opportunity, however, came as a model.
 &HT;    ``Vinessa Shaw suggested me as a replacement in a photo shoot,''
she says, ``and I got the job. Suddenly I was getting assignments
to travel to places like Italy, France, Mexico and Tahiti. I wasn't
a cover girl, but I was able to pay for my first car and my first
apartment.
 &HT;    ``I never worried about getting pigeonholed as a model,'' she
adds, ``because I wasn't getting that much attention.''
 &HT;    Smart made her acting debut in a small part in an MTV ``Rock the
Vote'' promo, and went on to minor roles in ``Starship Troopers''
(1997) and ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide'' (1997). Then came
``Varsity Blues,'' and the wheels of celebrity began to turn.
 &HT;    ``I'm still close to my parents,'' she says, ``and they help
keep me grounded. But they get a kick out of what I'm doing. For
instance, NBC put a huge `'70s' billboard on a building in Burbank.
It was almost six stories high. My father called me up and said, `I
brought my camera to work. Let's have lunch and take a few
pictures.'
 &HT;    ``He was posing me in front of this billboard with a picture of
me on it,'' the actress recalls, laughing. ``It was so sweet.''
 &HT;    Another grounding influence in Smart's life is her boyfriend,
actor Branden Williams.
 &HT;    ``We've been together for a long time,'' she says. ``It's nice
to be with somebody who understands this business. If you don't, I
think you could become incredibly insecure in a relationship with
an actor.''
 &HT;    Actually, Smart adds, despite the cliche of the neurotic
actress, she considers herself perfectly secure.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes you just have to take charge,'' Smart says. ``I
remember that, when I was doing `Felicity,' it looked like it would
conflict with `The '70s.' I really wanted the chance to play this
wild party girl on the miniseries, but I also knew that getting
pregnant on `Felicity' was something I had to do.
 &HT;    ``Finally I called up J.J. Abrams, the `Felicity' producer, and
I told him I really wanted to do both and I needed him to help
me,'' she recalls. ``That little phone call kept me on the show. I
realized how important it was to speak up and not get caught in
having an agent or somebody else speak for you. I charged ahead,
and I got what I wanted.
 &HT;    ``The other thing I've learned,'' she adds, ``is how the best
people, especially some of the legends, are really just people. You
have this larger-than-life image of them, and then you realize that
they're not trying to be that way.
 &HT;    ``It actually brings up my own confidence,'' Smart says. ``You
realize they're just people, too. And if they can do it, maybe you
can, too.
 &HT;    ``So why not reach for the stars?''

FRANKIE MUNIZ: LITTLE MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF A GREAT BIG HIT

 (Includes a color slide of Frankie Muniz in a scene from ``Malcolm
in the Middle.'') 
 By KEVIN DICKSON  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before May 28. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This past year has been a blur for Frankie Muniz.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old actor has gone from virtual obscurity to stardom
as the title character of the season's biggest breakout comedy,
``Malcolm in the Middle.'' And Muniz is enjoying his rocket ride to
fame, with one small exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't skateboard any more,'' he says with a rueful regret
that would befit any teen-ager. ``Although I did get hurt a couple
times _ I used to do a lot of extreme stuff. I have to be a bit
more careful now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox Broadcasting insists on it, in fact _ the network counts
Muniz as one of its most valuable assets. Since its January
premiere, ``Malcolm'' has become a Sunday-night habit for many
viewers who either identify with the dysfunctional family depicted
therein or at least love to laugh at their foibles.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm's family doesn't have a last name, they're not animated,
the parents aren't divorced and, most notably, the series has
managed to be anything but predictable. In short, it's ``The Wonder
Years'' filtered through ``Mad TV,'' and the public can't get
enough.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Muniz dispels the myths about child actors: instead
of being a petulant, snotty brat, he's charming, self-effacing and
friendly. Even more refreshing, in a business in which the Olsen
twins have acted like corporate traders since they could toddle,
Muniz actually acts his age.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is he complaining about the added responsibilities that
accompany his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love acting, so whatever comes with it, I'll do,'' he says.
``It's really fun for me. I don't mind traveling all over, living
in a hotel, because I get to meet so many new people. It's just a
lot of fun for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The fun is only beginning. In addition to his newfound fame as
Malcolm, Muniz got a big-screen boost with this spring's
family-themed feature ``My Dog Skip,'' in which he co-stars with
Kevin Bacon. And he's recently started shooting a new film,
``Deuces Are Wild,'' in Los Angeles, alongside Matt Dillon and
Deborah Harry.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I'm doing a cartoon for Nickelodeon called `The Very
Odd Parents,''' Muniz adds, ``and I'm doing a charity event for
Baskin-Robbins.''
</P>
<P>
   Between all of this, Muniz must find time for school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm home-schooled now,'' he says, ``but when I was in regular
school I was always a little ahead in my stuff, and my teachers
would always have to give me extra work, because I would get done
with my math and everything really quickly. So when I was in first
grade, I was doing fourth-grade work.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake him for Malcolm, the television genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a genius,'' Muniz says patiently, ``but just a little
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   He never had the trouble that Malcolm does with other children
taunting him about his brains _ though he admits that his
blossoming career has brought problems of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this kid who, it seems every time he sees me, someone
is always asking about the show or about acting and stuff,'' he
says, ``so he's always like, ``Is that all you talk about?''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's a little weird,'' Muniz says. ``But really, before
this show, I never told anyone about my acting. They would just see
it on TV and come up to me, `Were you on that? That's really cool.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But now everyone has seen the show, so they all come up to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the show took off, Muniz, his mother and his 15-year-old
sister have moved from New Jersey to Los Angeles, where the young
star keeps himself busy on his time off by exploring the area's
endless array of golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually play golf,'' he says. ``I've played since I was 5.
My grandpa taught me, and I can now beat him. I have a 13
handicap.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spends time with his ``Malcolm'' castmates, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do hang out together,'' he says. ``We're always in school
together, and then when you're done with school we play football
and just hang out, or play basketball on the set.''
</P>
<P>
   From all reports that set is one of the most laid-back in Los
Angeles, which is saying quite a lot. Bryan Cranston, who plays
Hal, the boys' oddball father, seconds the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real normal kids,'' he says in a separate interview.
``Which is great from my standpoint, because they're not so
callused and business-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 7-year-old daughter myself,'' he adds, ``and she is
crazy about the boys. Crazy about them.''
</P>
<P>
   She's not the only one. ``Malcolm'' has proven to be a ratings
powerhouse for the troubled Fox network, and there are already a
multitude of devoted fan sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz is elated about the show's success, but like many actors
before him is perplexed by his fans, who seem to think that Muniz
is Malcolm and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the confusion may be his own fault, he admits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to sound real weird, but I hadn't read the
script when I first auditioned, so I was just myself saying
Malcolm's words,'' he recalls. ``I just went in and did how I would
do it if it was me. So I guess I am who I play.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has grown into his character, Muniz has become more aware
of their differences than of their similarities, and he's no longer
sure that he'd even want to hang out with Malcolm himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be friends with him ... like half and half,'' the
young actor says thoughtfully. ``He is like me a little bit, but I
really wouldn't want to be with him because he is always angry.
He's always so mad at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad temper notwithstanding, it looks like Muniz is stuck with
Malcolm for the foreseeable future. The little guy is still
settling into his role as television's top kid, but the actor who
plays him is slowly getting used to those surreal moments that seem
to keep popping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so weird,'' he says, shaking his head. ``Last year I was
watching the Nickelodeon Kids Choice Awards, and this year I'm
co-hosting. It's just so weird and awesome.''
</P>

BACK TO BRADY: BARRY WILLIAMS REVISITS HIS YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Barry Williams on the set of ``Growing
Up Brady.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It was another Brady moment in a life bursting with Brady
moments.
 &HT;    There stood Barry Williams, who portrayed the ever-wholesome
Greg Brady in ``The Brady Bunch'' and its assorted spinoffs,
watching as actor Adam Brody played Williams playing Greg in a
scene for ``Growing Up Brady.''
 &HT;    Based on Williams' memoirs about his days as a Brady, ``Growing
Up Brady'' will air May 21 on NBC.
 &HT;    ``I think surreal might describe it,'' Williams says. ``There
was an element of deja vu. There were moments when it was plain old
uncomfortable. I felt exposed _ you had 100 people on a soundstage,
dissecting my life, my memories, my dialogue.
 &HT;    ``I'd be standing right there, thinking, `No, Barry wouldn't do
that. Wait a minute, let me tell you what to do,''' he says.
``There had to be a bit of compromise, because the actor playing me
had to interpret the dialogue for himself. I think believable is
better even than accurate.''
 &HT;    Williams, who served as the television movie's co-executive
producer and appears briefly as himself, explains that the story is
told in flashbacks and covers his five years making ``The Brady
Bunch,'' his relationship with co-star Maureen McCormick (Kaley
Cuoco) and the battles between Robert Reed (Daniel Hugh Kelly),
producer Sherwood Schwartz (Michael Tucker) and Paramount Pictures
over money and the quality of the scripts.
 &HT;    Most important, ``Growing Up Brady'' examines the impact of the
show on its six young cast members.
 &HT;    ``It gives you a real clear feeling for the environment of
growing up as pretty normal kids in pretty unusual circumstances,''
Williams says by telephone from his production offices in New York.
``You've got a bunch of kids dealing with all the hype, intensity,
challenges and rewards of being under the microscope as a result of
being on a show, making records, touring, making personal
appearances, being isolated from our friends and counting on one
another.
 &HT;    ``The telemovie, as opposed to my book, shows all of that,
rather than putting it only into words,'' he says. ``The telemovie
has a completely different arc than the book. It's got a beginning,
middle and an end, while the book goes chapter by chapter.''
 &HT;    Nobody, of course, ever foresaw that ``The Brady Bunch,'' which
ran from 1969 to 1974, would endure as it has. It was a sweet,
corny show that never quite went away. Much like ``Star Trek,''
``The Brady Bunch'' entered the realm of phenomenon only after its
cancellation, riding an unending afterlife of reruns.
 &HT;    Soon enough, there was a ``Brady Bunch'' variety hour, then
several reunion telemovies and two short-lived ``Brady'' series.
Then came two feature films, ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' (1995) and
``A Very Brady Sequel'' (1996). Even now, ``Brady'' fever runs so
high that Fox has whipped together its own Brady telemovie, ``The
Brady Bunch _ The Final Years,'' and scheduled it for May 16, a
week before ``Growing Up Brady.''
 &HT;    Exactly why ``The Brady Bunch'' emerged as an icon _ and why it
remains one _ is as much a mystery today as it was 10, 20 or 30
years ago.
 &HT;    ``There are probably 1,000 answers, and I'm certainly no
authority on it,'' says Williams, who is now 45 and a newlywed who
lives with his wife in Connecticut. ``I can tell you what people
tell me, and that is they appreciate the show for not being
preachy.
 &HT;    ``They like the little messages in each show,'' he says. ``They
like that the family communicates, that they get along, that the
parents get along with each other and the kids, and that the kids,
if they have an argument, talk and work things out.
 &HT;    ``There's also an identifiability factor,'' Williams adds,
``because there are boys and girls, and there's a youngest kid, a
middle kid and an oldest kid. Even now, adults can say, `Oh yeah, I
had braces' or `I remember when I got my first pair of glasses.'
 &HT;    ``It could also be the supergroovy fashion statements we made
every week,'' he says with a laugh.
 &HT;    ``All in all, everybody understands that there is no family like
the Bradys, but it is an ideal that just hasn't gone out of
fashion,'' he concludes. ``I'm thrilled that kids today appreciate
the show, and I've got 5- and 6-year-olds coming up to me and
asking for autographs, sometimes for themselves and sometimes for
their parents.
 &HT;    ``What's amusing to me,'' Williams adds, ``is that kids think
they've discovered this new show. And what I find poignant is that
parents tell me that watching `The Brady Bunch' is one of the few
activities they can do together and actually enjoy with their
kids.''
 &HT;    Prior to ``The Brady Bunch,'' Williams was a busy child actor in
Hollywood. He appeared as a boy dying of leukemia on ``Marcus
Welby, M.D.'' and as a young king in a ``Mission: Impossible''
episode. He played brainy boys and kids who talked back.
 &HT;    And then came Greg.
 &HT;    ``I've lived life with `The Brady Bunch' in it, and I'm happy
with my life,'' the actor says. ``But there is a true curiosity on
my part about what it would have been like not to have been
associated and identified with one project so strongly.
 &HT;    ``It would have been fine that I played Greg,'' he says, ``but
the show never left the air. It's been on for 30 years, and that's
a lot of reinforcement.
 &HT;    ``The whole typecasting phenomenon is interesting,'' he says
thoughtfully, ``and it's something I've come to learn a little bit
about. All actors who come on the scene get associated with the
role that made them famous. Sean Connery has a tremendous body of
work, but don't you think of Bond when you think of Sean Connery?
Michael Landon did `Little House' and `Highway to Heaven,' but to a
lot of people he was always Little Joe from `Bonanza.'
 &HT;    ``Look at what Sally Field had to overcome,'' Williams says.
``Sylvester Stallone is an interesting case. He came on the scene
as Rocky and he tried everything, comedies and even musicals, but
people just didn't get him in those other roles. You can't do
anything about typecasting, unless you do something bigger than
that which you became first known for.''
 &HT;    Williams has yet to land a part that will do for him what
``Norma Rae'' (1979) did for Field or ``First Blood'' (1982) did
for Stallone, but he isn't complaining. A couple of years ago he
starred in the national tour of ``City of Angels'' and, more
recently, he released ``The Return of Johnny Bravo,'' a CD of pop
songs which is available through his official Web site,
barrywilliams.com.
 &HT;    ``Here's the thing,'' he says. ``I'm proud of `The Brady Bunch.'
I embrace it. I feel fortunate that I have had a career outside it,
that I've done one-man shows and many musicals, and that I've
performed on Broadway, in Las Vegas, all over the country.
 &HT;    ``So I don't feel threatened by the show,'' Williams concludes.
``People love it, and for that I'm very grateful. It's part of who
I am as a person and as an entertainer.''

UNWANTED BOY BLOOMS IN THE FUTURE

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR ALL NEEDING)  
 BY E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's mid-May in the year 2019 and the smart-alecky columnist for
``The Arizona Republic'' (yeah, still me) has tracked down the
21-year-old son of Ruth Ann Burns to ask if he'll be sending his
mom flowers for Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it to you, old-timer?'' asks the young man, whose name
is Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   It has to do with what happened in court back in 2000, he's
told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get lost,'' Nicholas says.
</P>
<P>
   Kids these days. No respect. (I'm nearing retirement age by this
time. I'm supposed to spout off about youngsters.)
</P>
<P>
   I've been waiting for you to become a grown-up, Nicholas is
told. There are things no one could ask you back in 2000, when you
were only 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   Like, did the court case ruin your life?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's old news.''
</P>
<P>
   Your mother sued her doctors for not diagnosing her pregnancy
sooner so she could have had an abortion. She claimed her life
would have been a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had nothing to do with me,'' Nicholas says.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it did, he's told. In Maricopa County Superior Court, your
mother's lawyer said, ``This is a major imposition.'' He meant you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just talk for the lawsuit,'' Nicholas says. ``It wasn't
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but he was speaking for your mother and father. A lot of
frustrated parents wonder if they'd have been better off without
kids. Some even say it out loud. But I don't recall anyone swearing
an oath to it in open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 2{,'' he says. ``I don't remember any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good. You should have heard some of the things people
said about your mom. The trial brought up other abortions she'd
had, her lifestyle. I took calls at the paper from people who said
her children should be taken away from her. They couldn't believe a
mother would file such a lawsuit. They were sure it would destroy
your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's hasn't happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What about when you were a kid? Back in 2000, people figured
you'd be scarred forever by all the teasing you'd take at school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Not at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened once or twice. All kids get teased,'' Nicholas
says.
</P>
<P>
   But, your mother used you as a pawn in a sleazy money grab. Her
lawyer put an economist on the stand to say your life was worth
$143,214. Then, when the opposing lawyer asked your mother if she
was ``damaged'' by the fact you were born, she answered under oath,
``Yes.'' And she said so a week before Mother's Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you hate her for that?
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Why not? I can't imagine a worse thing a parent could say about
her child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 2000,'' Nicholas says, ``did anyone claim my mother
had abandoned me?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was she accused of physically abusing me?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she fail to give me clothes or food, or to put a roof over
my head?''
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she also say that, after I was born, she loved me?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what was your original question again?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Will you be sending your mom flowers next Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   (Hey, I'm an old man. I'm supposed to dream.) &QL;

&HT;     HERBIVORES CELEBRATE THE JOYS OF SHUNNING FLESH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANASTASIA HENDRIX  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRACISCO _ Dressed in an oversized banana suit, Rob Schaff
spent Sunday afternoon playing tunes with titles like ``I Got the
Blues `Cuz I Ain't Got No Greens,'' and ``I Left My Lettuce Hearts
in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   He blared out the moody melodies as hundreds swarmed around
tables sampling meat-free morsels at VegFest 2000, a celebration
organized in part by the San Francisco Vegetarian Society to
promote plant-based diets. And to revel in plenty of puns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be known for being too serious because this is such a
serious issue,'' said Nancy Loewen, a Vegetarian Society board
member who has not eaten any meat, poultry, fish or dairy products
for nearly a decade. ``What we really want is to just give people
information, education and inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouquets of smiling, cartoon-faced Mylar balloons shaped like
bell peppers, tomatoes and celery stalks bobbed above vendors
pitching products with names like Un-Chicken, Tofurkey Jerky and
even one called ``Veat.''
</P>
<P>
   After eating a tan-colored cube of Veat from a toothpick, Laura
Bilodeau declared it delicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tastes a lot like chicken,'' said Bilodeau, a
self-described ``major carnivore.'' ``They did a good job of faking
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal fitness coach, Veat fan and sample-server Christopher
Todd said he fell in love with the flavor after his first bite of a
faux salmon filet about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm getting goose-bumps just thinking about it,'' he
said, pointing to his forearm. ``This is my buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd even composed a poem about his favorite product, which is
posted on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But for vegetarian Esta Lewin, the texture was almost too close
to the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little too meat-like for me,'' said Lewin, who lives
in South Lake Tahoe and came to San Francisco for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing, I used to travel for recreation, now I travel to
eat,'' she said, explaining that her menu options are often limited
in her hometown because there are far fewer vegetarians.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the San Francisco area has one of the largest
concentrations of vegetarians and vegans in the country, organizer
Loewen said the group hopes even more will join the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second consecutive year the Vegetarian Society has
sponsored such an event. Last year's ``Joy of Soy'' gathering at
Fort Mason was tightly focused on the vegetarian staple. About 500
people attended, Loewen said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers decided to broaden the emphasis this year to include
all kinds of products - though many of those featured did contain
some form of soy.
</P>
<P>
   Loewen, who is also a nurse, said the health benefits are
considerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty to 70 percent of chronic illnesses in the United States
are diet-related, including heart disease, many types of cancer,
osteoporosis, arthritis and diabetes are just a few,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal is putting to rest the perception that vegetarian
diets are boring and bland.
</P>
<P>
   Vegan restaurateur Ann Wheat of Millennium wowed the crowd with
gourmet plantain tortes and cabbage-shiitake spring rolls.
</P>
<P>
   There were many variations of vegetable- and soy-based
``burgers'' and even soy-based corn dogs served with sweet and
spicy mustard.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most popular were the chewy vegan cookies and brownies
from the Oakland-based company called NoCookie. The secret recipe
ingredient: prunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what keeps them moist,'' boasted the vendor.
</P>
<P>
   While most of those ``vegging out'' at the food festival are
already devout vegetarians, some, like Ed Lomasney, said they were
there to learn more about going meat-free and to try various
meat-free recipes by attending informational lectures by
dietitians, chefs and organics experts, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, I never met a vegetarian I didn't like,'' Lomasney
joked.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... right away.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Teller, the former head of MCA and CBS Records and now
founder/CEO of the Internet music start-up Atomic Pop, agrees.
``Artists will often bridge the gaps by doing a soundtrack song in
between album projects,'' says Teller, whose company announced last
week an agreement with Microsoft to provide music content for
WindowsMedia.com. ``It will serve them well to keep the flow of new
music to fans without the pressure to make a full album. I would
hope that artists are freer to create music that they want to
create.''
</P>
<P>
   Teller argues that, in fact, an Internet-based music business
might actually improve the quality of pop music. ``The overall
artistry of records that have reached commercial success levels has
really diminished in the video era,'' Teller says. ``The use of
video as primary imaging allows mediocre talent to masquerade as
something more, whereas previously an artist's image came from
their music and from live performances, onstage, where you can't
fake it. On a controlled set, you can camouflage talent. I think
we're now going to allow for a more diverse set of artists, and
more that don't fit into the mold, to find an audience. And that
will be great for the audience, too.''
</P>
<P>
   There are scads of artists eager to enjoy the distribution
opportunities and freedom of expression presented by Internet-based
technology. Some, however _ mainly from the old guard _ place great
value on the creative imprinting that goes into a full-length album
of songs. Way back in 1988, the Artist formerly known as Prince
released ``Lovesexy,'' an exactingly sequenced song cycle that
explored the intersection of the sexual and spiritual. The CD
didn't have index markings to separate individual tracks,
preventing listeners from programming songs out of sequence. It was
a commercial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, people download things, or they get an album,
listen to one track or they mix it up,'' said veteran rocker Lou
Reed in a recent CNN interview to promote his new CD ``Ecstasy.''
``If you listen to it in the order that we spent days and days _
weeks, months, possibly years _ putting together, listeners will
appreciate the music more. So all those kids out there who think
mix and match is really great, you don't know what you're talking
about.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The old guard &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is still an active, old-guard consumer base out there, as
well. The misanthropic, emotionally crippled rock-star protagonist
of Pink Floyd's 1979 rock opera ``The Wall'' is embedded in the
canon for all eternity. Last week ``The Wall Live 1980-81: Is
Anybody Out There?'' entered the Billboard Top 200 album charts at
Number 19. Tower Records in the Back Bay sold 125 copies in its
first week, as well as 30 copies of a limited-edition companion
book that sells for $47, according to store manager Greg
Harrington. ``It was pretty much the standard Pink Floyd fan,''
Harrington says. ``Older white males.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tide is turning. An entire generation of rock music fans
has now grown up on a steady diet of quick-edit videos and movie
soundtracks, computer-generated radio playlists and instant pop
sensations. It's a generation well versed in virtual experience,
one that has no qualms about kissing physical product goodbye. They
want their MTV, their MP3 files, and their CD burners. They want
three-minute songs, and they want them now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's really gonna drive the market is kids
downloading directly to portable devices,'' says Kevin Conroy,
senior vice president for worldwide marketing and new technology at
BMG Entertainment, which operates more than 200 record labels
worldwide. ``Certainly we want those consumers to access what they
like in the form they like it. On the other hand, artists need to
have a say in how their music is presented to the public. There are
artists who've communicated very clearly that they don't want their
music to be cherry-picked,'' says Conroy (though he declined to
name those artists). ``The new technology has given us the
opportunity to engage in the market differently, and that's a
wonderful thing. But just because you can do something with
technology, it doesn't mean you should. It's up to the artistic and
business communities to come to a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Internet's promise of democratization, the age-old
struggle between art and commerce is alive and well, and barreling
like a train wreck into the digital age. But it will be a new
generation of music fans, armed not only with cutting-edge
technology but with entirely reconfigured appetites, who define how
music is consumed in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE TOP TEN CRITERION TITLES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1.``Amarcord'' (1974)
</P>
<P>
   Federico Fellini's brilliant use of color is spectacularly
restored, and Nino Rota's score (which was mushy on VHS) is crisper
than ever.
</P>
<P>
   2.``Autumn Sonata'' (1978)
</P>
<P>
   Ingmar Bergman directs Ingrid Bergman in her final film. The
director refused to record additional tracks for the DVD, but the
restoration of the soundtrack makes this a must for any collector.
</P>
<P>
   3.``Beauty and the Beast'' (1946)
</P>
<P>
   Jean Cocteau's classic fantasy has been victimized for years by
bad 16mm prints and worse VHS reproductions. Now it's perfect.
</P>
<P>
   4.``Brazil'' (1985)
</P>
<P>
   Terry Gilliam's futuristic fantasy contains more extras than a
fully loaded Humvee _ with his reworked director's cut, the version
Universal released, and Jack Matthews's informative documentary on
the artist-vs.-industry controversy.
</P>
<P>
   5.``Grand Illusion'' (1937)
</P>
<P>
   This disc includes an introduction by Jean Renoir filmed in the
late 1930s; footage of Renoir and Erich von Stroheim accepting
their New York Film Critics Circle Awards in 1938; and a letter
from Renoir to the projectionist on how best to showcase his film.
</P>
<P>
   6.``Great Expectations'' (1946)
</P>
<P>
   David Lean's black-and-white imagery is recaptured in all its
glory on this edition. It's too bad that the great director, who
relied so much on visual storytelling, didn't live long enough to
record companion tracks.
</P>
<P>
   7.``Henry V'' (1944)
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the explosive, saturated colors enriching Laurence
Olivier's classic, there's an informative commentary by historian
Bruce Eder and a vivid collection of production notes and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   8.``The Last Temptation of Christ'' (1988)
</P>
<P>
   The original release of Martin Scorsese's adaptation of Nikos
Kazantzakis's novel was mired in controversy. More than a decade
later, it's easier to see the movie's artistry with the external
religious politics removed. Helped along by a commentary track that
includes the always-articulate director, screenwriters Paul
Schrader and Jay Cocks, and star Willem Dafoe, the disc also
includes an extensive collection of production material.
</P>
<P>
   9.``The Third Man'' (1949)
</P>
<P>
   Carol Reed's adaptation of Graham Greene's novel gets
first-class treatment with supplementary material that includes
Joseph Cotton's alternate introduction, several episodes of the
radio drama, and Greene reading excerpts from his screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   10.``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' (1985)
</P>
<P>
   Director Philip Kaufman's sexy film about love and politics gets
the widescreen treatment and an informative commentary track by the
filmmaker.

FILM SCHOOL IN A CAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sandwiched between a Japanese restaurant and an Irish
bar on 52d street near Third Avenue is the modest brick home of two
companies developing the future of home entertainment _ Janus Films
and the Criterion Collection. A pair of posters frame the lobby. On
one side there is Orson Welles as the enigmatic Harry Lime in ``The
Third Man,'' while on the other Erich von Stroheim fixes his
eternal gaze out from Jean Renoir's ``Grand Illusion.'' It's a
small building consisting of two floors and an assortment of
offices and work spaces. Yet, on these few thousand square feet, a
handful of employees is producing as much work on as many films as
Louis B. Mayer created on his miles of backlot in MGM's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Criterion obtains the rights to films, searches for the best
available components, runs them through a complex series of
computerized and digitized operations, adds supplementary
commentary tracks and creates, essentially, an entertaining film
school in a can.
</P>
<P>
   First the numbers: Nearly 4 million DVD players were sold in
1999, up from 350,000 in 1997, according to the trade publication
Video Business. According to the Video Software Dealers
Association, the number of PCs equipped with DVD drives has will
rise from 12 million in 1999 to an estimated 32 million by the end
of this year. There are now nearly 6,000 titles available and the
DVD Entertainment Group, a consortium of DVD providers, estimates
that number will rise to 8,500 by the end of the year. Homes with
DVD players bought 21 discs last year, three times more than the
1997 VHS numbers when that format was at its economic peak.
</P>
<P>
   The plants where the DVDs are pressed can't keep up with the
demand. An estimated 45 million discs _ at prices averaging about
$20 _ were sold last year. Nearly 30 million already have been
shipped to retailers this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent issue of Variety, the studios
earned $9.5 billion from domestic home entertainment (VHS, DVD,
Pay-Per-View) last year _ triple what they made from theatrical
rentals.
</P>
<P>
   There's gold in DVDs, and Criterion is just one of dozens of
companies planning to cash in.
</P>
<P>
   While the inside of Criterion, with imposing stacks of audio and
video components, makes it look like a souped-up version of the Bat
Cave, it has its roots in the scratchy black-and-white 16mm
art-film library of Janus Films.
</P>
<P>
   Criterion president Peter Becker, a graduate of Milton Academy
and Harvard '87, and his partner, Jonathan Turrell, whose fathers
were partners in Janus Films, are carrying the family tradition to
the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you've got an electronics engineering degree, it's
difficult to understand how the colorful lights intersect with the
cables and monitors and how the computer modules work together, but
one thing is certain _ the results are astounding.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Anderson, the director of DVD development, who started as a
Criterion intern six years ago after graduating from the University
of Colorado film school, explains. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Putting pieces together &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically start the production process by searching for the
best available film elements,'' he said, while working his way
through the labyrinthine complex. ``We piece together sections of
negative with chunks of release prints that we find sometimes at
the major studios in Los Angeles or in film archives in Europe.
While we usually start at the studios, they are usually not the
best places to find material. Sometimes the studios don't even know
what they own.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the pre-home-video movie moguls believed films were
perishable commodities _ destined for a few days or weeks in
theaters. Now, with so many ancillary markets, movies have become
completely recyclable.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson opens the door to a small room where David Lean's
``Brief Encounter'' (1945) is playing on a monitor. The
black-and-white cinematography sparkles, and the soundtrack,
featuring Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto, has never sounded
crisper.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says it's often easier working on vintage films because
the camera was kept much steadier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They concentrated much more on the acting,'' he says, as
Trevor Howard stares longingly at Celia Johnson. ``They weren't as
interested in a showy style. We try to assemble the closest thing
to a camera negative. Then we begin a video-grade restoration. The
process picks up every flaw. If the camera jiggles a little bit it
gets picked up. They were much steadier in the old days.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Will Salas and Benjamin Rabitor are working on a
restoration of ``The Blob,'' a 1958 horror film starring Steve
McQueen and featuring a title song composed by Burt Bacharach. It's
a print that looks as if it's been run through too many drive-in
projectors. At the time, ``The Blob'' symbolized the Red Menace
threatening small-town America, with its ever-growing, red oozing
mass. But at the moment, Salas and Rabitor are not interested in
the figurative. They're trying to remove more than 30 years of
dirt, scratches, and other examples of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Rabitor, seated at the monitor, hits a few computer keys and a
thin red box imprisons a particularly ornery scratch. He strikes
annother key and the scratch disappears. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Creating missing frames &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer's sometimes too smart,'' says Salas. ``If you let
it have its own way it reads everything with a slightly gray tinge.
But what's amazing is that if there's a frame completely missing,
the computer reads the preceding frame and the following frame and
creates the missing frame based on that information.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston-born Michael W. Wiese, who supervises the audio elements,
is in New York for some discussions on upcoming titles, but he does
most of his work from his home in Sante Fe, where he's currently
editing down six hours of commentary from Jimmy Cliff on ``The
Harder They Come'' for its DVD release sometime later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some DVD producers just let the subjects talk over the film
extemporaneously,'' says Weise, who's wearing a Boston Bruins cap.
He prefers to edit the commentary. ``You can't expect people to be
witty and sharp and intelligent speaking into a microphone for an
hour and a half or two. It usually doesn't work. At least for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from matching a director or star's observations to the
footage, Weise, a former musician, is also responsible for
eliminating annoying noises on the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start by eliminating the clicks and ticks and crackles,'' he
says. ``Then, the tiny hums and minor sounds. Then they put it
through a Dolby digital process that sometimes exposes new problems
we hadn't heard before. It's very time-consuming. You've got to be
very careful going through all the levels of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the technical renovations, Criterion prides itself on
its ability to attract the film's creators to talk about the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked on the three-disc set of `Brazil,' '' says Anderson.
``and Terry Gilliam was very active in the whole process.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Brazil'' resurrected &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil'' is a magnificent case in point for the power of DVD
to resurrect a director's version of a movie. In 1985, Gilliam
delivered a bleak, futuristic comedy to Universal Studios. They
rejected it and ordered it recut without Gilliam's consent. Through
the intercession of Criterion, Gilliam restructured his original
film and viewers can now see the 142-minute film as he intended.
Not only that, the set also includes the 94-minute cut version
(which bears little relation to Gilliam's), a 30-minute on-the-set
documentary featuring Gilliam, star Jonathan Pryce, and
screenwriter Tom Stoppard, among others; Jack Matthews's
documentary on the battle over control of the movie; a production
notebook with Stoppard and cowriter Charles McKeown discussing the
script's evolution through three treatments and three drafts, and a
remarkable audio track where Gilliam's commentary details the
destruction of his idiosyncratic vision by bureaucratic marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get Peter Weir to talk about his early work on
`Picnic at Hanging Rock,' '' says Anderson. ``Weir told me that the
film is about the impossibility of knowing for certain what
happens. He declined to do a commentary track we respect his
position. Our goal is to present the film the way the filmmaker
wants it presented.''
</P>
<P>
   While Criterion owns most of the Ingmar Bergman titles, the
Swedish director also has declined several invitations to
participate in the process. But that doesn't affect the
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a film like `The Virgin Spring,' it's important to
preserve the quality and integrity Bergman expected,'' states Steve
Riforgiato, vice president of sales and marketing for Home Vision,
the distributor of home video for Janus Films and Criterion. ``Our
viewers no longer hope for the best, they anticipate it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest was always in the films and not in the means of
transmission,'' says William Becker, Criterion president Peter
Becker's father and one of the original partners in Janus Films
back when founder Cy Harvey ran it out of the back offices of the
Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. ``But I must say this is very
impressive.''

NOWADAYS IN MUSIC, IT'S THE SINGLE LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the not so distant past, music fans were at the mercy of a
thin black platter, encoded _ in what now seems like
Pleistocene-era technology _ with songs. Each side offered a
sequence of tracks, assembled with much thought by the artist.
There was an arc to the album, a mysterious flow in the best of
them, that demanded patient listening and many return visits. Songs
were like stanzas, memorized in relation to the one that came
before and the one after. There were always fussy listeners who
manually lifted the turntable arm, painstakingly trying and failing
and trying and failing to lay the stylus down in the sliver
preceding another track. But most people let the big disc spin,
song by song, all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of listening to an uninterrupted side of music has been
on the wane since the advent of the compact disc in the early
1980s, when technological advances supplied listeners with scan
buttons, random play features, and skip and repeat funtions. We
became masters of our musical domains, no longer beholden to an
artist's vision of how his or her work should unfold or cohere.
Skip the ballads? No problem. Program the single to repeat 20
times? Awesome. Sure, it was sometimes a pleasure to hear an album
straight through without flipping it over. But the choice was ours.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new generation of technology is enabling us to take even
greater control over when and how we listen to music. The music
consumer has, in essence, become the music programmer, rendering
the very idea of a full-length album obsolete. With the push of a
few buttons on your computer keypad, songs can be sampled and
compiled into customized CDs on countless Web sites, or downloaded
via MP3 files directly onto computers. For a couple of hundred
dollars, you can buy a CD burner and copy songs from MP3 files onto
blank CDs (each costs a dollar or two) for easy Walkman or
car-stereo access. In theory, the Internet could replace the record
store as the prime source of the music you listen to.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time, offline music consumers have the
opportunity to create custom compilations as well: Music kiosks,
which have been in development for several years, are finally
popping up in brick-and-mortar retail stores worldwide. At these
stations, you can burn your own CD; eventually, you'll be able to
download onto your portable MP3 player. Using a touch screen,
customers listen to song samples, select and sequence the tracks,
and even choose titles and art for the label. With a swipe of a
credit card (they accept cash, too), the CD is recorded. It takes
about four minutes to burn 32 minutes' worth of music, at a cost of
$6 to $20, depending on the number of songs.
</P>
<P>
   This month RedDotNet is installing kiosks in Target stores, Sam
Goody, and Wherehouse record stores. Liquid Audio just opened a
string of them in major European and Asian cities. And
Musicmaker.com, which this month will produce between 3 and 5
million custom CDs for Pepsi's ``Choose Your Music'' promotion,
will begin deploying its own retail kiosks later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of music delivery is no longer a matter of conjecture:
The album is on a crash course with the digital future. The
recording industry has recently come to this realization; the
debate about song licensing, legal parameters, and financial
compensation is ongoing, and will be for some time. Last week the
Recording Industry Association of America won a
copyright-infringement lawsuit against MP3.com _ which has compiled
a vast database of sound recordings that it delivers digitally via
computer. It's the first lob in what's certain to be a long and
complicated process during which the music industry struggles to
establish a new business model for the cyber-age.
</P>
<P>
   But what implications does the new digital delivery have for the
art form itself? As more and more music fans are able to browse
titles and personalize CDs with single tracks from massive catalogs
offered through the Internet or at kiosks, will the full-length
album simply vanish? And at what cost to the vision and artistry
that went into capturing _ and loudly proclaiming in a carefully
constructed sprawl of songs _ a moment in time? &QL; 
 &QL; 
A matter of time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we just don't have the time anymore. In the high-tech
order, speed, convenience, and efficiency are paramount. It's
undeniably cost-effective, from a consumer standpoint, to purchase
two songs you really like rather than pay for an entire CD.
Moreover, the idea of sitting still through a dozen tracks when
only a few songs really put you over the top simply doesn't jibe
with our streamlined lives. In other words, kids aren't whiling
away their adolescent years communing with a set of headphones in
their bedrooms. More and more of them are downloading songs onto
multimedia portable MP3 players. We're on the go, and in the surge
to tailor input and maximize the odds for instant gratification,
the notion of an hour spent listening to someone else's idea of a
worthwhile musical experience is sorely out of date.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enhanced techno-wizardry that has accompanied each
new format, LPs, cassette tapes, 8-tracks, and CDs have all served
the same humble purpose. They're albums in the broadest definition
of the word: collections of songs linked by time and tethered by
intention, at the very least, and pointed conceits at their most
ambitious. The Who's ``Tommy'' was the first massively popular
concept album, a full-blown ``rock opera'' with a lengthy notional
narrative and powerful songs that opened a world of new
possibilities to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   But the Beatles' ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,''
released two years earlier, is rock's most splendid song suite. A
third of a century after the album's release, and despite archival
commentary serious and trivial, it's still a mystery how the band
arranged for ``When I'm Sixty-Four'' to sound like a logical
extension of ``Within You Without You,'' and then, miraculously,
become the picture-perfect portal leading to ``Lovely Rita.''
That's not to suggest that any one of these songs doesn't stand
alone. On the contrary, it was the Beatles' particular genius (with
a little help from their producer, George Martin) to have pulled
such an eccentric gaggle of fearless pop-music experiments into a
cohesive whole.
</P>
<P>
   It's not simply a matter of generational lament for bygone
times, either. In recent years, Radiohead and Beck have released
twisted, epic song cycles. Radiohead's 1997 ``OK Computer'' was a
stunning, moody ode to survival of the self in the information age,
and Beck's latest, last year's ``Midnight Vultures,'' is a
shimmering satire/critique of late-century junk-culture. Neither
sold very well, though Beck commented recently (to the online music
site Wall of Sound) that ``there's so much downloading going on
that you wonder how many million people got it that way.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ripe for change &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, this is a trend that took seed long before the
technology came along to make track-by-track music delivery a
reality. For nearly two decades recording careers have been made or
broken almost exclusively by the success of songs on radio and MTV.
Record companies won't bother to release an album if they don't
``hear'' a hit single. As the marketing of singles and videos has
become the full extent of album campaigns, the notion of artist
development at major labels is a near-extinct proposition. And the
time, many would argue, is ripe for change.
</P>
<P>
   If you accept the idea that an ``album'' is a sequence of songs
chosen for a particular reason, the power to put together an album
passed out of artists' hands some time ago. Radio assembles
``albums'' for you; the people programming your favorite
music-video station put together ``albums'' for you. Consumers
aren't revolting against artists' control, they're opting out of
the system that gave control to programmers. No wonder some artists
actually embrace the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine artists being screwed any more than they
already are by the system,'' says Tim Quirk, managing editor of San
Francisco-based Listen.com, an Internet directory of downloadable
music. Quirk, who is also lead vocalist in the alt-pop band Too
Much Joy, sees the pendulum swinging toward an egalitarian system
that favors less prominent artists, in sharp contrast to the
current model that largely subsists on a small stable of hugely
profitable stars.
</P>
<P>
   A key change, Quirk says, is that ``the Internet doesn't tie an
artist to a business cycle,'' which generally runs anywhere from 12
months to two years. ``Speaking as a guy in a band, once you record
a song, you have this incredible impulse to share it. It kills you
waiting for months to get it on record. The Internet allows you to
work at your own pace. Plus, you get instant feedback. A band
throws a song up, and they'll find people who are interested in
them, nurture and build that audience, without the insane pressure
to succeed right away.'' &QL;

AGGRESSIVE SAVING SHOULD KEEP PROGRAM ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Due to being married to a drug addict and all of the
accompanying financial problems, I have contributed to my
retirement savings erratically; some years the maximum, some years
nothing. I am now divorced (with two children and no child support)
and am attempting to catch up and save regularly. How close am I to
being on track? I plan to establish Roth IRAs each year in the
future. My 401(k) plan now has a new option to invest in Franklin
Small Cap Growth fund. Should I put some into that one?
</P>
<P>
   L.W., Escondido, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you maintain your aggressive saving pace, you'll be in
great shape. A lot of people your age are just starting to get
serious about retirement saving, and few have savings targets as
high as yours. I suspect experience has taught you something about
discipline, and the most important thing for you to do _ even if it
requires slightly reducing your savings level _ is to get into a
saving groove that will break the irregular pattern of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some projections (I did not include the bank savings in these
tallies, and I assume you are making the same proportional 401(k)
contributions from your bonuses as from your base salary):
</P>
<P>
   If you achieve 10 percent average returns from the total
portfolio and maintain the contributions at current levels, you
would have $2,153,415 at age 60, and $3,631,413 at 65. If you
maintain your savings level as a percentage of earnings, the totals
would increase significantly as your earnings increase.
</P>
<P>
   Those additions could be important, because if inflation runs at
an average 3.5 percent for 26 years, the accumulation at age 60
would be the equivalent of a little more than $875,000 in today's
dollars. The projected accumulation for age 65 would be the
equivalent of a little less than $1.5 million in today's dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the lower level, you certainly would have enough to
maintain your current life style _ which I tally as your earnings
less the amount you are now contributing to your retirement savings
_ plus leave yourself a good deal of money to invest to offset the
inflation that is likely to come after retirement.
</P>
<P>
   I have no major problem with your portfolio as it now stands,
but I am unenthusiastic about that $1,000 in Van Eck Global Hard
Assets, a natural resources fund with heavy participation in the
precious metals area. As that fund's 8.61 percent five-year record
shows, such funds tend to produce only mediocre long-term results,
although short-term they can be spectacular. My suggestion would be
to swap that position for the new offering, Franklin Small-Cap
Growth fund.
</P>
<P>
   You might also consider substituting an overseas fund for Janus
Worldwide, provided one is available. As a way to participate in
overseas markets, Janus Worldwide is less than perfect, since about
30 percent of its portfolio consists of large-cap US stocks _
precisely what you are already holding in the Standard and Poor's
Index fund. But if there is no purely international fund available,
I wouldn't worry about it. Janus Worldwide has an excellent record,
so you could just tally your exposure to the overseas markets as 70
percent of whatever the Janus Worldwide position is, and add 30
percent to your large-cap domestic position when judging the
balance of your portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I suggest you use your plan to fully fund Roth IRA
accounts in future years to branch out into some more aggressive
elements for your portfolio. Since the after-tax money that goes
into a Roth account will produce tax-free earnings, the Roth
accounts are where you want to make your most aggressive market
plays. I suggest you use this to establish positions in some sector
funds. For example, I'd begin with Vanguard Health Care fund,
following the next year with Fidelity Select Computer fund. Then
reassess your position, maybe repeating the same pattern in years
three and four.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps by that time some of the froth will have gone out of
Internet stocks, and there might be an offering in that arena that
offers prospects of some big winnings (and some spectacular flops
at this stage). Such investments are riskier than the funds you now
hold, but all of them are in markets with enormous upside
potential. And even though you feel that you haven't made a lot of
progress at age 34 (although I disagree) you're still more than 25
years away from the usual retirement age. Such funds will in all
likelihood provide a bumpy road, but over that very long time frame
they should reward you handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been with the MFS fund family for six years but would
like to get more dividends. For 1999, I got only about $14,000 from
my IRA portfolio. I also am drawing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   J.R., Dana Point, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a fairly tough call. You have a substantial amount in
higher-yielding bond funds: the MFS High Income and the MFS
Strategic Income funds. Transferring from the MFS Government
Security fund to one of those, or to a similar higher-yielding
fund, would increase risk. And moving out of MFS Massachusetts
Investors Trust, your only stock fund, would eliminate the one
element of the portfolio that should keep it growing and
accordingly would offer you some protection against inflation. But
its yield, 0.2 percent, is nearly negligible.
</P>
<P>
   I'd suggest one of two courses:
</P>
<P>
   Cut the Massachusetts Investors position to an even $100,000,
putting the proceeds into the High Income fund, which would net you
an additional $1,787 annually in income.
</P>
<P>
   Or, look to the solid longer-term results of Massachusetts
Investors and decide you could safely withdraw $2,000 a year from
that position, calculating that over time a 1.6 percent annual
withdrawal rate should not seriously dampen the position's ability
to protect you against future inflation.
</P>
<P>
   I'd take the second course.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel you would need still more income, you could probably
draw more from that position, but I would draw the line at about
$3,500, or roughly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it a great risk to roll over our $210,000 in IRAs into an
IRA annuity? The offer, from an insurance company, is 7.65 percent
interest the first year and 6.25 percent in the remaining five
years.
</P>
<P>
   V.H., Chatanooga, Tenn. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The rate being offered is well below what you can get with
CDs. Entering this week, the nation's best rate for five-year CDs
of $100,000 or more was 7.46 percent. Put your IRAs into such CDs,
at the end of the five years you'd have $304,549. If you take the
annuity offer, you would have $290,786 by the end of the fifth
year, and $309,459 at the end of the sixth year. Thus you would
have to achieve only 1.6 percent interest returns in the sixth year
for the CD to tie the annuity. The odds are overwhelming that you
will do a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures, of course, do not reflect the mandatory minimum
withdrawals you will be required to take, but even if those were
calculated, the best bank rate is superior to what this annuity
offers.

BUSH CAMP LOOKS FOR RECONCILIATION WITH MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As George W. Bush and John McCain prepare to meet Tuesday for
the first time since the primaries ended, uncertainty about the
warmth of their tete-a-tete dogs the presumptive Republican nominee
and potentially imperils his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Will Bush be greeted with enthusiasm, as his campaign hopes, or
will McCain continue to treat him with the cool hostility that has
marked their relationship since the South Carolina primary?
</P>
<P>
   One thing seems clear: Both sides agree there will be no
endorsement for the television cameras immediately following the
get-together in Pittsburgh, expected to last an hour. Bush campaign
officials, however, are hoping that the promise of a prime-time
role at the Republican convention in Philadelphia this summer will
nudge McCain along on the path toward reconciliation. And McCain is
expected to endorse Bush's candidacy eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The two camps have been engaged in a delicate dance for weeks.
Aides to Bush called the meeting crucial toward helping the Texas
governor attract independent voters and beat Vice President Al Gore
in November. However, McCain aides have maintained a studied
take-it-or-leave-it indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how many people care about politics right now
anyway,'' said John Weaver, McCain's political director. ``Although
people who committed to John are looking for a signal about where
he is headed and how enthusiastic he will be about the governor. .
. . These initial discussions will help indicate how enthusiastic
he will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and advisers to Bush warned that McCain's conduct will
have as much bearing on his own presidential ambitions as it will
on Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If McCain has any political future, how he handles this is
going to have a lot to say about what future he has,'' said Will
Abbott, a former political director for Bush's father during the
1988 New Hampshire primary. ``If he's an impudent child he has no
future in the Republican Party, and if he's a mature senior member
of the party, he has another crack at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates and campaign staffs have nursed bruised feelings
since dropping all pretense of friendliness following McCain's
lopsided victory in New Hampshire. In South Carolina, the religious
right massed against McCain, passing along rumors of drug addiction
by his wife, a black child in their family, adultery, and an
illegitimate child. Bush ran television ads questioning McCain's
commitment to funding breast cancer research even as McCain's own
sister battles the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, McCain's campaign issued a ``Catholic voter
alert,'' phone calls to Catholic voters telling them of Bush's
visit to Bob Jones University in South Carolina, where students are
prohibited from interracial dating and the pope has been compared
to Satan.
</P>
<P>
   Since McCain dropped out of the race, tensions escalated as Bush
said he had learned nothing from McCain and would change nothing
about his own positions based on McCain's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the Bush campaign considered jobs for a few
members of McCain's team, they were met with total rejection. Even
McCain's bus driver on the ``Straight Talk Express'' refused to
work for Bush despite strong wooing. McCain aides strongly
discouraged the driver, Greg Price, from jumping ship because of
the symbolism his departure would provide. Price is expected to
drive McCain to the Republican convention this summer instead.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush and McCain get together they are expected to talk
about Social Security, education, health care, the military, and
campaign finance reform. McCain's role at the convention will be on
the table, too, and Bush is expected to sound him out about running
for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, has strenuously rejected that idea and is
expected to brush the governor back if the topic is raised.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers are likely to analyze every syllable uttered
by the politicians as they emerge from their meeting, looking for
hidden messages and nuances. And there's no real agreement on
whether strong backing from McCain will bring along his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain's support really isn't transferable,'' said John J.
Pitney, a political scientist at Claremont McKenna College in
California. ``People aren't going to switch their November
preferences based on what John McCain says unless he decides to
become a problem and start criticizing Bush openly.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell M. West, a political science professor at Brown
University, said that while most voters have moved on since the
primaries, a small segment intend to take their cue from McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain has incredible credibility among a certain set of
voters, namely independent swing voters, and they are the voters
Bush needs if he's going to win,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Abbott, a Bush supporter, said the tenor and texture
of McCain's words at this meeting are critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure John McCain would be greatly distressed if George
Bush didn't win the election,'' Abbott said. ``And that's why
anything less than an enthusiastic endorsement would hurt the
party.''

THE NEW YORKER MARKS ITS 75TH, WITH STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New Yorker threw itself a 75th birthday bash over
the weekend and danced fancy all over town.
</P>
<P>
   From Greenwich Village north to Times Square and beyond, it
strutted its stable of writers and poets and cartoonists for
audiences in love with the magazine and the idea of it.
</P>
<P>
   They came from British Columbia and North Carolina and the West
80s and Soho to hear Salman Rushdie and Zadie Smith, the way kids
from the Bay Shore of Long Island line up for Springsteen at the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The large names were here, save V.S. Naipaul, who was lost to
illness, and John Updike, who was holed up in his lair on the North
Shore of Boston, churning out his 600 words a day. The list
dazzled: William Trevor, Muriel Spark, Edna O'Brien, Julian Barnes,
Rushdie and Smith, Richard Ford, E. Annie Proulx, Alice Munro,
Stephen King, Jhumpa Lahiri, Tobias Wolff, Cynthia Ozick, Sherman
Alexie, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Nick Hornby.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just Friday night, when the Yankees beat the
Orioles in a roller coaster up in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Reading The New Yorker tea leaves has long been a pursuit
rivaled perhaps by Cold War Kremlinology. The practice has been
feverish this birthday year, as readers ponder questions like:
</P>
<P>
   Has editor David Remnick brought the magazine back to the center
after a spell out on the warning track under Tina Brown?
</P>
<P>
   Are the cartoons still funny?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a bad thing that John McPhee no longer writes 80,000 words
on the history of the Ping-Pong ball?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, no, and no.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? More interesting was the speculation about the
audiences this weekend. Would they be a hoary bunch pining for a
literary Camelot where people still drink gin and where station
wagons still come with real wood paneling? Would they be gaunt New
York Review of Books types in Birkenstocks? Village people in
fuschia with lip rings? Banana Republic SUV jockeys?
</P>
<P>
   They were, in their splendor, all of the above. Friday night,
when the fiction blitz lit up the city at 8 p.m. in 13 different
spots at once, legations of Prozac Nation in reading glasses were
overwhelmed by strange and wondrous urban creatures in Doc Martens
and dreadlocks who floated through the first tropical night of the
year like lightning bugs. Score one for youth.
</P>
<P>
   The arteries hardened on Saturday, when the theater critic John
Lahr talked in the hush of the Morgan Library about Noel Coward to
a crowd whose average age was 60, by his own estimate. And over on
Seventh Avenue, Adam Gopnik spoke about the magazine's most
brilliant artist, Saul Steinberg, to an audience with a 50-year
spread. (Gopnik reported that Steinberg once had told him, ``First
grade is a shock from which we never recover.'')
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a smorgasbord or a nightmare, depending on your
energy level. Charles Gates interviewed UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, Calvin Trillin waxed on about humor, Remnick queried Paul
Simon about songwriting, outlaw singer/songwriter Steve Earle
played some new tunes. Then there were the panels _ on the
Internet, presidential politics, medicine, journalism, and young
writers.
</P>
<P>
   The options were as exhausting as was the logistical challenge
of trying to get to them, on a day of steamy temperatures and
Midtown gridlock from the throngs paying their respects to the late
Cardinal John O'Connor, who lay in state at St. Patrick's
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this chaos, the ill-fated New Yorker bus tour of
Manhattan's landmark buildings, led by the architecture critic Paul
Goldberger, departed its perch by Saks Fifth Avenue, a festival
sponsor that featured blow-ups of New Yorker cartoons in its
windows.
</P>
<P>
   This jaunt was not for the faint of heart. The double-decker bus
secured by the magazine had itsy-bitsy windows and no air
conditioning. The heat inside surely rivaled the innards of a
Sherman tank in a firefight with Rommel somewhere near Tobruk.
</P>
<P>
   And with the roof squarely in place, riders could gaze at the
first five stories of the skyscrapers whose hallowed spires
Goldberger described in detail _ while the vehicle remained stuck
in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time that the birthday bash acquired the feel
of a forced march. Springtime in New York be damned, cabs suddenly
looked swell and a nap better than sex. Culture can be a brutal
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who could get a ticket rallied that evening for the
humor review at Town Hall. Playwright Wendy Wasserstein adapted
some of the wittiest writing from the magazine's 75 years. Swoosie
Kurtz, Alec Baldwin, Buck Henry, and Christopher Durang then read
the material with panache on stage. Some of it flopped, but most
was priceless.
</P>
<P>
   There was James Thurber's ``Mr. Preble Gets Rid of His Wife'' _
(``Let's go down to the cellar.''); Robert Benchley's
``Questionnaire'' _ (``What are English actors saying?''); Andy
Borowitz's ``Emily Dickinson: The Jerk of Amherst'' _ (``Writing
poetry beats stealing cars.''). Ian Frazier envisioned Samuel
Beckett as an airplane pilot _ (``You are now free to move about
the cabin and hang yourselves.'')
</P>
<P>
   The events continued like rolling thunder Sunday, when the
brunches took place. There were eight of them, on subjects ranging
from cartoons to war, from jazz to crime. The cartoon gang, led by
Robert Mankoff and Roz Chast, assembled in the cafe on the eighth
floor of Saks Fifth Avenue, which offered a fabulous view of the
secret gardens of Rockefeller Center high above street level.
</P>
<P>
   All moaned good-naturedly about the magazine fact-checkers,
famous for their diligence with cartoons as well as text. Charles
Barsotti recalled being queried if a hot dog has 17 grams of fat in
it after one of his offerings included a wiener.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoonists finally provided faces to go with their storied
names. They also provided the delicious thrill of walking across
the ground floor of the store on a Sunday morning, when it is
closed to the public and free of all those women of a certain age
spritzing perfume atomizers at you like ray guns.
</P>
<P>
   By the the end of the weekend, it was clear that the hagiography
around the ancien regime under the late William Shawn, the
secretive mandarin who edited the magazine for more than three
decades, is fading. Which is fine with Remnick, who became the
editor of the magazine at the absurdly young age of 39 less than
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Yorker is not a museum, and I am not a curator,'' he
said last week in his office on the 20th floor of the Conde Nast
Building. Remnick pointed to the photos on the wall of his office
of two dead New Yorker icons, A.J. Liebling and Joseph Mitchell,
and said, ``I worshiped them, but they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, will be the readership frozen in the same amber. The
demographics demand an infusion of young New Yorker readers. ``I am
not an ancient,'' he said, stating the obvious. It is no surprise
that Remnick publishes young authors like Jhumpa Lahiri and Zadie
Smith and pays close attention to popular music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Yorker was great on Vietnam,'' he noted. ``But it
missed the Beatles. It missed rock and roll for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet such lapses won't happen on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   If Shawn was a god to many, he was a martinet to others.
Rushdie, for one, does not miss his magazine for an obvious reason.
``I couldn't get published in The New Yorker of Mr. Shawn,'' he
said Friday night at the Public Theater. Shawn rejected Rushdie's
first story, he recalled, saying, ``We don't publish pastiches.''
</P>
<P>
   But such eddies are lost in the broad flow of The New Yorker's
history. Rushdie is now part of the family, whose breadth and
vitality were evident along with its genealogy. If the bash was
uneven and solipsistic, it was nonetheless unlike anything else in
recent memory in this city. To paraphrase the PBS fund-raising
television spot, if not The New Yorker, who?
</P>
<P>
   The festival closed with a dozen of the magazine's finest poets
reading from their works in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public
Library. The lawn was full of hundreds of listeners who withstood
the fetid late-afternoon air to hear the likes of Philip Levine,
Charles Simic, and Louise Gluck read to the city. The turnout was
grand for the hometown magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The only missing element was the French aerialist who was to
have walked on a high wire above the crowd. But city officials
denied The New Yorker the necessary permit. The cowards.

50 YEARS AFTER ``PEYTON PLACE,'' CAMDEN, MAINE CELEBRATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, Maine _ When Barbara Dyer heard in 1957 that the film
version of ``Peyton Place'' was going to be shot in Camden, alarm
bells rang in her head.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the quaint New England town of Woodstock, Vt., had
coldly refused to associate itself with Grace Metalious' scandalous
novel. The quaint Maine towns of Wiscasset, Skowhegan and
Waterville were abuzz, weighing the promised income against the
danger of moral decay. Even the newspaper editor in Lewiston, a
town not quaint enough to make the director's short list, offered
his lofty two cents: ``We somewhat doubt,'' he wrote, ``if even the
broad-minded people of any Maine town would want it known as the
vicarious locale of such purposeless goings-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, who had read three pages of the novel before putting it
down in shock and disgust, heard the news and saw only disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   So it is ironic that, at the age of 75 and now the town
historian, Dyer helps to celebrate ``Peyton Place'' in a spirit of
playful 1950s nostalgia. Last weekend, as part of a film festival
on the theme ``Small Towns, Steamy Movies,'' Camden hosted fans of
the seminal small-town melodrama, walking them through Allison
McKenzie's sexual awakening, Selena Cross's pregnancy by her
stepfather and Betty Anderson's tenure as a parking lot siren. Dyer
is the first to admit it: Episodes that, in 1957, seemed to drill
into the marrow of human decency now seem almost quaint.
</P>
<P>
   But time has not entirely softened the story of ``Peyton
Place.'' Behind the weekend fun was the grim true experience of
Metalious, whose life was wrecked by the book she wrote. A lifelong
New Hampshirite from a poor Franco-American family, Metalious
declared war on Yankee New England with her first novel. The sex
scenes that titillated a nation were only the most obvious
transgression; behind every door in her fictional town lay an ugly
secret _ whether it be ethnic hatred, Doc Swain's abortion
services, the town fathers' desire to wipe poor families off the
map, or the everyday malice leveled at individuals who broke the
community's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Metalious's portrait of small-town life gave New England the
treatment usually reserved for the South. ``To the tourists,''
Metalious told one reporter, ``these towns look as peaceful as a
picture postcard, but if you go beneath the picture it's like
turning over a rock with your foot. All kinds of strange things
crawl out.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like that did not go unpunished. As ``Peyton Place'' broke
records in the publishing world _ it sat at No. 1 on the New York
Times's best-seller list for 59 weeks _ New England reviewers,
librarians and schoolteachers vilified Metalious and her book.
Camden's library did not stock ``Peyton Place'' when Mike Robson
decided to film the movie there; neither did the library in
Gilmanton, N.H., where Metalious lived, until Barbara Walters
donated one on a visit.
</P>
<P>
   But what got to Metalious was the personal snubbing, said Ardis
Cameron, a University of Southern Maine professor who uses ``Peyton
Place'' to teach social commentary in her New England Studies
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like she had an `A' on her,'' said Melissa Preston, 44,
who grew up in Gilmanton and now works at the Chamber of Commerce
in Camden. ``In New England, you shun something that is morally
wrong in your eyes. It affects your family to be seen with that
person.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was with Metalious, who was 32 when ``Peyton Place'' was
published: She was shunned, according to her friends and
biographers, as painfully as any character in her book. In
Gilmanton, people ostracized her children and crossed the street to
avoid her, said her then-husband, George Metalious. Once, flush
with her new success, Metalious invited all the town's citizens to
stay with her at the Plaza in New York, and none of them accepted,
Cameron said. When the film ``Peyton Place'' premiered in Camden to
great fanfare, Maine resident Bette Davis was on hand, but
Metalious was not.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Metalious about it, she said she was not
invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people thought Grace was a trashy person,'' said Emily
Toth, a professor at Louisiana State University who published
``Inside Peyton Place,'' a biography of Metalious, in 1981. ``I
remember sitting in a library in Laconia and local citizens would
say things like, `If you found out the truth about her it would
really curl your hair.' There was a way in which they were still
mad at her.''
</P>
<P>
   In her peculiar isolation, Metalious began to drink heavily.
Near the end, she ate almost nothing but big salads at night time,
Toth said.
</P>
<P>
   Metalious died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1964, at age 39,
seven years after her blockbuster success. According to Frances
Hugelman, 84, who lives in Metalious's old house, there was a
sincere attempt by some citizens of Gilmanton to prevent her being
buried in the town cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   When tourists asked to see Metalious's grave, Preston recalled,
townspeople ``wouldn't even show them where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But the events in Camden have a gentle, nostalgic tone, geared
less toward revisionist historians than film buffs such as Frank
Anzalone.
</P>
<P>
   For Anzalone, a Philadelphia stage director who was a boy when
the movie was released, the lush technicolor and hectic embraces of
``Peyton Place'' preserve the delicious appeal of the forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about an innocent time, and about sex being verboten,''
he said. ``There's a fascination with that, because we've certainly
gone the other route. If you look around, there is no innocence
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie that came out of Camden was far less disturbing than
Metalious's book, substituting a miscarriage for Selena Cross's
abortion, excising racist and ethnic ugliness and toning down a
host of seething sexual issues involving parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s television series ``Peyton Place'' was even more
benign, removing Selena Cross and Doc Swain from the scene
altogether. When the Camden Herald's editors defended their stance
in favor of allowing the filming, they made it clear that they had
little respect for the novel: ``It is a sorry day,'' they wrote,
``when the people of a state as steeped in freedom as Vermont or
the editors as conscientious as the (Lewiston) Sun argue against
the making of a movie because the book it is based on is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The gamble paid off for Camden, a sparkling coastal town where
the balance had been shifting from industry to tourism for many
years. Although Camden had long drawn wealthy summer people, the
movie's lush scenery helped establish ``leaf-peeping'' as a
middle-class pastime, said Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, fans of the movie trickled in, and it became
clear that Camden's potential scandal had grown into a legitimate
tourist attraction culminating in the weekend festival, which was
complete with a re-creation of Allison McKenzie's Prom Night and
appearances by two of the film's actors.
</P>
<P>
   But New Englanders are still prepared to debate whether
Metalious drew an accurate picture of small-town life. One elderly
resident recalled moving to Camden a few years after the film came
out and expressing disgust at the film's depiction of a town full
of malicious gossip and dark secrets. Overhearing her comment, an
elegant older neighbor took her aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear, talk to me after you've lived here long enough to
know your neighbors a little better,'' she said. ``We'll see what
you think then.''

SOME LEGENDARY ACADEMICS, UP CLOSE

THE DONS 
Mentors, Eccentrics and Geniuses 
By Noel Annan. University of Chicago Press. 357 pp. Illustrated.
$30. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before there were playing fields at Eton, the British had
raised insiderdom to an art form. In the last century, it had few
finer practitioners than Noel Annan, who died in February at age
83. An insider's insider, he was to the British Establishment what
Olivier and Richardson were to the West End.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of King's College, Cambridge, Annan was a
military-intelligence officer during World War II. He returned to
King's as a fellow, then provost. He later was provost at
University College, London, then became vice chancellor of the
University of London. He was president of the London Library and
served on the boards of the British Museum, National Gallery, and
Royal Opera. Annan also chaired the government committee on the
future of broadcasting that led to the creation of Britain's
Channel 4. For these and numerous other accomplishments, he was
made an officer of the Order of the British Empire, and a Labour
government (Annan wasn't a complete insider) elevated him to the
House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   His academic specialty was intellectual history. Such books as
his study of Leslie Stephen, the 19th-century man of letters who
was Virginia Woolf's father, and ``Our Age,'' Annan's magisterial
examination of the cultural impact of the generation that came of
age between the two world wars, combine a wonderfully vigorous
prose style with a dauntingly encyclopedic knowledge. Not only did
Annan know everyone that mattered (or so it could seem to readers
of his many New York Review of Books articles, wherein his dropping
of names was simply the pursuit of footnoting by other means). He
could also give the impression of knowing everything that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to conceive of anyone better situated to write a book
like ``The Dons,'' Annan's highly affectionate yet by no means
worshipful look at some of the more remarkable academic personages
to distinguish _ and sometimes dumbfound _ Oxford and Cambridge
over the past two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Annan makes no claim to be comprehensive. These are simply the
men _ and a few women _ who seem to him representative,
particularly interesting, or (in several instances) of whom he was
personally fond. Some are famous, such as John Henry Newman;
Benjamin Jowett, the translator of Plato; or the physicists J. J.
Thomson and Ernest Rutherford. Others claim a narrower renown, such
as Maurice Bowra and Isaiah Berlin. A few would seem to be included
as much for their oddities as anything else. There is, for example,
the Cambridge historian Oscar Browning, who upon seeing the
incumbent poet laureate eagerly introduced himself: ``Hello
Tennyson. I'm Browning.'' (Lord Alfred replied, ``No, you're
not.'') Or there was the Cambridge classicist of whom a college
master complained, ``What time he can spare from the adornment of
his person he devotes to the neglect of his duties.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that it cherishes eccentricity and abounds in Oxbridge
gossip, ``The Dons'' is at heart a deeply serious book, one
dedicated to a conception of learning and culture that is at once
increasingly rare (on both sides of the Atlantic) yet very far from
being outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities,'' Annan writes, ``should hold up for admiration
the intellectual life. The most precious gift they have to offer is
to live and work among books or in laboratories and to enable the
young to see those rare scholars who have put on one side the world
of material success, both in and outside the university, in order
to study with single-minded devotion some topic because that above
all seems important to them. A university is dead if the dons
cannot in some way communicate to the students the struggle _ and
the disappointments as well as the triumphs in that struggle _ to
produce out of the chaos of human experience some grain of order
won by the intellect. That is the end to which all the arrangements
of the university should be directed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dons'' concludes with Annan's celebrated 1956 essay, ``The
Intellectual Aristocracy,'' a fitting coda to a book from a man who
so clearly belonged at the fore of any such body.

FABLE OF LUTENIST STRIKES A HOLLOW NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AMY GRAVES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
MUSIC AND SILENCE 
By Rose Tremain 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, 485 pp., $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year is 1629, the hero plays the lute in the royal orchestra
of King Christian IV of Denmark, and the plot is simple: He's about
to fall in love. Will he get the girl?
</P>
<P>
   You have to wait almost 400 pages to find out, and what happens
in between doesn't fit neatly into any category. Billed as
historical fiction, Rose Tremain's ``Music and Silence'' is
anything but.
</P>
<P>
   It's a romance novel that happens to be set in a long-ago time.
Or it's fable _ a sad king struggles to save his country from debt
and himself from his adulterous second wife; the lutenist loves a
young girl who's lost her chief protector with the death of her
mother; and a countess's husband goes mad trying to remember a song
he's heard only in his dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Fables are supposed to teach us something. The book promises
enlightenment early on: As one attendant to King Christian's wife
tells another, ``a fable can awaken the mind to the truth of what
it perceives in the daily world.'' Tremain offers us familiar fairy
tales about growing up and making your way in the world; her story
of the boy made king before he's old enough to assume power is
engaging, if a little old hat.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, though, it's a false hope. This book teaches us
little beyond the value of plot. The characters are flat and their
actions predictable. If you read on, it's to see how Tremain works
it all out. With few exceptions, the characters are either entirely
good or entirely wicked. The wicked ones are amusing; the good ones
are pathetic and boring.
</P>
<P>
   Take the lutenist, Peter Claire. His angelic good looks and
perfect playing are dull enough. On top of this, the reader must
struggle with incredulity: One minute he's recovering from the loss
of a lover, the Italian-born Countess O'Fingal, and the next he's
in thrall to Emilia, a motherless child he's just met who proves
the opposite of the brave, mature countess in every way.
</P>
<P>
   Growing old is no fun in ``Music and Silence.'' The most nuanced
character, King Christian, starts out as a boy who sees the world
``not as it was, but as his mind reconstituted it,'' a brave and
benevolent soul who puts a forger to work as a royal printer,
rather than sentencing him to death, out of admiration for his
skill. From this promising start he's reduced to begging gold from
his mother to finance work on a silver mine in Norway, so he can
save Denmark from financial ruin.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest women in the book _ the countess and the king's
second wife, Kirsten _ never get what they want, though Tremain
seems determined to pair everyone else off. Kirsten is the one
truly memorable character, if only because she's painted in
hilarious extremes, especially in her journal entries, which are
peppered with unnecessary capitalization and passages betraying her
complete lack of self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   She's punished for her sins. Not only divorced by the king,
she's abandoned by everyone except her servants: ``I find myself in
a house of Shadows with only the Furniture to talk to, but even
this . . . seems to have risen up against me. Worst and rudest of
these Things are the Mirrors on the walls. Whenver I pass by one,
it contrives to Distort me, so that instead of seeing myself as I
am . . . what I am shown is a Scowling and Plump Object that I do
not recognize at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Tremain has written at least one highly praised work of
historical fiction, ``Restoration,'' about Charles II and the
return of royal rule to England. ``Music and Silence'' does not
measure up to that standard. It offers much drama and stunning
cruelty, but little insight into the human condition of any time.

WHITNEY'S THE SALON TALK OF THE TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My daughter wanted to know if it was true that Whitney Houston
is addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   I told her I didn't know, but I hope not.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the look of concern on her face as she asked the
question, it occurred to me how involved we can become in the lives
of people we only read about in newspaper headlines, see on
television and in the movies, or in magazine photographs.
</P>
<P>
   We talk about them as if they were our best friends or next-door
neighbors or both. We laugh at them and with them. We criticize
them and we mourn when they die.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Vivian Thorne, owner of Vivian's Healthy Hair, during
a recent conversation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whitney had put the old boy out so when he went on Jay Leno,
she called up Jay Leno and told him to put Bobby (Brown) on the
phone. Girl, Whitney told Bobby to come on back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Laughter filled the salon and everybody in the know _ that
wouldn't include me _ knew the punch line: Brown (Houston's
husband) had the goods on Whitney, Vivian said, and she wanted to
keep him quiet.
</P>
<P>
   I won't say what the goods are for two reasons: They're too
risque and it wouldn't be right to spread rumors or allegations
that very well may be false.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, it's Saturday morning and Vivian is on a roll even
though she passes on the doughnuts and coffee she's doling out to
her sleepy clients.
</P>
<P>
   She moves breathlessly from Whitney to Luther Vandross back to
Whitney to Oprah _ laughter spewing from every other word _ until I
finally ask Vivian, ``Where do you get all that stuff? The National
Inquirer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, that's salon talk,'' she says, as if that makes it more
credible.
</P>
<P>
   While ``salon talk'' isn't necessarily based in fact, it
occurred to me much later how easily it is passed on as such.
</P>
<P>
   In a lot of ways, salon talk is a substitute for the
conversations we used to have over the backyard fence, when life
was simpler and we had time to stop and talk, share recipes,
discuss what the children were doing, find out who'd given birth,
who died or who just got married.
</P>
<P>
   And when you're in the salon _ unless you're dozing under a hot
dryer _ that's what you do. The magazines and books are in your lap
only as props. After all, not everyone _ especially the few with
the Bibles and motivational books _ want it known that they'd
willingly participate in idle gossip, which is what salon talk
amounts to most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to say this is all bad. Sometimes we actually talk
about things that are important, in which case salon talk becomes a
way to exhale, to unwind and unload about work, the children, the
husband and life in general.
</P>
<P>
   That itself makes salon talk not just important but necessary.
It's like therapy without the big bill, confession without the
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   I don't feel like a moral failure for listening, for instance,
to unsubstantiated allegations about Whitney Houston or about
Luther Vandross' lifestyle. I don't feel as though I am backsliding
because I find the comedy in it all strangely uplifting.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's nothing funny about some of the gossip we
hear about celebrities _ who they're sleeping with, who they marry,
and their personal habits. But it occurred to me that a reason our
lives seem so entangled with theirs is that they have ascended to a
place we'd like to be but will never reach, and because they
reflect the dark places in our own lives.

THE BARD IN THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE FOSTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Two weeks before previews, Slobodan Unkovski
doesn't know how he's going to end ``The Winter's Tale,'' which he
is directing for the American Repertory Theatre. It doesn't concern
him much; he's used to working this way. And it doesn't seem to
concern the actors, who have learned to love his intuitive,
collaborative style and trust that he _ and they _ will work it
out.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why Unkovski might be a little uneasy over the
ending. ``The Winter's Tale,'' one of Shakespeare's last works, is
a play both beautiful and difficult. It's usually viewed as a tale
of reconciliation after a raft of tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   What happens is this: When King Leontes gets suddenly and wildly
jealous over the attention his wife, Hermione, is paying to their
guest, his best friend, Polixenes, it sets in motion a series of
terrible events. Going from zero in nothing flat, he sends
Hermione, who is pregnant, to prison. Then he orders their newborn
daughter to be taken into exile and abandoned. His young son dies.
And just at the point where he finds out he's wrong, he's told that
Hermione is dead. He spends the next 16 years paying for his
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Even though at the end he is restored to his daughter and,
seemingly magically, to his wife, how do you get a truly happy
resolution out of all that tragedy? Is a modern audience going to
believe that a woman will easily forgive a man whose jealousy
wreaked such havoc with her life? Can this marriage be saved? That
is the problem this director is trying to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare is terse with the details: There is a reference to
Hermione embracing her husband. Other than that, it's not clear.
And Unkovski is mulling over what to make of that. ``At the end,
the short speech of the queen doesn't mention the king, just her
daughter. And Leontes just says, `Let's go, we have to talk.'
There's no real happy ending.''
</P>
<P>
   He sits at a gateleg table in ART's apartment in Harvard Square
and mulls over the problem. ``I'm not going to help the people
forgive him and forget the mistake that he did at the beginning of
the play. At the end of the play, there will probably not be a
reconciliation. There are so many dead people, so many shadows and
ghosts onstage. There's no way of having a new beginning. The
things that happen are so terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirjana Jokovic, who plays Hermione, says the actors spent some
time talking about the question of forgiveness. ``I think
Hermione's always being pictured as an idealistic woman who is
capable of forgiving everything. But I think in our case, it's
about trying to face another reality: Is it too late for
forgiveness? What would forgiveness bring?
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she forgive Leontes? I don't think so. I don't think she
has anger and bitterness toward him, it's more of a question of her
being noble . . . and living with that curse of what happened to
her.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
What colors his outlook &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That the production is taking such a dark view may have
something to do with the fact that Unkovski is from Macedonia, one
of the republics of the former Yugoslavia. It was one of the
countries to which hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians fled
when expelled from Kosovo by the Serbs. His wife, a psychologist,
treated many of the refugees, as well as the Macedonians who opened
their homes to them. While this play is not being actively seen
through the lens of that strife, he says it no doubt colors his
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my plays connect with my life,'' he says. ``It's not just
a professional execution of a play. In the last 10 years, my work,
especially my work in the US, has been about trying to articulate a
silent scream about the Balkans.'' He staged ``Peer Gynt'' at the
beginning of the Slovenian war in 1991. His production of Dejan
Dukovski's ``The Powder Keg'' (``the first real excellent analysis
of the developing atrocities in the former Yugoslavia,'' he says)
toured to more than 30 theaters across Europe. And from 1996 to
1998, he took time out from directing to be Macedonia's minister of
culture. Currently he is professor of drama at the University of
Skopje in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   While Jokovic is also from the former Yugoslavia, and the set
director, Meta Hocevar, is from Slovenia, Unkovski gently
pooh-poohs the notion that they are a troika intent on stamping a
uniquely Balkan perspective on the production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mirjana has acted nine years in the States. And Slovenia is
more likely to be part of Europe soon. I am the only one who is
coming from the Balkans. But I feel myself to be something of a
citizen of the world. I live and work there, but feel that
Macedonian culture gave so much to the world over the centuries
that it is more important than the terrible things that happened in
the Balkans in the last 50-100 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Unkovski came to the United States in 1987 as a visiting
Fulbright Scholar at the City University of New York. He last
worked for ART 10 years ago when he directed ``The Caucasian Chalk
Circle.'' He's been in touch with artistic director Robert Brustein
ever since. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Like coming home'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I sent a letter (to Brustein) proposing a play for the next
season, to be taken from a novel, (MIT professor and playwright)
Alan Lightman's `Einstein's Dreams.' Bob said he already had the
season and suggested I do ``Winter's Tale.'' So I read the play
again. I thought I could find a good approach and sent them some
ideas. They liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   So after 10 years, he's back in Cambridge again. ``It was like
coming home. It's really beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the serious wrestling over the meaning of the play,
there's a sense of lightness and expansiveness in a rehearsal that
the actors say is typical of the whole process. In the church
basement that the company uses as a rehearsal space, a trio of
actors exits running giddily and whipping each other around in a
line. Karen MacDonald, who plays Paulina, starts a speech straight
and then throws in a Texas accent for the last line. Thomas Derrah,
who plays the pickpocket Autolycus, in the comedic section (yes,
there is funny stuff in this play!), merely has to walk across the
stage in a floppy beige coat and he gets snickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unka (the cast's nickname for Unkovski) likes to have fun in
rehearsals; that's rare. He likes people to enjoy themselves,''
says John Douglas Thompson, who plays Polixenes, the boyhood friend
of Leontes, and the king of Bohemia. ``What's unique about him is
everything doesn't need to be dark. He makes it possible to have
fun with the play and experience it to its fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Woronicz, who plays Leontes, concurs: ``We're working very
loose, we throw things out in terms of his ideas, use lots of
imagination. He has a lovely sense of humor and encourages us to
look at things differently.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Opposite kingdoms &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While much may be in flux up until previews start on May 12, one
thing that is established is that the two kingdoms in the play,
Sicilia and Bohemia, are diametrically opposed to each other in
mood and style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sicilian side will be something very cold, rigid, with
sudden emotions,'' explains Unkovski. ``It will be based on some
kind of lost rationality. Sicilia, of course, is Sicily. But
Bohemia in the script doesn't match up to any particular country
nearby that has a coastline. So it's a made-up place. It will be
some place like North Africa, Morocco, different in culture and
habits. Bohemia will be something very warm, cool (as in hip, not
temperature), relaxed, and it will be based mostly on emotions:
love, joy, happinesss. So you'll have collisions between two
different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The costumes will reflect this division: Those for Sicilia are
dark and confining, Bohemia's are light and fluid. And while
Unkovski steers clear of describing the sets (to not spoil the
surprise), in rehearsal the actors in a Bohemia scene were walking
on swaths of brilliantly colored fabric streaming across the long
room.
</P>
<P>
   A page from Bohemia makes a whooping cry as he enters. He sounds
like Tarzan. But Woronicz advised a reporter to not think that's
cast in stone. All is subject to change, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Is that true about the ending as well? Sure, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be about forgiveness by the time the play goes up.''

THE HUMAN STAIN 
By Philip Roth. Houghton Mifflin. 361 pp. $26. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his 40-year probe of the national psyche, Philip Roth has
hardly been bashful about putting his own consciousness under
scrutiny. Manic-expressive and sometimes dazzling to a fault, the
man has taken us on whirlwind expeditions through sex, death,
politics, and morality _ delivering, while he was at it, the modern
Jewish condition as well as half the continent of human neurosis.
Irony has been his cover but truth has been his point; revelation,
it seems, is a dish best served bittersweet. Toward this
not-always-noble end, he has let his alter ego, Nathan Zuckerman,
take most of the heat. If America itself, in all its vastness,
power, and madness, has been Roth's Lear, then Zuckerman,
insistently, has got to play the Fool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Human Stain'' is the end of a thematically linked trilogy
that began with the powerhouse beauty of ``American Pastoral,''
then stumbled badly through the vitriolic detours of ``I Married a
Communist.'' This last installment rights the edifice again, for
Roth has taken the classical underpinnings of ``American Pastoral''
and given us their shadowy counterpart _ a tragedy with shades of
Euripides and Shakespeare, set in the pseudo-pastoral confines of a
liberal arts college in the Berkshires. By rendering the downfall
of a good man _ a life cut short by hubris, secrecy, and human
folly _ Roth has given us a story of ancient dimension. By calling
his campus Athena College and by making his Delphic Oracle a saucy
little deconstructionist named Delphine Roux, he has made it,
inimitably, a modern novel of wickedly Rothian proportion.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not the comic cruelty of, say, ``Sabbath's
Theatre,'' where Roth seemed to delight in Rabelaisian perils; nor
is Zuckerman off on one of his solipsistic footraces. Instead ``The
Human Stain'' is the sad and complex tale of Coleman Silk, an aged
classicist, and the choices he made and the ones he didn't _ the
road map of regret and indecision waiting for everyone who lives
long enough to earn the courage of hindsight. After devoting most
of his adult life to Sophocles and Homer _ to teaching half-formed
innocents that the world is full of strife, betrayal, beauty, and
murder _ Silk finds himself the fall guy in a classroom
misunderstanding of ludicrous proportion. Casting about for a
couple of absent students at the beginning of term, he refers to
them, in the ghostly sense, as ``spooks'' _ only later discovering,
upon being charged with making a racial slur, that the students are
black.
</P>
<P>
   This mare's nest sets the stage for Silk's estrangement and
eventual undoing; the young professors that he, as faculty dean,
had hired to upgrade Athena are of little use or loyalty when it
comes to defending the old (read: white male) guard, and he leaves
the college in an outrage. When Zuckerman meets him in summer 1998,
Coleman has been retired without honor for two years; he has buried
his wife, Iris (a casualty, he believes, of the scandal), and is
living in isolation in the old farmhouse in Western Massachusetts
where they raised four children. Well, near isolation: At 71,
virile and furious and still shadow-boxing with the specters of his
decline, he has taken up with a 34-year-old woman, Faunia Farley,
who works at Athena as a janitor, a woman apparently illiterate and
with a horrendous history of abuse and bad luck. When she and
Coleman find each other, it is a connection of immediacy and
honesty: They are neither one worried, at this point in life, about
what they have to lose.
</P>
<P>
   And Zuckerman, our town crier, is the equally isolated
neighbor-author whom Coleman befriends _ the wide-angle lens
through which we will view this story of the Professor Unbound.
We're introduced to Coleman and his past as one of the first Jews
invited into the patrician realm of classical studies; he has come
to Athena by way of NYU (and East Orange, N.J.) and breathed a
formidable new vitality into the college. Through a series of
crosscutting narratives and perspectives, the story of Coleman's
early years unfolds: the girls he loved and the boxing career he
barely sidestepped; the father who gave him perfect diction and
what he called ``the language of Chaucer, Shakespeare, and
Dickens.'' The child of humble roots _ his father an optician who
failed in the Depression, then a dining-car waiter; his mother a
nurse _ Coleman began a path of upward and outward mobility like
those of a million midcentury sons and daughters trying to make
their way in the world. But his own journey away from the past, his
effort to be ``just on his own and free,'' had a singular grief and
treachery at its center. And no amount of classical understanding _
of a life spent with the great tragedies of literature _ has been
able to lessen the wrenching effects of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Human Stain'' draws its title from an observation by
Faunia, whose weary rejection of bourgeois civilization has not
kept her from understanding one of Coleman's precious truths: that
humanity leaves its mark (of rage, desire, or both) on everything
in its wake, whether you see it as an imprint or a scar. It also
alludes to the central tragedy of this novel, which I've been loath
to reveal but which every other reviewer in America seems hellbent
on disclosing. Suffice it to say that Roth has invented a story of
exquisite personal suffering that resonates with the larger
upheavals of history _ where the sins of the children, it turns
out, are visited on generations before and since (see accompanying
story).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Faunia had seen her share of trouble before Coleman
arrived, the most recent miseries inflicted by her former husband,
Les Farley, who came back after his second tour in Vietnam poised
far more for violence than for domesticity. Carrying here all the
rage of Achilles with precious little of the spoils, Farley is a
triumph of a creation, and it's testament to Roth's empathic skills
that the author was able to envision him. Now a heat-seeking
missile, Farley is reduced to the quivering sum of his fears in a
Chinese restaurant _ an agonizing scene of sauteed pork and
post-traumatic stress disorder and simply magnificent realism. In a
novel laden with depth of character and narrative insights, Roth
has managed to make a terrifying, hardly heroic man far less
terrifying than what befell him.
</P>
<P>
   Having stumbled upon a splendid lot of characters, all with
their own driving mysteries, Zuckerman has the good sense to stay
out of their way, but for a few stretches of long-winded
pontification. He is instead the melancholy vast intelligence and
narrative momentum of this story, which belongs to the tragic cast
upon the stage, their sorrows inevitably linked, then revealed, in
death. There are typically Rothian etchings along the way: that
Delphic theorist, clutching her Julia Kristeva and hiding her
all-too-human yearnings; Coleman's sister, Ernestine, who shows up
near the end of the novel to bestow it with grace. And there's a
laconic moment of stunning tenderness in a foxtrot on the porch of
Coleman's home _ Coleman and Zuckerman! _ which paves the way for
the unstrained mercy that must accompany this story. Finally, there
is Coleman Silk himself _ the confused and heartsore counterpart to
the Swede of ``American Pastoral,'' each man following out his
story of serendipity, private agony, and doom. Each man something
more, too: a wounded summation of all the deceits, love songs, and
little murders that make up the great American mythology.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SIDEBAR: THE PLOT THICKENS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The great secret Coleman Silk has spent a lifetime protecting is
that he is a light-skinned black passing as a Jew. Roth's unveiling
of this central mystery _ why Coleman made the choice and what it
cost him _ is extraordinary, both in its eloquent comprehension of
the act and in its structural grace within the novel. Growing up as
a firecracker-talented black kid (and high school valedictorian) in
a predominantly Jewish neighborhood in the 1940s, Coleman slips
sideways into this dangerous territory of Self sacrifice: First he
is mistaken for being Jewish; then, upon the death of his father
(and his subsequent encounters, as a young man, with a racist
society), he dares to glance toward that unknown territory where
all things seem possible. Barely shy of his 18th birthday, he lies
about his age on a Navy enlistment form _ and then realizes that,
with the mark of a pen, he can change his race as well. By the time
he emerges in the free-form Greenwich Village of the postwar years,
the lie is set. And Coleman is carrying a concealed weapon that
will protect and threaten him for the rest of his days.
</P>
<P>
   It has been tempting for some to draw a parallel between Roth's
subject and the late New York Times critic Anatole Broyard, whose
bohemian life in mid-century New York mirrored some of Coleman's
here. But the comparison, which packages an age-old story in an au
courant frame, only goes so far. While Roth has made Coleman's
heartrending duplicity the subtle center of his novel, it is not
simply a story about passing. Instead it traces one of the great,
treacherous undercurrents of American literature: The same idea of
reinvention that drove Dreiser's Clyde Griffith and Fitzgerald's
Jay Gatsby. And like Gatsby's Nick Carraway, like Ahab's Ishmael,
Zuckerman alone has lived to tell the tale: ``I did no more than
find a friend,'' he tells us near the beginning of his story, ``and
all the world's malice came rushing in.''

SOMETHING ELSE DISTURBING ABOUT `AMERICAN BEAUTY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``American Beauty'' _ I know it dominated the
Oscars with Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Practically Everything
but there's something disturbing about this comic indictment of
American middle class morality. And it's not the theme. David
Lynch's ``Blue Velvet,'' which deals with some of the same sexual
darkness, was deeper and darker and funnier. It's the attitude
that's akew. I may be wrong about this but the whole tone of the
movie was patronizing toward the characters and condescending to
the audience. It's as if a bunch of Hollywood insiders decided to
take a few broad pot shots at middle America and couldn't contain
their giggling superiority.
</P>
<P>
   NEW ON DVD: Fans of Sherlock Holmes can rejoice with the release
on Tuesday of ``An Evening With Sherlock Holmes.'' Actually, it
should be titled several evenings because this boxed set contains
four movies _ ``Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon'' (1942),
``Woman In Green'' (1945), ``Terror By Night'' (1946) and ``Dressed
To Kill'' (1946). And that's not all. It also includes an interview
with Holmes creator Sir Arthur Conan Doyle filmed in 1927 and 30
original radio broadcasts starring the film's leads, Basil Rathbone
and Nigel Bruce. The complete set is available for a retail price
of $69.95.

THE PEOPLE SPEAK, AND THEY ACTUALLY AGREE WITH ME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not used to this. To praise, I mean.
</P>
<P>
   My mail, e-mail and phone messages usually run overwhelmingly in
favor of the widespread point of view that I'm an idiot. Some of
these messages are so mean and obscene that I can't even get all
the way through them without hitting the delete key or tossing them
into the trash.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine my surprise at the favorable reaction to last week's
column praising the government for snatching EliAn Gonzalez from
his Miami relatives and reuniting him with his father. No kidding,
folks _ positive responses to that column vastly outnumbered the
critical messages.
</P>
<P>
   A quick tally of the first surge of phone calls, in fact, came
out 23-2 in my favor.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few highlights from the voice mail:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful. You said what I thought.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sentiments exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Cuban-American, and I live in Arlington, Texas. That
was a great article.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts completely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you run for political office, I'll vote for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The last one was scary, wasn't it? That reader's vote would
surely be the only one I'd get if I ran for office.
</P>
<P>
   Even I wouldn't vote for me.
</P>
<P>
   I appreciate the thought, though. When you spend a sizable chunk
of your day listening to people tell you how wrong you are, it's a
nice change of pace to suddenly get a truckload of ``atta boys.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't hurt, of course, that my opinion on the Elian deal
just happened to be approximately the same as that held by a large
majority of Americans. Public-opinion polls suggest that anywhere
from 60 to 70 percent of the public has endorsed Attorney General
Janet Reno's decision to grab Elian by force and return him to his
Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time somebody gave Janet Reno the credit she
deserves in placing Elian back in his father's arms where he
belongs,'' wrote one e-mailer. ``I was beginning to think that the
Cubans in Miami had their own laws and were exempt from U.S.
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for my continued sense of humility, there were
dissenters. Frankly, I'd be distressed if I ever received a batch
of letters that didn't include at least a modicum of hate mail. I
would worry that my legions of detractors had stopped reading.
</P>
<P>
   One of the angrier responses came from a reader who apparently
took exception to my characterization of Elian's Miami relatives in
general as ``lunatic uncles and cousins'' and to Marisleysis
Gonzalez in particular as ``dangerously unstable.'' An excerpt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your racism and xenophobia is evident ... since you have to
resort to petty insults to the latino community to make your
opinion known. Your kind of hatred died out a long time ago,
usually in the crosshairs of a Marine infantryman on D-Day ... did
you also cheer when the protesters at Kent State were mowed down?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not exactly sure what D-Day and Kent State have to do with
Elian Gonzalez, but the reader's objection to my opinion is duly
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Another reader took issue with my description of the relatives
as ``kidnappers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Miami family was `kidnappers' as you so claim, why
weren't they arrested? Is it because of the kindness of Janet Reno?
Uh-huh. If you actually believe in the legality of the search and
arrest warrant produced ... to conduct this armed raid, I've got
some oceanfront property in Arizona I'd like to sell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I've been to Arizona _ I spent a month in Phoenix one
week _ and I wouldn't be interested in property there even if this
e-mailer could magically deliver an oceanfront lot. But I agree
with him on one thing: Why weren't the Miami relatives arrested?
They were holding the kid illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Reno knew she'd have her hands full just defending
the raid to her critics without putting herself in the position of
explaining why a hysterical Marisleysis was hauled off in
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the reader who accused me of subscribing to
``that old saw _ the end justifies the means.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't everyone?

THAT BIG SALESPERSON IS WATCHING YOU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willy Loman never had it so good.
</P>
<P>
   Five decades after Arthur Miller eulogized a salesman's life,
modern-day seller John Bacon keeps a crush of appointments,
callbacks, and drop-ins at arm's length, thanks to a laptop
computer and GoldMine 4.0 software. While crisscrossing half a
dozen states in a Dodge Caravan, Bacon uses the software to keep
appointments, record customer preferences, and track inventory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lost without it,'' says Bacon, the regional sales
manager for a pharmaceutical company.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to manage a gaggle of clients, though, to benefit
from personal information managers (PIMs) such as GoldMine.
Millions of people use them along with _ or in place of _
old-fashioned calendars and date books to organize their personal
lives.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that the software is affordable and widely available,
running as low as $30 in many places.
</P>
<P>
   Still, free is better.
</P>
<P>
   That's where online calendars enter the picture. These
on-the-house imitations of PIMs first appeared on the Web scene a
little more than a year ago, providing basic PIM functions as well
as access to local movie times, cultural and sporting events, TV
schedules, and other events about town.
</P>
<P>
   The catch? Most keep track of your schedule so they can sell you
things tied to your to-do list. They make money, in other words, by
shepherding you to online ticket vendors and providing cards for
upcoming holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The aggravation isn't worth the benefit for most folks.
</P>
<P>
   But not all sites are created equal. A handful differentiate
themselves by throwing in nice extras, and a glorious few are
designed with the investor in mind. With the aid of Bacon's expert
eye as both an investor and a PIM aficionado, here are a handful of
the most popular sites.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman's analysis: All are worth more than the price of
admission (zilch), but he won't be giving up GoldMine any time
soon.
</P>
<P>
   --www.when.com _ When.com is unabashedly commercial, which is
not surprising given its parentage (the site is a division of
America Online). Virtually anything with a possible sales tie-in is
listed, from sports to Stravinski.
</P>
<P>
   In between, the calendar will search and automatically list
career fairs, cultural events, wine tastings, and movie openings
around town if you like. It will even keep you up to date on your
favorite TV show.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its most redeeming quality is its ``Finance Channel,''
which consists of a schedule of earnings announcements, public
offerings, and stock splits of companies you select.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of companies is limited, and the rest of when.com
seems aimed at the pop-culture crowd. And the site doesn't do much
beyond the calendar, which puts it at a disadvantage when compared
to other offerings.
</P>
<P>
   --http://calendar.msn.com _ MSN Calendar looks and works much
like when.com's, but that's just the beginning this time around.
</P>
<P>
   This agenda keeper also ties into a search engine, e-mail,
online buying service, and MSN, with all its news and chat
capabilities. For investors, the cherry on top is the calendar's
click-through connection to MSN Money Central, one of the better
finance sites on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that the calendar doesn't interact directly with
Money Central. So there's no way to have the calendar itself alert
you to earnings announcements or important business news.
</P>
<P>
   --www.smartmoney.com/si/tools/calendar _ SmartMoney.com is an
investment site first and foremost. In addition to its calendar
service, the site offers portfolio tracking, market news, brokerage
information, sector news, investment charts, and chat areas. All
are robust.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar is noteworthy in its own right, though.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to keeping track of your comings and goings, it can
be set to track economic data, from the consumer price index to
regional Federal Reserve Board reports. It will send you e-mail
reminders before and after the announcements, as well as show up on
your grid of events.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar also notes corporate earnings announcements, if you
like, along with stock splits, dividend payouts, company meetings,
conference calls, and analysts' upgrades or downgrades.
</P>
<P>
   --http://calendar.yahoo.com _ Like SmartMoney.com, Yahoo
Calendar is one piece of a larger puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   On top of its well-known Internet search engine, Yahoo also
offers a free address book, auction service, e-mail account, chat
rooms and, importantly, finance-specific area
(http://finance.yahoo.com). The latter includes news on US and
world markets, investment research, an Investment Challenge game,
tax and insurance areas, message boards, and an economic calendar
similar to SmartMoney.com's.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the calendar and address book makes Yahoo
more like a traditional PIM than its brethren, and its finance
offerings are nearly as extensive as those on SmartMoney.com. Plus,
as an added bonus, Yahoo calendar synchronizes with traditional
PIMs and some palm-top computers easily, so you don't necessarily
have to ditch one for the other.

BUSH-MCCAIN? LET'S HOPE IT'S TALK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The long-awaited, much-anticipated, big-deal meeting between
George W. Bush and John McCain is scheduled for Tuesday in
Pittsburgh, according to news reports, and Bush-backers everywhere
are eagerly awaiting the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Will George and John bury the hatchet and stand happily united
against Al Gore and the Democrats in the fall election? Will the
former rivals plot out common ground on previously rancorous issues
such as tax cuts and campaign finance reform?
</P>
<P>
   And don't overlook the big one: Will Bush ask McCain to be his
running mate?
</P>
<P>
   McCain has consistently said that he wants no part of the vice
presidential nomination, but it is an established fact that the
Arizona senator does not always say what he means. If you don't
believe it, just look at his recent back flip on the Confederate
flag controversy in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet the farm that McCain will decline if Bush offers the
No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket. For one thing, McCain is _ or claims
to be _ a dutifully loyal Republican; if Bush tells him that the
party needs him, McCain will be hard-pressed to say, ``No,
thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   For another, McCain might just figure that serving as vice
president _ or even serving as second banana on a losing ticket _
will set him up perfectly for a future run at the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   But even if we assume that McCain would be receptive to a vice
presidential offer from Bush, there is another question that must
be asked: Why in the world would Bush make the offer?
</P>
<P>
   McCain prides himself on his independence, his willingness to
take issue with or flat-out defy his party and its leaders on a
variety of issues. That's good for a legislator; it's bad for a
vice president or a candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Look, folks, running mates don't have to agree on every issue,
and the VP candidate doesn't have to slavishly say, ``Ditto,'' to
every pronouncement by the guy who tops the ticket. But it is
absolutely imperative that No. 2 understands and accepts his role _
and his role precludes any words or deeds that undermine the
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans need look no further back in history than 1996 to
see what can happen when the candidate for vice president is
someone who is incompatible with the presidential candidate in
terms of philosophy and/or personality.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Dole chose Jack Kemp as a running mate because Kemp was a
big name in Republican circles, retained some nonpartisan celebrity
status as a onetime football star, and commanded considerable
admiration among economic conservatives. But Kemp disagreed with
Dole on a number of basic issues, harbored no apparent loyalty to
the presidential candidate and clearly believed from the start that
he was second in command on a sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp was right about the ticket's nonexistent chances of
dislodging Bill Clinton and Al Gore from the White House. But
wouldn't you think he could have faked a little enthusiasm _ just
to bolster Republican morale, if nothing else?
</P>
<P>
   Dole would have been better off with no running mate at all.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the much-discussed idea of a Bush-McCain
ticket _ the much-discussed and terrible idea of a Bush-McCain
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of self-absorbed egomania, Kemp is a third-stringer
compared to McCain. Where politics and public policy are concerned,
McCain has one overriding priority, and it isn't campaign finance
reform _ it's John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gets along with just about everybody, but McCain seems to
get along with almost no one. We're talking about a man who snarled
at the perfectly pleasant and totally harmless Maria Shriver on
live television, for crying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing Bush needs as he embarks on a tough presidential
campaign _ and, later, the challenge of the presidency _ is to be
saddled with a cantankerous vice president who feels no allegiance
to Bush or his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Bush knows all this. Surely the talk about McCain as a
running mate is just talk and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Surely.

KATHIE LEE'S WOE-IS-ME MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Kathie Lee Gifford. ``People will not let us heal; they
have to pick the scab,'' she complained to Diane Sawyer on ``20/20
Downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it occurred to her that if she bandaged the scab, maybe
people would stop picking at it? Better yet, she should bandage her
mouth, permanently. The woman is insufferable. Will she ever shut
up about her pain and her heartbreak after the much publicized
infidelity of her husband, Frank? Evidently not _ or not as long as
she thinks she can wring another nickel out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee's appearance on ``20/20 Downtown'' Thursday night was
as much infomercial as interview. Sawyer didn't miss an opportunity
to plug Kathie Lee's new CD, a collection of songs about _ what
else? _ Kathie Lee's pain and heartbreak. There were musical
interludes from the album, including a song about, as Sawyer put
it, ``surviving the unbearable.'' Like a good pitchwoman, Sawyer
noted that Dolly Parton had sung the song with Kathie Lee at the
recent Dove Awards. All that was missing was an 800 number across
the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Sawyer turned to Frank and said, ``You've heard
the album.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet he has. OK, he cheated on her. Still, it's impossible
not to feel a little sorry for him, one of the great heroes of
American sport, publicly undone by his own urges, then publicly
humiliated by his third _ or is it his fourth? _ wife. It might
almost be a classic tragedy, if he had a brain. He sat there
looking like a ventriloquist's dummy as Kathie Lee compared their
post-scandal lovemaking to having a colonoscopy: ``It's not easy,
but you're supposed to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Good grief. And she wonders why people won't leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   It was gratifying to see that Frank hasn't been totally
emasculated. He faced up to his sin like a man. ``I was stupid,''
he told Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He revealed that he had considered suicide in the wake of the
tabloid story about his interlude with the other woman. ``I thought
seriously about how easy it would be to take my little Mercedes
convertible and stick it in the abutment.''
</P>
<P>
   He decided to stick it out instead. The marriage, that is. He
stayed. They prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed in Scripture and we stayed in bed,'' said Kathie
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love that part,'' said Frank, a little too eagerly, I
thought, considering the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Will their marriage last forever? Sawyer asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a lot of forever, if you think about it,''
reflected the 69-year-old studmuffin, the man Kathie Lee used to
call her Love Machine. Those were the days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running out of time and running out of wives,'' Kathie
Lee put in perkily.
</P>
<P>
   She said she's fallen in love with Frank all over again. But
even if she hadn't been able to bring herself to forgive him, she
would have stayed in the marriage. She told Sawyer, ``I remember
saying to myself, even if it means I stay married to somebody I am
no longer in love with, I will still do it for my children's
sake.''
</P>
<P>
   She also stayed for the sake of her weaker sisters. ``For every
woman that's ever fallen apart,'' she said, ``let one woman be
strong to show we can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Lee. Martyr. Patron of self-promotion. Now at a record
store near you.

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   !! ``Adrenaline Drive'' Lightweight Japanese comedy with a
take-the-money-and-run plot. A young corporate nerd and a shy nurse
happen upon mob money, then flee, hoping the mob won't happen upon
them. We've been here before, too often. This one seems powered by
Redi-Whip _ not by, well, adrenaline. (Unrated) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! ``Bossa Nova'' Warmly beguiling romantic comedy, with Rio de
Janeiro and a bossa nova soundtrack supplying some of the charm.
Most of the rest is supplied by Amy Irving's widowed
English-language instructor and Antonio Fagundes's dapper
gentlemanly charmer, one of her pupils. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Committed'' This one proves that Heather Graham can carry
a comedy even when it stops carrying itself. As a dishy,
saucer-eyed wife, she tracks her unworthy husband from SoHo to El
Paso when he flies the coop. The film bogs down there, but she
doesn't; Patricia Velasquez and Casey Affleck supply some help as
goofy pilgrims of love. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(FL) !! 1/2 ``I Dreamed of Africa'' Kim Basinger stars in a true
story of a European woman who made a new life for herself and her
young son in Kenya. Grandly dramatic things happened to this brave
spirit, and the visuals are stunning. But the film never really
penetrates its characters' exteriors, or translates their story
into a cohesive, compelling whole. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!! 1/2 ``Gladiator'' It's just as solemn as Hollywood's old
sword-and-sandal epics, but more jolting in its fight scenes.
Russell Crowe is commanding as a fictional Roman general betrayed,
sold into slavery, then hacking his way back with venegeance on his
mind. But the film, while high-impact, is too cynical not to seem
more than a merger between Hollywood and the World Wrestling
Foundation. (R) &QL; 
 &QL; 
(FR) !!! ``Up at the Villa'' Stylish period romance built around W.
Somerset Maugham's novella about the idle classes in Tuscany on the
eve of World War II. No tea, no Mussolini, but handsomely inflected
performances from Kristin Scott Thomas as an impoverished widow,
Sean Penn as a rakish ne'er-do-well, and Anne Bancroft as a shrewd
American-born principessa. (PG-13) &QL; 
 &QL; 
!!! 1/2 ``The Virgin Suicides'' Sofia Coppola's impressive debut
film uses the suicides of five teenage sisters as a dreamy,
fabulist evocation of adolescence, with everything heightened and
much remaining mysterious. Kirsten Dunst is the standout as the
most ephemeral and provocative sister. James Woods and Kathleen
Turner are too sad to be funny as the rigid parents who repress
them into disaster. (R)

CASH FLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN TRAUSCH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cape Cod waterfront property was selling for $2.3 million.
The buyer paid cash. Not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people who aren't stretching to pay one or two million
for a house,'' says Paul Grover at Kinlin Grover GMAC Real Estate
in Osterville. He notes that Cape waterfront land is higher than
it's ever been, with places going for $5 million. But that's cheap
compared to Palm Beach, where oceanfront sells for $15 million to
$20 million. Everything is relative.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these people who can write a check for a view? A person
with a mortgage and no view, or someone who can't even find an
affordable rental, easily works up an aggressive stereotype of a
young dot.com-er who thinks money grows on computer terminals. And
realtors do see a lot of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to see a guy in jeans and know he was a college
student looking for an apartment,'' says Joe Palermino, managing
partner of Cabot &AMP; Co. ``Now he's got a half million to put down on
an $800,000 condo.'' Cabot has had four all-cash buyers in the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``People with cash walk into a place, look around, and say,
`Yep, this is it. Oh, by the way, how much is it?' '' notes Michael
Foley, manager of Boston Realty Works.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in business 30 years and have never seen anything
like it is now,'' says Janet Hansen, who manages the Boston offices
of DeWolfe Cos. She's noticed cash purchases increasing over the
past five years. ``I see a lot of women with huge sums of money,
and not because they just got divorced. I just had a woman walk in
and buy a $457,000 condo for her daughter _ an undergraduate!''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much money a person has, or how little, the
purchase of a home is almost always emotional _ probably the most
emotional investment a human being can make. And as crazy as this
economy is, it's not spawning the speculative real estate market of
the 1980s. Today's buyer usually buys to live there, to enjoy, and
to connect with some basic psychological stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 60 years old, and still following my mother's advice,''
says the Massachusetts venture capitalist who paid cash for the
$2.3 million Cape waterfront. ``My mother was a real estate broker
and she said you should always pay cash for the land.''
</P>
<P>
   He plans to tear down ``a ramshackle cottage'' and build a
house, which he will finance with a mortgage. It will be his
permanent residence. He also has a condo on the Cape.
</P>
<P>
   He has owned several Cape properties and generally pays cash for
whatever he buys or builds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a background where I had no money. My parents were
hard-working middle-class people, products of the Depression. Their
parents lost their homes. So I'm happy to forgo the tax break for
the comfort of knowing there's no risk of my missing a payment. If
I suffer a setback of some kind I won't owe a lender. Even though
my net worth is in the millions, I always worry about losing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many buyers today, he was in a bidding war, but won because
his competition was a developer and the sellers didn't want their
land subdivided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been in the family for generations. That's what I want
_ I want the property to go to my children.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cambridge architect wasn't so lucky last year when she offered
just under $500,000 in cash from investments for a tiny
1,200-square-foot house on a 7,000-square-foot lot in her city. The
seller wanted no conditions on the sale. When the architect asked
that the land be surveyed because she couldn't tell where the
property line ended, she lost out. She offered more money, but no
deal. She cried _ still no deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd looked for two years,'' she said, noting that she wanted
a small place to renovate and expand so she could show prospective
clients her work. She and her husband, a college professor, and
daughter love Cambridge. They like city walking. They want
bookstores. Call it a need for intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   She has since found another place but still reads the ads _ it's
an addiction of sorts. Her favorite was the two-family house with
termites and no bathrooms. Asking price: $600,000. It sold.
</P>
<P>
   And somebody loves it. Maybe somebody's mother does, too.

SPRINTING TO KEEP UP WITH THE JONESES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much of what I hear on a daily basis are complaints from
consumers about how companies treat them, but there is rarely much
introspection about what makes consumers tick.
</P>
<P>
   Academics, however, are full of theories about Americans and
their preoccupation with consumption. With 5 percent of the world's
population, the United States consumes 30 percent of the world's
resources. The average new home in the United States has doubled in
size since 1970, and shopping has become a national obsession. Yet
no matter how much we buy we always seem to want more.
</P>
<P>
   Two new books by Harvard lecturer Juliet B. Schor and Wharton
School fellow Jeremy Rifkin take a look at this buy-buy-buy
mentality, albeit from very different perspectives. They assess
some of the long-term implications for our society and suggest some
responses that might be warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Schor, an economist and senior lecturer on women's studies at
Harvard University, takes direct aim at the shop-till-you-drop
consumer culture in an essay entitled ``The New Politics of
Consumption.'' It's the featured article in a book of essays from
Beacon Press titled ``Do Americans Shop Too Much?''
</P>
<P>
   Schor is well versed on the subject. The Newton resident is the
author of ``The Overworked American'' and ``The Overspent
American,'' and draws heavily on these works in making the case for
a dramatic restructuring of consumer politics.
</P>
<P>
   She says there is too much academic emphasis today on solving
America's consumption problem by funneling more income to the
people who don't have enough, and far too little focus on the
spending side of the equation. ``Somebody needs to be for quality
of life, not just quantity of stuff,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are caught in a competitive consumption trap, Schor
says. They are trying to keep up with the spending habits of the
people they meet at work, see on TV, or read about in the Robb
Report. This ``upscale emulation,'' she says, sends credit-card
balances soaring, harms the environment, cuts the rate of savings,
and saps money from deserving public projects like education,
parks, and the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Schor doesn't buy the conventional view that it's unAmerican to
interfere with consumer spending habits (after all, the consumer is
king). She favors government policies that would penalize bad
consumption (green taxes, luxury taxes, and tighter regulation of
credit) and promote quality of life (ad-free zones, retail
diversity, and more family time).
</P>
<P>
   Other essayists in the book beg to differ. Craig J. Thompson,
associate professor of marketing at the University of Wisconsin,
says Schor's analysis resonates with a puritanical moralism,
understates the cultural underpinnings of consumption, and misses
the point that, for many, ``stuff'' is no longer the Holy Grail of
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are already pursuing an improved quality of life
rather than greater quantity of stuff, and consumer culture is
right there selling `it' to them with great skill and alacrity,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Twitchell, professor of English at the University of
Florida and author of ``Lead Us Into Temptation: The Triumph of
American Materialism,'' says consumerism may not be pretty but it
beats the alternatives. ``Face it: You are what you consume, not
what you make. You are the logo on your T-shirt,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends in
Washington and the author of ``The End of Work'' and ``The Biotech
Century,'' has a new book that touches on some of these same
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Age of Access: The New Culture of Hypercapitalism Where
All of Life is a Paid-For Experience,'' Rifkin argues that the
economy and consumers are going through a fundamental change. The
market-based economy, in which the goal is to buy and sell goods
and acquire property, is giving way to a network-based economy in
which change is so rapid that consumers increasingly pay to use
things rather than to own them outright. Access is more important
than ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Automobiles, for example, are being transformed from a good to a
service as more and more of them are leased rather than bought. In
the same way, consumers are buying time shares rather than second
homes.
</P>
<P>
   There are some holes in this reasoning. Auto leases and time
shares, for example, are also ways for consumers to upscale, to use
Schor's term, on a limited bank account. Why buy a Chevy Cavalier
when you can lease a BMW?
</P>
<P>
   What resonated with me, however, was Rifkin's discussion of how
our lives are being commercialized. It's not just designer labels
and omnipresent advertising. Companies, he says, increasingly talk
about going after customer share rather than market share. They
practically give away products in order to lock consumers into
long-term service contracts that allow companies to work their way
into all aspects of their customers' lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Co. is a prime example, according to Rifkin. Its
far-flung business interests seek to envelop consumers in a
corporate cocoon of information and entertainment. The cocoon
consists of everything from movies, theme parks, retail stores, and
television networks to cruise ships and planned residential
communities. ``You can live your whole life now with Disney,'' said
Rifkin in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin frets that the steady drumbeat of commercialization is
sapping our culture and changing us in the process. In one long
passage in the book, he talks about how people are different in
this age of access.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think of themselves as players rather than workers and
prefer others to think of them as creative rather than
industrious,'' he writes. ``They think of Disney World and Club Med
as the real thing, regard the shopping mall as the public square,
and equate consumer sovereignty with democracy. . . . They are
experimental and court innovation. Customs, conventions, and
traditions, on the other hand, are virtually nonexistent in their
fast-paced ever-changing environment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Car-buying information
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen years ago Consumer Reports came up with the dealer
invoice price for automobiles. The figure told consumers what an
automobile dealer paid the manufacturer for a car and provided a
much better starting point for price negotiations than the
manufacturer's suggested retail price.
</P>
<P>
   But today the invoice price is often misleading. Dealers may pay
the invoice price for a car, but then later receive additional
money back from the manufacturer in the form of dealer incentives
and holdbacks. As a result, auto dealers can offer a car for
invoice price plus $100 and still make a healthy profit.
</P>
<P>
   To give consumers a better understanding of a car's actual cost
to the dealer, Consumer Reports is providing what it calls
wholesale price information on cars, in effect invoice price minus
these behind-the-scenes subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the difference is substantial. On a 2000 Ford Escort
ZX2, the difference between invoice and wholesale price is $1,859.
On a 2000 Toyota Camry Le, the difference is just $357. Consumer
Reports say the information is gleaned from its ``sources'' and is
available at www.consumerreports.org or by calling 800-395-4400.
The cost is $12.
</P>
<P>
   Paige Amidon, director of auto price services for Consumer
Reports, cautions that the wholesale price doesn't cover a dealer's
costs for such things as overhead and advertising. ``We're not
saying you should be able to buy the car at wholesale, but it gives
you a starting point,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Automobile Dealers Association, which plans to
start listing invoice prices for free on its Web site this summer,
said Consumer Reports' wholesale price isn't worth the money.
``It's not a meaningful figure for consumers,'' a spokesman says.

GEORGE V. HIGGINS AT DUSK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AT END OF DAY 
By George V. Higgins. Harcourt. 
383 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1972, a 32-year-old assistant US attorney named George V.
Higgins burst on the literary scene with ``The Friends of Eddie
Coyle.'' This was his first novel accepted for publication, though
it was about the 15th the young lawyer had written. The book became
a bestseller, and it launched a series of more than 20 other novels
_ most of which didn't become bestsellers, mostly because Higgins
declined to repeat himself or to relax into formula, even in the
four books that formed a series about Jerry Kennedy, ``the
classiest sleazy criminal lawyer in Boston.'' Ever industrious,
Higgins had begun a fifth Kennedy book before he died, last
November.
</P>
<P>
   Because his later books never took off in the marketplace, it
was easy to buy into the notion that Higgins had somehow ``fallen
off'' from his early promise and accomplishment, though publicists
and even reviewers ritually greeted the appearance of a new Higgins
novel as ``a return to form.'' Even the publisher of the last novel
Higgins completed, ``At End of Day,'' maintains that the book
represents ``a step up, and back, to his earlier excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At End of Day'' is a terrific and topical book that takes off
from headlines _ specifically, from the story of Whitey Bulger and
the FBI's complicity with some members of the underworld. In a
sense the novel represents a return to the criminal milieu of ``The
Friends of Eddie Coyle.'' But it isn't necessary to denigrate
earlier Higgins novels in order to praise this one. The writer
didn't have an easy life, and some of his books turned out better
than others, but Higgins never wrote a bad book, or probably even a
bad sentence. The same questions _ of character, code, and
principle _ occupied him in whatever social or professional setting
he found his people and started eavesdropping on them and letting
them spring surprises on themselves, each other, the reader _ and
probably their creator himself. There is never a dull moment in
George V. Higgins.

   In his last outing, Arthur F. McKeon, a.k.a. McKeach, and Nick
Cistaro are gangsters, ruthless and careful, and they run their
rackets out of a base in South Boston. Everyone knows them and what
they're up to, and for more than 30 years they've gotten away with
murder, as well as loan sharking, extortion, assault, bribery,
gambling, drug-dealing, and just about everything else in their
full-service operation. McKeach, we learn, ``fixed horse races,
prizefights, probably college basketball games, and at least one
election each for seats on the Boston City Council and the
Governor's Council. He stole union funds, diverting members' dues
and embezzling their pension money. He corrupted public officials _
tax assessors, cops on the beat, building inspectors, municipal
liquor-licensing board inspectors, two state members of the
Alcoholic Beverage Control, and a member of the state racing
commission . . . and we're just getting warmed up here.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeach and Cistaro are not going quietly into their sunset
years, but they have found it useful to form a private and mutually
beneficial alliance with two FBI agents, Jack Farrier and Darren
Stoat. The gangsters feed information about La Cosa Nostra to the
FBI and settle some scores by betraying some of their own clients
who have become more trouble than they're worth. The FBI, in turn,
does not look too closely into the affairs of McKeach and Cistaro,
and promises to be of whatever assistance it can if other agencies
are closing in.
</P>
<P>
   There is honor among thieves, but Higgins does nothing to
romanticize them; they have their likable sides, but then they will
lash out with terrifying violence. There is also corruption among
the law enforcers _ nothing serious, of course, just asking for an
occasional help-me-out-here. The parallels between the criminal
world and the world of respectability are connected like fault
lines. But the ironies are not simple and predictable like circles
around a stone dropped in a still pond; instead they ricochet, like
an echo in a dark and looping cave.
</P>
<P>
   The story, like all of Higgins's stories, is convoluted, even
twisted, and most of it plays out offstage, like the action in
Greek drama. And the story isn't really the point of the book; the
point is the way the story darts into and out of the shadows of the
mind, the way it develops and disappears in the conversations of
the people who are telling it. Higgins's books are extremely
stylized, but utterly realistic; poetic yet vernacularly
down-to-earth; the epic struggles in them are entirely human. His
books are rough, artful, and uncompromising.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of them, ``At End of Day'' unfolds in a series of
monologues by and conversations with some very dodgy people who are
equally determined to find things out and give nothing away, by
indirection to find directions out. The only way to read a Higgins
novel is to listen to it, attentively. These people are trying to
con each other; often they do not realize the extent to which they
are conning themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Most Higgins characters reveal themselves as they tell stories,
which add up to the substance of the book. Some of the stories act
like funhouse mirrors, distorting an event or exaggerating a truth
by reflecting it from a crooked surface set at a different angle.
Others seem genuinely irrelevant; they don't have to be there. But
the things that don't have to be there constitute the quality and
the character of a Higgins novel.
</P>
<P>
   There's a cat in ``At End of Day,'' for example, a cat named
Mouser who prefers eating beef scraps to chasing after mice. The
cat is regal even in a dumpster; it pounces on the scraps, ``using
its front paws to gather them expertly into a neater pile, then
settling down on its stomach to eat, growling huskily in its
pleasure as it chewed the flesh.'' The cat's behavior inspires a
conversation that includes commentary about the Board of Health,
about political correctness (``. . . insultin' your feline gender
diversity. You happen to be a cat that doesn't like huntin' and
then eatin' mice. Most boy cats don't. And for this he's
threatenin' to discriminate against you.''), about the welfare
system, about freeloading, about gelding (``You expect him to do
cat work for you, after you did that to him? Stopped him from
acting like a self-respecting tomcat? Would you work for a man who
had that done to you? He thinks you owe him a living now.'').
</P>
<P>
   This is a genre scene in a genre novel, but there is nothing
predictable about it; it tells us about the cat, about the people
who are observing it and the situation they are in, and about human
nature. And it is pure George V. Higgins, who stood for something
and never gave up.

CUBA EMBARGO MAY EXPIRE OF WEAKNESS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the dust from the Elian Gonzalez saga settles, one unintended
but welcome consequence is emerging: the likelihood that the United
States will reconsider its policy toward Cuba _ especially the
embargo that has been in place since shortly after Fidel Castro
took power in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone considers that good news. For the Cuban-American
National Foundation, the powerful lobbying group for the exile
community, any step toward trade with Cuba is perceived as a
softening of opposition to the longest-running tyrant in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-American community has taken a beating for its support
of Elian's Miami relatives. The public perception of it has been
driven by stereotypes of Hispanics as hysterical and irrational.
Yet however misguided and legally uninformed the exile community
has been, it has acted on passion and principle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one likely consequence of the Elian episode will be to
dilute both the exiles' voice and their influence in favor of
traditional US-Cuban policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the Cuban-American community has been a
determining factor in keeping the embargo in place, and I think
their capital at the political level has diminished because of the
Elian thing,'' said Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research
Center at Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are tending to believe less what Cuban exiles
have to say,'' Perez continued. ``They put all their eggs in this
one basket, in this cause they never could have won either
politically or in terms of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the political impetus to end the embargo may be fresh,
the action itself is long overdue. As Castro maintains his iron
grip after 41 years, some facts have become increasingly
indisputable.
</P>
<P>
   First, the embargo is not going to dislodge Fidel. Second, the
embargo primarily serves to impoverish the poor people of Cuba,
adding to the burden of those who are already deprived of civil
liberties and political rights as well.
</P>
<P>
   Third, and most important, the embargo is the greatest
propaganda tool Castro has at his disposal. It legitimizes his
false rhetoric of victimization, enables him to present himself as
a champion of the people he has oppressed, and strengthens his hold
on the Cuban economy, his chief tool for rewarding his friends and
punishing his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the embargo, once an article of faith among exile
activists, has been showing signs of weakness for some time. Even
among the huge, 800,000-strong exile community in Miami there has
been growing frustration that it has failed as a means of
punishment. Elsewhere, given the United States' willingness to
trade with equally oppressive governments _ most notably China _ it
has come to be regarded as a hypocritical Cold War anachronism.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo began for legitimate reasons. After taking power,
Castro nationalized all US property on the island. More
importantly, in the context of the time, he vowed to export
communism throughout Latin America, and to build closer ties to the
Soviet Union. At that time, the US government thought the embargo
might bring a quick end to this upstart pest in its backyard.
</P>
<P>
   But that was a miscalculation. By the end of the Cuban Missile
Crisis in 1962 _ which followed the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs _ it
was clear that the embargo would not be the tool to sweep Castro
from power. Even as exiles began pouring into Florida by the
thousands, much of the embargo's original rationale was fading.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Castro's threats to export ``armed struggle''
never amounted to much. In the 1970s, the official position was
that the embargo could not be lifted until Castro ended efforts to
export revolution and severed military ties with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the Soviet Union fell apart, and the United
States began moving toward normal relations with many other former
enemies, including Russia, the embargo had taken on a different
flavor. For exiles, even those who acknowledged its practical
ineffectiveness, it had come to symbolize resistance to the Castro
regime and its human rights abuses. Meanwhile, for Castro himself,
it had become an easy excuse for every failure of his ruinous
economy. The embargo had become an issue where extremes met.
</P>
<P>
   Characterizing the view of the Cuban exile community, not his
own position, Perez explained: ``If it were lifted, it would be
recognition of the legitimization of the Castro government. Castro
would have `won'. You have to understand the embargo in terms of
symbolism.''
</P>
<P>
   International support for the embargo, once widespread, withered
long ago _ leaving the United States as the only country pursuing
economic isolation as its foreign policy toward Havana.
</P>
<P>
   More recent, supposedly tougher, measures have failed even more
dramatically. The Cuba Democracy Act of 1992 _ which stiffened our
embargo just as other countries were lifting theirs entirely _ has
done none of the things its advocates said it would do. At the time
of passage, its chief sponsor, US Senator Robert Torricelli, a New
Jersey Democrat, bragged that the Castro regime would fall within
months.
</P>
<P>
   Barring the unforeseen, when Bill Clinton leaves office, Fidel
Castro will have outlasted his eighth US president.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the divide between Cuba and the United States is
beginning to erode. In recent years travel restrictions have eased,
and the two governments have cooperated on environmental and
anti-drug efforts. At the same time, Washington has allowed the
sale of certain medical and farming supplies to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will soon consider a proposal that goes a considerable
step further, exempting all food and medicine from the embargo.
There is also a move afoot to ease restrictions on exiles returning
to Cuba to visit families.
</P>
<P>
   Recent years have also brought some measures to open up the
Cuban economy. Castro now allows private enterprise in some limited
forms, such as farmers' markets and small businesses. The US dollar
has become coveted currency. The loss of the Soviet Union as a
national bank has been largely offset by increased tourism, much of
it from Americans who enter through third countries.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of isolationism, of which embargoes are a part, is a
sorry one. Withdrawing from countries and isolating them only
tightens the grip of leaders like Castro. A unilateral embargo
makes even less sense, serving in this case only to assuage the
bruised consciences of those who wrestle with the guilt of having
``lost the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Cuban-Americans suggest that lifting the embargo could
perhaps be tied to internal changes in Cuba, such as freeing
political prisoners or relaxing restrictions on a free press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Castro was willing to allow a general amnesty of political
prisoners, if he would allow the people to be able to express
themselves without repression, if he would allow the opposition
groups to be legalized _ which now he does not _ and if he would
allow supervised free elections, I think everybody would work
together to get rid of the embargo and I think the Cuban people
would benefit,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez of the Democracy Movement,
an anti-Castro advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   That is far too much to hope for while Castro remains in power.
But economic improvements always weaken repressive regimes, and
that alone may be reason enough to lift this symbolic gesture.

COLORBLIND AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACOBY-COLUMN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, colorblindness was synonymous with civil rights. The
pioneers in the fight to abolish Jim Crow took as their inspiration
Justice John Harlan's great dissent in Plessy v. Ferguson. ``Our
Constitution is color-blind,'' Harlan had written, ``and neither
knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   That was how civil rights leaders used to sound. In 1941, A.
Philip Randolph, the head of the Pullman Porters union, threatened
a mass march on Washington. What he and his followers wanted, he
said, was ``the abrogation of every law which makes a distinction
in treatment between citizens based on religion, creed, color, or
national origin.'' Seven years later, Thurgood Marshall's brief for
the NAACP in Sipuel v. University of Oklahoma argued that
``classifications and distinctions based on race or color have no
moral or legal validity in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, today's civil rights establishment clamors not for
color-blindness, but for its opposite: affirmative action, racial
preferences, minority set-asides. In another era, the Klan would
have been the most vehement foe of laws, like California's
Proposition 209, that bar states from granting or denying benefits
on the basis of race. Now such laws are more likely to be savaged
by the NAACP or Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But where those ``leaders'' lead, Americans no longer follow.
Despite furious campaigns against them, Prop 209 (and I-200 in
Washington State) prevailed. Florida and Texas have stopped using
overt racial criteria in state college admissions. Ordinary
citizens _ contractors, parents, municipal employees _ are
increasingly willing to challenge quotas and set-asides in court.
It is hard to shake the feeling that the public is fed up with
being sorted by color. And to judge from a trio of new polls, that
dissatisfaction goes deeper than most of us had known.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-April, a survey on Connecticut's public campuses found
that faculty members were opposed _ overwhelmingly opposed _ to
taking race or gender into account in hiring and admissions.
Professors at the University of Connecticut disapproved of
preferences in faculty hiring by a ratio of 2 to 1. At Connecticut
State University, the ratio was 3 to 1. At Connecticut's community
colleges, 5 to 1. The faculty opposed preferences in admissions by
similar margins.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was commissioned by the Connecticut Association of
Scholars. It was conducted by the University of Connecticut's own
highly regarded Center for Survey Research and Analysis. If this is
how academics in the liberal Northeast feel about affirmative
action, what must the rest of the country be thinking?
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the Connecticut poll was issued, the Foundation
for Academic Standards &AMP; Tradition released the results of a far
more comprehensive campus survey. According to a Zogby
International poll of college students nationwide, large majorities
line up against racial preferences and quotas. Asked whether they
agree or disagree that ``schools should give minority students
preference in the admissions process,'' 77.3 percent disagreed.
Students in every category opposed affirmative action: whites, 79.5
percent; blacks, 51.9 percent; Hispanics, 71.4 percent; Asians,
78.1 percent; others, 78.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However the question was framed, students replied that
affirmative action is anathema. Asked whether it is unfair to lower
entrance requirements for some students, 78.9 percent said yes.
Asked whether it is right to give preferential treatment to some
minorities at the expense of other qualified applicants, 77.9
percent answered no.``Diversity stands out as an area where
students disagree with current trends in college education,'' reads
the Zogby summary. ``An extraordinary 95.7 percent said diversity
of ideas and high academic standards are more important to a
quality education than achieving ethnic diversity.'' (See the
complete results at www.gofast.org).
</P>
<P>
   Broadest of the new polls is a survey of the US public
commissioned by the American Civil Rights Institute. It too finds
solid opposition to the racial bean-counters.
</P>
<P>
   Should states be blocked from using race or gender preferences?
Yes, 55.4 percent. Is it necessary for government forms or job
applications to identify a person's race? No, 64.4 percent. Should
the government eliminate boxes asking people to indicate their
race? Yes, 78.2 percent. Is a person's racial identity a private
matter? Yes, 74.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The quota-mongers don't know it yet, but the sun has set on
preferences and ``reverse'' discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Creating Equal,'' Ward Connerly, who helped lead
Proposition 209 to victory, asks: ``What was it that ever made us
think that by encouraging government to disadvantage some we would
liberate others? How could we have ever believed that the
recipients of such condescending help would . . . not internalize
the message it conveyed about their inferiority and incompetence?
How did we ever convince ourselves that such a policy was
consistent with the promise at the heart of American life?''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed that his children might one day
live in a nation that would judge them by the content of their
character, not the color of their skin. He didn't live to see it,
but the dream is coming true.

HUB SETS EXAMPLE FOR GORE ON HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my favorite morsels of Tom Menino wisdom involves big
issues that politicians steer clear of, the ones that everybody
talks about except their ``leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't say anything because they don't know what to do,''
says Boston's mayor. ``And so they hope that by ducking completely,
the public's attention will go to other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The best example right now is housing.
</P>
<P>
   Go anywhere in the country and housing is Topic B if it isn't
Topic A. Price, location, availability. One of the few unfortunate
side effects of an unprecedented run of prosperity has been its
impact on the supply and price of dwelling units; in the world
where normal people live, the impact borders on the catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   As Senator John Kerry said in a speech in Boston last year, ``A
child cannot learn if he has to attend three or four schools in a
single year, if his family moves from relative to relative to
friend to friend because his parents can't afford the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   When $1,500 for a couple of bedrooms in a city or nearby suburb
is a bargain, hard work no longer translates into decent housing.
In Massachusetts, Kerry notes, it takes a hundred hours at the
minimum wage to afford a typical rental; worse, in Boston, the
figure is 135 hours at three times the minimum. And for elderly
citizens trying to squeeze into what there is of assisted housing,
there are more than eight people in line for each unit.
</P>
<P>
   More often, local governments struggle mightily just to keep the
situation from getting worse as federal subsidies expire and other
gentrification pressures intensify.
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential campaign slowly takes shape, housing is
still a stepchild. Given other priorities _ across-the-board income
tax cuts, Social Security privatization, ``Star Wars'' _ there is
no room, much less interest, in George W. Bush's constellation for
this issue, with the sole exception of a few symbolic gestures in
support of homeownership.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore is more of a question mark. As a Democrat who relied big
time on urban voters in nailing his nomination victory early, he
has no excuse taking so long to address housing issues. But Mayor
Menino and other major urban figures have prodded and cajoled, and
there have been signs in the last few weeks that the vice
president's Nashville-based operation is ready to try its hand.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is that economic prosperity will add tens of
billions of dollars to the budget surpluses of the next few years.
And housing has gotten the shortest end of the budgetary stick
during the Clinton years.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore is willing to wake up, Menino and Kerry are in
especially good positions to offer assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Under Menino, Boston is unusual in its record of direct
investment in housing. This year the city will spend $26 million of
its own funds from the sale of surplus properties on housing
production, and last year the number of new housing starts exceeded
2,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   Along with several of his colleagues, Menino believes that the
national tax reform of 14 years ago went too far in cracking down
on real estate shelters. He favors _ and so should Gore _ letting
apartment buildings for low- and moderate-income renters be
eligible for accelerated depreciation schedules. Commercial real
estate can ebb and flow with market forces, but affordable housing
needs and would greatly benefit from special tax treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, meanwhile, has proposed giving affordable housing
production the same kind of dedicated revenue stream that supports
highway and airport development _ in short, a trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the credit programs of the Federal Housing
Administration and the Government National Mortgage Association
generate earnings of $2 billion annually. That money now goes into
the government's pool of general revenues; Kerry proposes that it
go instead into a trust fund for the expansion of affordable
housing production operating through the states and the multitude
of private and nonprofit groups that already exists.
</P>
<P>
   His only string, to oversimplify, would require of recipients
that they make the kinds of vigorous local efforts that Boston
already does.
</P>
<P>
   The housing near-crisis did not happen overnight or by accident.
It was the conscious decimation of a national effort by Ronald
Reagan and George W.'s father. Twenty years ago the country was
turning out nearly 130,000 units of affordable housing a year; by
the 1990s, the slashing of federal efforts had cut that figure by
well over half.
</P>
<P>
   It can rise again, and in this economy it would be almost
criminal if the opportunity were lost.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gun incidents are nothing new in the Boston area, yet two recent
ones stood out: In both, middle-aged, middle-class men ran afoul of
a law prohibiting firearms on school campuses _ one in Wellesley,
the other in Framingham.
</P>
<P>
   The question they triggered was obvious: Why would these people
feel the need to be packing heat in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   Crime in Massachusetts is, after all, at a 30-year low. And even
if it weren't, speak the phrase ``mean streets,'' and the images
that leap to mind are hardly the pleasant avenues of Boston's leafy
western suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Richard Forbes, a lawyer who lost his .32-caliber pistol
in the Wellesley Middle School auditorium during a March 28 Town
Meeting, nor Steven Belli, a salesman who brought his 9mm handgun
onto Framingham High School grounds when he dropped his daughter
off on May 1, returned Globe calls.
</P>
<P>
   But if they weren't talking, others were hotly debating why
people in a safe state feel compelled to tote pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Hillman, former superintendent of the Massachusetts State
Police and now a Republican from Sturbridge, thinks the media has
created an exaggerated impression of the peril crime poses in this
state.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that each year in Massachusetts four times as many people
are killed in automobile crashes as are shot to death, Hillman
says: ``If you covered tragedies in the proportion they take place,
people would be clamoring for drunk-driving reform and not worry so
much about being a crime victim. But it is much sexier when it is
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts agree that crime is hardly at a level that
justifies the average person worrying about being a victim. Data
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show
Massachusetts tied with Hawaii for the lowest fire-fatality rates
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Massachusetts State Police, as of 1998, rape
was at the lowest level since 1983, robbery the lowest since 1970,
murder the lowest since 1962. (Although on the decline, aggravated
assault hasn't fallen as quickly.)
</P>
<P>
   James Alan Fox, the Lipman professor of criminal justice at
Northeastern University, says the overall drop in crime is best
seen through the homicide statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the state's homicide rate was 2.1 people for every
100,000, a halving of the 1989 high of 4.2 killings per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   And for the age groups of the two men in question, the risk is
smaller still. Belli is 46; for 1998, men 35 to 49 faced a homicide
risk of 1.4 in 100,000. Forbes is 54; men 50 to 64 had one chance
in 100,000 of being killed.
</P>
<P>
   Further, despite documented fears about school safety,
nationwide the chances of a schoolchild dying in a Columbine-type
killing is about one in 2 million, Fox says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he agrees with Hillman that public perceptions of crime
are far different from the reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though crime is low and going lower, half of Americans
think crime is going up,'' Fox said. Why? ``The prime-time news is
more like the crime-time news.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly anyone who sits through one of Channel 7's sanguinary
nightly newscasts can second that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other evidence suggests reality is arresting runaway
perceptions. A survey of 2,000 Boston residents released last month
found that fear of crime is down 50 percent since 1995 and that 78
percent feel safe walking near their homes at night.
</P>
<P>
   A psychological factor may also help intensify unease, says Dr.
Alvin F. Poussaint, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the
Harvard Medical School. Poussaint says that though well-adjusted
people keep tragedies like Columbine and other shootings in proper
statistical perspective, that carnage can come to represent an
exaggerated menace to those already inclined toward paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone on the paranoid side might be greatly affected,'' said
Poussaint. ``A certain amount of paranoia will make you more likely
to get a gun, because you fear things much more and you are
projecting your own fears onto ... other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall gun data is incomplete in Massachusetts, but according
to Charles McDonald, director of communication for the Executive
Office of Public Safety, there are currently 178,000 Licenses to
Carry (essentially a handgun permit) in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That means one of every 35 people has the right to possess, and
unless the permit is conditioned, to carry a handgun. Not that they
all do, of course; a handgun permit is necessary even if one only
wants to keep a pistol in his home.
</P>
<P>
   Other handgun-owners carry only occasionally. Hillman, for
example, says some of his friends who have handgun permits don't
carry their sidearms regularly in their communities, but do strap
them on if they come to Boston on a Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Include rifles and shotguns in the count and the number goes up,
though just how high is hard to say because the data is imprecise.
In total, about one million firearms-identification cards,
necessary to own a rifle or shotgun, have been issued in
Massachusetts, but because those permits were, until recently,
issued for a lifetime rather than renewed, that total likely
overcounts the number of people who own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Few issues so lend themselves to diametrically opposed views of
crime and causality as do guns, of course. Which is why, if gun
opponents are puzzled by the desire to carry a handgun in a safe
state, gun advocates claim it makes eminent good sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know if it would be fair to say that because
crime is going down someone will be less likely to carry a firearm
when the fact that they have been carrying firearms is part of the
reason crime is going down,'' says Michael Yacino, executive
director of the Gun Owners' Action League.
</P>
<P>
   Adding ordnance to that argument is the 1998 book, ``More Guns,
Less Crime: Understanding Crime and Gun Control Laws,'' by John R.
Lott Jr., now the senior research scholar at Yale Law School and
former chief economist at the US Sentencing Commission, which
reworked federal sentencing rules.
</P>
<P>
   Lott's research, one of the largest and most comprehensive
studies of gun laws, analyzed the effects on crime in 23 states
that have made it easier to carry concealed weapons since 1985.
(Most, though not all, handgun permits issued in Massachusetts
allowed the concealed carrying of the weapon.)
</P>
<P>
   His conclusion was that after those laws passed, murders fell an
average of eight percent, rapes five percent, and aggravated
assaults seven percent. The decrease in crime continued the longer
the right-to-carry laws remained on the books, he says.
</P>
<P>
   As one might expect, Lott's book has touched off a heated
debate, with critics challenging, though hardly outright
discrediting, his statistical analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, asked about the cases making headlines in Massachusetts,
Lott said the men in question don't seem to fit the profile of
those he thinks would most logically want to carry a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest benefits are for people who are weaker physically
_ women or the elderly _ and for poor blacks who live in high-crime
urban areas,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from the legal charges that may entangle Forbes and
Belli for bringing guns onto school property, Lott says other
citizens shouldn't look askance at them for carrying guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, one should be thankful that these people are
bearing the cost of carrying a concealed gun,'' he argues. ``If
some type of attack arose, those people might be there to help out.
So they are producing benefits for others, too.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of contention provokes vigorous disagreement from
other experts. Fox, for example, says the primary reason for the
increase in violence in the late 1980s and early 1990s was ``a
juvenile arms race,'' just as one of the principal causes of the
decline since then was that ``we have made some real inroads and
progress in trying to disarm young offenders.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Hillman, though he carried a gun for 25 years as a
Massachusetts state trooper, he says he took it off the day he left
the state police. So what advice does the former State Police
commander have for today's pistol packers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, unless you are a cop or are in the business of
arresting dangerous felons in the middle of the night, you don't
need to carry a gun in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,'' Hillman
said. ``It is a safe place to be.''

SUSPECTS IN COMPUTER VIRUS CASE DETAINED IN PHILIPPINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Authorities took a man into custody Monday
and demanded the surrender of a woman in connection with the ``love
bug'' virus that has disabled computer programs around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects, apparently both bank employees, live in an
apartment where authorities believe a computer owned by the woman
was the source of the virus. They apparently located the source by
tracing a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   A warrant was issued in the name of the woman, Irene de Guzman,
23. If she is responsible for the virus, this would be a very rare
case in which a woman is implicated in computer vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they had reached her by telephone and she had
promised to surrender in the company of a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The officials did not characterize the detentions as arrests,
however, and said the suspects were not necessarily the creators of
the virus, which could have been the work of anyone using the
computer. They said there might be additional suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only the computer used to launch the virus that was
traced, but anybody could use that computer,'' said an official of
the National Bureau of Investigation. ``The difference is that the
person we have identified is the registered owner of that
computer.''
</P>
<P>
   After three days of rumors and delays, agents late Monday moved
in on a three-story house in the lower-middle-class Manila
neighborhood of Pandacan. When the man, whom they named as Reomel
Ramones, 27, arrived after work, they ``invited'' him, in
handcuffs, for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   They seized 17 items including telephones, wires, computer disks
and computer magazines, according to a local official, Gil Alnas.
He said a computer was not found in the apartment, which could mean
authorities might not be able to look for evidence on the hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Local radio reports quoted Ramones as denying involvement with
the virus, and his relatives suggested the real culprit could be
the woman's sister, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The virus, which apparently originated through two e-mail
addresses in the Philippines, is one of the fastest-spreading and
most destructive acts of computer vandalism on record.
</P>
<P>
   By inviting recipients to open an attachment with the subject
line ``ILOVEYOU,'' it has infected some 45 million users in at
least 20 countries and has invaded systems in the Pentagon and the
British Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Several variations have followed, two of them masked as e-mail
jokes and one as a receipt for a Mother's Day gift. Operating as a
sort of poisoned chain letter, when opened the messages destroy
graphics and other saved files.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts quickly identified the Philippines as the
likely source of the infection. Reports emerged several days ago
that the suspect was a man living in the Pandacan neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators here first said they could not find a judge to
issue a warrant over the weekend, and then they said they could not
find a law under which to make out a search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no law on this, so we are looking for a law,'' said
Federico Opinion, chief of the National Bureau of Investigation,
earlier Monday. The warrant was finally issued under the Access
Device Act, which governs the use of codes, account numbers and
passwords. It provides for a maximum punishment of 20 years in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   According to one report, de Guzman or other suspects could be
charged with committing fraud using a telephone. Officials have 36
hours to bring charges against detainees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators said, charges could be brought in the
United States because the virus caused damage there. The FBI has
been assisting investigators in the Philippines.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Computer experts said the delays may have allowed the suspects
to destroy evidence and could make prosecution more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation here that the virus _ technically a
``worm'' that eats its way into programs _ was created primarily as
a scam to get Internet access rather than as an attempt to cause
widespread havoc.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was complicated by the fact that the
programmer of the virus apparently used a prepaid Internet account.
Such accounts are common here and issue temporary user names and
passwords. Temporary names are often difficult to trace.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation included evidence from Access Net, one of
several Internet service providers in the Philippines believed to
have been used by the programmer. The chief operating officer of
Access Net, Jose Carlotta, said he had given extensive e-mail logs
to government officials.

&HT;     ORACLE FOUNDER INTRODUCES NETWORK COMUTER, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Larry Ellison is breathing life back into the
network computer, reviving a stalled idea he championed years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Oracle Corp. chairman was expected to announce Monday the
creation of the New Internet Computer Co., which will be based in
San Francisco and produce a $199 Internet appliance dubbed the
``NIC.''
</P>
<P>
   The network computer will allow users to surf the Internet,
check e-mail, run software applications and perform other basic
computing functions without the benefit of an individual hard
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the NIC will deliver those services across a network,
using a Linux operating system stored on a CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Former Examiner columnist and ABC-TV technology correspondent
Gina Smith is the company's co-founder and CEO. Although Oracle
Corp. does not own the NIC Co., Ellison is the primary investor.
</P>
<P>
   The world was expected to got its first look at the NIC on
Monday morning in Dallas, where Ellison, Smith and Gen. Colin L.
Powell announced plans to donate ``thousands'' of NICs to schools
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Independent School District will be the first
recipient of the free NICs, with announcements of future donation
sites coming soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed by the offerings currently in the
marketplace, so we designed and built our own,'' said Ellison in a
statement. ``We were looking for an inexpensive yet reliable way of
connecting everyone, especially teachers and schoolchildren, to the
Internet as part of Oracle's efforts to bridge the digital
divide.''
</P>
<P>
   The donation is part of ``Oracle's Promise,'' an ongoing
philanthropic program to place thousands of computers in schools
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``At $199, the NIC is less expensive than the cheapest PC, but
it is every bit as Internet capable,'' said Smith, who recently
left a job at CNET in The City to co-found the NIC Co. with
Ellison, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It supports popular plug-ins - meaning the NIC can view any
site a PC can. It has all the functionality of a PC with none of
the hassles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison had introduced the idea of a network computer nearly
five years ago, championing the advantages of centralized storage
in the office. Although Oracle subsidiary Network Computer Inc. did
market a network computer for a short time, the product failed to
capture a significant portion of the lucrative commercial computing
market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the formation of the NIC Co., Ellison and Smith will
set their sights on the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Network Computers (NCs) are computing devices which cost much
less than traditional PCs to buy and maintain,'' said Michael
Salort, a spokesman for the NIC Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one needs the fast, hard-drive heavy PCs anymore. It's
overkill,'' he said. ``Most people would not be able to tell the
difference in the speed of a top-end computer vs. a low-end
computer. People are paying through the nose for not only
purchasing devices up front, but also for maintaining them,
upgrading them.''

&HT;     LAND ROVER SOFTENS ELITE IMAGE, AND PRICES, TO EXPAND SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. _ Land Rover, the British
sport-utility-vehicle maker, drew a ``line in the mud'' last week
with the introduction of a new, entry-level model of its Discovery
II aimed at snagging some sales away from the popular Jeep Grand
Cherokee and other midsize SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   In the rugged setting of the Land Rover Driving School in the
heart of West Virginia's Appalachian Mountains, Discovery model
manager Kim McCullough showed off the V-8 powered $33,350 Discovery
II SD alongside a comparably priced six-cylinder Grand Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   She then watched as Land Rover driving instructors compared the
off-road capabilities of the two vehicles along a steep, muddy
demonstration course on the hunting grounds of the Greenbrier
resort, which is home to the driving school.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery II seemed to easily outperform the Grand Cherokee
on the slippery course, smoothly moving up and down the hills and
through deep ruts.
</P>
<P>
   But then, off-road prowess has always been Land Rover's forte;
the company's longtime role has been to provide the Brits with
capable but refined vehicles to traverse the wilderness areas of
their once-vast worldwide empire.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its tenure in the U.S. market, however _ since the
company arrived on these shores in 1987 _ Land Rover has been only
an upscale marketer of the elite, full-size Range Rover SUV,
designed for affluent consumers. Those vehicles now are priced from
the upper $50,000s to beyond $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the original Discovery model, introduced in the mid-1990s
with a beginning price in the middle $30,000s, Land Rover has
attempted to become more of a mass-marketer and compete against
high-end models of other popular midsize SUVs, such as the Grand
Cherokee, Mercedes-Benz M-class and Ford Explorer Limited.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, U.S. sales of the Discovery II _ a slightly
redesigned model _ increased more than 50 percent to 21,937,
accounting for about 40 percent of the brand's worldwide sales,
McCullough said.
</P>
<P>
   But to Land Rover, that's not good enough. Because of Land
Rover's perception among consumers that it offers only expensive
vehicles to elite buyers, ``We're not even getting on people's
shopping lists when they're considering vehicles like the Grand
Cherokee,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover is hoping to change that with the lower price of the
entry-level Discovery II, down from $34,150 last year. Not only has
the price been lowered, but content has been added, too.
</P>
<P>
   A faux-leather interior called Duragrain replaces the previous
cloth seats. And power seats have replaced manual seats up front.
The comparably priced Grand Cherokee has cloth seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we sell just one Discovery for every 11 Grand
Cherokees sold, and we think we can get that to two or maybe even
three,'' McCullough said. ``In fact, if we get it to three, I can
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   To help get its message across to U.S. consumers, Land Rover
last month fired its previous advertising agency and signed up
Austin, Texas-based GSD&AMP;M, the longtime agency for Southwest
Airlines and the state of Texas' tourism promotions.
</P>
<P>
   New GSD&AMP;M ads to promote the Land Rover brand will appear within
the next few days, said Jim Selwa, Land Rover's vice president for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real excited about this new campaign and this new
agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just how successful can Land Rover be with this new push into
the world of mass marketing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to ask them in England for a firm number, but I
believe they can turn out 150,000 Discovery II units a year if we
need them to,'' said Land Rover North America President Howard
Mosher, who also was on hand for the rollout of the lower-priced
Discovery model.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never maxed them out at the plant yet,'' he said. But he
also hinted that such a condition might be advantageous for Land
Rover as it prepares to be taken over by Ford Motor Co. Such
success might keep Ford from taking too active a role in managing
Land Rover.
</P>
<P>
   Ford last month announced that it would purchase the profitable
Land Rover operation from German parent BMW, and the takeover is
expected to be finalized by the end of June, Mosher said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why Land Rover officials were careful not to
mention the Ford Explorer _ which also is priced comparably to the
Discovery II _ in their ``line in the mud'' declaration of war
against the top-sellers in the midsize SUV class.
</P>
<P>
   The Explorer is the best-selling passenger vehicle in the
nation, and it has been almost from its introduction in 1990.
Worldwide sales total nearly 500,000 a year.

&HT;     SUBARU ZOOMS AHEAD WITH HYBRID SUV-SEDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   Is it a car, or is it a sport-utility with a trunk?
</P>
<P>
   That's the big question with the 2000 Subaru Legacy Outback
Sedan, a strange combination of vehicular concepts that just might
catch on with some consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of you out there have watched the growing sport-utility
vehicle craze from a detached point of view, and have never
seriously considered buying one of those big trucklike things.
</P>
<P>
   But then, perhaps on some occasions you just might like to have
a vehicle that can boldly go where your average family car has
never gone before.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the Outback Sedan, a cross between the very nice midsize
Legacy sedan and the beefy Legacy Outback wagon, the one that has
been touted in innumerable television commercials by Paul Hogan,
the Down Under comedian who starred in the Crocodile Dundee movies.
</P>
<P>
   Although I found that I liked this vehicle quite a lot, I must
take issue with one claim Subaru makes in its marketing literature:
The company bills this as ``the world's first sport-utility
sedan.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   American Motors Corp., the former Jeep company, made one in the
1980s called the AMC Eagle, which looked a lot like the Legacy
Outback but wasn't built nearly as well. A few of the old Eagles
are still around; I see one now and then.
</P>
<P>
   What these cars had in common was their high profile (for better
ground clearance) and four-wheel drive. But the Outback Sedan is
much more refined. Inside, it's more like a luxury car than a
sport-utility. It has Subaru's patented full-time all-wheel-drive
system, which makes for outstanding traction on all kinds of
terrain in all types of weather.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, people in places like Texas seldom have a need for
all-wheel drive in their daily commutes, but think about the
possibilities. The Outback Sedan probably would never get stuck in
the sand on Padre Island (well, never say never). And with its high
ground clearance _ 7.3 inches _ which approaches that of some
popular sport-utilities, it could clear some not-too-high rocks on
some desert back trails in Big Bend National Park.
</P>
<P>
   For ski trips to Colorado, it would be great _ nothing short of
a blizzard could stop it.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you're not planning a lot of off-the-beaten-track
excursions, it's still a great everyday car for those of you who
want a car and not one of those big SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not cheap, but it costs a lot less than comparably priced
midsize sport-utilities, so that could be a consideration for some
consumers. Base price of the Outback Sedan is $25,895 (plus $495
transportation), but it comes almost fully equipped for that money.
Our test model had only one option, a $260 subwoofer amplifier for
the audio system. That brought the total sticker to $26,650, about
$10,000 less than a well-equipped Toyota 4Runner or similar SUV.
</P>
<P>
   This essentially is a version of Subaru's flagship Legacy sedan,
which has been completely updated for 2000. It was so nice that I
felt as though I were in a much more expensive car.
</P>
<P>
   It came with leather interior, power moon roof,
AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo with six speakers,
power-everything, heated exterior mirrors and front seats, front
and side air bags for the front-seat occupants, four-wheel antilock
disc brakes, keyless entry, six-way power driver's seat, halogen
fog lights, air-conditioning, cruise control and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Standard is a smooth four-speed automatic transmission; no
manual transmission is available.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission links to the all-wheel-drive system, which
includes a viscous limited-slip rear differential for even better
foul-weather and off-road traction.
</P>
<P>
   The system automatically distributes power to all four wheels as
needed to maintain traction, with no driver input required. It can
vary the amount of power sent to each wheel at all speeds.
</P>
<P>
   This system isn't designed for serious off-roading; it has no
low-range gearing for the steep inclines, and the ground clearance
isn't enough to overcome the kinds of terrain you would find on
routes such as the famous Rubicon Trail in California's Sierra
Nevada range. But it has ample traction for dirt roads that you
wouldn't want to take the average family sedan on.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Outback comes with Subaru's 2.5 liter, 16-valve,
single-overhead-cam four-cylinder boxer engine that produces 165
horsepower and 166 foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Although I found the car a bit sluggish on initial starts
because of a lack of serious low-end torque, it performs well at
highway speeds. It's easy to get it going way over the speed limit
on the freeways. Top speed is well over 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Ride comfort is much better than you would find in even the
cushiest of truck-based sport-utilities, so if that is a
consideration but you still need foul-weather and off-road
capabilities, this might be the vehicle for you.
</P>
<P>
   Road handling is much better than that of the average SUV, too _
steering response is crisp, with no disturbing body lean in tight
curves, thanks to the Outback Sedan's comparatively lower center of
gravity. It's no sports car, but it doesn't drive like a pickup,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Five adults can fit inside _ two in the comfy front bucket seats
and three on the rear bench _ but like most cars in the midsize
segment, two would be more comfortable. The trunk has 12.4 cubic
feet of space for luggage and stuff, not huge, but adequate for
most needs.
</P>
<P>
   Competing cars, according to Subaru, include the Audi A4, Honda
Accord EX, Mazda 626, Mitsubishi Galant, Nissan Maxima, Oldsmobile
Intrigue and Toyota Camry. Of those, only Audi has all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard features include automatic-off headlights, dual
power mirrors, 16-inch alloy wheels with splash guards,
windshield-wiper de-icers, heavy-duty raised independent
suspension, front and rear stabilizer bars, daytime running lights,
power rack and pinion steering and a five-year/60,000 mile
powertrain warranty.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy is one of the Outback Sedan's greatest advantages
over the average sport-utility. EPA ratings are 22 miles per gallon
in the city and 27 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 16.9 gallons
of gasoline.

   WASHINGTON _ Having put in a magnificent performance as a
stand-up comic at last weekend's White House correspondents'
dinner, President Bill Clinton was back on deadly serious form on
May 2, tackling two of America's most worrying problems: the glass
ceiling that prevents parents from rising to the top at work, and
the difficulty of raising teenagers. All those honest folk who once
had to choose between climbing the greasy pole or weaning their
daughters off Black Sabbath will now be able to get the best of
both worlds _ and sue if anybody tries to stop them. &QL;

the past two years, yachting and power-boating have taken off in a
big way, particularly among the techies of the Pacific Northwest.
Total sales in the American recreational boating market were up
more than 19 percent in 1999. The link between boating and
confidence in laptop land appears to be a strong one. Despite the
travails of Nasdaq, larger purchases are still holding up; when the
high-tech admirals start leaving their vessels at the pier, it may
be time to bail out. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``Bogus asylum-seekers,'' bellows William Hague, the leader of
Britain's opposition Conservative Party, are ``flooding'' the
country, and Britain should lock them all up in detention centers
until they can be sorted.
</P>
<P>
   Germany ought to educate its own ``children instead of
(importing) Indians,'' roars his fellow conservative, Jurgen
Ruttgers, the Christian Democratic candidate for this month's
crunch election in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
</P>
<P>
   The European popular imagination, it seems, is gripped by panic
about foreigners: that there are too many of them pouring in, that
there is certainly no need for any more. In short, that Europe is
``full up.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that view, however, with some rather different
observations.
</P>
<P>
   Because Europeans are not having enough babies and are living so
long, the European Union would need to import 1.6 million migrants
a year simply to keep its working-age population stable between now
and 2050.
</P>
<P>
   With Europe's unemployment now falling, and its people
increasingly sniffy about the sorts of jobs they are prepared to
do, or too ill-equipped to do the high-tech ones being created, the
continent's work force is in need of renewal as never before.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants tend to inject into stale, aging countries fresh
vitality, fresh energy and an uncommon willingness to work hard at
unappealing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   How can Europe reconcile its economic need for more immigrants
with its apparent political distaste for them? In an ideal world,
there would be no barriers to the free movement of people, between
the various countries as within them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the curiosities of migration is that, even where
such barriers no longer exist, as within the EU, so few people
choose to pack up their belongings, uproot their families, and trek
off to settle in a foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   But human insecurities are not soothed by economic and
demographic logic alone, nor even much by clear evidence that
migrants are needed. Europeans seem to need reassurance that their
jobs, their culture, their sense of identity are not somehow under
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how to create a more liberal immigration regime
that can still be made politically palatable on a continent as
prone to xenophobia as Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Europe errs on the side of mean-mindedness. Since
the 1970s, it has more or less shut its doors to primary
immigration: that is, to economic migrants who might later bring
their relations too.
</P>
<P>
   These days, many of those who settle permanently in the EU are
the families of those who are already there.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, just as Europe has been busy bolting up its front door, so
those seeking a better life in the rich countries of the Union have
increasingly resorted to finding ways in around the back.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1980s, there has been an upsurge in the numbers of
people seeking political asylum, and _ though they are difficult to
measure _ in the numbers of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine refugees from persecution, as defined by the 1951 Geneva
Convention, should be welcomed in the EU without reservation. They
should be confident of this welcome, and Europeans should be proud
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, and though it is politically incorrect to say so, even a
cursory glance at the numbers of asylum claims judged to be false
suggests that many of those hoping to gain entry as political
refugees are economic migrants in disguise.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that asylum-seekers ``shop around'' for the
best deal: research shows clearly that the chief reason they, like
all migrants, head for one country rather than another is that they
know people already there.
</P>
<P>
   Even if EU countries were to harmonize their provision for
refugees, as they have promised to do, existing patterns would
probably change little: the networks that draw asylum-seekers to,
above all, Germany and Britain have taken on a life of their own.
</P>
<P>
   What the many asylum claims do suggest, however, is that a
clampdown on bogus refugees by itself is only a half-solution.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, economic migrants would not have to dress
themselves up as refugees, nor to make those hazardous journeys
crammed into the cargo holds of rickety boats or the containers of
long-distance trucks, if there were an alternative way of applying
to get in legally _ with some hope of success.
</P>
<P>
   If the EU were to install a more orderly system of admitting
economic migrants _ both the high-tech ones it needs to fashion its
software and the less skilled ones it needs to pick its lettuces
and gut its chickens _ would that really curb the numbers of
illegals getting ready to make their dash across the continent's
borders?
</P>
<P>
   That is one objection made by those who oppose the introduction
of a more generous policy towards immigrants. It may be, they say,
that today's image of Fortress Europe deters some of tomorrow's
would-be migrants, and that a more liberal system to admit
outsiders legally would only encourage yet others to slip in on the
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, however, it is a risk that Europe should be ready to
take. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A more persuasive objection is that any regime that concentrated
on luring the highly skilled would run the risk of robbing poorer
countries of the people they are least able to do without. Yet even
poor countries can benefit when emigres send home the remittances
they earn in the rich world.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians face a choice. They can either pander to the fears
of voters about being ``swamped'' by outsiders, or they can seek to
reassure them that those worries are only half-founded.
</P>
<P>
   As unemployment rates fall in most European countries, the task
of reassurance ought to become easier. For the moment, however,
Europe's politicians show little inclination to be brave.
</P>
<P>
   How many British politicians advertise the fact that, in terms
of the number of asylum-seekers it accepts per head of population,
Britain lies halfway down the EU table? How many German politicians
remind their voters that as many foreigners, including lots of
refugees, are now leaving Germany as are coming in?
</P>
<P>
   The greatest pity of all would be if the EU's governments at
last managed to agree to a more orderly joint system of
immigration, only to appeal to the lowest, most illiberal, common
denominator. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   It has been a strange week in the playroom of American
presidential politics. Foreign policy has not just been mentioned,
but actually debated.
</P>
<P>
   In an unexpectedly vicious attack on George W. Bush, Al Gore
accused his opponent of being an isolationist, fixated by Cold-War
ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's camp has responded with jabs about the Clinton
administration's policy towards Russia. There is even something of
a debate going on about China's accession to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally nobody expects this to last. Why should the American
electorate consider anything so tedious as global security, free
trade or missile defense when there are serious things to campaign
about _ such as the Confederate flag flying in South Carolina, or
missing White House e-mails?
</P>
<P>
   This attitude is perhaps understandable: the last person to make
much noise about foreign policy was Bush's father, who lost to Bill
Clinton partly because the latter promised to concentrate on
domestic policy.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still wrong and _ as President Bush might have put it
_ getting wronger.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, foreign policy is one of the few things where
being president matters. The next president's domestic economic
policy has in many ways already been ``outsourced'' to the Federal
Reserve: even Bill Clinton seems to have given up the fiction that
he, rather than Alan Greenspan, runs the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government supplies only seven cents in every dollar
spent in the country's schools. And the states have been acquiring
ever more power over various parts of social policy.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, defense _ only one part of the foreign policy
equation, but a vital one _ accounts for about half of
discretionary federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world has always presented presidents with
intractable problems. But, recently, it seems to have placed ever
more pressure on the president. Globalization is binding America's
economy ever more tightly into those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Cold War has in many ways made the job of running
the western alliance a much harder, subtler task. Allies are less
willing to accept the dictates of Washington, and it is often even
harder to convince congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalism's triumph over communism has in a sense given every
American politician an excuse to break ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Against this background, Bill Clinton has proved a mildly
disappointing foreign-policy president. His poor first-term start
can perhaps be put down to his promise to focus on matters at home
_ and to the sheer novelty of the post-Cold-War world.
</P>
<P>
   He can also point to an increasingly obstructionist Congress.
But the overall impression has been of episodic and inconsistent
attention; his considerable diplomatic skills have been employed
only fitfully.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, this approach eventually muddled through (most
notably, in Bosnia); in other cases, the lack of any consistent
agenda has been startling (with China, there seem to have been
several successive policies).
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Republican Congress proves unexpectedly cooperative
or Clinton himself unusually decisive, the outgoing president will
leave behind a few outright successes, notably the North American
Free-Trade Agreement (though Bush senior had done some of the
spadework); a few outright failures, such as the defeat of the
Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty; plenty of currently unsolved cases
(Northern Ireland, Cuba, missiles, and, inevitably, the Middle
East); and unclear messages on everything from America's vision for
the United Nations and the World Trade Organization (WTO) to when
exactly the United States thinks that humanitarian intervention is
justified.
</P>
<P>
   This, it should be repeated, is not a disastrous bequest. But at
the very least it challenges the next occupant of the Oval Office
to do better.
</P>
<P>
   One unfortunate consequence of the sidelining of foreign policy
is that there is relatively little evidence available to assess the
capacity of either Gore or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Both would claim to be internationalists. Gore fought hard for
NAFTA, and his current attempts to rethink foreign policy show
enthusiasm for the subject.
</P>
<P>
   As governor of Texas, Bush can hardly be judged on his
foreign-policy achievements, but he has been a prominent supporter
of immigration (not a bad guide in Republican terms) and he has
inherited an experienced foreign-policy team from his father.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, also doubts about both men. In his attempt
to court the unions, Gore has added ``fair trade'' to his own
somewhat flaky ideas about green trade. These helped destroy the
serious side of the WTO's meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And it remains to be seen how the vice president's close
exposure to Clinton's modus operandi has affected his own strategy.
Letting a problem fester into a crisis and then using your
considerable diplomatic charm to solve it is almost excusable if
you possess Clinton's powers of persuasion; in other hands it would
be mad.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush, there is nothing in his record to support Gore's
charge that he is an isolationist _ though there are some in the
Republican Party who plainly err in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has made unilateral noises _ about America intervening
abroad only when ``its interests'' are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on how those interests are defined. In some cases _
China perhaps _ a little hard-nosed realpolitik is called for. In
other cases, such as Kosovo and Bosnia, it is hard to see how the
United States' foreign policy could avoid having a humanitarian
edge.
</P>
<P>
   If the president did not put it there, American voters, watching
the ghastly events on CNN, soon would.
</P>
<P>
   Putting morality into foreign policy has been a card played
mostly by the Democrats _ but not exclusively so; former President
Ronald Reagan did it most successfully. The difficult thing is
deciding how much morality _ and making sure that the rest of the
world happens to agree with it.
</P>
<P>
   These are, in short, thorny problems. But they require
consistency, character and attention from the two men who want to
be president.
</P>
<P>
   The two both remain novices. Yet their new attention to worldly
matters is welcome _ if it is sustained. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The Anglo-Saxons are back. For nearly a thousand years, no one
gave them much thought.
</P>
<P>
   A few poor wretches had to study their poetry, but most people,
if they learned anything about them, discovered only that Bede was
venerable, Beowulf boring, Alfred burned some cakes and the good,
short words in English, notably those spelled with asterisks
instead of vowels, were coined by the heathen Germans who occupied
most of what is today called England between 449 and 1066.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the Anglo-Saxons are everywhere. They pop up in
the context of stock options, shareholder value and neo-American
capitalism, or rather (here's a clue) les stock options, la
shareholder value et le capitalisme neo-americain.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is the French who have restored the Anglo-Saxons to
prominence, though others _ even The Economist _ seem ready to
adopt their usage. Which is a bit odd really, because whatever the
Anglo-Saxons may have done for poetry, they were not noted for
groundbreaking work in macroeconomics and double-entry bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the early Germanic nations had an admirably free
trade in subjects for their epic poems. It is true that an early
editor of this newspaper noted that ``the religion of gold...is the
natural idol of the Anglo-Saxon.''
</P>
<P>
   But was Walter Bagehot an Anglo-Saxon? Was Adam Smith, come to
that, or Ricardo, or Rockefeller _ or even their latter-day
disciples such as Alan Greenspan, Warren Buffett, Jacob Rothschild,
George Soros and every other capitalist who happens to have English
as his native tongue?
</P>
<P>
   The restoration of the Anglo-Saxons' hegemony is even odder than
that. Readers may have noticed that their first run came to an end
in 1066. That was another clue: yes, it was the Normans _ aka,
nowadays, the French _ who knocked the poor old Anglo-Saxons off
their pedestal, once and for all, as most people thought.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the French squash the English, introducing fancy
words like mutton and pork and beef for the posh folk indoors,
while the downtrodden peasants stuck to good old sheep and pig and
cow, but, quite independently of 1066 and all that, they fizzed up
the entire intellectual scene, just as they did throughout western
Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   So why resurrect this vanquished enemy and turn it into a
bogeyman? A bogeyman it has certainly become.
</P>
<P>
   In France Anglo-Saxonism is held responsible not just for all
the wickedness of global capitalism, but also, to judge by a recent
trawl through the French press, for espionage (the Echelon
scandal), pragmatism (ugh), experimental empiricism (ugh, ugh), the
adversarial judicial system (far inferior to the French
alternative) and transparency (no, not ooh-la-la, alas).
</P>
<P>
   The current Paris jazz fair has prompted a critic to declare
that Anglo-Saxon jazz is ``not systematically better'' (was Louis
Armstrong really French, perhaps, coming from New Orleans, and not
Anglo-Saxon after all?).
</P>
<P>
   And not long ago a rugby match had Le Monde decrying
``Anglo-Saxon refereeing,'' under the headline ``Coup de sifflet:
facheuse tendance anglo-saxonne.'' Should Anglo-Saxophony really
get the blame for all this, or is there a better term?
American-British, English-speaking or plain liberal, perhaps,
depending on the context?
</P>

   Suggestions on a postcard, please, to L'Academie Francaise,

   Over the past three decades, the Republican ticket has carried
North Carolina in every presidential election except one _ in 1976,
when Jimmy Carter of neighboring Georgia won.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, however, Jim Hunt, a Democrat, won four
elections for governor. He lost a political race only once, in
1984, when Jesse Helms beat him for a seat in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   His political strength has been a bulwark for his party against
a rising tide of Republicanism, and has put him on the (rather
long) shortlist of potential running-mates for Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state constitution, Hunt cannot seek a third
consecutive term as governor this year. His absence from the ballot
touched off spirited races for both the Democratic and Republican
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In the primaries on May 2, Republican voters chose Richard
Vinroot, a lanky one-time college-basketball player and former
mayor of Charlotte, as their nominee.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the Republican nomination four years ago as a
relatively moderate Republican, Vinroot hired a former Helms
strategist to recast his image. He emerged as a more aggressive and
right-leaning candidate, defeating two veteran state legislators in
a campaign in which the candidates scrambled to prove who was most
ardently against abortion and gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Vinroot apologized for his ``mistake'' in having, as mayor, cut
the ribbon to open a Planned Parenthood facility in Charlotte.
Apparently, he didn't know that some clinics run by the nonprofit
agency performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would restrain the growth of state government,
promised not to raise taxes and advocated voucher programs to help
pupils attend private schools. He also proclaimed his opposition to
a state-run lottery, though he indicated that he would not object
to a referendum on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, chose Michael Easley as their nominee. The
telegenic attorney-general with a flair for political creativity
scored a landslide victory over the lieutenant-governor, Dennis
Wicker.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates promised to build on the education reforms of
Hunt (Easley, in particular, wants a state lottery to help pay for
education), and to attack the fouling of air and water by
industrial pig farms scattered across the state's coastal plain.
</P>
<P>
   As a prosecutor in a coastal district in the 1980s, Easley
earned a reputation as a crime-fighter unafraid to take on illegal
drug merchants and corruption in public office.
</P>
<P>
   During his eight years as attorney-general, he raised his
visibility by appearing in TV commercials warning consumers against
fraudulent practices.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is America's largest tobacco-growing state, but,
even so, Easley helped negotiate the settlement that required
cigarette manufacturers to pay billions to state governments.
</P>
<P>
   He was also behind the scheme to put about $2 billion of North
Carolina's take from the tobacco settlement into a charitable
foundation to rebuild rural communities.
</P>
<P>
   In the November elections, there is likely to be some interplay
between the presidential contest and the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Recent history suggests that George W. Bush, the Republican,
starts with an advantage in North Carolina, but the Gore campaign
has signalled that it plans to compete in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore fails to win there, the fact that he is campaigning
will force the Bush campaign to expend time and money _ and it will
give the Democrats a stronger chance of holding the governor's
office. &QL;

<P>
   If you are looking for a demonstration of raw political power,
forget about the elder Daley's Chicago, Tammany Hall or any of
those strange shenanigans they get up to in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, consider Gray Davis's California.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom might say that party machines are a thing of
the past. But on the face of things, the mild-mannered governor has
amassed the sort of political clout that his more brutal
predecessors only dreamed about.
</P>
<P>
   The intriguing question is why he uses it so sparingly. Davis
won election in 1998 by a stunning 20 percentage points. He will
probably be reelected in 2002, unless Al Gore makes him his vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Davis's troops hold 25 of the 40 seats in the state Senate; 47
of the 80 seats in the state Assembly; both federal Senate seats;
and 28 of the 52 seats held by the California delegation to the
House of Representatives. All but two of the statewide elected
officials are Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In the primary in March, Al Gore beat George W. Bush by seven
percentage points, and in the latest polls the vice president looks
likely to carry California just as Bill Clinton did in the last two
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   More telling, perhaps, is the complete shambles that the
Republicans find themselves in. Even the two state officers who
managed to win in the teeth of the Davis Democratic landslide are
in poor shape today.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jones, the state secretary, backed John McCain rather than
Bush in the primary in March this year, putting him out of favor
with the mass of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charles Quackenbush, the centrist insurance
commissioner who briefly seemed the Republicans' last best hope, is
going down in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Were Davis a more Machiavellian type, it would be tempting to
imagine him plotting the hearing Quackenbush recently had to endure
in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the insurance commissioner admitted, it had not been wise
to forgive the large fines owed by insurance firms that had failed
to pay victims of the Northridge earthquake in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it had been a bad idea to let them make rather smaller
contributions to foundations he had set up.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was not good that the foundations had given none of this
money to the earthquake victims but, instead _ among other things _
to a football camp that Quackenbush's sons attended.
</P>
<P>
   All that stands between California's Republicans and utter
collapse is the hope that Bush, at the top of the ticket in
November, will pull them through the election without losing any
more seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 425) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The only apparent constitutional brake on Democratic ambitions
is the requirement that the state budget pass by a two-thirds
majority; this ensures that as long as the Republicans retain their
seats in the state Senate, their views cannot be altogether
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are now praying that Bush does not follow his
father's example and in effect abandon California, giving the
Democrats a chance to increase their majority.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, Davis's battalions will probably control the
redistricting process next year, giving them another chance to lock
in the party's advantages for the future. Big Business certainly
seems to have reached that conclusion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,075) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Davis has raised a record $1.2 million a month since taking
office at the beginning of 1999. Not only have habitual Democratic
supporters such as the unions and lawyers showered money on him,
but also the oil industry, agriculture, and such stalwart
Republican paymasters as Gallo, Fox and GTE.
</P>
<P>
   These defections are extremely pleasing for Democrats. But they
also reflect Davis's pitch to his corporate backers. He portrays
himself as a regulatory and fiscal conservative who offers
insurance against the wilder instincts of the left wing of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   The last two Democrats elected governor _ both members of the
Brown dynasty _ built up the state institutions California
Democrats cherish: Pat introduced grand educational and
infrastructure programs, while son Jerry expanded the state's green
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals who had hoped for more of the same from Davis have
watched in dismay as he has vetoed all but a small set of measures
creating performance indices for schools (and some would argue that
this is a Republican idea).
</P>
<P>
   A cautious soul who has devoted most of his life to crawling
slowly up the ladder of California Democratic Party politics (and
who has endured endless taunts about the aptness of his first
name), Davis seems convinced that the lesson of his own landslide
is that drawing away from the center in pursuit of a radical agenda
is to court disaster.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Pete Wilson, was a moderate Republican, but he
listened to the extremist wing of his party by endorsing an
anti-immigrant program. That helped secure Wilson's own reelection
in 1994, but it also stirred up a backlash among California's many
Latinos and Asians that wiped out Davis's Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   A policy of clinging to the center is not without risks. A
warning shot, showing how the Democrats might be sunk, was fired in
March last year.
</P>
<P>
   A pocket of California that did appear truly one-party, where
the question was not ``Which party do you like?'' but ``Which
faction within the party do you like?'' _ a perpetually Democratic
assembly seat in Oakland where no Republican had even bothered to
run _ elected the first Green representative in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader, a Californian, has promised a Green run at the
presidency this year, and could carve support away from the
Democrats' left flank.
</P>
<P>
   There is even the chance of Seattle-hardened rowdies disrupting
Davis's showpiece _ the Democratic Convention to be held in Los
Angeles in August.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the odds are that Davis has got it right. The truth is that
California is not a one-party state but a no-party state. Its
policies are increasingly dictated by ballot propositions voted on
directly by the people.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits have winnowed away the professional politicians and
knocked holes in the boilers of the party machines.
</P>
<P>
   Davis's paralysis is the fear of a politician who has lived
through tax revolts and has seen the punishment that voters mete
out to mainstream parties.
</P>
<P>
   He has achieved party dominance at precisely the time that the
country's fastest-evolving state is reaching beyond the party lines
that have defined American politics in the 20th century. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Having put in a magnificent performance as a
stand-up comic at last weekend's White House correspondents'
dinner, President Bill Clinton was back on deadly serious form on
May 2, tackling two of America's most worrying problems: the glass
ceiling that prevents parents from rising to the top at work, and
the difficulty of raising teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear that terrible ceiling crack as Clinton
issued his executive order banning federal employers from denying
people jobs or promotions because of their parental obligations.
</P>
<P>
   All those honest folk who once had to make a choice between
climbing the greasy pole or weaning their daughters off Black
Sabbath will now be able to get the best of both worlds _ and sue
if anybody tries to stop them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to send a clear signal to employers that there is
nothing wrong with being a parent,'' said Bruce Reed, the
president's chief domestic policy adviser, in one of the bravest
speeches of his career.
</P>
<P>
   There were nevertheless two big disappointments. First, the
private sector is still dead set against parental rights, on the
extraordinary grounds that it ``targets a nonexistent problem'' and
creates yet more opportunities for frivolous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a little harsh to say that this is part of the
conspiracy of the childless to preserve their control of corporate
America. But it is worth noting that, in a recent survey of the
heads of America's biggest companies, exclusive to The Economist,
only 10 percent reported having any kids ``that they know of.''
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is an all-too-familiar one with the Clinton
White House: vagueness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his attack on discrimination at a conference
attended by many of the country's leading experts on raising
teenagers. The experts came up with some superb solutions to the
teenage problem, but the White House (recently free of its own
teenager) failed to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   The conference recommended that families should ``break bread
together.'' A Council of Economic Advisers report found that
teenagers who dine regularly with their parents are less likely to
become involved with alcohol, drugs, violence or sex (no, we are
not making that up).
</P>
<P>
   But what sort of bread should they break? What is the optimum
combination of foods to promote healthy teenage growth? Should they
eat fish on Friday and roast beef on Sunday? And, if so, what
options should be provided for the inevitable sulking vegetarians?
</P>
<P>
   The White House was also worryingly silent on how to prevent
women from bearing a disproportionate share of the burden of
preparing all these family meals.
</P>
<P>
   Should the government offer tax credits so that more men can
learn to cook? Or should it issue an executive order mandating that
men must do all the table-setting and dishwashing?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the conference recommended that parents should give
their children more chores, on the grounds that these help them be
``effective, contributing members of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   But parents should be careful how often they ask their teenagers
to take out the trash or pick up their clothes from the floor,
since federal regulations are strict about hours worked without
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The last recommendation is the most dangerously vague of all:
that employers should provide flexitime for all parents who have
teenagers living at home.
</P>
<P>
   But how do we know that these parents will use their flexitime
wisely? There are grounds for thinking that at least some of them
will spend their time vegetating on the couch in front of ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer,'' with or without their teenage progeny, rather
than offering counselling on the evils of sex, drink and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal solution, from all sorts of perspectives, might be to
recruit a corps of people who can report, discreetly of course, on
whether people are using their ``parenting time'' wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton would make an ideal chief family monitor. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Having put in a magnificent performance as a
stand-up comic at last weekend's White House correspondents'
dinner, President Bill Clinton was back on deadly serious form on
May 2, tackling two of America's most worrying problems: the glass
ceiling that prevents parents from rising to the top at work, and
the difficulty of raising teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   You could almost hear that terrible ceiling crack as Clinton
issued his executive order banning federal employers from denying
people jobs or promotions because of their parental obligations.

   ANNAPOLIS, MD. _ Is the high-tech party over, as Nasdaq bucks
and slides? Not if messing about in boats is anything to go by.
</P>
<P>
   Buying something that needs a rudder has always been an
indicator of economic confidence (few people need a boat to take
the children to school).
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, yachting and power-boating have taken
off in a big way, especially among the techies of the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   James Denn, executive editor of Boating Industry International
magazine, reports that total sales in the American recreational
boating market were up more than 19 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the plushest yachts actually come from Germany. But
Sailing/Cruising World magazine still reckons that sailing-boat
production in North America increased by 16 percent from 1998 to
1999, with strong growth in the large (over 36-foot) boat sector.
</P>
<P>
   Boating-accessory sales are booming, too. Don Durant, the owner
of Club Nautique/Cruising Specialists, a San Francisco firm, has
seen fresh demand for his products at close hand. Since March 1999
``it's been almost straight uphill.''
</P>
<P>
   Are his customers mostly the IT crowd? ``And how! We're close to
Silicon Valley so we're seeing a huge increase in buyers with cash
as opposed to credit. Lots of people with bonuses, options,
founder's stock, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand miles away in Annapolis, Md., Rob Emmet, the
owner of Performance Yacht Systems, a boating-accessory e-business
set up in 1997, noticed demand from areas such as Silicon Valley
and the Northwest almost immediately. Orders came from the Seattle
area ``even before we advertised.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology folk are not known for their love of natural light,
let alone the great outdoors. Boats seem to be an exception.
</P>
<P>
   The influence of technology gurus such as Bill Gates
(Microsoft), Larry Ellison (Oracle) and Jim Clark (Netscape), all
owners of extremely sleek sail or power yachts, cannot be
discounted.
</P>
<P>
   Durant says he saw a flow diagram published recently showing the
steps to going public. One of the steps was ``Order new yacht.''
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of this watery enthusiasm has been sated on borrowed
money.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Bankers Association recorded a 25 percent
growth in marine loans booked for 1998, with similar figures
expected for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in the industry holds that interest-rate
fluctuations have a great impact on the purchase of boats. Now
people are beginning to talk about there being so much credit
available that the old rules no longer apply.
</P>
<P>
   The link between boating and confidence in laptop land appears
to be a strong one. Despite the travails of Nasdaq, larger
purchases are still holding up.
</P>
<P>
   When the high-tech admirals start leaving their vessels at the
pier, it may be time to bail out. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ All the talk in technology publishing is of the
``thud factor.'' Subscribers are said to prefer computer magazines
that make a loud slap when they hit the desk. If that is true,
American readers are certainly getting what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Technology magazines today are as thick as telephone books. The
current issues of the six leading technology publications _
Business 2.0, Fast Company, the Industry Standard, Red Herring,
Upside and Wired _ boast between 300 and 600 pages each.
</P>
<P>
   And soon there will be even more thuds. This week, Time Inc.'s
Fortune is launching a new magazine called eCompany Now, whose
first issue runs to more than 300 pages.
</P>
<P>
   And this autumn, Business 2.0 and the Industry Standard are
launching European editions.
</P>
<P>
   This is, to some extent, a media bubble inflated by the larger
Internet bubble. Hundreds of Internet start-ups need to advertise
to develop their brands.
</P>
<P>
   The six leading tech magazines _ all monthlies, except the
Industry Standard, which is a weekly _ increased their combined
number of advertising pages in January and February by 150 percent
on the same period last year, to 2,390, according to Adscope, a
market-research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy tech rags are nothing new. In the heyday of the PC,
computer publications offering everything but the kitchen sink to
computer hobbyists were over 1,000 pages thick.
</P>
<P>
   The new generation of magazines, however, is different. They are
not about the nuts and bolts of computers: they are about how the
world is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Upside (205,000 circulation) and Red Herring (163,000) are the
granddaddies of the genre. Originally pure Silicon Valley
publications, they are now trying to broaden their base.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring, in particular, wants to spread the word about the
region's innovation model. Wired (469,000) and Fast Company
(403,000) added lifestyle to the mix in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Wired, now owned by Conde Nast after an aborted attempt at a
stock market flotation in 1996, has morphed from being a central
organ of the cyber-elite into an interesting read about
cutting-edge technologies. Fast Company is a sort of Cosmopolitan
for middle managers in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard (150,000) and Business 2.0 (210,000), both
founded in 1998, are the newest entrants. They are targeted at the
``transformers'' (Business 2.0) or ``e-strategists'' (Industry
Standard) _ senior managers who are involved in their company's
Internet strategy and yearn for guidance in these difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers love this crowd, which is why there are more and
more non-technology advertisements in these magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Their readers are youngish (on average about 38 years old),
highly educated (almost half have a postgraduate degree), affluent
(the average household income is well above $100,000) and
influential (more than 50 percent are in top management).
</P>
<P>
   The ad rates are correspondingly pricey. The Industry Standard,
for example, charges $139 per thousand copies in circulation,
compared with $86 for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two months of this year the San-Francisco-based
magazine, which had already increased its advertising pages by 440
percent in 1999, outpaced the mainstream magazines in advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Although their riches come from the new economy, these
publications are solidly old media. They use the Internet for
promotion _ the Industry Standard sends out more than 10 million
e-mail newsletters per month _ but their focus is on the
old-fashioned paper product.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, beginning to exploit their brand profitably
in new businesses. The Industry Standard, for example, is charging
an impressive $4,300 for its three-day Internet summit in July, and
has sold 400 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics predict that these streams of money will soon dry up,
once the Internet bubble bursts. Many dot.com ads will certainly go
away, but surely not the interest in technology news.
</P>
<P>
   A correction might even be a good thing: readers are starting to
complain about information overload and too many advertisements.
That is mainly why Business 2.0 and Red Herring will go biweekly _
and so a bit thinner _ some time this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger threat comes from the mainstream business titles.
They have moved into the tech magazines' territory, increasing
their technology coverage substantially and have launched
technology supplements. (The Economist, too, plans a quarterly
supplement for later this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the tech magazines is that they may fall victim
to exactly what they so often predict: as technology becomes
ubiquitous, magazines devoted solely to that field will find
themselves obsolete. &QL;

for middle managers in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard (150,000) and Business 2.0 (210,000), both
founded in 1998, are the newest entrants. They are targeted at the
``transformers'' (Business 2.0) or ``e-strategists'' (Industry
Standard) _ senior managers who are involved in their company's
Internet strategy and yearn for guidance in these difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers love this crowd, which is why there are more and
more non-technology advertisements in these magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Their readers are youngish (on average about 38 years old),
highly educated (almost half have a postgraduate degree), affluent
(the average household income is well above $100,000) and
influential (more than 50 percent are in top management).
</P>
<P>
   The ad rates are correspondingly pricey. The Industry Standard,
for example, charges $139 per thousand copies in circulation,
compared with $86 for Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two months of this year the San-Francisco-based
magazine, which had already increased its advertising pages by 440
percent in 1999, outpaced the mainstream magazines in advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Although their riches come from the new economy, these
publications are solidly old media. They use the Internet for
promotion _ the Industry Standard sends out more than 10 million
e-mail newsletters per month _ but their focus is on the
old-fashioned paper product.
</P>
<P>
   They are, however, beginning to exploit their brand profitably
in new businesses. The Industry Standard, for example, is charging
an impressive $4,300 for its three-day Internet summit in July, and
has sold 400 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics predict that these streams of money will soon dry up,
once the Internet bubble bursts. Many dot.com ads will certainly go
away, but surely not the interest in technology news.
</P>
<P>
   A correction might even be a good thing: readers are starting to
complain about information overload and too many advertisements.
That is mainly why Business 2.0 and Red Herring will go biweekly _
and so a bit thinner _ some time this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger threat comes from the mainstream business titles.
They have moved into the tech magazines' territory, increasing
their technology coverage substantially and have launched
technology supplements. (The Economist, too, plans a quarterly
supplement for later this year.)
</P>
<P>
   The danger for the tech magazines is that they may fall victim
to exactly what they so often predict: as technology becomes
ubiquitous, magazines devoted solely to that field will find
themselves obsolete. &QL;

<P>
   SAO PAULO _ The skies over South America are going to get
emptier.
</P>
<P>
   On April 28 a new rescue plan for Aerolineas Argentinas drawn up
by the Boston Consulting Group was leaked to La Nacion, an
Argentine newspaper. It involves big cuts in domestic and
international services, and the loss of perhaps 1,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, TAM and Transbrasil, two of Brazil's four big
airlines, said they were discussing an ``operational partnership''
to cut the overlap between their flights, a step widely seen as
leading to an eventual merger and thus significant cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, the deeply indebted Vasp, another of
Brazil's big four, had announced the ``temporary'' suspension of
its flights to North America and Europe from the middle of this
month, after Boeing had demanded some of its airplanes back because
Vasp was not keeping up its lease payments.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first hint that Vasp is in difficulties. Last
year, a check for part of its arrears in airport fees bounced; now
Infraero, the airports authority, insists on being paid weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian post office stopped using Vasp to carry letters,
claiming that the airline had faked a document to keep the
contract. Vasp denies this. Pilots and other staff took the firm to
court last month after they were not paid.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, many of the region's airlines expanded their
capacity, expecting demand to rise. But it shrank in the wake of
Brazil's devaluation crisis in early 1999, at the same time as the
airlines were facing ever more competition from airlines in the
United States, which enjoy bigger economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   Aerolineas Argentinas, as well as being squeezed on
long-distance flights by North American competition, has faced
growing pressure on domestic and regional routes from LAPA and
other local airlines that set up after Argentina's deregulation of
services in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, just when the industry's prospects were looking
up, along came the surge in the price of oil _ and thus of aviation
fuel _ to add to the squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   New figures for Brazil's domestic flights in the first quarter
show that only 58 percent of seats were taken. That is a little
higher than the same period last year, but Bob Booth, president of
AvMan, a Miami-based airline consultancy, says that around 65
percent seat occupation is the industry's typical break-even point.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that some rationalization might make sense. But
how much? There are some, such as Francisco Gros, president of the
Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES), who reckon that there might be
room for only one large local airline in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   LAPA's boss, Ronnie Boyd, has suggested that the same may be
true of Argentina. Gros points to Canada and Mexico, where in each
case the two big local airlines have merged.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Vasp suggested combining Brazil's big four into one,
but at the time it could not persuade the others to join.
</P>
<P>
   Given that Brazil's competition authorities have just approved a
monopolistic merger between the country's two biggest brewers with
only a few restrictions, it is perfectly possible to imagine them
waving through a domestic air monopoly, even though they are
currently investigating the airlines over allegations of a price
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   But Booth reckons that it is unduly pessimistic to argue that
there is room for only one local airline per country outside
America: Australia continues with two large local carriers, and
recent ticket-price rises are attracting foreign airlines to start
competing on domestic routes there.
</P>
<P>
   There is scope for some South American carriers to cut costs by
retiring older aircraft (which can guzzle up to 40 percent more
fuel than new ones) and standardizing fleets to cut training and
maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo Pereira, an analyst at Banco Pactual in Rio de Janeiro,
adds that in-flight service on some short routes is over-elaborate,
so a cheap no-frills airline could survive alongside one of the
existing operators.
</P>
<P>
   In North America, the business of cutting out travel agents and
selling tickets directly to customers over the Internet is saving
airlines money. But it is only just starting in South America.
</P>
<P>
   And Brazilian airlines are looking forward to the outcome of
their case against the government over a price freeze in 1986-92:
Transbrasil has already won compensation of 725 million reais ($400
million) over this (most of which went to paying off its
social-security debts), and the others hope for similar payouts.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, though, the region's economy is now back on
track for growth. Since air travel, per head of the population, is
still way below North American levels, the industry's long-term
prospects ought to be good.
</P>
<P>
   Projections for the next decade by America's Federal Aviation
Authority (FAA) say that the world's fastest growth rates are
likely to be in Latin America. And, as other parts of the world
have seen, airlines can come back from the dead. Lufthansa and
Iberia did it in Europe; so did Mexicana and Aeromexico in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   There may be space in South America's skies for more airlines
than the past year's terrible results suggest. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the condemned home of sleazy stockbroking
practices to the shining temple of cutting-edge technology-company
shares in only five years, Nasdaq's image has undergone quite a
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, allegations of price-fixing by brokers, and an
investigation by the Department of Justice, suggested that the
world's second-biggest stock market's days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, crowds gather most days to pay homage to the ``new
economy'' at Nasdaq's new giant multicolored share-price screen in
New York's Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq is rapidly taking its technology gospel to the corners of
the earth. On May 3, it took a giant step towards its goal of
creating the ``first global digital stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal between the London and Frankfurt stock
exchanges, the new entity will create a joint venture with Nasdaq,
under the Nasdaq brand. This will replace its earlier planned
Nasdaq Europe, launched last November, and will combine with
Frankfurt's Neuer Markt for tech stocks and London's less
successful techMARK.
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredients of a 24-hour global Nasdaq stock market are
now in place. Last week it announced a deal with the government of
Quebec to launch Nasdaq Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999 it agreed to launch Nasdaq Japan with Softbank, an
Internet venture firm. This exchange is to go live later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq claims a ``special relationship'' with Sydney's stock
market, and says that negotiations are under way with South
Korea's.
</P>
<P>
   Already up and running, albeit on a modest scale, is a deal with
the Hong Kong Stock Exchange that allows some of Nasdaq's main
shares to trade in Hong Kong, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, this global alliance will allow companies to gain
access to foreign capital more easily, says Frank Zarb, the chief
executive appointed to clean up Nasdaq after the price-fixing
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And it will make it easier for investors to trade in shares
listed abroad, as long as they meet the regulatory requirements of
the country in which the investor is located.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb expects shares in as many as 500 companies to change hands
around the clock throughout the world within three to five years.
Whether this is what investors want remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Since the merger of Daimler and Chrysler, almost all of the
trading in the new firm's shares has shifted to Frankfurt, during
German trading hours, even though the shares are listed around the
world, which is hardly encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   Still, big institutional investors certainly want fewer
exchanges. And retail investors will welcome easier access to
foreign shares.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb can be well pleased with his success, particularly as his
exchange seems to offer little to its foreign partners. Few foreign
exchanges will want to import Nasdaq's strange market structure,
which reflects America's quirky system of stock market regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq is the automated share-price quotation system of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, a self-regulatory body
for broker-dealers.
</P>
<P>
   It has an increasingly competitive relationship with those
broker-dealers that run their own electronic-trading systems, known
as ECNs. Yet order-handling rules introduced to stop price-fixing
in effect make Nasdaq subsidize some of these ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's foreign partners would be mad to copy that. And
questions still remain about how good a price investors get on the
Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, despite its popularity with technology companies, is
Nasdaq's own trading technology much cop. Problems with it are one
reason why it asked the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
main market watchdog, to delay the introduction of decimal pricing
of shares (instead of 16ths of a dollar) until next year _ to the
delight of the rival New York Stock Exchange, the world's largest,
which has its technology ready now.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasdaq has at least done a better job than the NYSE of
transforming itself into a for-profit, soon to be public, company.
This may have put it in a stronger position to form partnerships
with foreign exchanges, many of which are also going public, than
the Big Board, which says it is unlikely to become a public company
before late 2001, if then.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's biggest asset is its brand as the global byword for
technology stocks. In Argentina, locals have nicknamed Argentina's
aspiring new tech market the ``Nasdaquita.'' The Neuer Markt's
willingness to throw in its lot with a Nasdaq exchange is ample
proof of the brand's value.
</P>
<P>
   There will be rival global stock market alliances, but Nasdaq
will be the market of choice for many of the world's technology
companies. The biggest threat is that this brand may become a
wasting asset if technology-stock prices do not rediscover their
zip. &QL;

technology stocks. In Argentina, locals have nicknamed Argentina's
aspiring new tech market the ``Nasdaquita.'' The Neuer Markt's
willingness to throw in its lot with a Nasdaq exchange is ample
proof of the brand's value.
</P>
<P>
   There will be rival global stock market alliances, but Nasdaq
will be the market of choice for many of the world's technology
companies. The biggest threat is that this brand may become a
wasting asset if technology-stock prices do not rediscover their
zip. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ ``I am very happy to pull my money out of the
market,'' says George Soros, a hedge-fund investor who won fame and
notoriety in equal measure by helping to force sterling out of
Europe's exchange-rate mechanism in 1992, and was blamed by some
Southeast Asian countries for contributing to their crises in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and politicians around the world have long fretted
about the malign effects of big hedge funds on financial markets,
especially after the near-collapse in 1998 of Long-Term Capital
Management, another big hedge fund, threatened to damage the
world's financial system hugely.
</P>
<P>
   These worries were perhaps overdone. In March Julian Robertson,
a man almost as famous (and as self-important) as Soros, closed
down Tiger, the hedge fund that he ran.
</P>
<P>
   Now Soros, after a lifetime in the markets, has made his
biggest, and possibly last, investment decision: that he does not
understand what is going on.
</P>
<P>
   His two biggest funds, Quantum and Quota, have, in effect, been
shut down; and the two men who ran those funds _ respectively
Stanley Druckenmiller and Nicholas Roditi _ will retire.
</P>
<P>
   This might be dismissed as nothing more than a few rich people
quitting at a time when the markets are unusually volatile, with
reputations that can go nowhere but down and wealth beyond the
dreams of avarice. But their decisions carry greater significance.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, some of America's most accomplished investors are
stepping aside. Last weekend Warren Buffett told shareholders in
Berkshire Hathaway, his investment company, that share valuations
were too high and that Berkshire's exposure to equities, which has
already been cut sharply, would be reduced still further.
</P>
<P>
   And now the most famous and one of the most successful
financiers of the age has all but quit.
</P>
<P>
   All are leaving a market which, they think, has become
irrational, in which trusted ways of valuing shares no longer work,
and relationships between assets and economic variables no longer
apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is now crazy _ insane, unbelievably
dangerous,'' says Druckenmiller
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are important differences between these
investors. Buffett and Robertson have long made clear their refusal
to touch ``new economy'' shares.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett likens investing in Internet stocks to a ``chain
letter,'' in which early participants get rich at the expense of
later ones.
</P>
<P>
   But Soros and Druckenmiller did not eschew tech shares
completely. In part this is because Druckenmiller is a
half-believer in the new economy. But it is also because they were
burned when they tried to bet against such stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost $700 million in March 1999 by selling tech shares
short, and similar amounts the year before, they started to dabble
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum invested heavily in Qualcomm, Veritas and a number of
other technology shares in the second half of last year, turning
around what would otherwise have been a rotten 1999. But when
Nasdaq plunged in March and April, Quantum suffered such heavy
losses that Soros and Druckenmiller decided to call it a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being the last in, we felt it incumbent to be the first out,''
says Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Although his funds lost some $2.5 billion in high-tech shares,
Druckenmiller reckons that buying was still a good strategy:
Quantum kept half the original $5 billion profits that it had made
_ more, by far, than it made betting against the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the two men do not want to punt either way. Yes,
tech stocks, in particular, are absurdly overvalued. But then they
also were last year.
</P>
<P>
   Soros says that, in these circumstances, ``it is too dangerous
and crazy to short. You could have shorted the market in March of
1929 and lost everything.'' If you cannot go long and cannot go
short, the only other place to go is away.
</P>
<P>
   Druckenmiller had considered quitting ever since his record
began to deteriorate badly after 1996. Certainly, Quantum's recent
results have not lived up to previous glories.
</P>
<P>
   Its returns have lagged the S&AMP;P 500 by over six percentage
points a year for the past six years. A failure to read the markets
correctly in February proved the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   When he saw Robertson announce his retirement he was, he says,
``jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   The closure of Quantum and Tiger, at one time the world's two
biggest hedge funds, should calm the nerves of those politicians
who think that hedge funds are a danger to world markets and should
be reined in.
</P>
<P>
   America's Congress has been considering a bill that would force
the big funds to disclose more about themselves _ a move backed by
the Financial Stability Forum, an international committee of the
great and the good.
</P>
<P>
   The committee even considered whether hedge funds, unregulated
for now, should be brought under the regulatory umbrella. Although
the French and Germans were in favor, the committee rejected such a
move, at least for now. But hedge funds are clearly less scary than
they used to be. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850. UNCUT VERSION IS 1,350) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Regulators might still be interested to hear what Druckenmiller
has to say about risk-management models, especially the ubiquitous
value-at-risk (VAR) models, which purport to show how much an
institution might lose.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum was forced by its bankers to use such models after their
near-death experience with LTCM. ``VAR is extremely dangerous.
People look at their computer models and think they are safe. Much
better to have no models and watch your own net worth every day.''
Watching it crumble is what told him to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Will Quantum and Tiger take their particular style of hedge
fund, with its big, aggressive bets on all manner of financial
assets, with them into retirement?
</P>
<P>
   Of the big funds, only Moore Capital, with $12 billion of
assets, and Tudor Investments, with $2 billion, are left. Soros
does not rule out the possibility that opportunities remain for
others.
</P>
<P>
   If the hedge funds had only got it right, the euro's slide would
have been an attractive bet. Still, there may be reasons why they
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Both his funds and Tiger started life as equity hedge funds. As
they got bigger, they migrated into other investments in which they
had less expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The likes of Tudor and Moore Capital, on the other hand, started
in the futures markets and have long punted on all manner of
things.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these two seem better able to delegate responsibility
to those who know what they are doing: Tiger, at least, was run by
what one insider calls a ``back-seat driver,'' making it less able
to retain talented staff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike other sorts of hedge fund, ``macro'' funds have in
general had a dismal time lately. Many have been wrong-footed.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger famously lost some $2 billion in September 1998, when the
yen rose sharply and unexpectedly. And last year many were caught
out by the rises in the prices of oil, of American Treasuries and
of the yen, and by the fall in the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, financial markets have become less liquid (partly because
banks, their counterparties, are less willing to take risks),
making bets more expensive. And as they have got bigger, managers
gripe, those with whom they deal often try to do the same trades as
they do, queering their pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that macro funds are far less keen to take big
punts. All in all, says Nicola Meaden, who runs TASS, a research
firm, ``the era of the classic macro hedge fund is drawing to a
close.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the railings against them by regulators, that would be a
bad thing. Without the willingness of hedge funds to take risks and
bet against irrational trends, the markets would be more volatile,
not less.
</P>
<P>
   Have no fear. Investors, hedge funds included, wisely get out of
a market when it gets too bubbly to call, but when good
opportunities arise they'll be back. &QL;

   ULAN BATOR _ For the ten years since the end of communism in
Mongolia, the banking system has inflicted more costs than benefits
upon the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Governments have collapsed over the issue of banking reform, and
the outcome has been a financial system dominated by rotten state
banks and a welter of poorly supervised private ones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet now a political consensus has emerged to get the state out
of banking, bring foreigners in, and improve supervision. That
should lay the foundations for serious economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   This ex-vassal of the Soviet Union might yet have one of the
best banking systems in developing Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Political shenanigans in the past ensured that bad state banks
were neither shut down nor privatized. ``Restructurings'' were
mainly a way to avoid pain. But, prodded by the Bank of Mongolia,
the central bank, the government now thinks that drastic action is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year the central bank forced into liquidation the
two worst state-owned banks, the Investment and Technological
Innovation Bank, and the Reconstruction Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The latter possibly had the world's highest bad-loan ratio _
over 95 percent. This is the first time that any insolvent banks
have been forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   For those that remain open, minimum capital-adequacy
requirements have been doubled. New banks must immediately meet the
requirements; longer-established ones have until the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of banks in Mongolia has fallen from 18 to 12. As
well as the liquidations, a handful of private banks with
insufficient capital have closed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the country still looks over-banked: there are a mere 2.5
million people in Mongolia, with an annual per capita income of a
little over $400 a year. More mergers are on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   A third insolvent bank, the Agricultural Bank, merits closure by
any dispassionate measure. Yet its social importance is immense: in
Mongolia's vast rural areas, it is the only bank that most people
have ever walked into.
</P>
<P>
   Even though distant branches often have no money to dispense,
the bank's removal would destroy any stirrings of a money economy.
So the government will soon advertise for a foreign boss to turn
the bank around.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Mongolia's biggest bank, the state-owned Trade and
Development Bank. After general elections in July, parliament will
be asked to approve the bank's privatization.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have no hang-ups about foreign ownership:
international banks will be invited to bid. A Citigroup or an HSBC,
the authorities believe, would benefit the Trade and Development
Bank and the whole financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Jigjidiyn Unenbat, the central bank's governor, argues that
Mongolia is over the worst of its banking crisis. Now he wants the
level of financial intermediation in the economy to rise threefold.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of scope. Mongolia's ratio of M2 to GDP, a
measure of the role that money plays in the economy, has declined
over the past few years to only 18 percent, on a par with Africa's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The multilateral institutions are betting on Mongolia. Late last
month the World Bank approved a $32 million soft loan for
financial-sector restructuring. The Asian Development Bank is
dispensing advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is
about to welcome Mongolia into the fold _ although Ulan Bator is
twice as close to the Pacific as it is to the North Sea. &QL;

have been forced to close.
</P>
<P>
   For those that remain open, minimum capital-adequacy
requirements have been doubled. New banks must immediately meet the
requirements; longer-established ones have until the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of banks in Mongolia has fallen from 18 to 12. As
well as the liquidations, a handful of private banks with
insufficient capital have closed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the country still looks over-banked: there are a mere 2.5
million people in Mongolia, with an annual per capita income of a
little over $400 a year. More mergers are on the cards.
</P>
<P>
   A third insolvent bank, the Agricultural Bank, merits closure by
any dispassionate measure. Yet its social importance is immense: in
Mongolia's vast rural areas, it is the only bank that most people
have ever walked into.
</P>
<P>
   Even though distant branches often have no money to dispense,
the bank's removal would destroy any stirrings of a money economy.
So the government will soon advertise for a foreign boss to turn
the bank around.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Mongolia's biggest bank, the state-owned Trade and
Development Bank. After general elections in July, parliament will
be asked to approve the bank's privatization.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have no hang-ups about foreign ownership:
international banks will be invited to bid. A Citigroup or an HSBC,
the authorities believe, would benefit the Trade and Development
Bank and the whole financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Jigjidiyn Unenbat, the central bank's governor, argues that
Mongolia is over the worst of its banking crisis. Now he wants the
level of financial intermediation in the economy to rise threefold.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of scope. Mongolia's ratio of M2 to GDP, a
measure of the role that money plays in the economy, has declined
over the past few years to only 18 percent, on a par with Africa's
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   The multilateral institutions are betting on Mongolia. Late last
month the World Bank approved a $32 million soft loan for
financial-sector restructuring. The Asian Development Bank is
dispensing advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is
about to welcome Mongolia into the fold _ although Ulan Bator is
twice as close to the Pacific as it is to the North Sea. &QL;

   XAI-XAI _ The rivers that flooded Mozambique in February gained
pace and volume as they neared the sea. So a coastal town such as
Xai-Xai, at the mouth of the great Limpopo River, was a dangerous
place to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Limpopo, whose width swelled to over 100km (63 miles) in
places, hit the town so fast that locals had almost no time to
prepare, and so forcefully that most preparations proved useless.
</P>
<P>
   A wave of water roared over Xai-Xai's defensive dykes like a
herd of elephants over a speed bump. Residents who had prudently
placed their televisions and refrigerators on the roof watched
aghast as their whole houses were flushed into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The flood crushed the slums, and drowned the commercial
district. Fields of maize were inundated. The road to the capital,
Maputo, was cut, along with the telephone and electricity cables
that run beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   The city was plunged into darkness. Food prices tripled. Only
those with mobile phones could call the outside world for help.
</P>
<P>
   It is less than two months since the world's cheeks were
dampened by news of a young Mozambican woman giving birth in a
tree, which she had climbed to escape the waters, and from which
mother and baby were plucked to safety by a South African
helicopter crew.
</P>
<P>
   Now that such rescue work is complete, the Mozambican government
is asking for $450 million to rebuild roads, homes and lives in
Xai-Xai and places like it.
</P>
<P>
   It held a joint summit with aid agencies in Rome on May 3 and 4
to extract pledges of outside help while memories remain fresh.
</P>
<P>
   It will be money well spent. Helped by the donations already
received, Mozambicans have been working hard to rebuild their
battered country.
</P>
<P>
   Take agriculture. The floods devastated a tenth of Mozambique's
land, and nine-tenths of its irrigated areas. Some 200,000 cattle
were washed away.
</P>
<P>
   Already, as the waters recede, Mozambican peasants have been
rushing back to plant beans and maize in the silt. Officials and
aid workers are handing out seeds and tools.
</P>
<P>
   If crops are sown before the southern winter arrives, a quick
harvest could be reaped in two months. Next year should be
bountiful: alluvial soil is rich in nitrates and phosphates.
</P>
<P>
   The government is even taking advantage of misrule in
neighboring Zimbabwe by inviting white farmers to bring in their
capital and skills.
</P>
<P>
   To guard against future floods, the government is trying to
resettle refugees on higher ground. In Xai-Xai, about 2,500
families, out of 40,000 displaced people, have so far been
allocated new plots to build homes and grow vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies offer free building materials to those who will
help clear up the dead conger eels, oil drums and concrete girders
that litter newly drained parts of the town.
</P>
<P>
   The work can be hazardous. Snakes lurk in damp heaps of maize
stalks, and land mines from the country's long civil war have been
exposed and scattered by the deluge: residents of one town found an
anti-tank mine lying in the main street.
</P>
<P>
   Despite official urging, however, most refugees want to return
to their old homes. About three-quarters of those who fled to
refugee camps have gone back to what is left of their dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   Many still turn up periodically at the camps to receive medical
care or to trade; but few want to live in tents any longer. Though
understandable, this makes it harder to get help to them.
</P>
<P>
   Those still stranded on islands are hungry and often sick. Drugs
and bandages are being dispensed at the camps, as well as soap,
buckets and lessons in sanitary hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   Most schools have reopened. Where classrooms have disappeared,
pupils sit beneath shady trees. After much heavy labor with trucks
and shovels, several severed roads have also been reconnected.
</P>
<P>
   It will take months to rebuild properly the tarmac route between
Maputo and Xai-Xai, but a bumpy dirt road reopened at the end of
April.
</P>
<P>
   Travel is not easy. The most popular vehicles are minivans that
failed their safety tests in Japan many years ago. They are
overladen with passengers and driven at axle-snapping speed. Many
break down, or sink into the mud, creating road blocks. But at
least people and goods are moving again.
</P>
<P>
   Food and fuel prices are coming down, as the markets where they
are sold migrate uphill.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the devastation, there has been surprisingly little
unrest. Looters in boats stripped warehouses; and four people were
killed recently in a stampede for food in a refugee camp. But
otherwise calm has prevailed. This is not bad for a country torn by
civil war for most of the time since independence in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The government is far from flawless. Some aid supplies have been
stolen, and the ruling party cheekily flies its own flag, rather
than the national one, over refugee camps. But the abuses have been
few and minor.
</P>
<P>
   Aid to many of today's poor countries is usually ineffective
because the recipient has only a vague understanding of the sort of
prospering economy they are trying to create.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique, by contrast, was booming before the floods _ or at
least growing fast off a miserable base. A generous injection of
charitable liquidity could well restore it rapidly to health. &QL;

BROADWAY PRODUCTIONS RECEIVE TONY NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A struggling new musical, ``The Wild Party,''
received seven Tony nominations, a mother and daughter were pitted
against one another in a leading-actress category and two actors
who alternate roles in ``True West'' wound up as competitors when
the Tony Award nominations were announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 30, ``The Wild Party'' _ which opened to mixed
reviews last month _ was selling at 50 percent capacity. Had it not
been nominated for best musical, some people in the theater
industry expected it to close. Monday's nominations, however _ only
one less than the acclaimed revival of ``The Music Man'' _ give
``The Wild Party'' a new lease on life, at least until the awards
are announced on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   Michael John LaChiusa, who, with George C. Wolfe, wrote ``The
Wild Party'' and also wrote ``Marie Christine,'' which closed
earlier this year, had a big day Monday. Both of his shows received
nominations for best book of a musical and best original score
despite the fact that they have not been hits.
</P>
<P>
   The nominations also pointed up the growing gray area in
defining a musical because the three shows nominated along with
``The Wild Party'' for best musical defy conventional definitions.
``Contact'' is a dance play performed to recorded music, whose
eligibility has prompted protest from the musicians union; ``James
Joyce's The Dead'' is a play with parlor songs that recently closed
on Broadway; and ``Swing!'' is a dance show.
</P>
<P>
   The races that promise to be particularly close are best play,
best revival of a musical and best performance by a leading actor
in a play.
</P>
<P>
   In the best play category, the acclaimed production of Michael
Frayn's ``Copenhagen'' will compete against ``Dirty Blonde'' by
Claudia Shear, ``True West'' by Sam Shepard _ which successfully
lobbied for consideration as a new play although it was previously
produced off-Broadway _ and ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' by
Arthur Miller, which recently earned attention after its star,
Patrick Stewart, complained from the stage about what he considered
inadequate promotion by the producers, the Schubert Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart himself was not nominated.
</P>
<P>
   The race for musical revival has heated up since ``The Music
Man'' opened on April 27, creating head-to-head competition with
``Kiss Me, Kate,'' which opened in the fall. The two musicals are
competing for awards for best performance by a leading actor in a
musical _ Brian Stokes Mitchell for ``Kiss Me, Kate'' versus Craig
Bierko for ``The Music Man'' _ and for best performance by a
leading actress in a musical _ Rebecca Luker for ``The Music Man''
versus Marin Mazzie for ``Kiss Me, Kate.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition for best actor is complicated by the fact that
Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly have both been nominated
for performances in ``True West'' despite efforts by the play's
producers to have the actors, who alternate roles every three
performances, be considered jointly as one candidate. The two
actors are up against Gabriel Byrne, who received strong reviews
for ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' Stephen Dillane for ``The Real
Thing'' and David Suchet for ``Amadeus.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A number of shows will compete against themselves in various
categories. For best performance by a featured actress in a
musical, for example, Laura Benanti and Ann Hampton Callaway were
nominated from ``Swing!'' and Deborah Yates and Karen Ziemba were
nominated from ``Contact.'' Also in that category was Eartha Kitt,
nominated for ``The Wild Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kevin Chamberlain and Bob Stillman of ``Dirty
Blonde'' will compete against each other for best performance by a
featured actor in a play.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stroman will compete against herself for best direction of
a musical and best choreography, having been nominated for both
``Contact'' and ``The Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The director Michael Blakemore also received two nominations,
though in different categories _ one for ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and one
for ``Copenhagen.'' The last time this happened was 10 years ago,
when Blakemore was nominated for his direction of the musical
``City of Angels'' and of the play ``Lettice and Loveage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Harris, nominated for ``Waiting in the Wings,'' will
compete against her daughter, Jennifer Ehle, nominated for ``The
Real Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two musicals that have closed each received five nominations:
``James Joyce's The Dead'' and ``Marie Christine.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the shows seemingly slighted by the awards was ``Aida,''
which was not nominated for best musical, although Elton John was
nominated for the score and the show received three other
nominations (for its star, Heather Headley, and for scenic design
and lighting design). Julie Taymor's ``The Green Bird'' received
only two nominations _ one for best costume design (Constance
Hoffman) and one for best performance by a featured actor in a play
(Derek Smith).
</P>
<P>
   The first hour of the Tony Awards will be broadcast on PBS by
Thirteen/WNET in the New York metropolitan region beginning at 8
p.m. on June 4. The remaining two hours will be broadcast live on
CBS from Radio City Music Hall with Rosie O'Donnell as host.

via the Internet is evolving rapidly, setting the stage for a much
larger confrontation over the ability to freely and almost

   When you go to Chattanooga, make sure that you're there on a
Friday night. Cross the Tennessee River and head up Signal Mountain
until you get to the Walden Ridge Civic Center, a white wooden
building that looks like it might once have been a church or a
schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, you'll find a large room decorated with American flags
and faded photographs. On a sultry night, ceiling fans stir the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Around 400 people assemble here every week at 8 p.m. to listen
to amateur bass, banjo, fiddle and guitar players trot out old
favorites like ``The Wabash Cannonball'' and ``Smoky Mountain
Blues'' interspersed with cornpone patter and nostalgic
reminiscence about favorite players who have passed on. This is the
Mountain Opry _ ``free, authentic and wholesome,'' according to a
brochure that continues, ``Everyone is welcomed including the aged,
children, dogs, cats, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   They're all here, some of them eating popcorn and hot dogs,
which can be purchased on the premises. Alcoholic beverages and
smoking are prohibited. The proceedings are over by 11 p.m.,
probably so the kids can get to bed.
</P>

   Chattanooga is a great place for a family vacation. For a
relatively small city (population 152,000), it offers a lot to do.
The city straddles the Tennessee River and is surrounded by
mountains, most prominently Lookout Mountain, the local landmark.
</P>
<P>
   While noted for its industry, it also has forests, caves,
waterfalls and flower-strewn meadows in and near the city. An
eight-mile-long path for walkers, joggers and bicyclists runs along
the river. Eventually, it will be 20 miles long and will stretch
between Chickamauga Dam and what is called the Grand Canyon of the
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of Chattanooga is the largest fresh water aquarium
in the world. The intersecting triangles of its distinctive roof
dominate the skyline. The 7-year-old aquarium is credited with
spurring a renaissance in downtown Chattanooga, which, like many
American cities, had deteriorated as people moved to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   A plaza in front of the aquarium is a setting for concerts and
other community events and nearby streets are once again bustling.
Dozens of stores and restaurants plus two new movie theatres have
opened in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million visitors a year have ascended the aquarium's
narrow escalator _ accompanied by the sound of a mountain stream _
to find themselves in a re-creation of an Appalachian cove forest
complete with live trees, flowers and native birds. Trout swim in a
mountain pool while river otter frolic nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Other naturalistic exhibits introduce visitors to the Tennessee
River, to other major rivers of the world and to the Mississippi
delta.
</P>
<P>
   There are around 9,000 animals on display including the
ever-popular American alligator, a giant catfish who weighs in at
62 pounds and some six-foot-long arapaima from the Amazon that are
still growing. Apparently they get excited easily and have been
known to jump out of their tanks. The kids might enjoy that.
</P>
<P>
   The newest exhibit at the aquarium, ``Venom Striking Beauties,''
which features poisonous frogs, toads, snakes and the like, is also
sure to please the younger set.
</P>
<P>
   While life is usually relatively placid in the tanks despite the
presence of predators and prey, you never know what's going to
happen. The tanks are monitored 24 hours a day from a control room
equipped with computers and alarms.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, during an open house for the 350 volunteers who
help keep the aquarium going, someone noticed that the fish in one
tank were going belly up. Fortunately, because of the party, the
aquarium was fully staffed so a dead fish was rushed up to the
laboratory, dissected and examined under a microscope. The
diagnosis was too much oxygen in the water. The situation was
immediately corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in another tank, a stingray was giving birth. Her
babies, born live, fluttered around her while some of the larger,
predatory fish hovered nearby, sensing the presence of some tasty
morsels. While some volunteers hastily suited up to go in and
rescue the babies, the rest of the staff watched anxiously, unsure
of whether the rescue would come in time. It did. It's all in a
day's work at the aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Another Chattanooga institution, the Houston Museum of
Decorative Arts, is surely one of the most unusual museums in the
world. The collection of priceless china, antique art glass, early
American pressed glass and antique furniture was assembled by Anna
Safley Houston, who was as famous for her eccentricity as for her
encyclopedic knowledge of antiques.
</P>
<P>
   She was born into a poor family in Arkansas in 1876, and was
married at least nine, and possibly as many as 12 times. She spent
her last years living in an unheated barn surrounded by her
collection, devoting all of her money and strength to acquiring
more so that she could fulfill her cherished dream of creating a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Children are admitted here, but you might enjoy yourself more if
you send them elsewhere while you wander through room after room of
glass and china.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty in and around Chattanooga to interest the history
buff, including two major Civil War battlefields. Chattanooga's
strategic location on the Tennessee River and prominence as a
railroad hub made the city important to both North and South.
</P>
<P>
   On September 19 and 20, 1863, the Federal Army of the Cumberland
faced the Confederate Army of Tennessee in the forests and
farmlands now known as the Chickamauga Battlefield. The Union
forces were defeated and retreated to Chattanooga, where they were
beseiged for almost two months. With food almost completely
depleted, the seige was lifted in November by troops led by newly
appointed Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The battle of Chattanooga, sometimes called the Battle Above the
Clouds because much of it took place at the top of Lookout
Mountain, is considered one of the turning points in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Kids may come away with a better understanding of the enormity
of this war which, in Tennessee, a border state, pitted brother
against brother and neighbor against neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   In the battles of Chickamauga and Chattanooga alone, 5,000
people died and 42,000 were wounded or reported missing. To put
that in perspective, the population of Chattanooga at that time was
2,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   The haunting whistle of a steam locomotive and the rhythmic
clack of iron wheels on iron rails are more cheerful legacies of
the past. The Tennessee Valley Railroad, which runs two-hour-long
excursions between East Chattanooga and Chattanooga, is the largest
operating historic railroad in the South. An intriguing roundtable
enables engineers to turn hulking black locomotives around for a
return trip.
</P>
<P>
   For a different kind of historic ride, try the recently
refurbished antique carousel from Atlanta that was installed at the
north end of the Walnut Street Bridge, in itself an attraction for
both tourists and residents. The bridge is more than a 100 years
old and is the longest pedestrian bridge in the world. If you're
agile, you can join local rock climbers, who scale its sturdy stone
pilings.
</P>
<P>
   After so much sightseeing, the family may want a good meal. Try
Mount Vernon, a one-story clapboard roadside restaurant famous for
its pies. For many years, they were baked by a tiny, gray-haired
lady named ``Mama'' Ida Kate Davis. Mama Kate's best seller, the
amarillo pie, is not for someone on a diet. A thin, buttery crust
is topped with an almond-flavored custard and a thick layer of
whipped cream with almonds sprinkled on top.
</P>
<P>
   This, or one of her other pies (pecan, bavarian fudge or
``goober'') should give everyone enough fuel for another day of
family fun in Chattanooga. With so much to do, including hang
gliding and whitewater rafting, a few extra calories shouldn't
hurt.

<P>
   In 1989, actress Meryl Streep gathered a group of parents in her
rural Connecticut home to discuss their shared concern about the
effects of pesticides on their children's health. Streep had in her
hand a report issued by the Natural Resources Defense Council
titled ``Intolerable Risk: Pesticides in Our Children's Food.''
</P>
<P>
   It revealed that a chemical called Alar was so commonly sprayed
on apple crops that it represented the No. 1 cancer risk for kids.
Since Alar seeped through the peel to the fruit's flesh, neither
peeled apples nor apple juice were safe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the elevated risk was due to a kind of oversight: When
regulations were set to limit pesticide residue in food, the body
(and consumption patterns) of an adult male were considered.
Because no adjustment of these levels was made to safeguard a much
smaller and developing body, children over the course of their
growing years were ingesting ``intolerable'' amounts of the toxin,
the report warned. (Indeed, seven years later, a federal act would
rule that the Environmental Protection Agency, when considering
questionable chemicals, must divide the level considered safe for
adults by 10 to arrive at one safe for children.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the moms present at that meeting in Streep's kitchen was
Wendy Gordon, her friend and the mother of two boys. A staff member
of the National Resources Defense Council, Gordon knew about the
toxic effects of pesticides on the body. She also knew that
granting consumers the right to know what's in their food was part
of what parents should fight for.
</P>
<P>
   From this kitchen-table meeting, Mothers &AMP; Others for a Livable
Planet was born. This nonprofit organization is dedicated to
untangling environmental issues so the average consumer can make
eco-sound decisions for her family, both in her home and at the
store. The underlying message is simple: environmental activism
begins at home with small, but significant choices that are made
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The right to know is essential to all of us as consumers, and
it is at the heart of Mothers &AMP; Others' mission,'' says Gordon, who
served as executive director of the organization for its first 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign against Alar was a baptism by fire for the tiny but
determined group of parents. Although not by design, Streep, Gordon
and their gang had taken on an 800-pound gorilla as their first
adversary. Alar was manufactured by Uniroyal, a multinational
corporation disinclined to withdraw a profitable chemical from the
market.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, ``60 Minutes'' broadcast a damning report about
Alar that prompted the apple industry _ and a faction of the press
_ to turn against the protesters, branding them ``Chicken Little
environmentalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits were filed, the Supreme Court was called into judgment
and _ in the midst of the circus _ Uniroyal stopped selling Alar.
In 1990, the EPA banned the substance. Alar, of course, wasn't the
only bad apple in the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mothers &AMP; Others is voicing its concerns about PVC _ a
compound used to make products such as shower curtains, mini-blinds
and flooring. Dioxin, a carcinogen, is produced during its
manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   Alerting members about the hazards of PVC, the organization's
Web site (www.mothers.org) also provides a list of manufacturers
responsible for bringing the substance into your home, along with a
sample letter to send to them protesting its use. Consumer pressure
does work, Mothers &AMP; Others contends: Companies such as Simple
Green, Kiss My Face and the Planters Co. have phased out use of PVC
bottles in response to shoppers' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives like these are at the core of the group's ongoing
``Shoppers Campaign,'' dedicated to educating consumers about
what's in their food and how to speak out against the bad stuff.
The biggest battle raging today concerns genetically modified
organisms that are produced when DNA, pesticides and/or herbicides
are spliced into seeds used by farmers to increase crop yields.
</P>
<P>
   As with Alar, GMOs flood into supermarkets inadequately tested
and unlabeled _ and Mothers &AMP; Others has organized an attack: It
has spoken out against genetic engineering at Food &AMP; Drug
Administration hearings; it provides education on its Web site and
in its monthly newsletter, the ``Green Guide''; and it encourages
members to write to the CEOs of such corporations as Nestle USA, to
protest the use of GMOS.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Eco-Info phone line rings constantly in the
Mothers &AMP; Others New York City office. Although the 11-year-old
organization's membership has swelled to 30,000 nationwide (and
comprises not only mothers but also fathers, grandparents and
single people), a real live person still answers calls, fielding
questions from members on topics as diverse as baby-bottle choices
to levels of lead in mini-blinds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of carpet calls,'' says executive director
Elisabeth Marx, when asked to name a major area of consumer
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We help keep parents calm,'' says Mindy Pennybacker, editor of
the ``Green Guide.'' ``A mother might call because her
mother-in-law used a commercial carpet shampoo to clean up a spill
while baby-sitting and the child had been playing on the carpet for
hours. We'd ascertain that her child is symptom-free, then assure
her that it's really a cumulative exposure to household toxins that
poses health risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Marx acknowledges that most parents get involved with Mothers &AMP;
Others out of a kind of self-interest: A recent poll shows that 98
percent of the members feel that their personal health and the
environment are closely linked.
</P>
<P>
   ``One mother might look at her toddler walking for the first
time across her spring lawn and think, 'Lawn chemicals cannot be
good for him,''' explains Marx. There is a natural ripple effect
from one issue to the next, she says, citing a mother who might be
in the process of washing organic salad greens in a sink she just
scrubbed with a chemical disinfectant _ which prompts her to ask
about a different way to clean sinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all start with what's at hand,'' Marx says philosophically.
Indeed, the organization is only too happy to encourage baby steps
toward clean-and-green living _ otherwise the conversion effort is
so monumental that few people will actually succeed.
</P>
<P>
   As a Mothers &AMP; Others member, Haylee Messing, a New Jersey
mother of two, appreciates this accommodation, noting that when she
first bought organic food, she purchased only enough for her kids'
meals, which was all her budget could withstand at the time. ``Once
one change became a habit, I added another,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members might not start by writing to the FDA,'' Marx says.
``They might not think of themselves as 'political.' So they can go
about making their personal choices, and that's a good thing. But
in order for real change to happen, we all need to express our
preferences to the stores we patronize and the companies we
support.''
</P>
<P>
   A reasonable first step: Take two extra minutes in the produce
aisle to find the manager or the store owner and request that he
stock organic fruits and vegetables. You might also ask questions
about fruit that's unlabeled: Where is it from? If it was not
locally grown, is it possible to get produce from regional farmers?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Marx says, our buying patterns do reveal our values.
But a faster way to express what we want is to communicate via fax,
mail and e-mail to food processors and to our governmental leaders.
And Mothers &AMP; Others is equipped to aid in this process _ and
amplify members' voices _ in every way.
</P>
<P>
   THE TOP 10 FOODS TO BUY ORGANIC
</P>
<P>
   Most of us can't shop all organic all the time. But some
conventionally grown and processed foods tend to have higher levels
of toxins than others do, and those toxins have a greater effect on
a child's small body. Plus, the average youngster tends to eat more
fruits, vegetables and dairy products than the average adult does.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these Mothers &AMP; Others guidelines also apply to
adults _ who should opt for organic coffee and meat whenever
possible, too.
</P>
<P>
   1. BABY FOOD: In 1995, the Environmental Working Group tested
eight baby foods made by the leading manufacturers. Some 16
pesticides were found in more than half of the samples. Commercial
organic baby foods include Earth's Best, Well-Fed Baby and Gerber's
Tender Harvest _ or make your own by cooking and pureeing organic
food.
</P>
<P>
   2. RICE: Because rice allergies are practically nonexistent,
this cereal grass is a primary ingredient in baby food. Pesticide
use on rice fields in California's Sacramento River Valley, one
major growing region, has been so heavy that it has contaminated
groundwater there.
</P>
<P>
   3. STRAWBERRIES: These fruits are the single most
pesticide-laden produce item in the United States, according to a
1995 Environmental Working Group study. In addition, strawberries
and other produce bought out-of-season are likely to be imported,
often from countries with even less-stringent pesticide
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   4. GRAINS: The USDA recommends six to 11 servings of grains a
day. But in 1994, the FDA found illegally high pesticide residue in
a year's worth of oat-based Cheerios. And two years later, the FDA
found residue from at least one pesticide in 91 percent of wheat
samples tested. Serve a healthy variety of organic offerings,
including millet, quinoa, barley, couscous, amaranth and spelt.
</P>
<P>
   5. DAIRY PRODUCTS: Milk comprises nearly a quarter of the
non-nursing infant's diet, but many dairies inject their cows with
recombinant bovine growth hormone to boost milk production.
Organic-milk dairies don't use hormones or antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   6. CORN: Processed foods made with corn _ cornbread, tortilla
chips and popcorn _ were among the top 15 foods likely to expose
children to an unsafe dose of organophosphate residue, according to
a 1998 report by the Environmental Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   7. BANANAS: Often the first fruit offered to babies, bananas are
produced using the pesticides benomyl (linked to birth defects) and
chlorpyrifos (a neurotoxin). In Costa Rica, a major exporter, only
5 percent of farmland grows bananas, but that small number accounts
for 35 percent of the country's pesticide consumption.
</P>
<P>
   8. GREEN BEANS: In 1992-93, contamination with pesticides
illegal in the United States was found in 7.4 percent of green
beans imported from Mexico. The EWG's tests found three pesticides
in conventional green-bean baby-food samples.
</P>
<P>
   9. PEACHES: A recent FDA study found that 5 percent of the peach
crop in the United States was contaminated with excessive amounts
of pesticides. Peaches lead the EWG's list of foods likely to
create unsafe organophosphate exposure.
</P>
<P>
   10. APPLES: This fruit ranks second on the EWG list for
organophosphate residue and baby-food apple juice also made the top
15. Look for organic apples and those from crops grown utilizing
integrated pest management.
</P>
<P>
   MERYL STREEP TALKS ABOUT WHY SHE IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVIST
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, when the pesticide Alar was being used to spray apples,
Meryl Streep had three children who were, as she says, ``mainlining
apple juice.'' She had cause for concern: Alar had been cited as
the No. 1 risk factor for cancer among children. Streep acted
locally, gathering friends to discuss the problem, and then
globally, co-founding Mothers &AMP; Others.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, ``Healthy Living'' spoke with the Academy
Award-winning actress and mother of four about environmental
activism on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Were you always attuned to nature?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, actually, I grew up in New Jersey. (Laughter) As a
girl, I remember following the fogger trucks on my bike. They were
emitting these clouds of DDT _ I remember thinking it smelled so
sweet. I'm horrified to think of that now. In college in the '70s,
I was impressed by reports about dangerous levels of pollutants in
our air and water. But it wasn't until I had my first child that my
environmental concern crystallized.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, when our son was born, we (Streep and sculptor husband,
Donald Gummer) were living in Chinatown (in Manhattan) in an
apartment with intermittent heat and a hot plate for cooking. But
when we had money to spare we'd send a check to the Natural
Resources Defense Council. With a baby at home, I was suddenly
concerned with what my son breathed, ate, drank. Before, when we
were living paycheck to paycheck, the future was always next week.
Suddenly, I was committed to the future in a way I hadn't been
before.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did the Alar issue mobilize the mothers you knew?
</P>
<P>
   A. We all had young children and we were all browbeating them to
eat fruits and vegetables. But we weren't washing the food as
assiduously as we might have. Then it became clear that Alar can't
be washed off _ it penetrates to the flesh of the apple _ and that
it was highly toxic. We weren't scientists. But we knew that it
could not be good for our children.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're very focused on your family.
</P>
<P>
   A. Every single choice I've made in my career I've based on my
concerns as a parent. What is satisfying about the Mothers &AMP; Others
work is that people really heard us _ people who were feeding
children. And eventually, together, we created a demand for organic
foods, a market that's been growing by 20 percent every year. That
carries a lot of weight with companies making decisions about how
to grow and process food. ``The dollar drives the dream,'' as they
say.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does Mothers &AMP; Others help you make decisions in your own
home?
</P>
<P>
   A. I rely on the ``Green Guide'' a lot. Because household
cleansers are among the most toxic substances we willingly bring
into our homes, I clean with a mix of white vinegar and baking soda
_ it's cheap, it's nontoxic and it smells really good. I'm also
involved with a community supported agriculture group that delivers
organically grown vegetables once a week. I have three teen-age
daughters, and I'm concerned about the levels of dioxin produced
when tampons are bleached. This is just one example of how
environmental choices can affect us in a very intimate way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you get your kids to be eco-conscious?
</P>
<P>
   A. We can only set an example. I have been a mother long enough
to know that even though most of what I offer is atmospheric, if
they're breathing, some of it will go in. There were times, I
admit, when they were a little reluctant to accede to my wishes,
but I trust that they are thoughtful about these things.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does environmentalism mean to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Acting on behalf of the environment is about all the little
decisions we make every day. It's not separate from living; it is
living.

<P>
   If you still haven't replaced your old VCR with a DVD player,
then you don't know what you're missing. Besides a much sharper
picture and ultra-crisp sound, DVD offers features such as multiple
viewing angles, zoom and scan, and, in some cases, interviews,
deleted scenes and other insider information on your favorite
flicks. Most important, DVDs show a movie the way the director
meant for you to see it.
</P>
<P>
   Watch ``The Graduate'' on DVD, for example, and _ unlike on VHS
_ you'll get a full view of Anne Bancroft seducing Dustin Hoffman.
Plus, you can use a DVD player to play your audio CDs.
</P>
<P>
   After a blowout Christmas season, most manufacturers have
stepped up production of new models with even more bells and
whistles. As it turns out, though, your choice of a DVD player is
simpler than it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, you need to look at what kind of entertainment
system you have (or would like to have). Here's why: DVDs use
particular sound formats _ Dolby Digital is the most universal _ to
give movies their lifelike quality. To extract this sound from your
DVD movies, a decoder is required. You have to decide whether to
get a player with a built-in decoder (which adds about $100 to the
price) or to rely on a separate audio receiver to supply the
decoder.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply want to hook up the DVD player to your television
for better sound and picture quality, then the built-in decoder
will do the trick. However, if you intend to put together any type
of component home-theater system, you are better off putting $100
toward a high-quality receiver, if your stereo system doesn't
already have one. Not only will the sound quality be better, but
you will also have the flexibility to add new digital components to
your setup down the line.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing to consider when shopping is whether your player
has the right outputs _ the connections to your television or
receiver. The most important two to look for are S-video and
component video, both of which will sharpen your picture.
(Component video is the more important, but they usually come as a
package.) And make sure that your television's inputs are
compatible with the DVD player's outputs.
</P>
<P>
   So which player should you buy? If you're in the market for a
basic model, we like the ultra-reliable Panasonic DVD-RV30 ($300),
which has a component-video output for high- resolution color and a
``cinema mode'' that reduces glare and sharpens details.
</P>
<P>
   With just a simple receiver and two speakers (rather than six),
this machine will also give you virtual surround-sound.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you'd like to build something of a powerful home theater
but don't want to spend several thousand dollars on a piece of
consumer electronics. In that case, consider the Sony DVPS7700
($999). Its best feature: two separate lasers _ one for compact
discs and one for DVDs _ so you'll get maximum performance when you
play either.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also introduced a new product this spring: an all-in-one
system for those who don't want to build a component system from
scratch. The Sony DAV-S300 provides a lot of bang for its $599
price tag: It's a DVD player and receiver in one box, so you can
also listen to the radio in full surround-sound. And it comes with
six speakers to maximize the Dolby sound. (This is the only product
we've selected that has a digital decoder built in.)
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to turn your living room into a virtual Imax theater?
Then you might want to pony up $2,495 for the California Audio Labs
CL-2500. It's designed for the aficionado who plans to invest in
other components, such as a six-speaker system and a big-screen
television, in order to maximize the player's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch a DVD on this system and you will be able to discern the
stitching in an actor's cashmere sweater and hear grains of sand
hit the ground.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for a good reason to go with a less expensive
model, consider the fact that recordable DVD players are on the
way, meaning that you might not want to make a serious investment
right now. Pioneer was the first to launch such a product; on sale
right now only in Japan, it will be available in the U.S. this fall
and will sell for about $2,000.

Lu-Ray Pastels,'' write for ``Country Living'' magazine.
 &HT;    
 By KATHY &AMP; BILL MEEHAN 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc. 
<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   Set your table with jewels. That's what a 1940s brochure for the
Taylor, Smith &AMP; Taylor Co. (TS&AMP;T) invited homemakers to do with the
firm's softly hued dinnerware line _ Lu-Ray Pastels. Introduced in
1938, the East Liverpool, Ohio, firm marketed Lu-Ray as an
alternative to the bold ``fiesta'' colors then popular in
``modern'' dinnerware.
</P>
<P>
   More than a half century later, the Art Deco-inspired plates,
platters, pitchers, tumblers and teacups still catch collectors'
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lu-Ray Pastels have simple designs and cheerful colors, but
there's more to it than that,'' say Michael Fiur and Jerry
Lombardi, whose 250-piece collection fills the kitchen of their
late-1800s farmhouse in New York's Hudson River Valley. ``The look
is retro, yet it has stood the test of time. A table set entirely
with Lu-Ray is classy, but the pieces were introduced as a
moderately priced pattern meant for the everyday working person.
These inherent contradictions appeal to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Named for the colorful caverns in Luray, Va., Lu-Ray Pastels
were originally produced in four colors: Windsor Blue, Sharon Pink,
Surf Green and a butterfly yellow called Persian Cream.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth color, Chatham Gray, was added to the line in 1949 but
didn't prove as popular with homemakers as the original four.
Chatham Gray was discontinued in 1955; the rarity of pieces in this
color have bolstered their desirability among today's collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the early 20th century's elaborate dining rituals,
TS&AMP;T produced 29 pieces in the original Lu-Ray line, including not
only the basic plates, bowls and cups, but a wide variety of
specialized serving pieces, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The line's immediate success encouraged the manufacturer to add
new pieces every year through 1942, including a tiny bud vase and
urn in 1939, a covered muffin plate in 1940, a set of four nesting
mixing bowls in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Following World War II, however, Americans yearned for
simplicity in food preparation and presentation, so most of
Lu-Ray's elegant but nonessential serving pieces were discontinued
by 1947. As with Chatham Gray items, the rarity of serving pieces
produced for a limited time have made them particularly desirable
with collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Lu-Ray Pastels remained one of America's most popular dinnerware
patterns through the early 1960s (production ceased in 1961). After
that time, piles of the colorful pieces were discarded, often
viewed simply as unfashionable ``old dishes.'' This unfortunate
turn, coupled with 60 years of repeated use and the inevitable
breakage, has dramatically decreased the supply of Lu-Ray. Because
of the pattern's revived popularity with collectors over the past
few years, the hunt for quality Lu-Ray Pastels _ especially certain
rare designs _ has become more challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we began collecting four years ago, it was fairly easy to
find inexpensive pieces in small antiques shops around the
country,'' says Fiur, who works in New York City as a producer for
Radio City Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Fiur frequently crisscrosses the United States while producing
such events as the Radio City Christmas Spectacular and the Super
Bowl Halftime Show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spotted our first piece of Lu-Ray _ a Surf Green chop
plate, a large circular plate _ in Cat House Antiques in High
Falls, N.Y. I don't remember what we paid for it at the time, and
we had no way of knowing that it would inspire more collecting. We
just loved the color and the shape.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fiur, rare pieces have become more difficult to
find, and prices have risen by roughly 20 percent to 40 percent in
recent years. ``Dinner plates used to start at about $8 each,'' he
recalls. ``Now it's more like $12.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor affecting the market is online auction sites.
``Online auctions have been both good and bad for Lu-Ray
collectors,'' says Lombardi, owner of Simply Grand Catering in New
York City. ``Through sites like e-Bay, you can sometimes locate
hard-to-find pieces that might have taken you years to find
otherwise. On the other hand, prices tend to run quite high. Rare
pieces can reach several hundred dollars each. We've found that
prices on e-Bay are about 50 to 100 percent higher than what you'd
pay for similar pieces in an antiques shop.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those collectors who savor the joy of a patient pursuit,
there is still plenty of Lu-Ray to be found. Searching for these
pastel beauties, whether online or at antiques stores and flea
markets, can become an open-ended Easter egg hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Common pieces can still be found for $10 to $15, and rare
pieces even appear from time to time in unexpected places, but
those can often cost $100 to $200,'' Lombardi points out. ``It's
still possible to amass a wonderful collection, and the pieces look
particularly great when they're displayed in large numbers, but it
has definitely become more of a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fiur and Lombardi have gone to great lengths to create
a suitable setting for their own sizable _ and ever-expanding _
collection. Soft-yellow walls complement Lu-Ray's pastel shades,
custom-made open shelving and glass-doored cabinetry beautifully
showcase stacks of plates and rows of platters, and period Lu-Ray
advertisements have been framed and hung on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly antiquing trips keep the collection growing. ``Sometimes
we pass on a piece now, but not often. Rare pieces with small chips
can be displayed with the chip facing the wall and duplicates of
common items come in handy if something breaks,'' Fiur says. ``In
all these years, our interest has certainly not waned.''
 &UR; LU-RAY LITERATURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 1938 trade-show advertisement sponsored by the Taylor, Smith &AMP;
Taylor Co. of East Liverpool, Ohio, features a group of businessmen
discussing the firm's newest dinnerware line, Lu-Ray Pastels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have a real volume winner in Lu-Ray,'' one says
to another. ``They must have,'' he responds, ``judging by the talk
that's going around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``TS&AMP;T. was famous for creating an aura of anticipation before
introducing a new line,'' says New Jersey Lu-Ray expert Bill
Meehan. Store displays, illustrated brochures and company
literature often utilized equally intriguing jargon.
</P>
<P>
   According to Meehan, Lu-Ray enthusiasts often buy advertising
items to round out their collections. ``Brochures that include
costs are especially fun to have on hand for reference,'' he says.
``There are prices like 45 cents for a teacup, 65 cents for a
10-inch plate and $1.50 for a covered sugar bowl. If the original
makers could see what these pieces are selling for today _ $10,
$50, $100, and more _ they probably wouldn't believe it!''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Lu-Ray literature is difficult to find, and examples
that turn up at flea markets and ephemera fairs often sell for $100
or more, depending on age, condition and graphics. Quality copies
are sometimes offered by dealers for significantly less than the
originals.

   MOMS-MARCH _ WASHINGTON _ Parenting in America has come to this:
Before letting their kids play at a friend's home, mothers
routinely ask if there's a gun in the house and, if so, whether it
has been safely locked away. Caren Appel started inquiring after
her 9-year-old daughter, Molly, was visiting a pal in an Atlanta
suburb and the friend's 5-year-old brother walked in with a
parent's gun. On Mother's Day, Appel will join a predicted 100,000
marchers in the nation's capital on a quest for ``sensible''
gun-control legislation. With hundreds of thousands of mothers also
assembling in 20 other cities, organizers believe this ``Million
Mom March'' will be the largest rally ever for gun control. (Dart,

PERHAPS THEY NEED A BACKGROUND CHECK ON THEIR TAX KNOWLEDGE

<P>
   To those moms planning to march on Washington this Mother's Day
in support of gun control, I quote a cliche used by one of their
heroines, Oprah Winfrey: ``You go, girls.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be hypocritical to say otherwise. It is the right of
every American to peaceably assemble with those of like minds and
to freely speak about issues important to them. The First Amendment
guarantees it.
</P>
<P>
   That same fragment of constitutional genius on the part of the
Founding Fathers guarantees the right of the Second Amendment
Sisters to hold a counterprotest, the Armed Informed Mothers March,
on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   So the Million Mom Marchers will gather on Capitol Hill,
providing TV crews with tableaus of teary-eyed women with babes in
arms and toddlers in strollers, shouting for more federal gun laws.
If you can't make it on May 14 because you're spending the day with
your family _ what a concept _ don't fret. One of the official MMM
endorsers will make sure that the nightly news snags an image of an
appropriately placed message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whitehouseprotests.Com, a full service, web based corporation
that enables you, from the comfort of your home or office, to
organize a demonstration using a custom designed, full size banner
to be displayed by our staff directly on the sidewalk in front of
the White House or Capitol buildings in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   How uniquely American. Protest by proxy.
</P>
<P>
   But while the dot-com demonstrators attempt to convince
lawmakers (who won't be anywhere near Capitol Hill on a weekend)
that they echo the majority voice of American motherhood, keep this
in mind:
</P>
<P>
   The Million Mom March is violating federal law.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the view from here. Hardly a soul can question
the organization's political nature. Just check out its Web site,
with the ``Time Out Chair,'' which threatens to unseat politicians
who don't vote the way MMM wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come Mothers' Day, we mothers will stand together on the mall
of Capitol Hill to remind your PRO-GUN House that on Election Day,
the voters will stand by our children,'' writes Rene King of
Kentucky, in a letter posted by MMM castigating House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay.
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the Mom's Apple Pie Awards, serving up sugary
kisses to ``Rep. Joe Hoeffel, D-Pa., who plans to co-sponsor a bill
next year, along with Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., that would
require the licensing of handgun owners and the registration of
handguns. It would also require gun purchasers to undergo
background checks, take a gun safety course, and wait three days
before acquiring a gun .... It will be up to us to convince
Congress to pass it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or event organizer Donna Dees-Thomases' thank-you letter: ``With
thousands of mothers and others on the National Mall, we will put
Congress on notice that common sense gun policy _ specifically
licensing and registration _ is the will of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   MMM has every right to champion politicians who support its
cause and torment those who don't. It can even lobby Congress for
more gun control. But not as a nonprofit organization that receives
preferential tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   Again, MMM's Web site: ``We have 501-c(3)(sic) status as a
nonprofit tax entity .... Contributions are tax deductible.''
</P>
<P>
   How can this be, you ask, when federal tax law expressly
prohibits 501(c)(3) nonprofits from engaging in political activity?
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internal Revenue Service's
frequently-asked-questions list: ``501(c)(3) organizations may not
engage in political activity, including endorsing candidates, but
other organizations, such as 501(c)(4) organizations, may engage in
political activity so long as that is not their primary activity.''
Emphasis added.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases (who, for you trivia buffs, is the sister-in-law
of the Clintons' close friend Susan Thomases) has a decision to
make: Give up the tax-exempt status, or stop the politicking.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the howl that would resound across the land if the NRA
asked for tax-exempt status. Jeepers, poor ol' Chuck Heston would
never hear the end of it. The National Rifle Association's
information clearly states that contributions are not deductible
for federal tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet money donated to MMM by individuals and corporate sponsors
like Guess, StrideRite, McClelland Press, Viacom, iVillage.com and
New Frontier Clothing is a tax write-off.
</P>
<P>
   MMM's conundrum would be amusing if the hypocrisy it reflects
weren't so disturbing _ an organization crying for more federal
laws while violating one of them.
</P>
<P>
   But then, wasn't it tax laws that brought down Al Capone?
</P>

   The New York Times News Service plans the following  &UR; Science
Times &LR;  stories for papers of Tuesday, May 9:
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VINLAND (L'Anse Aux Meadows, Newfoundland) _ At the northern
tip of Newfoundland is what archaeologists agree is the first and
still only authentic site of Viking settlement in North America,
500 years before the voyages of Columbus. Ruins of eight houses and
workshops, some of their thick walls and pitched roofs meticulously
restored, will be a focus for this year's millennial commemoration
of all things Viking. Excavations here have not only confirmed
elements of truth in the sagas of the seafaring adventurers from
Scandinavia, they have also inspired new scholarship revising the
legendary image of the Vikings. By John Noble Wilford. (2100 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT28 sent on 04/27, and a map.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ The Personal Health column: Forty
years ago a social and medical revolution was set off: the Pill was
born. And as people were to learn later, it had a number of side
effects, good and bad, as well as helping kick off a sexual
revolution, freeing women of the confines of other generations.
Since its introduction, an estimated 468 million American women
have taken the pill. Today more than 16 million American women are
on it, making it the most popular contraceptive technique outside
of sterilization. By Jane E. Brody. (1375 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT1.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-JEWS-DIASPORA (Undated) _ Following the trail left in the Y
chromosome, geneticists chart the Jewish diaspora. By Nicholas
Wade. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENOME (Undated) _ The government consortium decoding the
human genome announces that it has sequenced its second chromosome,
No. 21, which is linked to Down's syndrome. The chromosome turns
out to contain surprisingly few genes. By Nicholas Wade. (600
words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NEWZEALAND-ECOLOGY (Undated) _ Authorities in New Zealand
continue to strive mightily to keep out invasive species with the
potential to destroy the prisitine ecological balance of that
island nation. By Alan Coukell. (975 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-NASA (Washington) _ NASA engineers and experts on spacecraft
design talk about new ideas for yet faster, cheaper, better space
exploration. By Warren E. Leary.
</P>
<P>
   With photo, NYT4.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-LIGHTMAN-PHYSICS (Undated) _ A physicist-turned-writer looks
back on what he misses about science: the purity. Theoretical
physicists, and many other kinds of scientists, work in a world of
the mind. It is a mathematical world without bodies, without
people, without the vagaries of human emotion. By Alan Lightman.
(1025 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-MILKYWAY-COLLIDE (Undated) _ Andromeda and the Milky Way are
speeding toward each other at more than a quarter-million miles per
hour. In three billion years, the two galaxies may slam together
head-on. By Kenneth Chang. (790 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WATCH (Undated) _ Items about Arctic and Antarctic species
being ever so similar; the effects of El Nino; blister beetles'
remarkable survival techniques. By Herny Fountain. (700 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ULTRASOUND (Undated) _ Since the '70s, ultrasound has grown
up. Rather than simply glancing at the fetus, doctors today take a
series of measurements: the length of the fetus; the length of the
thigh bone; and the circumferences of the head and abdomen. They
check the four chambers of the heart and the structures of the
kidney and bladder. And now ultrasound is on the verge of yet
another revolution. The latest gadgets, though far from standard
use, create three-dimensional images of the fetus and may be used
to peer deep within the fetal brain, identifying fine points of the
developing anatomy never seen before. By Randi Hutter Epstein.

<P>
   With photos, NYT2,3.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AMNIOCENTESIS (Undated) _ Women share the joys and sorrows
of amniocentesis, as compiled by in interviews for a book by Dr.
Renna Rapp. (1150 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-PROSTATE-TREATMENT (Undated) _ Like Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, 180,000 American men will suddenly learn that they have
prostate cancer this year, and what makes their decisions so
difficult is that doctors do not know which treatment is most
effective. Better information about survival and side effects may
come from studies in Canada, Sweden and the United States, but not
for several years. Until then, patients must rely on limited
information. Not surprisingly, wide variations in practice occur.
By Lawrence K. Altman. (1320 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DOCTOR-TRAINING (Undated) _ The pressures of efficiency and
profits are ruining the environment of the teaching hospital. The
bottom line: doctors in training to longer have the time to
contemplate and think through their decisions. And that may mean a
new generation of physicians unable or unwilling to challenge
conventional wisdom or go beyond the standardized prescribed course
of treatment. By David A. Shaywitz, M.D. and Dennis A. Ausiello,
M.D. (850 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-VITAL-SIGNS (Undated) _ News and notes on helth and fitness:
</P>
<P>
   _ A study that looked at almost 13,000 people over six years
found that those who were most prone to anger were about 2.5 times
as likely to have heart attacks or sudden cardiac deaths than their
calmer counterparts. (290 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Most Americans still don't eat the 5 daily servings of fruits
and vegetables so widely recommended, a new study shows. (290
words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Oxidants may actually have value in repairing diseases to
heart vessels. (240 words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Now, experts say, the crucial number in a blood pressure
reading is the systolic pressure, the top one, not the bottom. (300
words)
</P>
<P>
   _ Ulcerative colitis, a serious disease in which the lining of
the colon and rectum become inflamed causing severe pain, appears
to be worsened by long-term stress, a new study has found. (150
words0
</P>
<P>
   SCI-Q&AMP;A (Undated) _ A science question answered: I see yellow
tomatoes, among other exotic types, at vegetable stores. Do they
differ in nutritional value from red tomatoes? By C. Caliborne Ray.

<P>
   QLogic (QLGC:NASDAQ), a maker of high-speed electronic
components, said on Monday that it had agreed to acquire Ancor
Communications (ANCR:NASDAQ), a developer of fiber switches, in a
stock deal valued at $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, QLogic will exchange 0.5275 shares
of common stock for each share of Ancor common stock. QLogic closed
at $99.9375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal values each Ancor share at $52.72, a 59 percent premium
over its Friday closing price of 31 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Ancor surged to 46 in pre-opening trading on Monday in thin
activity, according to Instinet. QLogic did not trade.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to be neutral to slightly accretive
to QLogic's earnings for the year ending December 2001, and
accretive to earnings in the fiscal year ending March 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the closing of the acquisition Ancor's CEO, Ken
Hendrickson, will be nominated to QLogic's board.
</P>
<P>
   QLogic of Aliso Viejo, Calif., said the transaction is intended
to qualify as a pooling of interests and as a tax-free exchange of
shares under IRS regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. It
is expected to close in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   SG Cowen Securities was the financial advisor to QLogic for the
transaction. Goldman, Sachs represented Ancor, which is based in
Eden Prairie, Minn.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the sounds of choral hymns rose toward church
spires, Roman Catholic leaders draped in white robes slowly filed
through the portals of St. Patrick's Cathedral Monday afternoon to
commence the elaborate funeral Mass of Cardinal John O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders began their short march after 1 p.m. on the
sweltering streets in front of the cathedral in Midtown Manhattan,
where hundreds of worshippers, some tearful, had gathered since the
morning Mass. The solemn procession then turned into the cool
recesses of the cathedral, where the cardinal's body rested in his
wooden coffin, awaiting this final congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Mourners from around the world gathered before the gilded altar
to pay their final respects to the most influential Roman Catholic
leader in America.
</P>
<P>
   Before the funeral began, church officials estimated that about
3,500 people would pack the cathedral for the invitation-only
ceremony. They included President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, former President George Bush, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and more than 100 bishops, archbishops
and cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   State and city leaders also attended, including Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, former Mayor Edward Koch and New York state Gov. George
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal, who died on May 3 at the age of 80, was the eighth
man to lead the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York. For 16
years he led one of the most diverse Catholic constituencies in the
world. But for the last eight months, O'Connor's health flagged as
he struggled with brain cancer. This year, he missed his first
Easter Mass since ascending to his position.
</P>
<P>
   It is widely expected that Pope John Paul II will appoint Bishop
Edward M. Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., to the empty post, perhaps as
early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The successor is expected to be as vocal a champion of Catholic
tenets as was O'Connor. He tried to influence some of the most
controversial social issues of the day, speaking out against
abortion and holding a firm line on church teachings regarding
homosexuality and the ordination of women. Such stringent views won
him many admirers in the church but also inspired critics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before the Mass began, the cardinal's closed coffin rested in
the center aisle near the altar, bathed in light streaming through
stained glass windows. The cathedral portals were opened to allow
hundreds of priests, nuns, deacons, representatives of lay orders
and leaders of other religions to enter the cathedral. Many of the
priests helping to celebrate the Mass wore the archdiocesan
chasuble, a sleeveless outer vestment, designed for Pope John Paul
II's tour of the New York area in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishops followed the first marchers in the procession. Those
bringing up the rear were among the highest-ranking officials of
the Roman Catholic Church. They included two cardinals from the
Vatican and 13 from the United States and four other countries. All
wore crimson skullcaps identifying them as cardinals, white
vestments symbolizing the resurrection and the miters that church
princes have long worn.
</P>
<P>
   The rituals ushering O'Connor into the afterlife have evolved
for centuries, since cardinals were likened to princes and popes
were regarded as monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve other Catholic leaders have been entombed in the crypt at
St. Patrick's Cathedral, beginning with Cardinal John Hughes. The
same ritual was followed for all of them: the coffin was carried
past the altar, down a short marble staircase and through the
bronze doors below the sacristy. There, according to Catholic
beliefs, the bodies were to be hidden forever from human eyes while
the spirits ascended to their appointment with God.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday morning, hundreds of worshippers came to the
cathedral hoping to catch a final glimpse of the cardinal before he
was laid to rest. But after the 8 a.m. Mass ended, church officials
unexpectedly ushered everyone outside to allow Secret Service
agents to conduct a security sweep before President Clinton
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Those who had come for later ceremonies were barred from
entering. Some worshippers prayed on the cathedral steps while
others stood outside the doors as policemen politely turned people
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was the cardinal for all the people, not for the
politicians or the Secret Service,'' said Faith Mavretich, 40, who
had come with her 10-year-old daughter, Jennie. ``You could get
angry, but I don't think Cardinal O'Connor would get angry.''

NOT ALL TRUTHS ARE SELF-EVIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the end of the recent legislative session, Arizona became
first state in the nation to require grade-school children to
recite the passage from the Declaration of Independence beginning,
``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created
equal.''
</P>
<P>
   We did it, apparently, to keep the little brats from whining
about the fact lawmakers have done nothing for them. It's there in
black and white. All men are created equal. Nothing about children.
Deal with it, kiddies.
</P>
<P>
   The passage continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``That they (all men) are endowed by their creator with certain
unalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are
instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent
of the governed . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation requiring Arizona's kids to repeat these words
each day was called ``a huge victory for future generations of
children in Arizona'' by Len Munsil of the Center for Arizona
Policy, an organization that prides itself on standing up for the
Declaration's values _ as long as the liberty you pursue in life
doesn't involve any actual happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Munsil told me it was vital to make kids recite the passage in
order to ``reinforce the most important principles'' of our
country.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, Munsil and his organization and their allies lobby
the legislature to preserve unenforced Arizona laws that make a
crime of co-habitation (which is popular among senior citizens
hoping to keep their benefits) as well as certain activities
engaged in by adults within the privacy of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   As Munsil so delicately put it earlier this year, ``Is it really
necessary for the Legislature to spend its time giving the state of
Arizona's stamp of approval to cheating on your spouse, shacking up
and anal intercourse?''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Arizona policy also would like to prohibit anyone
in the state from wagering a few bucks on the state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   It would like to make it impossible for anyone to purchase a
girlie magazine or rent a naughty movie from the video store.
</P>
<P>
   It wants laws on the books making it more difficult to get a
divorce, apparently believing it's better for children to live with
unhappily married parents than happily divorced ones.
</P>
<P>
   It's against any kind of state-subsidized day-care for poor
families but is more than willing to give special ``education tax
credits'' to parents wealthy enough to afford the price of private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   In Munsil's vision of a more perfect America, a woman who had an
abortion would be charged with murder, as would her doctor and any
accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   All this, it seems, will come to pass eventually if we first
have our children recite like robots an otherwise lovely passage
from one of the world's great documents.
</P>
<P>
   This same type of mindless memorization _ without any thought to
what the words on the page actually stand for _ was tried when some
of us were kids. The plan worked spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   Because of it, you and I and just about every thief, con man and
murderer in the nation's prison system can successfully recite the
Pledge of Allegiance. &QL;

CROSSING THE BORDER TO ABSURDITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (RESENDING FOR ALL NEEDING)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You'd think a nice retired couple
</P>
<P>
   like Rocky and Midge Wahl would have learned long ago that being
an honest, taxpaying citizen doesn't give you the right to
disregard U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we were thinking,'' Rocky told me.
</P>
<P>
   The Wahls brazenly violated long-standing U.S. immigration
practices and conspired to transport a young Mexican couple across
the international border _ legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured the best way to get this done was to go completely
by the book,'' Rocky said, pausing while we had a good laugh
together.
</P>
<P>
   The Wahls divide their time between Arizona, Washington state
and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, in Mazatlan, they met a young Mexican teenager named
Oscar. The Wahls and Oscar became friends, visiting his home and
meeting his family. They've dined together, gone to sporting events
and traveled some in Mexico. Oscar now is in his 20s and married to
Lorena.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Wahls invited Oscar and Lorena to accompany them
from Arizona to Washington. The plan was to take 25 days and visit
the West from the Grand Canyon to Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The Wahls planned to pay for all their friends' expenses. They
helped the couple acquire Mexican passports, then paid for Oscar
and Lorena to travel from Mazatlan to Hermosillo so they could
apply for U.S. visas at the consulate there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent all manner of documentation to the consulate,'' Rocky
said. ``We informed them we were paying for the trip and made a
personal guarantee that Oscar and Lorena would return to Mexico. We
thought that would have more than satisfied American officials.''
</P>
<P>
   A vice consul in Hermosillo looked through all of the Wahls'
paperwork, complimented them on their thoroughness and generosity _
then denied the visas. The Wahls were told that because Oscar and
Lorena don't own a home or a car, they couldn't be trusted to
return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very large and close family down there,'' Rocky
said. ``Oscar has a good job (at a hotel). Neither one has a desire
to live here. We told them (consulate officials) all this. For some
reason, that wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Morisseau at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City told me the
embassy alone processes 2 million visa requests a year. Consulates
across Mexico process thousands more, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final decision is the consul's,'' Morisseau said. Oscar
and Lorena can apply again in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wahls went so far as to offer a sizable bond they were
willing to forfeit if their friends didn't go home. That, too,
failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk out of my door in Redmond (Wash.) and see illegal
immigrants working in orchards,'' Rocky said.
</P>
<P>
   If Oscar and Lorena had wanted to pick fruit rather than have
lunch in the Space Needle, Wahl figures they'd have had no trouble
at all.
</P>
<P>
   The government did offer a compromise, it turns out. The Wahls
were told that their net worth, along with the other information
they provided, qualified them to sponsor Oscar and Lorena for
permanent resident status in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Just not for a visit. &QL;

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: V-E bonfire ''twas a glorious
sight'
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Lois Oller Nasados
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   It was V-E Day _ Victory in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hitler's forces had surrendered, and those of us kids who
watched Saturday movie newsreels knew it was only a matter of time
before Japan would give up the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Why wait? We were ready for a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the war practically over, but my father would be
coming home from the Navy. I was certain it would be any day now.
</P>
<P>
   Since we couldn't have fireworks because of the wartime
shortages, the most excitement we could envision was a huge
bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Where? Well, in the middle of the street, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone big enough to pull a wagon or carry an armload of
newspapers was recruited to gather materials.
</P>
<P>
   We went from neighbor to neighbor collecting the newspapers they
had been saving for the Victory Paper Drive held each month by the
local public schools to help the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   A few stubborn souls held out, claiming the United States might
need their papers to finish the job of winning the war in the
Pacific. But most folks were ready to celebrate with us.
</P>
<P>
   At this point an ad hoc committee of parents stepped in. After
assuring us they wouldn't spoil our fun, they put two older boys in
charge of the building the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   The ``little kids'' -- though none of us admitted to being in
that category _ were sent to watch from the porches with parents
and grandparents. The ``big kids'' -- everybody else _ could stand
as close as the curb.
</P>
<P>
   To quote my Irish grandfather, ``'Twas a glorious sight.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bonfire that blazed long past our usual bedtimes,
two things stand out in my memory.
</P>
<P>
   My mother worried that my father, stationed on a repair ship
based at San Diego, might still be sent to the Pacific war zone.
The war with Japan must be ended quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as important in her mind was the problem of continued
rationing and food shortages. Would she be able to buy enough sugar
and real butter to bake Daddy his favorite cake to welcome him
home?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, my father came safely home, greeted by three excited
children, each with a different story about the Great V-E Bonfire,
and by a beaming wife _ and yes, with a real cake, complete with
chocolate frosting.
</P>
<P>

   Young voters, students sometimes feel unwelcome
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Montgomery
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Melissa Fried of Washington Township, Ohio, .
knows she looks young, even for an 18-year-old, but she didn't
expect her youthfulness to be such a burden when she went to vote
this year in Ohio's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Poll workers ``really questioned'' her about her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times they asked me how old I was and I kept telling
them,'' Fried said. ``They said, `Well, what year were you born?' I
mean, why would I lie about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, they huffed impatiently because she didn't know
how to use the key-punch voting system.
</P>
<P>
   The workers may only have been being vigilant, protecting the
integrity of the election rolls, but the result made Fried feel
unwelcome as she cast her first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be a nice experience, but the whole
time I felt like I wasn't good enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom pegs apathy as the leading cause of dismal
turnout among potential voters between the ages of 18 and 34, but
some election experts and activists say the problem is deeper than
that.
</P>
<P>
   From obstinate election officials to registration laws that
don't take into account the mobility of the young, the U.S.
electoral system offers more obstacles than incentives, say
advocates who are trying to reverse the decline in participation
among young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes those obstacles seem deliberate. For instance,
Michigan put a new law into effect last month requiring the home
address on a voter's registration card to match his or her driver
license. For college students who typically move annually the new
law means they'll have to get a new driver's license each year if
they want to vote in local elections where they go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aimed specifically at preventing students from voting,''
said Michael Delli Carpini, who as head of Policy and Programs for
the Pew Charitable Trusts has funneled grant money into many youth
voting initiatives. ``I think that's a great example of the system
actually working against young people voting.''
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan state legislator who introduced the bill called it a
``common sense'' law to ensure that people vote where they really
live, but youth voting advocates say it's designed to make voting
more difficult for people whose voting habits may be harder to
predict. Six university student groups joined the Michigan ACLU in
filing a legal challenge to the new law, but last month a federal
judge rejected their request for an injunction to block the law
from being enforced. The judge said the inconvenience of renewing a
license wasn't an unreasonable burden on voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really frustrating,'' said Windi Yager, 20, a junior at
Central Michigan University, who as a member of the school's
student government has been involved in voter registration drives
on campus. Yager said she has left her parents' address on her
driver's license for simplicity, so that such things as health
insurance and financial records don't get tangled by her constant
relocating.
</P>
<P>
   But Yager has a 12-month lease in Mount Pleasant, and that's
where she recently completed the Census form that will help Mount
Pleasant's local elected officials get their proper share of
federal money for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Yager said she simply wants to vote on the local issues that
effect her directly. Voting absentee in her home town of
Beavertown, Mich., isn't a good option. ``Why would I want to vote
in Beavertown?'' she said. ``I live in Mount Pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   She said in the months before the new law went into effect, her
campus was shot through with rumors that changing a driver's
license address could cost students everything from health
insurance to financial aid to scholarships. She said most of the
rumors couldn't be confirmed one way or another because
</P>
<P>
   policies vary from one institution to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't really involved in voting and I was just a regular
student here, I'd be extremely deterred from voting if I thought
something in my records might get messed up by changing my
address,'' she said. ``Society doesn't put a lot of pressure on
young people to vote, so anything that discourages it ....''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of mobility looms large among young Americans. In a
Census study in 1998, about 25 percent of Americans 35 or younger
said they had moved in the last year, but that percentage dropped
to about 7 percent for those 45 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very, very mobile generation,'' said Russ Freyman,
director of Neglection 2000, a youth voter project. ``And that
flies in the face of registration requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   That conflict flared earlier this year in New Hampshire, which
is one of the few states that permits same-day voter registration.
On the day of that state's first-in-the-nation primary in February,
hundreds of University of New Hampshire students flocked to the
town's polling place for a get-out-the-vote rally by the Bill
Bradley presidential campaign and a group called Youthvote 2000.
But when the students arrived they were greeted by poll workers who
so vehemently questioned the students' claims of residency some
simply gave up, according to a rally organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office conducted an
investigation, but no action was taken because students filed no
formal complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent a letter reminding our communities that have
universities that they need to allow the students to register,''
said New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Anne Edwards, ``that
a dorm address is good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this leads Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell
to conclude it's unfair to simply label young voters as
disinterested or apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think it's unfair,'' said Blackwell, whose office
handles elections in Ohio. ``Younger people are further down the
political food chain so it's easier to dump on them and say they're
apathetic than it is to look in the mirror at what we're doing to
help them become voters.''
</P>
<P>
   What would help young people become voters?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can break that down into two words,'' Blackwell said.
``Adult example.''
</P>
<P>
   He said dwindling turnout among all Americans makes it even more
difficult to draw younger people into the process. As the Pew
Trust's Delli Carpini said: ``Young people reflect us better than
we'd like them to.''
</P>
<P>
   And Blackwell, himself a campaign veteran who has run on state
and local ballots for years, said not everyone in the political
arena is eager to reverse the trend in youth voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are whole legions of campaign professionals, and some
weird pundits, that have made megabucks on low voter turnout
elections,'' Blackwell said. ``Do I think we have a whole class of
election professionals who prefer a smaller, more manageable
turnout? Yes, and that's a big part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without sinister motive, some say campaigns are
perpetuating a chicken-and-egg problem: The campaigns don't target
young people because they don't vote, but then young people don't
vote because the campaigns haven't targeted them. Or perhaps it's
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Neglection 2000, a project run by the young voting
group Third Millennium, tried to chronicle the dilemma by studying
the use of campaign commercials in the heat of the presidential
primary earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Studying media markets in four cities from Dec. 1, 1999 through
the decisive March 7 primary, Neglection 2000 used marketing
demographics and concluded that the presidential campaigns seldom
ran their television ads on shows or during viewing hours when
young voters were likely to see them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study found that only 36 presidential campaign
ads ran during the popular young people's show Friends, compared
with 651 ads during the ``older leaning'' Today.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to Neglection 2000, was that only 17
percent of those between the ages of 18 and 34 remembered a
campaign commercial, but for those over age 50 the percentage
jumped to 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For Nan Whaley, the youth coordinator for the Montgomery County
Democratic Party, none of this is surprising. At 24, she still
believes young people have to take more responsibility for becoming
engaged in voting, but she said the system needs to bend a bit to
help make that easier.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, the University of Dayton is likely to
become one of the rare college campuses with a polling place on its
grounds. The Montgomery County Board of Elections still is
reviewing the details of how the new precinct would be drawn, but
approval is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a polling place on campus took years. To split a
precinct, state law requires 1,000 new and active voters to be
counted in an existing precinct, but that's hard to do in a college
neighborhood when people are moving out every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us five years,'' said Whaley, who began working on the
project when she was a freshman at the school. ``The board of
elections people didn't really believe this ever would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With a polling place on campus, Whaley is convinced UD will
dramatically raise its voter participation rate among students
simply because voting will be so much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Yager, the frustrated junior at Central Michigan University,
admits it may sound like the height of laziness to say voting
should be made easy. But, she counters, at least it shouldn't be
made hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it just sounds like little things,'' she said, ``but if
you take all the little things and put them together it becomes a
big thing.''

THE NEW YORKER MARKS ITS 75TH, WITH STYLE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New Yorker threw itself a 75th birthday bash over
the weekend and danced fancy all over town.
</P>
<P>
   From Greenwich Village north to Times Square and beyond, it
strutted its stable of writers and poets and cartoonists for
audiences in love with the magazine and the idea of it.
</P>
<P>
   They came from British Columbia and North Carolina and the West
80s and Soho to hear Salman Rushdie and Zadie Smith, the way kids
from the Bay Shore of Long Island line up for Springsteen at the
Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The large names were here, save V.S. Naipaul, who was lost to
illness, and John Updike, who was holed up in his lair on the North
Shore of Boston, churning out his 600 words a day. The list
dazzled: William Trevor, Muriel Spark, Edna O'Brien, Julian Barnes,
Rushdie and Smith, Richard Ford, E. Annie Proulx, Alice Munro,
Stephen King, Jhumpa Lahiri, Tobias Wolff, Cynthia Ozick, Sherman
Alexie, T. Coraghessan Boyle, Nick Hornby.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just Friday night, when the Yankees beat the
Orioles in a roller coaster up in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Reading The New Yorker tea leaves has long been a pursuit
rivaled perhaps by Cold War Kremlinology. The practice has been
feverish this birthday year, as readers ponder questions like:
</P>
<P>
   Has editor David Remnick brought the magazine back to the center
after a spell out on the warning track under Tina Brown?
</P>
<P>
   Are the cartoons still funny?
</P>
<P>
   Is it a bad thing that John McPhee no longer writes 80,000 words
on the history of the Ping-Pong ball?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, no, and no.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? More interesting was the speculation about the
audiences this weekend. Would they be a hoary bunch pining for a
literary Camelot where people still drink gin and where station
wagons still come with real wood paneling? Would they be gaunt New
York Review of Books types in Birkenstocks? Village people in
fuschia with lip rings? Banana Republic SUV jockeys?
</P>
<P>
   They were, in their splendor, all of the above. Friday night,
when the fiction blitz lit up the city at 8 p.m. in 13 different
spots at once, legations of Prozac Nation in reading glasses were
overwhelmed by strange and wondrous urban creatures in Doc Martens
and dreadlocks who floated through the first tropical night of the
year like lightning bugs. Score one for youth.
</P>
<P>
   The arteries hardened on Saturday, when the theater critic John
Lahr talked in the hush of the Morgan Library about Noel Coward to
a crowd whose average age was 60, by his own estimate. And over on
Seventh Avenue, Adam Gopnik spoke about the magazine's most
brilliant artist, Saul Steinberg, to an audience with a 50-year
spread. (Gopnik reported that Steinberg once had told him, ``First
grade is a shock from which we never recover.'')
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a smorgasbord or a nightmare, depending on your
energy level. Charles Gates interviewed UN Secretary General Kofi
Annan, Calvin Trillin waxed on about humor, Remnick queried Paul
Simon about songwriting, outlaw singer/songwriter Steve Earle
played some new tunes. Then there were the panels _ on the
Internet, presidential politics, medicine, journalism, and young
writers.
</P>
<P>
   The options were as exhausting as was the logistical challenge
of trying to get to them, on a day of steamy temperatures and
Midtown gridlock from the throngs paying their respects to the late
Cardinal John O'Connor, who lay in state at St. Patrick's
Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this chaos, the ill-fated New Yorker bus tour of
Manhattan's landmark buildings, led by the architecture critic Paul
Goldberger, departed its perch by Saks Fifth Avenue, a festival
sponsor that featured blow-ups of New Yorker cartoons in its
windows.
</P>
<P>
   This jaunt was not for the faint of heart. The double-decker bus
secured by the magazine had itsy-bitsy windows and no air
conditioning. The heat inside surely rivaled the innards of a
Sherman tank in a firefight with Rommel somewhere near Tobruk.
</P>
<P>
   And with the roof squarely in place, riders could gaze at the
first five stories of the skyscrapers whose hallowed spires
Goldberger described in detail _ while the vehicle remained stuck
in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time that the birthday bash acquired the feel
of a forced march. Springtime in New York be damned, cabs suddenly
looked swell and a nap better than sex. Culture can be a brutal
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who could get a ticket rallied that evening for the
humor review at Town Hall. Playwright Wendy Wasserstein adapted
some of the wittiest writing from the magazine's 75 years. Swoosie
Kurtz, Alec Baldwin, Buck Henry, and Christopher Durang then read
the material with panache on stage. Some of it flopped, but most
was priceless.
</P>
<P>
   There was James Thurber's ``Mr. Preble Gets Rid of His Wife'' _
(``Let's go down to the cellar.''); Robert Benchley's
``Questionnaire'' _ (``What are English actors saying?''); Andy
Borowitz's ``Emily Dickinson: The Jerk of Amherst'' _ (``Writing
poetry beats stealing cars.''). Ian Frazier envisioned Samuel
Beckett as an airplane pilot _ (``You are now free to move about
the cabin and hang yourselves.'')
</P>
<P>
   The events continued like rolling thunder Sunday, when the
brunches took place. There were eight of them, on subjects ranging
from cartoons to war, from jazz to crime. The cartoon gang, led by
Robert Mankoff and Roz Chast, assembled in the cafe on the eighth
floor of Saks Fifth Avenue, which offered a fabulous view of the
secret gardens of Rockefeller Center high above street level.
</P>
<P>
   All moaned good-naturedly about the magazine fact-checkers,
famous for their diligence with cartoons as well as text. Charles
Barsotti recalled being queried if a hot dog has 17 grams of fat in
it after one of his offerings included a wiener.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoonists finally provided faces to go with their storied
names. They also provided the delicious thrill of walking across
the ground floor of the store on a Sunday morning, when it is
closed to the public and free of all those women of a certain age
spritzing perfume atomizers at you like ray guns.
</P>
<P>
   By the the end of the weekend, it was clear that the hagiography
around the ancien regime under the late William Shawn, the
secretive mandarin who edited the magazine for more than three
decades, is fading. Which is fine with Remnick, who became the
editor of the magazine at the absurdly young age of 39 less than
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Yorker is not a museum, and I am not a curator,'' he
said last week in his office on the 20th floor of the Conde Nast
Building. Remnick pointed to the photos on the wall of his office
of two dead New Yorker icons, A.J. Liebling and Joseph Mitchell,
and said, ``I worshiped them, but they're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, will be the readership frozen in the same amber. The
demographics demand an infusion of young New Yorker readers. ``I am
not an ancient,'' he said, stating the obvious. It is no surprise
that Remnick publishes young authors like Jhumpa Lahiri and Zadie
Smith and pays close attention to popular music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Yorker was great on Vietnam,'' he noted. ``But it
missed the Beatles. It missed rock and roll for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet such lapses won't happen on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   If Shawn was a god to many, he was a martinet to others.
Rushdie, for one, does not miss his magazine for an obvious reason.
``I couldn't get published in The New Yorker of Mr. Shawn,'' he
said Friday night at the Public Theater. Shawn rejected Rushdie's
first story, he recalled, saying, ``We don't publish pastiches.''
</P>
<P>
   But such eddies are lost in the broad flow of The New Yorker's
history. Rushdie is now part of the family, whose breadth and
vitality were evident along with its genealogy. If the bash was
uneven and solipsistic, it was nonetheless unlike anything else in
recent memory in this city. To paraphrase the PBS fund-raising
television spot, if not The New Yorker, who?
</P>
<P>
   The festival closed with a dozen of the magazine's finest poets
reading from their works in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public
Library. The lawn was full of hundreds of listeners who withstood
the fetid late-afternoon air to hear the likes of Philip Levine,
Charles Simic, and Louise Gluck read to the city. The turnout was
grand for the hometown magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The only missing element was the French aerialist who was to
have walked on a high wire above the crowd. But city officials
denied The New Yorker the necessary permit. The cowards.

&HT;     NEW TIRES MAY MAKE JACKS A THING OF THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not the kind of situation anyone wants to experience:
Changing a tire on a dark freeway in the middle of the night, with
cars buzzing by inches away at 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But it has happened to many of us. Tires are prone to going
flat; all it takes is a nail, screw or piece of debris to puncture
the rubber and let out the air.
</P>
<P>
   What if you could just keep on driving to a repair shop, where
the tire could be repaired safely while you lounge in the waiting
room?
</P>
<P>
   It's possible with an innovation in technology introduced to the
U.S. market in 1993 on the Chevrolet Corvette sports car: the
Goodyear Tire Co.'s run-flat tire, known as the EMT (short for
``extended-mobility tire'').
</P>
<P>
   With the model in use on the Corvette, the driver can keep going
even if all of the air escapes from the tire. And it isn't
necessary to stop at the nearest service station or tire shop; the
Corvette run-flat tires can be run up to 200 miles at 55 mph,
according to engineers from Akron, Ohio-based Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, we've driven 1,000 miles on one of these tires with a
2 1/2-inch hole in it, without a problem,'' said Bill Egan,
Goodyear's chief engineer for advanced product design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run-flat is the best technology so far that keeps you from
having to stop and change a tire,'' he said. ``It's so good, that
the two cars that come from the manufacturer with these tires _ the
Corvette and the Plymouth Prowler _ don't even come with a spare
tire. It can fail only from the standpoint of running it too far
and too fast; but even then, the failure is not catastrophic. You
don't want to drive very fast very far, because the tire gets hot
very fast with no air in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet began offering the Goodyear EMT as an option on
Corvettes in 1993, but when the fifth-generation 'Vette debuted in
1997, the tires were made standard, and the spare tire and jack
were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Goodyear introduced a line of Aquatred EMT run-flat
tires for vehicles other than the Corvette and the Prowler. They
don't have quite the range as a flat Corvette tire, but they will
go up to 50 miles at 55 mph with no problem, Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight sizes available to fit most popular sedans from
the midsize Ford Taurus, Honda Accord and Toyota Camry to the
high-end full-size cars such as the Buick Park Avenue and the
Cadillac Seville.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of the tires is a rigid sidewall that supports the
weight of the vehicle even if all of the air is gone. Goodyear uses
a special computer-designed steel thread in the tires to give it
the added strength.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the tires are available only for cars; they aren't
considered strong enough to support the weight of pickups, vans and
sport-utility vehicles, Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   For the cars that can use them, the new tires aren't cheap, and
there is a catch.
</P>
<P>
   Besides paying $120 to $150 apiece for the tires, each consumer
must also buy a low-air-pressure warning system that is installed
in each wheel to alert the driver if one of the tires loses its
air, Goodyear officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That system can cost up to $400 per car. But for now, in an
effort to get more people to buy these new tires, the company is
offering the pressure-warning system free, said Bob Toth,
Goodyear's marketing manager for consumer auto tires.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is that the tire performs so well when it loses air
that we can't leave it to the driver to determine when it has lost
air,'' he said. ``We require that you outfit your car with the
low-pressure warning system.''
</P>
<P>
   That system is rather high-tech itself: It consists of a
pressure gauge hooked to a miniature radio transmitter fitted into
each wheel. When the air pressure falls below 20 pounds, the
transmitter sends a signal to a dashboard-mounted receiver that
warns the driver that there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the transmitters has its own lithium-ion battery that is
designed to last at least as long as the tire, Egan said. To
conserve battery power, the devices shut themselves off after the
car has stopped for a few minutes, and they turn themselves back on
when the wheels start spinning again.
</P>
<P>
   In the Corvette and Prowler, the system is installed when the
vehicles come down the assembly line, and the warning receiver is
integrated into the instrument panel.
</P>
<P>
   But with after-sale installations, the receiver might not be the
most aesthetically pleasing piece of equipment in the car's cabin,
Toth said. It has to be attached to the dashboard or hung from a
sun visor, and it is usually plugged into the cigarette lighter
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is one of the issues we still have to overcome,'' he
said. ``They just aren't very pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   That technology is evolving, though, and soon the
pressure-warning systems should be less obtrusive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, most people will be driving on run-flat tires _
either Goodyear's or comparable tires developed by other
manufacturers, such as Michelin's new PAX run-flats _ tire experts
predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I want these tires on the cars my wife and
daughters are driving,'' Toth said. ``It's just not safe to get out
of the car and change a tire these days.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are some other solutions to that problem, however. Several
tire manufacturers, including Uniroyal, are selling self-sealing
tires, which come with a soft compound inside that works
automatically to seal the tire in the event of a minor puncture,
such as from a small nail or screw. They can't handle really large
punctures, however.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the market are puncture sealants that can be injected
into a flat tire through the air valve. These are readily available
at most auto parts stores.
</P>
<P>
   But they work ``just about 10 percent of the time, and they will
void the manufacturer's warranty on the tire,'' Egan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are water-based, some solvent-based. And some are not
very friendly to have running inside the tire. The chemicals in
them can attack the tire and make it fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear is now marketing a puncture-resistant tire for some
sport-utility vehicles, perfect for off-road use such as on the
famous Rubicon Trail in California, Goodyear spokesman Dave Wilkins
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, run-flat tires are available for many passenger cars
on the road today, and customers are embracing them even though
they do cost more and come with the complication of the
pressure-warning system.

   Young voters, students sometimes feel unwelcome
</P>
<P>
   By Scott Montgomery
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Melissa Fried of Washington Township, Ohio, .
knows she looks young, even for an 18-year-old, but she didn't
expect her youthfulness to be such a burden when she went to vote
this year in Ohio's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Poll workers ``really questioned'' her about her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times they asked me how old I was and I kept telling
them,'' Fried said. ``They said, `Well, what year were you born?' I
mean, why would I lie about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, she said, they huffed impatiently because she didn't know
how to use the key-punch voting system.
</P>
<P>
   The workers may only have been being vigilant, protecting the
integrity of the election rolls, but the result made Fried feel
unwelcome as she cast her first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to be a nice experience, but the whole
time I felt like I wasn't good enough,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom pegs apathy as the leading cause of dismal
turnout among potential voters between the ages of 18 and 34, but
some election experts and activists say the problem is deeper than
that.
</P>
<P>
   From obstinate election officials to registration laws that
don't take into account the mobility of the young, the U.S.
electoral system offers more obstacles than incentives, say
advocates who are trying to reverse the decline in participation
among young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes those obstacles seem deliberate. For instance,
Michigan put a new law into effect last month requiring the home
address on a voter's registration card to match his or her driver
license. For college students who typically move annually the new
law means they'll have to get a new driver's license each year if
they want to vote in local elections where they go to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's aimed specifically at preventing students from voting,''
said Michael Delli Carpini, who as head of Policy and Programs for
the Pew Charitable Trusts has funneled grant money into many youth
voting initiatives. ``I think that's a great example of the system
actually working against young people voting.''
</P>
<P>
   A Michigan state legislator who introduced the bill called it a
``common sense'' law to ensure that people vote where they really
live, but youth voting advocates say it's designed to make voting
more difficult for people whose voting habits may be harder to
predict. Six university student groups joined the Michigan ACLU in
filing a legal challenge to the new law, but last month a federal
judge rejected their request for an injunction to block the law
from being enforced. The judge said the inconvenience of renewing a
license wasn't an unreasonable burden on voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really frustrating,'' said Windi Yager, 20, a junior at
Central Michigan University, who as a member of the school's
student government has been involved in voter registration drives
on campus. Yager said she has left her parents' address on her
driver's license for simplicity, so that such things as health
insurance and financial records don't get tangled by her constant
relocating.
</P>
<P>
   But Yager has a 12-month lease in Mount Pleasant, and that's
where she recently completed the Census form that will help Mount
Pleasant's local elected officials get their proper share of
federal money for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Yager said she simply wants to vote on the local issues that
effect her directly. Voting absentee in her home town of
Beavertown, Mich., isn't a good option. ``Why would I want to vote
in Beavertown?'' she said. ``I live in Mount Pleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   She said in the months before the new law went into effect, her
campus was shot through with rumors that changing a driver's
license address could cost students everything from health
insurance to financial aid to scholarships. She said most of the
rumors couldn't be confirmed one way or another because
</P>
<P>
   policies vary from one institution to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't really involved in voting and I was just a regular
student here, I'd be extremely deterred from voting if I thought
something in my records might get messed up by changing my
address,'' she said. ``Society doesn't put a lot of pressure on
young people to vote, so anything that discourages it ....''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of mobility looms large among young Americans. In a
Census study in 1998, about 25 percent of Americans 35 or younger
said they had moved in the last year, but that percentage dropped
to about 7 percent for those 45 and older.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very, very mobile generation,'' said Russ Freyman,
director of Neglection 2000, a youth voter project. ``And that
flies in the face of registration requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   That conflict flared earlier this year in New Hampshire, which
is one of the few states that permits same-day voter registration.
On the day of that state's first-in-the-nation primary in February,
hundreds of University of New Hampshire students flocked to the
town's polling place for a get-out-the-vote rally by the Bill
Bradley presidential campaign and a group called Youthvote 2000.
But when the students arrived they were greeted by poll workers who
so vehemently questioned the students' claims of residency some
simply gave up, according to a rally organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Attorney General's Office conducted an
investigation, but no action was taken because students filed no
formal complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent a letter reminding our communities that have
universities that they need to allow the students to register,''
said New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Anne Edwards, ``that
a dorm address is good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this leads Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell
to conclude it's unfair to simply label young voters as
disinterested or apathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think it's unfair,'' said Blackwell, whose office
handles elections in Ohio. ``Younger people are further down the
political food chain so it's easier to dump on them and say they're
apathetic than it is to look in the mirror at what we're doing to
help them become voters.''
</P>
<P>
   What would help young people become voters?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can break that down into two words,'' Blackwell said.
``Adult example.''
</P>
<P>
   He said dwindling turnout among all Americans makes it even more
difficult to draw younger people into the process. As the Pew
Trust's Delli Carpini said: ``Young people reflect us better than
we'd like them to.''
</P>
<P>
   And Blackwell, himself a campaign veteran who has run on state
and local ballots for years, said not everyone in the political
arena is eager to reverse the trend in youth voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are whole legions of campaign professionals, and some
weird pundits, that have made megabucks on low voter turnout
elections,'' Blackwell said. ``Do I think we have a whole class of
election professionals who prefer a smaller, more manageable
turnout? Yes, and that's a big part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without sinister motive, some say campaigns are
perpetuating a chicken-and-egg problem: The campaigns don't target
young people because they don't vote, but then young people don't
vote because the campaigns haven't targeted them. Or perhaps it's
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Neglection 2000, a project run by the young voting
group Third Millennium, tried to chronicle the dilemma by studying
the use of campaign commercials in the heat of the presidential
primary earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Studying media markets in four cities from Dec. 1, 1999 through
the decisive March 7 primary, Neglection 2000 used marketing
demographics and concluded that the presidential campaigns seldom
ran their television ads on shows or during viewing hours when
young voters were likely to see them.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study found that only 36 presidential campaign
ads ran during the popular young people's show Friends, compared
with 651 ads during the ``older leaning'' Today.
</P>
<P>
   The result, according to Neglection 2000, was that only 17
percent of those between the ages of 18 and 34 remembered a
campaign commercial, but for those over age 50 the percentage
jumped to 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For Nan Whaley, the youth coordinator for the Montgomery County
Democratic Party, none of this is surprising. At 24, she still
believes young people have to take more responsibility for becoming
engaged in voting, but she said the system needs to bend a bit to
help make that easier.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for instance, the University of Dayton is likely to
become one of the rare college campuses with a polling place on its
grounds. The Montgomery County Board of Elections still is
reviewing the details of how the new precinct would be drawn, but
approval is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a polling place on campus took years. To split a
precinct, state law requires 1,000 new and active voters to be
counted in an existing precinct, but that's hard to do in a college
neighborhood when people are moving out every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us five years,'' said Whaley, who began working on the
project when she was a freshman at the school. ``The board of
elections people didn't really believe this ever would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With a polling place on campus, Whaley is convinced UD will
dramatically raise its voter participation rate among students
simply because voting will be so much easier.
</P>
<P>
   Yager, the frustrated junior at Central Michigan University,
admits it may sound like the height of laziness to say voting
should be made easy. But, she counters, at least it shouldn't be
made hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it just sounds like little things,'' she said, ``but if
you take all the little things and put them together it becomes a
big thing.''

50 YEARS AFTER ``PEYTON PLACE,'' CAMDEN, MAINE CELEBRATES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CAMDEN, Maine _ When Barbara Dyer heard in 1957 that the film
version of ``Peyton Place'' was going to be shot in Camden, alarm
bells rang in her head.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the quaint New England town of Woodstock, Vt., had
coldly refused to associate itself with Grace Metalious' scandalous
novel. The quaint Maine towns of Wiscasset, Skowhegan and
Waterville were abuzz, weighing the promised income against the
danger of moral decay. Even the newspaper editor in Lewiston, a
town not quaint enough to make the director's short list, offered
his lofty two cents: ``We somewhat doubt,'' he wrote, ``if even the
broad-minded people of any Maine town would want it known as the
vicarious locale of such purposeless goings-on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, who had read three pages of the novel before putting it
down in shock and disgust, heard the news and saw only disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   So it is ironic that, at the age of 75 and now the town
historian, Dyer helps to celebrate ``Peyton Place'' in a spirit of
playful 1950s nostalgia. Last weekend, as part of a film festival
on the theme ``Small Towns, Steamy Movies,'' Camden hosted fans of
the seminal small-town melodrama, walking them through Allison
McKenzie's sexual awakening, Selena Cross's pregnancy by her
stepfather and Betty Anderson's tenure as a parking lot siren. Dyer
is the first to admit it: Episodes that, in 1957, seemed to drill
into the marrow of human decency now seem almost quaint.
</P>
<P>
   But time has not entirely softened the story of ``Peyton
Place.'' Behind the weekend fun was the grim true experience of
Metalious, whose life was wrecked by the book she wrote. A lifelong
New Hampshirite from a poor Franco-American family, Metalious
declared war on Yankee New England with her first novel. The sex
scenes that titillated a nation were only the most obvious
transgression; behind every door in her fictional town lay an ugly
secret _ whether it be ethnic hatred, Doc Swain's abortion
services, the town fathers' desire to wipe poor families off the
map, or the everyday malice leveled at individuals who broke the
community's rules.
</P>
<P>
   Metalious's portrait of small-town life gave New England the
treatment usually reserved for the South. ``To the tourists,''
Metalious told one reporter, ``these towns look as peaceful as a
picture postcard, but if you go beneath the picture it's like
turning over a rock with your foot. All kinds of strange things
crawl out.''
</P>
<P>
   Words like that did not go unpunished. As ``Peyton Place'' broke
records in the publishing world _ it sat at No. 1 on the New York
Times's best-seller list for 59 weeks _ New England reviewers,
librarians and schoolteachers vilified Metalious and her book.
Camden's library did not stock ``Peyton Place'' when Mike Robson
decided to film the movie there; neither did the library in
Gilmanton, N.H., where Metalious lived, until Barbara Walters
donated one on a visit.
</P>
<P>
   But what got to Metalious was the personal snubbing, said Ardis
Cameron, a University of Southern Maine professor who uses ``Peyton
Place'' to teach social commentary in her New England Studies
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like she had an `A' on her,'' said Melissa Preston, 44,
who grew up in Gilmanton and now works at the Chamber of Commerce
in Camden. ``In New England, you shun something that is morally
wrong in your eyes. It affects your family to be seen with that
person.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was with Metalious, who was 32 when ``Peyton Place'' was
published: She was shunned, according to her friends and
biographers, as painfully as any character in her book. In
Gilmanton, people ostracized her children and crossed the street to
avoid her, said her then-husband, George Metalious. Once, flush
with her new success, Metalious invited all the town's citizens to
stay with her at the Plaza in New York, and none of them accepted,
Cameron said. When the film ``Peyton Place'' premiered in Camden to
great fanfare, Maine resident Bette Davis was on hand, but
Metalious was not.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Metalious about it, she said she was not
invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people thought Grace was a trashy person,'' said Emily
Toth, a professor at Louisiana State University who published
``Inside Peyton Place,'' a biography of Metalious, in 1981. ``I
remember sitting in a library in Laconia and local citizens would
say things like, `If you found out the truth about her it would
really curl your hair.' There was a way in which they were still
mad at her.''
</P>
<P>
   In her peculiar isolation, Metalious began to drink heavily.
Near the end, she ate almost nothing but big salads at night time,
Toth said.
</P>
<P>
   Metalious died of cirrhosis of the liver in 1964, at age 39,
seven years after her blockbuster success. According to Frances
Hugelman, 84, who lives in Metalious's old house, there was a
sincere attempt by some citizens of Gilmanton to prevent her being
buried in the town cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   When tourists asked to see Metalious's grave, Preston recalled,
townspeople ``wouldn't even show them where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   But the events in Camden have a gentle, nostalgic tone, geared
less toward revisionist historians than film buffs such as Frank
Anzalone.
</P>
<P>
   For Anzalone, a Philadelphia stage director who was a boy when
the movie was released, the lush technicolor and hectic embraces of
``Peyton Place'' preserve the delicious appeal of the forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about an innocent time, and about sex being verboten,''
he said. ``There's a fascination with that, because we've certainly
gone the other route. If you look around, there is no innocence
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie that came out of Camden was far less disturbing than
Metalious's book, substituting a miscarriage for Selena Cross's
abortion, excising racist and ethnic ugliness and toning down a
host of seething sexual issues involving parents and children.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s television series ``Peyton Place'' was even more
benign, removing Selena Cross and Doc Swain from the scene
altogether. When the Camden Herald's editors defended their stance
in favor of allowing the filming, they made it clear that they had
little respect for the novel: ``It is a sorry day,'' they wrote,
``when the people of a state as steeped in freedom as Vermont or
the editors as conscientious as the (Lewiston) Sun argue against
the making of a movie because the book it is based on is bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The gamble paid off for Camden, a sparkling coastal town where
the balance had been shifting from industry to tourism for many
years. Although Camden had long drawn wealthy summer people, the
movie's lush scenery helped establish ``leaf-peeping'' as a
middle-class pastime, said Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, fans of the movie trickled in, and it became
clear that Camden's potential scandal had grown into a legitimate
tourist attraction culminating in the weekend festival, which was
complete with a re-creation of Allison McKenzie's Prom Night and
appearances by two of the film's actors.
</P>
<P>
   But New Englanders are still prepared to debate whether
Metalious drew an accurate picture of small-town life. One elderly
resident recalled moving to Camden a few years after the film came
out and expressing disgust at the film's depiction of a town full
of malicious gossip and dark secrets. Overhearing her comment, an
elegant older neighbor took her aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dear, talk to me after you've lived here long enough to
know your neighbors a little better,'' she said. ``We'll see what
you think then.''

 &HT;    Reports find patients' needs misunderstood
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Physicians need to be more sensitive to their
patients' pain and more receptive to using both opiates and
alternative therapies, a Gallup survey and two research studies
have shown in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Stenning already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   For 55 years, he has battled spinal pain from a World War II
injury through surgeries and spinal fusion, from local hospitals to
the Mayo Clinic, using leg braces and crutches but never escaping
the pain that both wore him out and kept him awake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had pretty much decided I'd had it with doctors and surgeons
and what have you,'' Stenning says, but when his wife, Anne, read
something about a pain seminar two years ago, ``I decided to take
one more crack at it.''
</P>
<P>
   That seminar at Miami Valley Hospital led to surgery in October
in which a morphine pump was implanted in his abdomen and connected
to his spinal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   The computer-programmed pump provides much greater relief with
far lower doses by sending morphine straight to the central nervous
system, and it eases fears of morphine addiction by taking the
patient's decisions out of the equation. But even though all the
public hospitals in Montgomery County perform the procedure, Dr.
Townsend Smith says it's like most other pain treatments in that
it's not helping as many patients as it could.
</P>
<P>
   People suffer unnecessarily across the pain spectrum, from
aggravating to debilitating, largely because they don't know they
have a choice. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
said Thursday in an arthritis report, available methods for
treating pain and educating patients are underused. The problem is
compounded by misconceptions among health professionals and
government regulators about both pain itself and the opioid
pain-killing drugs that include morphine.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very big scare in most physicians' minds about
prescribing opioids for chronic pain problems,'' says Smith,
associate director of Miami Valley Hospital's Pain Center. Doing so
invites heavy government scrutiny and requires voluminous record
keeping, all with the doctor's license at stake. But there are
situations, says Smith, where no alternative pain management
exists.
</P>
<P>
   Even physicians tend to overestimate the risk of addiction,
according to University of Wisconsin Medical School findings
published April 5 in The Journal of the American Medical
Association. The report said medical opioids' share of all
drug-abuse cases decreased from 5.1 percent to 3.8 percent from
1990 to 1996, and previous research has shown such addiction is
rare among patients who never were addicted to anything else.
</P>
<P>
   About three of every seven American adults _ 42 percent _
experience pain daily, according to the Gallup survey of 2,002
adults for the Arthritis Foundation and several other
organizations. Opiates aren't appropriate for all of them, but some
treatment is called for when the same percentage, or 83 million
Americans, say pain ``frequently affects their participation in
some activities.'' The survey's margin for error was plus or minus
2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthritis and other types of pain significantly impact the
lives of most Americans, but many aren't comfortable taking the
first step to find relief _ talking to their doctor,'' says Dr.
Jack Klippel, medical director of the Arthritis Foundation, which
launched a ``Speaking of Pain'' program last month in hopes of
making the subject more prominent.
</P>
<P>
   It's telling, then, that one of the things Stenning, 75, found
most impressive about Smith was, ``He's a listener.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the roughly half of adults who see doctors for pain
treatment, the Arthritis Foundation survey says barely two-fifths
of them ``believe their doctor completely understands how their
pain makes them feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason pain is undertreated, Stenning says. Very few
doctors ``understand that kind of pain because they've never
experienced it.'' He recalls with contempt a military doctor who
was so insensitive to an amputee's ``phantom limb'' pain that he
opened his empty hand and said, ``Here are some phantom pills for
your phantom pain.''
</P>
<P>
   In Stenning's case, pain came from bending, sitting ``for any
length of time,'' turning the wrong way in bed, really just being
alive. Sometimes it was nerve pain shooting across his back or down
a leg. Sometimes it felt as if ``someone had put a knife in the
middle of my spine and was turning it.''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much he could do ``without the pain becoming an
all-encompassing reality in my system.''
</P>
<P>
   Specialists are learning more techniques to fight pain all the
time, Smith says. The World Congress on Pain two years ago
recommended an ``analgesic ladder'' starting with nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and progressing to such
milder opioid pills as codeine, then to stronger opioids in
morphine's class and finally to the heavy artillery of corrective
surgery, intravenous opioids, microwave therapy and epidural nerve
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those options, 80 percent of respondents in the Gallup
survey called pain an unavoidable result of aging, 60 percent said
it is ``just something you have to live with'' and 28 percent
didn't believe there was ``any real solution'' for pain. Older
Americans are more likely to suffer pain regularly, certainly, but
even in the 18-to-34 age group, two-thirds of those polled reported
pain at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are starting to understand that at some point, pain
goes from being merely a symptom to being a disease process,''
Smith says. ``There are studies showing changes in the nerves
themselves as a result of a chronic, painful stimulus.''
</P>
<P>
   Pain complicates cancer treatment, for example, by robbing
patients of appetites and therefore nutrients, and of energy and
therefore exercise and social contacts. Cancer patients account for
about one-quarter of the 26 pumps Smith has installed in his three
years at Miami Valley, says Randy Lakes, his registered nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see more of them,'' Lakes says. ``Cancer patients
really respond well and often return to a practically normal
lifestyle. These people typically outlive their prognosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Back pain is the most common problem Smith treats with the pump.
It's often a vicious cycle, Smith says, because surgery to repair
back pain leads naturally to scar tissue that can cause worse back
pain. The pump also can be filled with Baclofen, a strong muscle
relaxant to relieve spasticity in some quadriplegics and people
with multiple sclerosis or cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   The morphine pump is a treatment of last resort, Smith says, for
the 5 percent to 10 percent of pain patients who can't be relieved
otherwise. Prospective patients are first screened psychologically
and hospitalized for three days to simulate the pump with an IV
drip.
</P>
<P>
   The pump, about the size of a hockey puck, is placed in the
abdomen with a catheter going to the intrathecal fluid around the
spinal cord. ``That is where we have the highest concentration of
receptors for pain,'' Smith says, ``so we can get better results
with a much lower dose of medication, sometimes one-300th of what
we were giving orally.''
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of decrease in his own opioids, Stenning says the
medication no longer clouds his concentration as it occasionally
did before. He still has some pain. ``It's not a cure-all,'' he
says. But the pain no longer overshadows everything else. He no
longer wakes up in agony two or three times a night.
</P>
<P>
   The pump can be refilled by injection and reprogrammed by radio
waves, but its batteries need to be replaced surgically every five
to seven years. It also has the advantage for doctors of not
requiring repeated large prescriptions for opioids.
</P>
<P>
   Other physicians often refer patients to Smith, says Lakes,
``because they don't want to prescribe narcotics themselves.'' But
Lakes says Ohio's State Medical Board makes no allowances for a
pain-treatment specialty when it monitors a doctor's prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to governmental fear of addiction, Congress is
considering legislation to further impede pain medication as a
means of discouraging physician-assisted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be looking to utilize these medications in the
appropriate situations regardless of personal feelings,'' Smith
says. In other words, stop considering anything else but the
patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife used to say, `Your face is full of pain,''' Stenning
says. ``That doesn't happen anymore.''

 &HT;    Eds. RUNS WITH PAIN
 &HT;    Many in pain seek alternative treatment
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When patients with chronic pain can't find relief
from their physicians, a lot of them turn to alternative
practitioners.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to highlighting conventional medicine's limitations,
the trend also puts patients at risk if they don't tell their
doctors about alternative therapies that could interact badly with
prescription drugs, university researchers said last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of emergency-room patients who were able to walk,
State University of New York-Stony Brook research indicated 56
percent of those with pain had used at least one alternative
therapy and 87 percent had gotten some relief from it, but only 30
percent had told their physicians about it. Massage and
chiropractic were the most popular alternative therapies, each used
by at least 30 percent of the pain patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's needs maybe are not being met by conventional
medicine, so we need to question ourselves what we are doing
wrong,'' Dr. Adam J. Singer of the University Medical Center at
SUNY-Stony Brook told Reuters Health.
</P>
<P>
   One mistake is the general reluctance to use such opioid
painkillers as morphine, University of Wisconsin Medical School
researchers found. Patients can develop addictions to those drugs,
or a tolerance that requires steady increases in dosage.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for abuse is real, but it is not a reason for
denying patients the drugs, Wisconsin researcher David E. Joranson
told Reuters Health. Many people who could benefit from these
painkillers aren't receiving them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that patient access to opioid analgesics is so bad
in some places that pain patients are checking themselves into
methadone programs only to get pain management.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the SUNY-Stony Brook study suggested the unsupervised
use of herbal pain-killing medications constitute a danger that is
not sufficiently recognized.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency-room survey showed about one in four had tried
herbal remedies. It's important for physicians to know about them,
however, because their side effects can be confused with disease
symptoms and because they can interact perilously with other
medications.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the researchers said when herbal ginkgo biloba is
used with some anticoagulant drugs, severe bleeding can result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to evaluate these alternative therapies
scientifically,'' Singer said. ``Those that are found to be
effective should be embraced by conventional medicine and those
that are found to be ineffective should be rejected by both
conventional medicine and patients.''

still only authentic site of Viking settlement in North America,
500 years before the voyages of Columbus. Ruins of eight houses and
workshops, some of their thick walls and pitched roofs meticulously
restored, will be a focus for this year's millennial commemoration
of all things Viking. Excavations here have not only confirmed
elements of truth in the sagas of the seafaring adventurers from
Scandinavia, they have also inspired new scholarship revising the
legendary image of the Vikings. By John Noble Wilford. (2100 words)

OH-OH: THE CASE OF THE SO-CALLED MECHANICAL ERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 14)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A satirical form of intellectual sabotage took place at The
Boston Globe 20 years ago. An editorial about President Carter's
economic plan was scheduled to be headlined ``All Must Share the
Burden.'' This is one of the dullest, most hackneyed cliches in
journalism, always followed by a mournful paean to responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Either a printer-prankster or an editorial writer who could not
stand it any longer changed the headline at the last minute to
``Mush From the Wimp.'' This could have been a derogation of the
president's policy or of the chief editorial writer's prose. The
underground dissident was never caught, but editorialists ever
since have been on the alert to this form of internal sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   (I remember this vividly because it triggered a column about the
origin of  &UR; wimp &LR; , defined as ``a person weepy as a drip and
listless as a nebbish,'' derived from  &UR; whimper &LR;  and influenced by
the name  &UR; Wimpy &LR; , for a sleepy-eyed lover of hamburgers in the
comic strip featuring Popeye the sailor.  &UR; Wimp &LR; , a derogation
dreaded more by politicians than ``ax murderer,'' has since been
edged out by  &UR; wuss &LR; , a rhyming form of unprintable etymology. But I
digress.)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in an editorial in The Washington Post supporting
the Justice Department's raid on a Miami home to seize Elian
Gonzalez, the headline remained as intended: ``The Elian
Operation.'' But the key line read: ``Eight agents were in and out
of the house in three minutes, carrying the boy in a blanket.
 &UR; ohhoh &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Fred Hiatt, editor of The Post's editorial page,
about this strange insertion of  &UR; ohhoh &LR;  into the editorial, he
muttered, ``We think it was a mechanical error.''
</P>
<P>
   I am prepared to accept this explanation from an embarrassed
fellow opinion-monger, but am inclined to wonder: Could  &UR; ohhoh &LR; 
have been a prankster's surreptitious editorial comment on
editorial comment? If so, what does it mean?
</P>
<P>
   The exclamation or interjection  &UR; oho &LR;  is defined in the OED as
``an exclamation expressing surprise, taunting, exultation.'' Its
first recorded use was in 1369 as a shout to arouse a sleeper (some
readers of editorials need this sort of anti-soporific) in a
passage by Chaucer: ``This messenger ... cried  &UR; O how &LR; , a-wake
anoon.'' Shakespeare changed the spelling when he picked it up in
his 1601 ``Twelfth Night,'' with Malvolio telling himself, `` &UR; Oh
ho &LR; , do you come neere me now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaucer, in his 1386 ``Canterbury Tales,'' also spelled the
exclamation differently: `` &UR; A ha &LR;  the fox! and after him they
ran.'' This sense of the sound as ``lo and behold'' was taken up in
the 1611 King James Bible thrice in Ezekiel, transliterated from
the Hebrew  &UR; heach &LR; , later translated by some as indicating
``malicious joy.''
</P>
<P>
   In current use,  &UR; oh-hoh &LR;  has been overtaken by  &UR; aha! &LR;  _ its
sense a ``triumphantly derisive discovery of a minor subterfuge.''
I asked the playwright Neil Simon about this a few years ago, and
he came up with several meanings, from ``a response when you know
something but find it unnecessary to share'' to ``the first half of
an uncompleted sneeze.'' His most apt usage: `` &UR; Aha! &LR;  is said
sarcastically to your daughter when she says she came home at 11
last night when you know it was 12:15.''
</P>
<P>
   Now let's take a different tack. What if the mechanical errorist
at The Washington Post meant to represent typographically a sound
of wry derision, as if to say, ``Sure, that's what  &UR; you &LR;  say''?
That would be spelled  &UR; uh-huh &LR; . (That meaning is also expressed in
what Edward Bleier of Time-Warner has termed the ``double
positive,'' which turns the sense of the word around, as in
``yeah-yeah.'')
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Uh-huh &LR;  is also the sound of ``I hear you, I understand'' or
the slightly more affirmative ``Yeah, I guess so.'' The earliest
recorded uses of  &UR; uh-huh &LR;  were in the late 19th century by magazine
fiction writers transcribing Negro dialect, more as exclamation
than affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   In contradistinction to that positive, if sometimes mocking,
 &UR; uh-huh &LR;  is the clearly negative  &UR; uh-uh &LR; . The first literary
citation for this negation is in Dashiell Hammett's 1930 ``Maltese
Falcon'': ``Do you know who he is?'' asks Effie Perine, and Sam
Spade replies, `` &UR; Uh-uh &LR; , but I'd guess he was Captain Jacobi.''
</P>
<P>
   Now for a final run at the possible meaning of the mysterious
 &UR; ohhoh &LR;  in The Post editorial.
</P>
<P>
   Dictionaries that have an entry for  &UR; oh &LR;  as ``an expression of
wonderment'' fail to carry a definition of  &UR; oh-oh &LR; , or the more
staccato  &UR; uh-oh &LR; . But almost every native speaker of American
English knows  &UR; oh-oh &LR;  to mean ``watch out'' or ``trouble ahead'';
when our leading lexicographers read this, they will utter  &UR; uh-oh &LR; 
and hasten to include the commonly exclaimed warning in their next
revisions.
</P>
<P>
   Could the phantom of the pressroom have meant ``Watch out _ the
preceding opinion will draw a lot of mail''? Perhaps; we'll never
know unless somebody confesses. But a new generation of
proofreaders is now alerted to avert mush from the wimp.
</P>
<P>
   POWER MISTAKE
</P>
<P>
   Beware the urge to be ultracorrect.
</P>
<P>
   Most power-writers know that the phrase  &UR; corridors of power &LR;  is
identified with C.P. Snow, author of the 1964 novel of that name.
In a recent article, I noted this, but after looking into the OED,
added, ``Actually, it was coined in the BBC's magazine, The
Listener, in 1962, but popularized by Snow's title two years
later.''
</P>
<P>
   Comes now Mary DeForest of Denver to set me straight. In a 1956
novel, ``Homecoming,'' Snow wrote, ``The official world, the
 &UR; corridors of power &LR; , the dilemmas of conscience and egotism _ she
disliked them all.''
</P>
<P>
   In his preface to ``Corridors of Power,'' Snow explained: ``By
some fluke, the title of this novel seems to have passed into
circulation during the time the book itself was being written. I
have watched the phenomenon with mild consternation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phrase was first used, so far as I know, in `Homecoming.'
... Mr. Rayner Heppenstall noticed it, and adopted it as a title
for an article about my work. If he had not done this, I doubt if I
should have remembered the phrase myself; but when I saw it in Mr.
Heppenstall's hands, so to speak, it seemed the appropriate name
for this present novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow knew it had become a cliche, but all must share the burden.
As he put it, ``I console myself with the reflection that, if a man
hasn't the right to his own cliche, who has?''

   Lilly has also aggressively sought to discredit researchers who
published data linking its product to suicide. One of its early
targets was Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of
psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and a McLean Hospital
researcher, who wrote a crucial paper on the link between suicide
and Prozac in 1990; he found that 3.5 percent of patients put on
Prozac either attempt or commit suicide due to severe agitation
from akathisia. As a result of Lilly's campaign, many in the
psychiatric community say they believe Teicher has distanced
himself from his original work. But in a rare interview with the
Globe, Teicher said that he stood by his work, and that the ability
of Prozac to induce suicide in a minority of patients ``is a real
phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Teicher, Barberich, and Young filed their patent for the new
Prozac in August 1993, the same year Teicher published another
report, this one in the journal Drug Safety titled ``Antidepressant
Drugs and the Emergence of Suicidal Tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper was a direct challenge to data reported in the March
1991 issue of the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry by Drs. Maurizio
Fava and Jerrold Rosenbaum of Massachusetts General Hospital. Their
study found no significant difference in ``suicidal ideation'' in
patients treated with fluoxetine compared to those receiving other
antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Teicher wrote in his 1993 paper that Fava and Rosenbaum's
statistics were flawed. Using Fava and Rosenbaum's data, Teicher
came to the opposite conclusion: namely, that patients on Prozac
were at least three times more likely to become suicidal than those
on older antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA came up with similar results even before Teicher
published his 1993 data. Dr. David Graham, chief of the FDA's
Epidemiology Branch, wrote on Sept. 11, 1990, that Lilly's data on
suicide and Prozac, as well as the Fava and Rosenbaum study, were
insufficient to prove that Prozac was safe. In an internal FDA
memo, Graham wrote: ``Because of apparent large-scale
underreporting, the firm's analysis cannot be considered as proving
that fluoxetine and violent behavior are unrelated.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Prozac Backlash''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now a decade later, Lilly has targeted Dr. Joseph Glenmullen,
whose book ``Prozac Backlash'' has apparently incensed Lilly
executives.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen, a clinical instructor in psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School and a clinician at the Harvard University Health
Services, says he wrote the book because he was alarmed by the
number of patients who were reporting severe side effects from the
serotonin-boosting antidepressants including Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft,
and Luvox. ``The two most upsetting side effects were patients
becoming suicidal on the drugs, and the development of disfiguring
facial tics,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   After obtaining hundreds of pages of FDA documents through the
Freedom of Information Act, as well as internal Lilly memos that
are part of the public record in lawsuits filed against the drug
company, Glenmullen wrote that Lilly had tried to downplay side
effects of Prozac for years.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly alerted newspapers and TV stations to the book and began a
campaign to discredit the author, saying that Harvard Medical
School professors were unfamiliar with his work and didn't
recognize his name. Glenmullen, a graduate of Harvard Medical
School, is one of 415 clinical instructors in medicine at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blast from a critic
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chief among Glenmullen's critics is Mass. General's Rosenbaum, a
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who, in a
written statement sent to the Globe calls ``Prozac Backlash'' a
``dishonest book'' that is `` manipulative'' and ``mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenbaum's objectivity has also been questioned. Not only
was his 1991 study on Prozac and suicide criticized by at least two
sets of researchers as well as the FDA, documents obtained by the
Globe show that Rosenbaum's relationship to Lilly is a cozy one: he
has served as a Prozac researcher and sat on a marketing advisory
panel for Lilly before Prozac was launched.
</P>
<P>
   When asked in an interview why he was speaking out against
Glenmullen's book, Rosenbaum said that the suicide controversy was
``old news'' and that the book presents the information as new
research. He noted that akathisia is ``pretty rare'' and that ``it
doesn't occur more than in people given a placebo.''
</P>
<P>
   But because there is no official reporting system for drug side
effects, no one knows how common drug side effects are, said Larry
Sasich, a research analyst at Public Citizen in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no active surveillance system to look at adverse
events,'' he said. ``Unless something very unfortunate happens and
a large number of people are harmed in a unique way, no one is
going to look at it; nobody ever puts two and two together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sepracor's patent
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, the Federal Trade Commission opened the way for
Lilly to market Teicher's, Barberich's, and Young's new Prozac, for
which Sepracor holds the patent. The new Prozac, R-fluoxetine, is a
modified form of an ingredient found in Prozac, which, according to
Sepracor, not only has fewer side effects but more potential uses
and benefits than the original.
</P>
<P>
   In making the decision, the FTC rejected arguments from its
lawyers and the generic drug industry that the agreement unfairly
limits generic Prozac competition.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Sepracor press release dated April 13, the
company will receive an upfront payment and license fee of $20
million from Lilly and an additional $70 million based on the
progression of the drug. Sepracor will receive royalties, and in
exchange, Lilly will get the exclusive world rights to R-fluoxetine
for all indications and uses. Lilly will be responsible for the
development of the drug, regulatory submissions, product
manufacturing, marketing and sales, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
   Glenmullen wonders whether the new Prozac will, in fact, be
little more than an effort to prolong the life of a product with a
soon-to-expire patent. Although it is touted as having fewer side
effects, no one knows what effects may surface once large numbers
of people begin taking it for months or years. In the epilogue to
his book, he simply says: ``Like any new drug, it too will be an
ongoing experiment.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as the 14-year patent on Prozac is about to expire and the
drug's maker, Eli Lilly and Co., is preparing to launch a new
version, a body of evidence has come to light revealing the
antidepressant's dark side.
</P>
<P>
   The company's internal documents, some dating to the mid-1980s,
as well as government applications and patents, indicate that the
pharmaceutical giant has known for years that its best-selling drug
could cause suicidal reactions in a small but significant number of
patients. The reports could become critical as Lilly seeks
government approval for its new Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Internal documents show that in 1990, Lilly scientists were
pressured by corporate executives to alter records on physician
experiences with Prozac, changing mentions of suicide attempt to
``overdose'' and suicidal thoughts to ``depression.''
</P>
<P>
   --Three years before Prozac received approval by the US Food and
Drug Administration in late 1987, the German BGA, that country's
FDA equivalent, had such serious reservations about Prozac's safety
that it refused to approve the antidepressant based on Lilly's
studies showing that previously nonsuicidal patients who took the
drug had a fivefold higher rate of suicides and suicide attempts
than those on older antidepressants, and a threefold higher rate
than those taking placebos.
</P>
<P>
   --Lilly's own figures, in reports made available to the Globe,
indicate that 1 in 100 previously nonsuicidal patients who took the
drug in early clinical trials developed a severe form of anxiety
and agitation called akathisia, causing them to attempt or commit
suicide during the studies.
</P>
<P>
   --Though Lilly has steadfastly defended the drug's safety and
downplayed studies linking Prozac to suicide, the patent for the
new Prozac, R-fluoxetine, expected to be marketed by Lilly
beginning in 2002, notes that the new version will not produce
several existing side effects including ``akathisia, suicidal
thoughts, and self-mutilation,'' which the patent calls ``one of
its more significant side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   --A McLean Hospital researcher and associate professor at
Harvard Medical School, Dr. Martin Teicher, whose early 1990s
studies linked Prozac to akathisia and suicide, is a co-inventor of
the new Prozac, which Lilly plans to market, along with Timothy J.
Barberich, the CEO of Sepracor Inc., a Marlborough, Mass. drug
company, and James W. Young.
</P>
<P>
   --A just-published book, ``Prozac Backlash,'' by a Cambridge
psychiatrist, Dr. Joseph Glenmullen, has drawn Lilly's ire for
discussing Prozac's link to suicide, tics, withdrawal symptoms, and
other side effects of Prozac and similar antidepressants.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly officials continue to defend the drug's effectiveness,
saying its track record is borne out by the fact it is still the
most widely prescribed drug of its kind. In a written statement,
Jeff Newton, a Lilly spokesman, said: ``There is no credible
evidence that establishes a causal link between Prozac and violent
or suicidal behavior. There is, to the contrary, scientific
evidence showing that Prozac and medicines like it actually protect
against such behaviors.''
</P>
<P>
   Using figures on Prozac both from Lilly and independent
research, however, Dr. David Healy, an expert on the brain's
serotonin system and director of the North Wales Department of
Psychological Medicine at the University of Wales, estimated that
``probably 50,000 people have committed suicide on Prozac since its
launch, over and above the number who would have done so if left
untreated.''
</P>
<P>
   Healy, meanwhile, is conducting a new study that he says is the
first of its kind, giving antidepressants to healthy people to
study possible links to suicide. The results are expected to be
published in June.
</P>
<P>
   Prozac's success is certainly unquestioned. The introduction of
the drug to the US market in the late 1980s changed the way
Americans viewed their most intimate emotions and limitations.
Billed as a wonder drug to combat depression by boosting levels of
the brain chemical serotonin, Prozac and others like it were also
said to remedy a host of human frailties from poor self-esteem and
concentration to fear of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of last year, more than 35 million people worldwide
were using the drug, which provided Lilly with more than 25 percent
of its $10 billion in 1999 revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the problems with Prozac were known even before it was
introduced to the US market. Figures in a 1984 Lilly document
indicated that akathisia, the severe agitation that can lead to
suicide, occurs in at least 1 percent of patients, a level
considered a ``frequent'' event, and as such must be disclosed in a
company's product literature and package inserts. But there is no
such disclosure in Prozac's US literature, and it is not clear
whether the FDA panel charged with approving Prozac simply
overlooked or did not have access to certain critical data of
Lilly's.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, researchers say that most US doctors do not know to
warn patients of the potentially dangerous effect which, according
to published literature on the topic, can be alleviated with
sedatives or by going off the drug.
</P>
<P>
   German regulators, who eventually approved Prozac for use in
that country, require a warning label about the risk of suicide and
suggest the concurrent use of sedatives when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Akathisia is listed in Lilly's US product literature, but as an
infrequent event in Prozac users. No mention is made of its
potential relationship to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   A relationship, however, was found in a Globe search of US
patents. The patent for the new Prozac or R-fluoxetine (US Patent
no. 5,708,035), which Lilly will market after the existing patent
expires in 2001, contains a wealth of information about the
original Prozac. According to the patent, the new Prozac will
decrease side effects of the existing Prozac such as headaches,
nervousness, anxiety, and insomnia, as well as ``inner restlessness
(akathisia), suicidal thoughts and self-mutilation'' _ the same
effect Lilly has contended has not occurred in any substantial way
in some 200 lawsuits against it over the past decade. Most of the
suits were settled out of court and the terms kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A 1990 communique
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an electronic communique obtained by author Glenmullen dated
Nov. 13, 1990, from Claude Bouchy, a Lilly employee in Germany, to
three Lilly corporate executives at the company's Indianapolis
headquarters, Bouchy says he and a colleague ``have problems with
the directions our safety people are getting from the corporate
group (Drug Epidemiology Unit) and requesting that we change the
identification of events as they are reported by the physicians. .
. . Our safety staff is requested to change the event term `suicide
attempt' (as reported by the physician) to `overdose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchy continued that ``. . . it is requested that we change . .
. `suicidal ideation' to `depression.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And then Bouchy makes an appeal to his US Lilly colleagues: ``I
do not think I could explain to the BGA, to a judge, to a reporter
or even to my family why we would do this especially on the
sensitive issue of suicide and suicide ideation. At least not with
the explanations that have been given to our staff so far.''

   GOALS OF THE MILLION MOM MARCH
</P>
<P>
   _ Sensible ``cooling-off'' periods and background checks for
anyone who wants to purchase, from any person or place, weapons
capable of killing or injuring people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring handgun owners to be licensed and all handguns to be
registered.
</P>
<P>
   _ Requiring manufacturers to build in safety locks for all
handguns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting an individual's purchases of handguns to one per
month.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strict enforcement of existing gun laws at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enlistment of corporate America in spreading the message that
``guns _ in the wrong hands _ are simply unacceptable.'' These
``child-friendly'' companies should offer goods that law
enforcement agencies can in turn offer in exchange for guns. The
guns that are turned in would be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Recruitment of mothers, grandmothers, stepmothers, godmothers,
future mothers and all others willing to be ``honorary mothers'' to
join a continuing crusade for sensible gun control laws.

 &HT;    FEARS FOR CHILDREN INSPIRED MANY TO JOIN ANTI-GUN MARCH

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Parenting in America has come to this: Before
letting their children play at a friend's home, mothers routinely
ask if there's a gun in the house and, if so, whether it has been
safely locked away.
</P>
<P>
   Caren(cq) Appel started inquiring after her 9-year-old daughter,
Molly, was visiting a pal in an Atlanta suburb and the friend's
5-year-old brother walked in with a parent's firearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my 6-year-old goes to play with a friend, one of the
questions I ask is if they have a gun,'' said Margaret Erickson of
Austin, Texas, who has two sons, Michael, 6, and Christopher Robin,
3.
</P>
<P>
   Before dropping off her 4-year-old son on a play date, ``I have
to ask if they keep a gun in their home,'' agreed Valerie Hartman
Levy, another Atlanta mom. ``Children can't get into a bottle of
Tylenol because of the safety cap, but they could easily pull the
trigger of a loaded gun. That doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   On Mother's Day, these women will join a predicted 100,000
marchers in the nation's capital on a quest for ``sensible''
legislation to help ensure safer childhoods for their sons and
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   With hundreds of thousands of mothers also assembling in 20
other cities, including Atlanta and Austin, organizers believe this
``Million Mom March'' will be the largest rally ever for gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Foreshocks are already being felt in the capital. Activists on
both sides of the gun issue are advertising heavily, including a
``Put Safe Kids First'' print and TV campaign by the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by marching moms, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., will
introduce legislation Tuesday to require that all future gun sales
be recorded and gun owners be licensed. On Friday, President
Clinton is scheduled to meet at the White House with mothers
seeking new gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Million Mom March has inspired a counter-demonstration
in the capital called the Armed Informed Mothers' March. Sponsored
by Second Amendment Sisters Inc., a self-described ``grassroots
self-defense and safety-education advocacy group'' based in Dallas,
this march is to highlight people whose lives have been saved by
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the keynote speaker will be Texas state Rep.
Suzanna Gratia-Hupp. She was a patron in a Kileen, Texas, cafeteria
in 1991 when a man killed 21 people in a shooting spree. The
victims included Gratia-Hupp's parents. Had she been armed, she has
said, she could have stopped the killer.
</P>
<P>
   At the Million Moms March on Sunday, TV talk show host Rosie
O'Donnell will emcee a rally on the National Mall between the
Capitol and Washington Monument. Rosanne Cash and Patty Smyth will
sing. Speakers will include Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose
husband was killed in a 1993 shooting on the Long Island Rail Road,
and several mothers whose children were killed in gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started in my family room and has grown to a mantra
across the nation,'' said Donna Dees-Thomases, the New Jersey mom
who conceived the march. ``There is nothing more powerful than a
mother's drive to protect her children.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months since Dees-Thomases asked the National Park
Service for a permit to stage a march on May 14, the mothers'
crusade has gathered force in PTAs and play groups and car pools
and neighborhoods across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers received a $300,000 grant from the Funders'
Collective for Gun Violence Prevention and are selling T-shirts for
$25 to help raise the $1.6 million needed to finance the event. The
group's Internet site attracts about 50,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is purely a grassroots movement,'' said David Bernstein
of Handgun Control Inc., a Washington advocacy group that supports
the march. ``It was started by mothers who are sick and tired of
gun violence in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband saw it on the Web,'' said Michelle Boeckman of
Austin. Since then, the Washington march has turned into a Boeckman
family gathering. Jim and Michelle Boeckman and their 3-year-old
daughter, Taylor, are coming from Texas. Jim Boeckman's parents are
coming from Missouri, and two brothers and their pregnant wives
will also be there, along with Taylor's 3-year-old cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a statement,'' Michelle Boeckman said in
explaining the trip. ``It's crazy that we have so many guns out
there. ... Guns aren't the most important things in the country.
People are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about it, I knew that I had to get involved,''
said Appel, who lives outside Atlanta in eastern Cobb County and
described herself as a ``mom at home with three children.'' In
addition to Molly, there's Rebecca, 7, and Michael, 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really concerned for my children's safety,'' she said.
Recalling how children roamed safely and freely in her childhood
neighborhood, she lamented the ``locked environment'' that is now
necessary for children to grow up safely.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the march came last August as Dees-Thomases was
watching TV in her family vacation house on Fire Island, N.Y. Her
husband was away on business and her daughters, Lili, 6, and
Phoebe, 4, were asleep. A part-time publicist for CBS-TV's ``The
Late Show with David Letterman,'' Dees-Thomases was channel-surfing
in search of her boss when she happened onto a news show about the
shooting at a Jewish community center in California.
</P>
<P>
   Her own children attend such a center, so the issue of gun
control suddenly grew personal. The following week, she jotted down
the words ``Million Mom March,'' registered a Web site and filed
for a parade permit for Mother's Day.
</P>
<P>
   But this organizer was considerably better connected than the
typical suburban mom. A former journalist, Dees-Thomases was the
publicist for Dan Rather and the CBS Evening News from 1987 to
1993. Her husband, Jeffrey Thomases, is the brother of Susan
Thomases, a close friend of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The march got a national publicity boost when O'Donnell agreed
to emcee the Washington rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``These 'Million Moms' are an inspiration. And as a mother, this
is a personal issue,'' O'Donnell explained. ``The gun-control issue
is of vital interest to me.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Marchers stressed their mainstream views.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the right to bear arms and in the Constitution,''
said Erickson, who said she has many friends who hunt and have
taught gun responsibility to their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also know some people who shoot squirrels with assault
guns. That's not really hunting,'' she said. ``I think we can have
some rules (controlling guns) that make it safer for children.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun control issue suddenly became personal for Hartman Levy
several years ago when she and her husband, Jeff Levy, were robbed
while coming home from a dinner party in the Atlanta neighborhood
of Ansley Park. ``I had a gun put to my face,'' she recalled. Her
husband was ``beaten up.'' She described the assailants as two
armed ``young kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, people asked if she hadn't wished that she had been
armed, Hartman Levy said. ``I believe that if I had had a gun, I
would be dead. It would have escalated until I was shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband and 4-year-old son will be marching in Atlanta on
Sunday, while the trip to Washington is her Mother's Day present.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take a stand as a family,'' she said.

THE DOCTOR'S WORLD: EXPLORING THE ENIGMA OF PROSTATE THERAPIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, 180,000 American men will
suddenly learn this year that they have prostate cancer, and what
makes their decisions about treatment so difficult is that doctors
do not know which one is most effective.
</P>
<P>
   Better information about survival and side effects may come from
trials under way in Canada, Sweden and the United States, but not
for several years. Until then, patients must rely on limited
information. Not surprisingly, wide variations in practice occur.
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives include surgical removal of the prostate gland,
radiation (delivered externally or implanted as ``seeds''),
techniques to freeze and destroy the entire prostate, early
hormonal therapy and watchful waiting. While there is no standard
plan for such observation, it generally involves monitoring blood
tests to determine if the prostate specific antigen level
increases, rectal examinations to determine if prostate nodules
develop and checking for developing symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, survival rates for all seem to be comparable but
full scientific evaluation is lacking. Each therapy produces a
spectrum of short-term and long-term complications and effects on
quality of life, with no outcomes assured. Surveys show that
doctors often report fewer post-therapy side effects than do
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the best treatment option is for men who
are found to have prostate cancer and doctors do not always clearly
say that to patients,'' said Dr. Timothy Wilt, a practicing
internist and health services researcher at the University of
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Wasson, an expert on health care delivery at Dartmouth,
said there was no proof from scientifically controlled trials
``that any treatment is better than watchful waiting'' and then, if
the cancer spreads, prescribing drugs to block male hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Because prostate cancer is usually slow growing, doctors also do
not know whether treating the cancer early, when confined to the
prostate, improves length or quality of life compared with close
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we don't know is because there have been no large
head-to-head comparison trials of survival or complications,'' Wilt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gold standard for determining a therapy's safety and
effectiveness is the randomized controlled trial, with participants
assigned to a group receiving one therapy or to a second group
receiving a different therapy, possibly a placebo, or dummy
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision for early prostate cancer is ``complex and
severely hampered'' by a lack of such trials, Dr. Mark Frydenberg
of Melbourne wrote in The Medical Journal of Australia in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In such circumstances, doctors are often medical salesmen.
Recommendations from each specialty tend to be mirror images:
urologists generally advise surgery and radiation oncologysts
recommend radiation.
</P>
<P>
   For men with early prostate cancer as measured by low amounts of
prostate specific antigen in the blood and low scores on the
Gleason pathology test, early intervention with any option appears
to provide an excellent chance for disease-free survival. But
experts say they can also do extremely well with no therapy for
years.
</P>
<P>
   People with higher PSA levels and Gleason scores ``do not do
well with observation, but their survival appears equally poor with
early treatment,'' Wilt said. ``The question is: do they do any
better with any one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Published studies based on various individual or group practices
that looked at patients one year after they had prostate surgery
showed rates of urinary incontinence ranging from 4 percent to 40
percent, and impotence from 29 percent to 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Using a different method and drawing on a broader group, cancer
registries in six regions of this country, a team of scientists led
by Dr. Janet Stanford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
in Seattle studied nearly 1,300 men after surgery for prostate
cancer. Overall, at 18 months or longer after surgery, 8.4 percent
of patients were incontinent. Of those, 11.9 percent were
incontinent more than twice a day and 3.3 percent used three or
more pads each day.
</P>
<P>
   In its report in The Journal of the American Medical Association
last Jan. 19, the team also found that 59.9 percent of all of the
men were impotent as measured by the inability to have erections
firm enough for sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Rigorously controlled trials for prostate cancer have been
difficult to do ``because everyone felt they knew the answer,''
said Wasson, of Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Such committed positions delayed for decades the studies needed
to document that many women with breast cancer could have
lumpectomies rather than breast removal. Thus, when researchers
have started randomized trials, too few patients agreed to
participate because they were convinced they knew the best
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   However, three randomly controlled trials of men with early
stage, slow and moderately growing prostate cancer are in progress.
</P>
<P>
   American and Swedish researchers are conducting two trials in
several centers in each country to compare surgery to watchful
waiting. One _ organized by the U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs, the National Cancer Institute and the Agency for Health
Care Quality and Research _ began in 1995 but results will not be
in for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   A third study from Canada is comparing external radiation and a
technique to freeze the prostate known as cryotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The new trials are needed because earlier ones were too small
and their designs outdated. For example, two earlier controlled
trials, each involving only about 100 men with early stage cancer,
showed no differences in outcomes. The trials were conducted before
the widespread use of the PSA test and refinements in early
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   In one study, the Veterans Administration compared surgery to
watchful waiting and found no difference in survival after 23 years
of follow-up. ``It suggests that surgery is unlikely to have a
large benefit,'' Wilt said.
</P>
<P>
   Another study, reported in 1982, suggested that cancer
recurrence was more likely after radiation therapy than surgery.
But radiation therapy has improved since then.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainty, experts have prepared videotapes to
aid decision making. But these and other informational materials
have found limited use in routine practice.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors, particularly those in group practices, have a
nurse tell patients what to expect in the recovery period. Even so,
patients are often not told in advance that radiation is also
needed in about 25 percent of men who had their prostates removed
surgically because microscopic studies of the prostate found
evidence of spread. In another 25 percent, a rise in PSA level in
the five years after prostate removal leads to further therapy,
usually with drugs to lower levels of male hormones to make the
cancer shrink or grow more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, patients said that doctors often provided only
general answers. And in a survey conducted in March by Roper Starch
Worldwide and paid for by two drug companies, Amgen and Praecis,
reported at a meeting of the American Urological Association last
week, found that many urologists were not aware that their patients
were experiencing diarrhea or constipation, hot flashes and other
symptoms from cancer treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Also, doctors tend to overestimate what patients can do in the
recovery period. Urologists not connected with Giuliani's case have
said that if he chooses surgery, he could resume campaigning and
flying three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   But ``flying isn't the problem; walking through airports is,''
said David Kudzma, a physician in Miami who had surgery and
radiation for prostate cancer. ``On the plane, you have to sit on
the aisle, not too far from the lavatory.''

   North and South Meet
</P>
<P>
   North is north, and south is south, and never the twain shall
meet. That (with apologies to Rudyard Kipling) has been the general
thinking about species isolation in Arctic and Antarctic waters. A
cold-water-loving species in the north is separated from the same
species in the south by thousands of miles of warmer ocean, and
thus might be expected to evolve differently.
</P>
<P>
   But a new study by scientists in Britain has shown that for
several plankton species, at least, that is not the case. Studying
three types of foraminifera, single-celled organisms that make up
much of the world's plankton, the scientists have discovered that
northern and southern specimens of the same species display some
identical genetic variation.
</P>
<P>
   This, the researchers write in Nature, is evidence that the
creatures somehow stay in touch enough to allow for genetic mixing.
</P>
<P>
   Different species of forams, as the organisms are known, show a
distinct preference for warm- or cold-water zones. These zones were
essentially established 8 million to 16 million years ago, so the
cold-water species in north and south should have had plenty of
time to develop genetic differences. But the researchers, studying
ribosomal DNA, found the same DNA sequences in both Arctic and
Antarctic populations of the same species.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how this mixing might occur is unclear. But the
researchers suggest that because the forams would be unlikely to
survive transit across warmer surface waters, the organisms might
be being submerged to deeper, cooler levels for their travels
through the tropics.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino's Effects
</P>
<P>
   Even a warm-water organism can run into trouble sometimes, if
the water gets too hot. That's apparently what happened off Belize
during the El Nino winter of 1997-98. The dominant coral species in
the central lagoon of Belize was almost completely destroyed as
water temperatures reached 90 degrees, the highest sea surface
temperature ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   When corals are stressed by high temperatures or other
environmental conditions, they expel the symbiotic algae that are
the source of most of their food. If the algae do not return, the
corals can die. The phenomenon is known as coral bleaching because
the loss of the photosynthesizing algae makes the corals appear
white.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the Dauphin Island Sea Lab in Alabama studied the
destruction in Belize caused by the heat, which has been attributed
both to El Nino and global warming. Until now, the researchers
wrote in Nature, coral reefs in the Caribbean that had been
bleached eventually recovered. The Belize case, they say, is the
first in which coral mortality has passed the point of no return.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also took core samples from the reef and
determined that nothing like the bleaching had occurred in Belize's
lagoonal reefs in at least 3,000 years. Their results, they say,
show that concerns about the impact of climate change on reef
ecosystems is justified.

<P>
   Tricky Survival Technique
</P>
<P>
   Birds do it, bees do it. The larvae of blister beetles don't do
it, but, being parasites, they are glad that others do
(particularly the bees).
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at San Francisco State University have discovered a
remarkable way in which blister beetle larvae get into the nests of
bees, allowing them to survive in harsh desert conditions like
those in the Mojave in California. The larvae, known as
triungulins, clump together into a mass that makes a male bee
swoon.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the researchers report in Nature, a male bee
mistakes a clump of triungulins for a female bee (using both visual
and olfactory cues), and tries to mate with it. The triungulins
respond by latching onto the male. Then, when the male eventually
finds and mates with a real female, the triungulins are transferred
to the female, who carries them to the nest. There they grow fat
and happy, living on pollen provided by the bees.

   CAUSE AND EFFECT: When Anger Sets Off Heart Attacks
</P>
<P>
   An outburst of anger sometimes prompts the plaintive response,
``Don't have a heart attack!'' There may be something to that
advice, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   A study that looked at almost 13,000 people over six years found
that those who were most prone to anger were about 2.5 times as
likely to have heart attacks or sudden cardiac deaths as their
calmer counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who experience frequent and intense anger may benefit
by learning to identify triggers of their anger,'' said the lead
author of the study, Dr. Janice Williams, who was an epidemiologist
at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when the
research was done.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers followed the medical histories of people who
appeared free of heart disease in four communities: Washington
County, Md., suburban Minneapolis, Forsyth County, N.C., and
Jackson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects, chosen randomly, were given a 10-item
questionnaire known as the Speilberger Trait Anger Scale, which
assigns a score of 1 to 40, depending on the level of anger a
person reports. The average was 16, and about 8 percent were rated
as having high levels of anger (most were younger, less educated
men who were more likely to drink and smoke).
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the study, 256 people in the group had heart
attacks. Those who were the most prone to anger were 2.69 times as
likely to have them as those with the lowest scores. Those with
moderate scores were 35 percent more likely to have heart attacks
than those with the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the increased risk did not hold true for people
with high blood pressure, who were already at higher risk. The
researchers are not sure why this is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perplexing,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   NUTRITION: Americans Still Pass Up the Vegetables
</P>
<P>
   Vegetables and fruit still have not caught on with the public,
despite the health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than one-fourth of Americans eat the five daily servings
of fruit and vegetables recommended by federal health officials and
the National Cancer Institute, a survey has found.
</P>
<P>
   The report, published in a recent issue of The American Journal
of Public Health, found that some progress had been made in the
period studied, 1990 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the first year, only 19 percent of Americans reported eating
five servings a day; in the last, 22.7 percent did.
</P>
<P>
   But most of that improvement, the researchers said, took place
place before 1994, and a leveling off has since occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted in 16 states, involved telephone calls to
up to 32,000 people a year. They were asked six questions,
including how often they drank juice or ate fruit. They were also
asked how often they ate potatoes (French fries and potato chips
did not count).
</P>
<P>
   Those interviewed were also asked about exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The highest proportion of people who met the dietary
recommendations were men and women 65 and older, whites, college
graduates and people who exercised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although progress from 1990 to 1994 was encouraging,'' the
report said, the survey suggested that further efforts were needed,
especially among inactive and obese people.
</P>
<P>
   REACTIONS: A Good Word for the Maligned Oxidant
</P>
<P>
   The much-reviled oxidant, also known as the free radical, has a
new defender.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical, which occurs naturally in the body, has long been
linked to cancer and other illnesses. And antioxidants, including
those found in high concentrations in fruits like the pomegranate,
have been assumed to be of potential value.
</P>
<P>
   But a study by researchers at Ohio State University finds that
when it comes to heart disease, at least, the oxidant has had a bum
rap. Dr. Pascal Goldschmidt, director of the university's heart and
lung institute, says oxidants actually appear to play a vital
repair role in repairing blood-vessel damage that can lead to heart
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   When wounds occur in the walls of blood vessels _ as happens,
for example, when cholesterol builds up _ endothelial cells nearby
produce more oxidants than their counterparts do elsewhere in the
body, Dr. Leni Moldovan and Goldschmidt reported in a recent issue
of the journal Circulation Research.
</P>
<P>
   Although the free radicals do kill healthy cells, the
researchers said, they appear to be necessary if new endothelial
cells are to come in and fill the hole caused by the wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can look at oxidants as not just being the bad guys, but
sometimes playing a positive role,'' Goldschmidt said. A goal,
researchers said, should be to develop drugs that stop the damage
the oxidants cause, but let them do their repairs.
</P>
<P>
   STANDARDS: On Pressure Scale, Heeding the Top Line
</P>
<P>
   For years, it has seemed almost axiomatic: to know if someone
has high blood pressure, just look at the figure for their
diastolic pressure (the ``80,'' for example, in 120/80.) The upper,
or systolic, figure, was practically ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, federal health officials said last week, is that
this belief, common among many doctors, is wrong _ dangerously so,
in many cases. Systolic blood pressure, health officials said, is a
reliable general sign of hypertension and as people get to middle
age and beyond, it is the best reliable indicator.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health have issued a formal clinical
advisory to doctors suggesting that they focus on systolic pressure
in older adults. And it plans to conduct a broad public education
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the health institutes issued guidelines recommending
that both systolic and diastolic blood pressure be used to diagnose
hypertension in patients of all ages. But since then, federal
officials said, studies have shown that the key figure for patients
who are middle-aged or older is the systolic figure.
</P>
<P>
   Significant evidence of the value of systolic pressure, for
example, came from recent results in the Framingham Heart Study,
which has followed the health of thousands of people in the Boston
area for 50 years. Still, Dr. Daniel Levy, director of the
Framingham study, said in an interview that there had been no one
finding that changed medical thinking about how to diagnose high
blood pressure, but rather a growing body of evidence that in the
end seemed incontrovertible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Systolic hypertension is a major health threat, especially for
older Americans,'' Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said in announcing the clinical
advisory.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines recommend that blood pressure for people of
all ages be kept below 140/90 (130/85 for hypertensives with
diabetes, and as low as possible for people with heart of kidney
failure).
</P>
<P>
   AT RISK: Painful Colon Disease Is Linked to Stress
</P>
<P>
   Ulcerative colitis, a serious disease in which the lining of the
colon and rectum become inflamed causing severe pain, appears to be
worsened by long-term stress, a new study has found.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long theorized that stress can play a role in the
disease, but have never been able to prove it, said the
researchers, writing in the May issue of The American Journal of
Gastroenterology.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, they said, was that past research looked at
short-term stress, with the expectation that a flare-up would be
seen within a month of two. Instead, the researchers concluded,
after examining 62 patients in Italy for six years, it is
longer-term stress, measuring as long as two years, that seems to
play a role.
</P>
<P>
   They emphasized, though, that stress was only one factor and
that no one really could explain the course of the chronic disease,
which goes in and out of remission.

   Yellow Tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Q. I see yellow tomatoes, among other exotic types, at vegetable
stores. Do they differ in nutritional value from red tomatoes?
</P>
<P>
   A. Like all vegetables, tomatoes differ somewhat in nutritional
value from variety to variety, and even from season to season; for
example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture lists different average
nutrient contents for tomatoes harvested from November to May and
for those from June to October.
</P>
<P>
   Many food values are comparable for red and yellow tomatoes, or
are a tradeoff. For example, the amino acids are found in similar
smidgens. The precursor of vitamin A called beta carotene is found
in valuable amounts in red and yellow tomatoes and in many other
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Both colors have vitamin C, though a red tomato has about three
times as much. Minerals are similar, though a yellow tomato is
higher in sodium. Yellow tomatoes have more niacin and folate, red
tomatoes have more vitamin B6 and pantothenic acid, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one significant nutrient, reported in some studies
to be a powerful antioxidant that may help prevent cancer, that is
found in red tomatoes but not in others: lycopene. Lycopene, which
is also converted in the body to vitamin A, is the very thing that
makes red tomatoes red. The redder the tomato, the more lycopene,
and no lycopene at all is to be found in green or yellow tomatoes.

THE DEMISE OF REFLECTIVE DOCTORING 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By DAVID A. SHAYWITZ, M.D. and DENNIS A. AUSIELLO, M.D.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals, the hospitals responsible for the education
of tomorrow's physicians, are now engaged in a struggle for
survival. Their unprecedented fiscal strain stems both from the
reluctance of HMOs and insurance companies to contribute
financially to clinical training and from recent reductions in
federal support.
</P>
<P>
   These new pressures have created a frenetic environment that
challenges patients and makes it difficult to turn out innovative
doctors who will question accepted doctrine, seek new knowledge and
establish higher standards of care for the next generation of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the responsibility to train doctors seemed a
natural extension of a teaching hospital's basic commitment to
providing patients with quality care. For patients, the obligation
to be examined by a succession of physicians _ an experience
neither efficient nor universally appreciated _ generally was
offset by the reassurance from such a thorough evaluation, and the
promise of collective wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   For doctors in training, the process brought close connections
with patients and a more sophisticated understanding of the
underlying diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of such reflective doctors on medical progress would
be difficult to overstate. The discovery that stomach ulcers can be
caused by bacterial infection, the use of steroids to treat
rheumatoid arthritis, the identification of Lyme disease, all are
important medical advances that resulted from doctors' efforts to
understand the problems of their own patients.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five years, the focus of clinical training has
changed drastically, as efficiency has become increasingly
important. In some ways, this new emphasis has served patients
well. Doctors are more rigorously guided by scientific evidence and
flow-charts articulating the best ways to manage common diseases.
</P>
<P>
   This growing awareness of a standard of care means that
physicians are more likely to apply successful strategies quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But our daily experience suggests that in the current
preoccupation with speed, something vital to medical education has
been lost. The damage to the new generation of doctors can be seen
perhaps most visibly in the much-publicized atrophy of their
essential skills: the ability to perform a basic physical exam, for
example, as several recent studies have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Young doctors also find they have little time with patients. The
deeply personal relationships they had long anticipated seem to
have devolved into brief, emotionally detached encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what may turn out to be the most significant casualty of
the modern training experience is also the least obvious: the
gradual disappearance of time to think, in an expansive fashion,
about an individual patient. Traditionally, such reflective
thinking has been a hallmark of teaching hospitals. It was why
doctors came to train and why patients came for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs and insurance companies tend to focus on the bottom line
and have placed intense financial pressure on teaching hospitals
and their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, even the most insightful and compassionate
academic doctors feel increasingly compelled to evaluate and treat
patients with reflexive speed.
</P>
<P>
   This matters because medicine is more than simply the
compassionate (and now, efficient) application of received wisdom;
it is also the challenging of old customs, and the development of
new insights. It is critical to recognize that an academic
clinician is both a provider, whose goal is to assimilate and then
thoughtfully apply a given set of information, and a medical
scientist who questions traditional dogma.
</P>
<P>
   This creativity crunch has appeared just as medicine sits poised
to benefit from major advances in molecular biology and computer
technology. Desperately required now are more ``clinical
champions,'' passionate physicians who have the expertise,
imagination and perseverance necessary to ensure that this
scientific progress finds expression in the care and treatment of
patients.
</P>
<P>
   We must encourage doctors in training to ask fresh, penetrating
questions, to wonder about underlying biological mechanisms, to
consider alternative therapeutic approaches.

   RAILROAD-KILLER (Houston) _ Attorneys for railroad-riding

<P>
   Forty years ago Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration
approved a medication that set off a medical and social revolution.
The medication was an oral contraceptive called Enovid, introduced
in 1960 by Searle to a nation of women increasingly eager for
greater certainty in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Though few
realized it then, ``the Pill,'' as it came to be called, has turned
out to have a number of ancillary health benefits as well as some
serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The pill was developed by Dr. Gregory Pincus and Dr. John Rock.
Rock, then a devout Roman Catholic, had hoped in vain that his
church would accept it as a ``natural'' means of birth control,
although many Catholic women adopted it despite papal
proscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The pill arrived at a time when abortion was illegal everywhere
in the United States and when growing numbers of young women were
striving to liberate themselves from the social trappings of
premarital chastity and vocational suppression.
</P>
<P>
   It took just five years for the pill to become the leading
reversible contraceptive method in the United States. Since its
introduction, an estimated 468 million American women have taken
the pill. Today more than 16 million American women are on the
pill, making it the most popular contraceptive technique outside of
sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   By blocking ovulation, the synthetic hormones in the birth
control pill, when taken properly, proved to be better than 99
percent effective in preventing pregnancy. Only surgical
sterilization could match that, and sterilization is not an option
for women who may want to have children one day.
</P>
<P>
   Diaphragms and condoms, which had to be used at the time of
intercourse, took their toll on spontaneity and romance and did not
offer enough contraceptive security for women seeking to complete
their educations and establish careers before starting families.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the pill gave women a highly effective
reversible method of contraception that was completely divorced
from the sex act.
</P>
<P>
   But also for the first time, millions of young, healthy women
were taking a potent drug every day, raising legitimate concerns
about drug-induced health risks of potentially epidemic
proportions. All drugs, including those sold over the counter, have
side effects. And, as predicted, serious, even fatal, complications
did occur among users of oral contraceptives, especially among
women who smoked or were over 35 and those who used the early
high-dose pills.
</P>
<P>
   These problems prompted a host of warnings and stimulated
research that resulted in safer products containing far smaller
hormone doses, less than one-hundredth the amount of estrogen in
the original pill.
</P>
<P>
   All the oral contraceptives work by suppressing the pituitary
hormones that prompt the ovaries to release eggs ripe for
fertilization. Most products contain synthetic versions of both
estrogen and progesterone. The so-called minipills contain just
synthetic progesterone (progestin). Although the minipill is
slightly less effective than the combination pills, it can be used
by women, like those who are breast-feeding, who cannot take
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   In both versions, the hormones are taken daily for 21 days,
usually starting from the first day of a woman's menstrual cycle,
then stopped to allow the built-up tissue lining the uterus to be
shed as menstruation.
</P>
<P>
   Women can now choose from among 59 different products, all
variations on the original theme. The types of synthetic estrogen
and progestin, the dosages and the design of dispensing packets
vary, and some products include seven dummy pills in addition to
the 21 active ones to help women remember to take a pill each day.
In 1984 Ortho Pharmaceuticals was the first to introduce a
triphasic version of the pill, which provides three different
hormone levels in the course of the month, more closely mimicking a
woman's natural hormone cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The pill in its current formulations is a remarkably safe drug,
and the overwhelming majority of women who take it experience
neither minor side effects like breakthrough bleeding or serious
health damage. Still, the pill today is sold with an insert
mandated by the FDA and filled with more facts, figures and
warnings than most women would want to know but should know if they
wish to avoid becoming a statistic.
</P>
<P>
   Blood clots, which can result in heart attacks, strokes,
thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism or vision-impairing eye
damage, are the most common serious side effect and are most likely
to occur in women who smoke and in older women. A smoker in her
middle to late 20s is seven times as likely to die as a nonsmoker
from pill-related clots, and the older the woman, the more smoking
increases her risk if she also takes the pill. Women who have
already had a clot-related disorder are advised not to take the
pill.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, women over 40 were told to avoid the pill
because of clot-associated risks. Then, in 1989 an advisory
committee of the FDA noted that if a woman over 40 was healthy and
did not smoke, the pill's benefits probably outweighed possible
risks, assuming she used the lowest-dose pill that was effective.
</P>
<P>
   But women who have had cancers of the breast, lining of the
uterus (endometrium), cervix or vagina are advised not to take the
pill, since it is possible that the hormones it contains could
stimulate the growth of such cancers.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s and mid-'70s, two cancer scares temporarily
curbed enthusiasm for the pill, but neither scare turned out to
have relevance to women using pills then on the market. While there
is at present no clear evidence that the pill increases a woman's
risk of developing breast cancer, women taking the pill who have
strong family histories of breast cancer or those who have had
breast nodules or abnormal mammograms should be monitored closely
by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Every user of the pill should be told that it does not protect
against any sexually transmitted disease, including infection by
HIV. When there is a risk of such an illness, a condom should also
be used in every sexual encounter.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to avoiding the risks associated with an ill-timed
or unwanted pregnancy, the pill has proved to have a number of
other benefits. For women whose menstrual cycles are irregular, the
pill provides predictability. For those who bleed heavily, it
reduces menstrual flow and consequently the risk of becoming
anemic. Menstrual cramps and other menstrual symptoms tend to be
lessened by the pill and, by minimizing menstrual flow, the pill
also diminishes the risk of developing endometriosis and can
sometimes reverse this disorder as well.
</P>
<P>
   The hormones in the pill cause a thickening of the cervical
mucus, providing something of a barrier to infectious organisms. As
a result, women on the pill have a reduced risk of developing
pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the tubes and cause
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   The pill also provides some protection against cancers of the
endometrium and ovaries. Taking the pill for as little as a year or
two significantly diminishes a woman's risk of developing ovarian
cancer. Noncancerous breast cysts are less frequent among pill
takers. And one product, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, has received FDA
approval to treat moderate cystic acne in women 15 or older who
desire contraception and who have not been helped by topical acne
remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pill blocks the monthly release of eggs, it does
not delay menopause. As Dr. Sharon Winer, an
obstetrician-gynecologist and reproductive endocrinologist at the
University of Southern California explained, ``A woman's eggs get
old and die off even if they are not released, so menopause occurs
on schedule.'' But the pill is increasingly being recommended for
women approaching menopause whose own estrogen levels are dropping
but who still face a risk of becoming pregnant.

   Spear agreed with some of the criticism, saying that people who
took short cuts or ``dumb risks'' under the guise of ``faster,
better, cheaper'' were not properly following the concept. ``There
has to be some flexibility and the ability to adjust goals if
things don't go as planned,'' he said, ``If you are working under a
fixed cost and schedule, for instance, you have to be able to
change the scope of the mission, perhaps leaving an experiment or
something off to compensate.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the meeting said that even without formal
policies to cut costs, there was pressure worldwide to find ways
drive down the price of space exploration. The European Space
Agency (ESA), a consortium of 15 countries, is planning to dispatch
a mission called Mars Express that would orbit the planet's poles
in 2003 and send down a small lander to examine soil composition.
</P>
<P>
   While ESA has never adopted the `faster, better, cheaper''
mantra, there has considerable pressure to cut mission costs in
recent years, said Gordon P. Whitcomb of the European consortium.
In a new approach, the Mars mission will use technology developed
for previous projects and turn over much of the project management
to contractors working under the supervision of a reduced ESA
project team.

ATTENTION FOREIGN FAUNA, FLORA: KEEP OUT OF NEW ZEALAND! 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ALLAN COUKELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Two police officers, three government
officials and a museum curator assembled outside a modest house on
a quiet suburban street here a few months ago. The occupants were
away, but the party, armed with a search warrant, entered through
an open side window, using pepper spray to subdue a barking guard
dog.
</P>
<P>
   The officials were responding to a tip about contraband on the
premises, and they quickly found what they were looking for: a pet
spider named Bob.
</P>
<P>
   The spider, a Chilean rose tarantula, is just one organism on a
long list of animals, plants and microbes that are unwanted in New
Zealand, a country serious about its biosecurity.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's geographical isolation has allowed farms, orchards
and tree plantations to remain relatively free of pests and disease
that could push up production costs and reduce market access for
export produce. But the isolation has also left its native
ecosystems susceptible to foreign invasion.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's birds were ill-prepared to cope with the influx of
cats, dogs, rats and stoats that accompanied human arrival. Many
species are now threatened. Many of the animals and plants brought
into the country have proliferated wildly in the absence of their
natural predators. The Australian brushtail possum, for example,
was introduced to New Zealand a century ago. Despite control
efforts, possums now number about 70 million. And they are
consuming native forests at an estimated rate of more than 20,000
tons of foliage every night.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated island ecosystems in other places face similar
problems. On Guam, the introduction of the brown tree snake in the
1940s led to the elimination of nine species of birds and a native
bat, and other species are considered threatened. Officials in
Hawaii have established cargo inspection programs to keep the snake
out of the state.
</P>
<P>
   For now, New Zealand remains snake-free. But three times this
year, snakes from Australia and Indonesia were captured in or near
newly arrived shipping containers, raising fears of further
reptilian incursions.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's precautions against foreign invaders ``are
probably the most comprehensive and dynamic in the world,'' said
Dr. Barry O'Neil, director of New Zealand's Biosecurity Authority.
``But can we ensure that another snake won't get to New Zealand?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   As in Hawaii, New Zealand's biosecurity begins overseas. All
shipments with the potential to carry pests must be inspected and
certified offshore. Upon arrival, goods are subjected to more
scrutiny. International travelers also are inspected.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, New Zealand intercepts about 4,500 organisms and
seizes 86,000 ``risk goods,'' like apples, meat and honey, that
could carry diseases. Upon arrival, every one of more than 60,000
imported used cars is checked, inside and out, for insect
hitchhikers. And under New Zealand law, any person who knowingly
smuggles plant or animal material could face a penalty of up to
five years in prison and a fine of about $48,500.
</P>
<P>
   But globalization is making the border increasingly difficult to
police. Increased trade means more cargo to inspect. (Even now,
only about a quarter of incoming shipping containers are
inspected.)
</P>
<P>
   Tourism and international travel may pose even greater threats.
Modern air travel whisks passengers around the world so quickly
that fruit flies and other insect pests tend to arrive alive. To
reduce the biosecurity risk, travelers are met by dogs trained to
detect meat or plants, and X-rays of baggage are frequently taken
in search of biological material. But tourism is an important
industry in New Zealand, and international travelers, despite the
value they may place on New Zealand's unique flora and fauna, are
unlikely to tolerate lengthy delays for inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many potential invaders are microscopic and almost
impossible to detect. Among the most feared organisms is the virus
that causes foot-and-mouth disease in livestock. Plant viruses and
fungi also pose significant and unknown risks.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds more pests, as yet unidentified, may have already
arrived. There are about 22,000 species of plants growing in
gardens around the country (outnumbering wild species by a factor
of five). Dr. David Penman, author of a report called ``Managing a
Leaky Border,'' said as many as 200 of those might become weeds
over the next 40 or 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty for New Zealand is balancing the cost of its
biosecurity program against the economic and conservation benefits
it provides. An effective quarantine system is possible, but zero
risk is not, said Dr. Ruth Frampton, director of Forest Biosecurity
at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to decide what is appropriate,'' Frampton said. ``But
in my personal view, a biosecurity defense system may be more
important than traditional defenses such as an army or air force.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry announced
that a parasitic honey bee mite, Varroa jacobsoni, had been
discovered on one property. Quarantine zones were quickly
established, as officials scrambled to determine the extent of the
invasion. But the discovery had come too late; the mite was already
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Until this discovery, New Zealand was one of only two countries
considered free of the mite, which may damage the country's bee
export industry, wipe out the wild honey bee population and reduce
the pollination of crops. Eradication _ the last line of line of
defense for biosecurity _ is under consideration, but any operation
will be costly, and success is far from guaranteed.

   Thirty years ago, obstetricians listened for the reassuring
sound of a fetal heartbeat and felt a woman's abdomen to monitor
fetal growth and position. It was, in essence, educated guesswork,
trying to visualize the unborn baby without ever really seeing it.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, obstetricians started to see it all. New
kinds of ultrasound machines revolutionized prenatal monitoring.
For the first time, physicians, mothers, and fathers could look at
the fetus' beating heart and squiggling hands and feet. Expectant
parents left the doctor's office with goodie bags, envelopes filled
with early baby photos.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, ultrasound has grown up. Rather than simply
glancing at the fetus, doctors today take a series of measurements:
the length of the fetus; the length of the thigh bone; and the
circumferences of the head and abdomen. They check the four
chambers of the heart and the structures of the kidney and bladder.
</P>
<P>
   And now ultrasound is on the verge of yet another revolution.
The latest gadgets, though far from standard use, create
three-dimensional images of the fetus and may be used to peer deep
within the fetal brain, identifying fine points of the developing
anatomy never seen before. Another type of ultrasound, Doppler, is
being used to monitor blood flow of fetal organs, helping doctors
check not just structure, but function of organs.
</P>
<P>
   And yet another new ultrasound technique, one that measures the
fluid in a fetus' neck, is now being studied. Many experts think
it, when combined with analyses of blood tests and maternal age,
might eventually reduce number of screenings by amniocentesis and
chorionic villus sampling, two definitive yet slightly risky
procedures, in detecting birth defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any new technology there are growing pains, but once we
overcome them we will see that the uses of ultrasound will grow
exponentially,'' said Dr. John Hobbins, director of obstetrics at
the University of Colorado Health Science Center in Denver. ``Soon
we will be using ultrasound to assess normality, not just identify
abnormalities. These new technologies are allowing us to see the
whole deal _ what the baby looks like, how it is behaving, and how
the organs are functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   But as ultrasound has grown up and come to rival amniocentesis,
it is raising new questions about how much information expectant
parents really want, and whether all those using ultrasound really
know what the new images mean.
</P>
<P>
   One of the latest findings is a bright spot on the heart that
has been tied to an increased risk of Down syndrome, Hobbins said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that ``if you use a high-frequency transducer,
with a little imagination you can find a bright spot in every fetal
heart,'' Hobbins said. ``So what do you tell a patient? I tell
patients that I've seen a bright spot and we are not sure what it
means, though some studies have shown an association to Down
syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   An article in January in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine
highlights the angst that the new technology can bring: ``From my
vantage point, the identification of these `abnormalities' in
low-risk women has crossed the line of `more harm than good,'''
wrote Dr. Roy Filly, professor of radiology at the University of
California at San Francisco School of Medicine. ``We put at least
10 percent of all pregnant women with perfectly normal fetuses
through a great deal of worry,'' he concluded in his essay,
``Obstetrical Sonography: The Best Way to Terrify a Pregnant
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first trimester, the ultrasound scan is now typically
used to determine fetal age by measuring crown-rump (head to
bottom) length and head circumference. In the second trimester,
doctors measure abdominal circumference, and check the chambers of
the heart, the kidneys and bladder to spot defects and monitor
growth.
</P>
<P>
   Another standard measurement is femur, or thigh bone, length.
Between 17 and 19 weeks of gestation, an abnormally short femur may
suggest Down syndrome, said Dr. Lawrence Platt, chairman of
obstetrics and gynecology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But ultrasound is already moving beyond such measurements. One,
now being tested in two trials in the United States, is performed
between the 10th and 13th weeks of pregnancy and, when combined
with blood tests and assessment of the mother's age, is aimed at
determining a woman's odds of having a baby with Down syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique measures a fluid-filled area behind the neck,
known as nuchal translucency. Fetuses with birth defects often have
extra fluid in this area between the 10th and 14th weeks of
gestation, said Dr. Kypros Nicolaides, a professor of fetal
medicine at Kings College Hospital in London, who developed the new
method.
</P>
<P>
   The blood test measures two hormones: beta-HCG (the same
substance measured in pregnancy tests) and PAPP-A, or
pregnancy-associated placental protein. For still unknown reasons,
abnormally high levels of HCG and low levels of PAPP-A in the first
trimester have been linked to Down syndrome. Already a British
study of 120,000 women found the method was 85 percent accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Such tests are still quite different from diagnostic tests like
amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (CVS) _ in which a
sample of fetal cells is examined with a microscope and offer
definitive answers. But roughly one woman in every 200 to 300
miscarries after amniocentesis. The risk is slightly higher for
CVS.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Leyden, a 38-year-old mother of two from Philadelphia, for
one, was determined to avoid amniocentesis in her second pregnancy.
In her first pregnancy, a blood test falsely suggested a birth
defect so her doctors recommended amniocentesis, which found the
fetus to be normal. This time she elected to participate in one of
the trials evaluating the new first-trimester ultrasound test. She
knew the test would not yield conclusive information but hedged her
bets that the results would be more accurate than the blood test
she had had before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The procedure was painless,'' Leyden said, referring to the
ultrasound. ``It was wonderful to see the baby at 14 weeks. I knew
there were no definitive answers, but every indication showed the
baby was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyden said her own mother feels fortunate she gave birth in the
days before the information explosion because, she told her
daughter, ``it's driving you girls crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if studies prove the first-trimester ultrasound test is
effective, many women may still decide to go right to amniocentesis
or CVS. ``It's an individual and personal decision that patients
will have to decide for themselves,'' said Dr. Michael Mennuti,
chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of
Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia. ``For some women the
anxiety of possibly getting a `high risk' result and then having
amniocentesis is not worth it. They would rather go directly for
the invasive, definitive test. For other women the reassuring
information of a screening test is good enough and they are happy
to avoid the definitive test because of the low risk of
miscarriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Socza, a 36-year-old television producer in Los Angeles,
was one who jumped at the chance to participate in the screening
trial. ``The last thing I wanted was amniocentesis. I didn't want
to be one of the statistics when the test didn't work out, plus a
needle going through your abdomen seemed so intrusive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say the screening test, if it is proved effective,
may pinpoint young women at risk who would never have considered
amniocentesis. About 80 percent of Down syndrome babies are born to
women younger than 35. That is because even though the individual
risk is lower, the vast majority of babies, healthy and unhealthy,
are born to younger women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some women who are intimidated by the
choices and find it confusing,'' said Dr. Ronald Wapner, the
director of maternal fetal medicine and of reproductive genetics at
Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, and a researcher in
one of the trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot of women are very happy to have choices and take
control over their pregnancy,'' he said. ``They are difficult
decisions. But the most important thing to remember is that no
matter how a woman decides, most likely everything will be fine.
The odds are in her favor.''

ESSAY: LOOKING BACK AT PURE WORLD OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ALAN LIGHTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I turned 35, I wrote an essay for The New York Times
Magazine about my distressing awareness that I would soon be an old
man in my field.
</P>
<P>
   That field was theoretical physics, where people do their best
work at a famously young age. Now, 16 years later, having long
since given up physics for a profession in which I am still young,
I find myself looking back on my life as a scientist and what I so
miss.
</P>
<P>
   I miss the purity. Theoretical physicists, and many other kinds
of scientists, work in a world of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mathematical world without bodies, without people,
without the vagaries of human emotion.
</P>
<P>
   A physicist can imagine a weight hung from a spring, bouncing up
and down, and fix this mental image with an equation. If friction
with air becomes an unwanted nuisance, just imagine the weight in a
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Much of science, in fact, is built on these pure pictures of the
mind. And the equations themselves are beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The equations have a precision and elegance, a magnificent
serenity, an indisputable rightness.
</P>
<P>
   I remember so often finding a sweet comfort in my equations
after arguing with my wife about this or that domestic concern or
fretting over some difficult decision in my life or feeling
confused by a person I'd met. I miss that purity, that calm.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, other occupations also deal with ideas. But the ideas
are often complicated with the ambiguity of human nature. The
exquisite contradictions and uncertainties of the human heart do
indeed make life interesting; they are why God held the apple in
front of Eve and then forbade her to eat it, they inspire artists
and art, they are why the poet Rainer Maria Rilke wrote that ``We
should try to love the questions themselves, like locked rooms and
like books that are written in a very foreign tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   All that is necessary and good. But I miss the answers. I miss
the rooms I could enter, the language that sounded clear as a
struck bell.
</P>
<P>
   I miss the exhilaration of seeing brilliant people at work,
watching their minds leap right in front of me, not the brooding
intelligence of writers, but an immediate mental agility, pole
vaults and somersaults and triple axels on the ice. Richard Feynman
once walked into my tiny office at Caltech and, in 20 minutes at
the blackboard, outlined the basic equations for the quantum
evaporation of spinning black holes, an ingenious idea that had
just occurred to him on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   When I was stymied by a tough astrophysics problem at Cornell,
the great theoretician Edwin Salpeter, while lying on the floor of
his living room with back pain, instantly drew an analogy between
the slow drift of stars orbiting a disruptive mass and the random
motion of marbles bumping around on a table with a hole in its
center.
</P>
<P>
   Others I watched from the front row: the British astrophysicist
and astronomer royal, Martin Rees, the Nobel Prize winning particle
physicist, Steven Weinberg. In the presence of these minds I felt
humbled as well as excited. I miss the humility; it made me crouch
down and observe. I listened more than I talked. I took in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, I miss the intensity. I miss being grabbed by a
science problem so that I could think of nothing else, consumed by
it during the day and then through the night, hunched over the
kitchen table with my pencil and pad of white paper while the dark
world slept, tireless, electrified, working on until daylight and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Every creative field has its moment of inspiration, the struggle
to that moment and then the surge of insight.
</P>
<P>
   In most occupations, the aftermath is a slow working out of the
idea. As a writer, even when I am writing well, I cannot write more
than six hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   After that I am exhausted and my vision has become clouded by
the inherent subtleties and uncertainties of the work.
</P>
<P>
   Then I must wait for the words to shift and settle on the page
and my own strength to return.
</P>
<P>
   But as a scientist, I could be gripped for days at a time. I
could go for days without stopping. Because I wanted to know the
answer. I wanted to know the telltale behavior of matter spiraling
into a black hole, or the maximum temperature of a gas of electrons
and positrons, or what was left after a cluster of stars had slowly
lost mass and drawn in on itself and collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   When in the throes of a new problem, I was driven night and day,
compelled because I knew there was a definite answer, I knew that
the equations inexorably led to an answer, an answer that had never
been known before, an answer waiting for me.
</P>
<P>
   That certainty and power, and the intensity of effort it causes,
I dearly miss. It cannot be found in most other professions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, I wonder if what I really miss is my youth. Purity,
exhilaration, intensity _ these are aspects of the young.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it is not possible at age 50 for me to look back on
myself in my 20s and early 30s and understand anything more than
the delicious feeling of immortality, the clarity of youth, the
feeling that everything was possible.
</P>
<P>
   I do miss my youth. And now, as a writer still finding my
stride, while I can reasonably expect another couple of decades to
thrive, I know that this second profession too will come to an end,
that I will inevitably dwindle down to the physical as well as
mental and artistic end, the final end. Of course, I want to be
young again.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, if given a chance to start over, I would do just what I
did, to be not only a young man in the shimmering of youth but a
scientist. I would want again to be driven day and night by my
research. I would want the beauty and power of the equations. I
would want to hear that call of certain truth.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within the constellation Andromeda is a dull, fuzzy patch of
light.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Great Andromeda galaxy, spiral in shape and similar
to Earth's own Milky Way galaxy, at 14 billion billion miles, the
farthest object one can see with the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   It is getting closer.
</P>
<P>
   Like the headlight of a distant, oncoming car, this little patch
of light will slowly brighten and sharpen over the eons. Andromeda
and the Milky Way are speeding toward each other at more than
250,000 mph. In 3 billion years, the two galaxies may slam together
head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have known for decades that Andromeda is headed this
way, though they still cannot say whether the two are destined to
collide or merely to speed past, narrowly missing each other.
</P>
<P>
   But, if their paths are to cross, computer simulations now
provide a preview of that celestial crash.
</P>
<P>
   Using the latest, biggest, fastest computer at the San Diego
Supercomputer Center, Dr. Lars E. Hernquist, a professor of
astronomy at Harvard University, and Dr. John J. Dubinski, an
assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Toronto,
calculated the motions of 107 million particles representing the
contents of the two galaxies to obtain the most detailed look yet
at their future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a collision where it's mostly head-on, but it's
slightly offset,'' Hernquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that outer space is mostly empty, individual stars would
very rarely, if ever, run into one another, the astronomers say,
and the hundreds of billions of stars in the two galaxies would
continue to burn, unaffected by the merger.
</P>
<P>
   But gravitational forces would radically shuffle around the
stars' locations.
</P>
<P>
   As the two initially graze past each other, the gravitational
forces pull off strands of stars into ``tidal tails,'' ripping
apart the galaxies' pinwheel shapes and casting tens of billions of
stars into the dark, intergalactic void.
</P>
<P>
   About two billion years later, the Andromeda and the Milky Way
merge into one larger, mangled blob.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't look like a spiral galaxy anymore,'' Hernquist
said.
</P>
<P>
   While supercomputers are needed for the details, the basic
physics of how tidal tails form is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the phenomenon is almost kinematic,'' said Dr.
Alar Toomre, professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``clumsy calculations'' he performed in the 1970s produced
tidal tails, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the gravitational pull of the Moon creates tides in
Earth's oceans, the pull of one galaxy on the other would lead to
bulges of stars on the near and the far sides of each galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Because the galaxy rotates, ``the far side gets swung and slung
into something that looks like a comma,'' Toomre said. ``This
comma, after a while, goes flying off into space,'' producing the
tail, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed simulations could help astronomers figure out
whether the football-shape elliptical galaxies they observe are the
result of spiral galaxies that have collided and combined. Some
elliptical galaxies have streams of stars orbiting around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might suggest perhaps these elliptical galaxies are a
more evolved version of what we're seeing at the end of the
simulation,'' Hernquist said.
</P>
<P>
   The simulations could also lead to better understandings of the
halos of ``dark matter'' that encircle the visible parts of the
galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone left on Earth three billion years from now, the night
sky would become almost totally black if the sun were one of the
stars cast out into the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have this dark sky with very few stars,'' Dubinski
said. ``Maybe none.''
</P>
<P>
   If the sun and Earth were pushed in the other direction, toward
the center of the merging pair, the view would brighten
considerably. When galaxies collide, hydrogen gas left over from
the formation of the galaxies is sometimes pushed toward the
center, sparking a new epoch of star-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you slam that much gas together, you can ignite these
starbursts,'' Dubinski said. With more stars, there would be more
supernovas, the explosive deaths of the largest stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these celestial fireworks that will be going off for
tens of millions of years,'' Dubinski said. ``It would be much
brighter than a full Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   A supernova too close, however, could kill off any remaining
life on Earth, though the end of the world would be nearing in any
case. By the time the two galaxies complete their merger about five
billion years from now, the sun will have burned out.

   SIERRA-LEONE (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ At least four people
were killed Monday after shooting erupted in Sierra Leone's capital
as U.N. peacekeepers struggled to maintain control in the West
African nation. Witnesses said at least four people were killed
outside the rebel leader Faday Sankoh's house after his supporters
fired into a crowd of protesters who had marched on it to demand
peace. (Summary from wires.) By Norimitsu Onishi.

   DELAY-TRADE (Washington) _ After a bill-signing ceremony in the
Oval Office last month, President Clinton sidled up to an unlikely
ally in his fight to pass a decisive trade bill with China, the
administration's top foreign policy goal. ``We talked about what
each of us has to do and we gave each other some advice,'' said
Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip and one of
Clinton's most vitriolic critics on Capitol Hill, who refused to
discuss the details of the conversation. With the crucial vote just
over two weeks away, DeLay, who led the charge to impeach Clinton,
now finds himself in the improbable role of the president's chief
water-carrier and potential legacy-builder in an all-out battle to
grant China permanent normal trading privileges. By Eric Schmitt.

Senior military officials believe that they will be pulling out

   OCONNOR (New York) _ Cardinal John O'Connor's life was
celebrated at a funeral Mass on Monday marked by pageantry, prayer,
hope and an outpouring of love for the man who served the
archdiocese's 2.4 million Catholics for 16 years. A massive funeral
procession of 800, including priests, 120 bishops and 15 cardinals,
wound its way through the great bronze doors of St. Patrick's

including President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.

   SF-FAT-BIAS (San Francisco) _ San Francisco is joining only two

against people because of their personal appearance. Passage of the
legislation in San Francisco comes after a local health club ran
this ad: ``When the aliens come, they'll take the fat people
first.'' The campaign created a huge outcry among overweight
people, many of whom pressed for the law. Other cities with similar
ordinances include Santa Cruz, which is not a surrpise, and
Washington, D.C., which has had such a law on the books since the
1970s, and has, according to officials there, invoked it often in
job discrimination cases. By Evelyn Nieves.

perhaps utter something close to the e-word? If politics is often
about appearances, the eagerly anticipated meeting here on Tuesday
between Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona is being scrutinized as closely by the political and media
elites as Egyptologists might pore over the Rosetta Stone. In their
first face-to-face encounter since Bush trounced McCain in the
primaries on Super Tuesday, March 7, the governor and senator are
getting together at Bush's invitation for private fence-mending,
public picture-taking and the expectation in the Bush camp that
McCain would eventually make some kind of formal endorsement. By

recordings, the software for reproducing and disseminating
information is evolving rapidly. As a result, a more dramatic

Netgear network card and a pewter frame, he offered a ``great big
wild abstract painting'' that he said was bought years ago at a
garage sale in Berkeley and has a small hole inflicted by a son
wielding a bicycle. He asked for bids to open at a quarter. On
Monday bids for that painting, which may be a 1952 work by Richard
Diebenkorn, were up to $135,605. If the sale, which ends Monday
night, goes through, and if the painting is genuine, it would be
not only a stunning and serendipitous investment for ``golfpoorly''
but also probably the second-highest price paid online for a work
of art. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

SCIENTISTS DECODE DOWN SYNDROME CHROMOSOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reaching another milestone in the race to decode the human
genome, a team of principally Japanese and German scientists has
essentially completed the DNA sequence of chromosome 21, a result
that sheds light on the workings of Down syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   The team is part of the international consortium of academic
centers led by the National Institutes of Health and the Wellcome
Trust of London. The consortium has now completed two chromosomes,
numbers 21 and 22, which are the two shortest of the human
complement of 23 pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Chromosome 21 is best known in the context of Down syndrome.
Affected children are born with three copies of the chromosome
instead of the usual two. Usually a third chromosome is lethal
because the extra doses of its genes derange the carefully balanced
economy of the cell.
</P>
<P>
   The decoded DNA sequence of chromosome 21, being published in
this week's Nature, explains why Down syndrome children escape the
usual death sentence, although at a cost. The chromosome has
extremely few genes _ a mere 225, according to the consortium
team's count, in its 33,827,477 decodable units of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists who study Down syndrome do not know whether there is
a general imbalance because of all the extra genes, or whether a
handful of specific genes underlies the 80 or so specific disorders
of the syndrome. The decoding of chromosome 21 at least establishes
a catalog of all the relevant genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So defining the players and the playing field is a very major
step that the Down syndrome community has been working toward for
years,'' said Dr. Roger Reeves, a geneticist at Johns Hopkins
University who studies the syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying the genes, and when and where they operate, could
lay the basis for someday devising gene therapy for the syndrome,
Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium team estimates that if chromosomes 21 and 22
between them have an average number of genes, the total number of
human genes would be a mere 40,000. Other estimates range from
70,000 to 140,000.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem extraordinary that with the human genome so close to
completion, the estimates of its number of genes are all over the
lot. But recognizing human genes in the DNA sequence is a rapidly
developing art.
</P>
<P>
   A bioinformatics company called DoubleTwist, of Oakland, Calif.,
said Monday that it had downloaded the consortium's human genome
data, which at present cover 80 percent of the genome, and that
with its own software it had identified about 105,000 probable
human genes.
</P>
<P>
   If the higher estimates of human genes are correct, the
consortium teams that analyzed chromosomes 21 and 22 may seem to
have been too conservative in its gene count.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese-German team decoded all of chromosome 21 except for
the centromere region, which cannot be tackled by present methods,
and 10 small gaps of particularly resistant sequence, which are
being left for analysis later.
</P>
<P>
   In decoding chromosome 21, the consortium now leads 2-0 in the
genome race against its rival, the Celera Corp. of Rockville, Md.
But the score is misleading because Celera's strategy is to decode
all the chromosomes in tandem, and company officials say they are
only weeks away from the goal.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist's ability to survey the genome is evidence of the
impressive amounts of human DNA data the consortium has been
putting into the public database. The directors of the five leading
sequencing centers said Monday that they had decoded 16 million
units of DNA in overlapping segments that together covered 85
percent of the human genome. Their project is now moving into the
finishing phase, that of filling the remaining gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view the race is over in that the vast
majority of the human genome sequence is freely available on the
web,'' said Dr. Eric Lander, director of the genome sequencing
center at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.

<P>
   Sometimes archaeologists must scrape and sift through tons of
dirt to find a single tiny fragment of the past. And sometimes the
past surges up at them in such abundance that they need cranes and
trucks to haul it away.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Bruni has the latter problem. He just happened to be in
the right job at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year Bruni was an obscure Etruscologist, a student of
the people who preceded the Romans in central and northern Italy.
Among other things, he had dug up the burial mound, or tumulus, of
an Etruscan prince just outside Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruni is also the scientific director of the Soprintendenza
ai Beni Archeologici della Toscana, the government agency that
protects archaeological sites in Tuscany. His agency had classified
the area around the tumulus, which happened to include an old
railway station called San Rossore, as archaeologically protected.
</P>
<P>
   When the Italian national railway, the Ferrovie dello Stato,
decided to build a new control station at San Rossore, it had to
come to Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   Before construction started, Bruni's team sampled the site to a
depth of about 20 feet. They found nothing surprising _ mostly
traces of Roman farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 1, 1998, just below the depth where the
archaeological survey had stopped, workers at the northeast corner
of the site sliced through a wooden ship from the second century
A.D.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Ferrovie thought it might get away with handing
over that one ship and moving its building 33 feet to the south,
but it soon turned out there was more than just one ship. Bruni's
team has since found parts of 17 ships and is now excavating eight
that are more or less intact.
</P>
<P>
   The ships date from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 500, but there may
well be older ones to come; a stone pier and wooden breakwater at
the south end of the site, Bruni says, date from the fifth century
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently this plot of land, which is just over six miles from
the sea, was once a small harbor off a large Pisan lagoon that has
since filled with silt.
</P>
<P>
   Bruni is digging up ships that sank in that harbor, along with
their contents: incense burners and oil lamps, fish hooks and
sewing needles, and many, many amphorae. Those large earthenware
jars once brought goods to Pisa from all over the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   What isn't so well known, and what these ships promise, is the
sort of detail that makes history come alive _ details about
ancient Pisa itself, about ancient ships and about the life of an
ancient harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Pisa was several centuries old when the Romans took it over. It
was the Etruscans who built the breakwater and pier Bruni's team
has found, and so Pisa must have been a substantial Etruscan port.
</P>
<P>
   During the Punic Wars of the third and second centuries B.C. _
when Rome defeated Carthage and so became the dominant power in the
western Mediterranean _ Pisa became a Roman naval base. But the
city _ about 200 miles north of Rome _ did not become a Roman
colony until the reign of Augustus. It acquired temples then, a
theater and baths. Of all that, nothing is left.
</P>
<P>
   One place where you find bits and pieces of the Roman city, it
turns out, is in the harbor. In the stratum just above the first
ship, Bruni's team found fragments of mosaics, of frescoed walls
and of marble columns. Bruni thinks he knows where the rubble came
from.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when he did some digging in the Piazza dei
Miracoli, where the medieval cathedral and its leaning bell tower
now stand, he found traces of grand Roman edifices. In the fifth
century, when those buildings were declining and falling along with
the rest of the Empire, the inhabitants of Pisa apparently chucked
the debris into the nearby harbor.
</P>
<P>
   By then perhaps it had silted up enough to be most useful as a
dump. The harbor lay at a bend in a river whose course has since
shifted some miles to the north of Pisa. It was not far from that
river's confluence with the Arno, which still flows through the
city center _ and which is still prone to flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At different times the harbor would have received loads of silt
from both rivers, as well as from the sea, which was close by.
Picture Pisa in Roman times, Bruni says, like the Venice of today:
a city built on islands in a vast lagoon and traversed by canals.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid silting up of the harbor covered the ships Bruni's team is
now excavating and preserved them from decay. Although hundreds of
ancient shipwrecks have been found before underwater, in general
the only significant ship parts to survive the millennia were
protected by cargoes of indestructible amphorae.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only the hull or the bottom of the hull of practically
all of them,'' says Lionel Casson, a professor of classics emeritus
at New York University and an expert on ancient seafaring. ``We're
lucky enough that some of the ships fell over and rested on their
sides, so we have the sides that the amphorae fell on top of and
protected. The higher on a ship you go, the more interesting the
information gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Pisan ships are preserved right up to the
gunwales, their planking a bit worm-eaten and waterlogged _ the
workers hit groundwater at the site even before they hit ship _ but
otherwise beautifully intact.
</P>
<P>
   In one ship, called ship B, the cargo is preserved: Amphorae
were still stacked in the hold, still held upright by a ballast of
rock. Some of the rock is lava from Vesuvius, which indicates the
ship had come from the Bay of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   The amphorae contain residues of what appears to be wine, as
well as peaches, cherries, plums and walnuts. A coin with the head
of Augustus suggests that the ship's last journey occurred in the
late first century B.C. For some reason it sank when it arrived in
Pisa; perhaps its cargo was not worth the effort for divers to
salvage it.
</P>
<P>
   Pisa is not Pompeii, although it is tempting to see it that way.
Pompeii is a snapshot taken on the morning of Aug. 24, A.D. 79,
when an ash cloud buried the city; the harbor Bruni is excavating
is a collage assembled over the course of a millennium, which makes
it trickier to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   So far, researchers have been more concerned with excavating and
preserving their find than with analyzing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race against time,'' Bruni says. ``When we expose the
boats to the air, the wood decays very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   As the boats are uncovered they are immediately re-covered with
a protective shell of fiberglass, which may also help make it
possible to move them someday without breaking them.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Bruni, the railway has decided to build its
offices elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the ships have been removed from the site, rinsed in
fresh water and injected with a chemical solidifier, will it become
possible to study their construction with care.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Bruni for the most interesting aspect of his dig, he
says it is the way in which the harbor at San Rossore is like
Pompeii _ in its preservation of the commonplace, of ordinary
objects that seem almost as precious to us now as the more glorious
bits of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things you don't normally find in digs,'' Bruni
says, ``things made of materials that are destroyed by time. Wooden
dishes and vases, cords and sacks, wicker baskets, leather sacks,
cloth ... It's everyday life we're seeing here.''

   One place where you find bits and pieces of the Roman city, it
turns out, is in the harbor. In the stratum just above the first
ship, Bruni's team found fragments of mosaics, of frescoed walls
and of marble columns. Bruni thinks he knows where the rubble came
from.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when he did some digging in the Piazza dei
Miracoli, where the medieval cathedral and its leaning bell tower
now stand, he found traces of grand Roman edifices. In the fifth
century, when those buildings were declining and falling along with
the rest of the Empire, the inhabitants of Pisa apparently chucked
the debris into the nearby harbor.
</P>
<P>
   By then perhaps it had silted up enough to be most useful as a
dump. The harbor lay at a bend in a river whose course has since
shifted some miles to the north of Pisa. It was not far from that
river's confluence with the Arno, which still flows through the
city center _ and which is still prone to flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At different times the harbor would have received loads of silt
from both rivers, as well as from the sea, which was close by.
Picture Pisa in Roman times, Bruni says, like the Venice of today:
a city built on islands in a vast lagoon and traversed by canals.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid silting up of the harbor covered the ships Bruni's team is
now excavating and preserved them from decay. Although hundreds of
ancient shipwrecks have been found before underwater, in general
the only significant ship parts to survive the millennia were
protected by cargoes of indestructible amphorae.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only the hull or the bottom of the hull of practically
all of them,'' says Lionel Casson, a professor of classics emeritus
at New York University and an expert on ancient seafaring. ``We're
lucky enough that some of the ships fell over and rested on their
sides, so we have the sides that the amphorae fell on top of and
protected. The higher on a ship you go, the more interesting the
information gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Pisan ships are preserved right up to the
gunwales, their planking a bit worm-eaten and waterlogged _ the
workers hit groundwater at the site even before they hit ship _ but
otherwise beautifully intact.
</P>
<P>
   In one ship, called ship B, the cargo is preserved: Amphorae
were still stacked in the hold, still held upright by a ballast of
rock. Some of the rock is lava from Vesuvius, which indicates the
ship had come from the Bay of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   The amphorae contain residues of what appears to be wine, as
well as peaches, cherries, plums and walnuts. A coin with the head
of Augustus suggests that the ship's last journey occurred in the
late first century B.C. For some reason it sank when it arrived in
Pisa; perhaps its cargo was not worth the effort for divers to
salvage it.
</P>
<P>
   Pisa is not Pompeii, although it is tempting to see it that way.
Pompeii is a snapshot taken on the morning of Aug. 24, A.D. 79,
when an ash cloud buried the city; the harbor Bruni is excavating
is a collage assembled over the course of a millennium, which makes
it trickier to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   So far, researchers have been more concerned with excavating and
preserving their find than with analyzing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race against time,'' Bruni says. ``When we expose the
boats to the air, the wood decays very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   As the boats are uncovered they are immediately re-covered with
a protective shell of fiberglass, which may also help make it
possible to move them someday without breaking them.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Bruni, the railway has decided to build its
offices elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the ships have been removed from the site, rinsed in
fresh water and injected with a chemical solidifier, will it become
possible to study their construction with care.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Bruni for the most interesting aspect of his dig, he
says it is the way in which the harbor at San Rossore is like
Pompeii _ in its preservation of the commonplace, of ordinary
objects that seem almost as precious to us now as the more glorious
bits of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things you don't normally find in digs,'' Bruni
says, ``things made of materials that are destroyed by time. Wooden
dishes and vases, cords and sacks, wicker baskets, leather sacks,
cloth ... It's everyday life we're seeing here.''

   When a male horsefly (hybomitra hinei wrighti) spies a suitable
female, he chases after her, catches her in midair, and they fall
to the ground copulating. The behavior is not surprising, but the
speed is.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Butler, an entomologist at the University of Florida, once
got a male Hybomitra to chase a plastic pellet fired from an air
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which it caught in midair and dropped,'' Butler says. From the
speed of the pellet, he calculated the fly was going at least 90
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are far from fully understanding such biomechanical
marvels, but in the past few years they have made an excellent
start. For one thing, they now have a plausible story for how
insect flight evolved. And if they can't quite say how a bug
manages to catch a speeding bullet, they at least have an
aerodynamic explanation for why it can stay aloft.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the key insight is this: Insects are not like
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   If an aeronautical engineer had been in charge of the evolution
of flying insects, he would have gotten them started with the
simplest form of flight: gliding. He would have had them grow rigid
wings on either side of their skeletons, crawl up a tree, and then
jump off.
</P>
<P>
   Once they mastered gliding, the insects could graduate to
flapping, hovering and buzzing annoyingly in our ears at night.
That, at least, was the prevailing evolutionary theory until the
1980s, when Jarmila Kukalova-Peck, a paleontologist at Carleton
University in Ottawa, came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the theory I hope I murdered,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kukalova-Peck pointed out that the gliding theory not only
lacked practicality _ until their wings grew long enough to glide,
bugs who jumped out of trees would have fallen on their mouthparts
_ but there was no fossil evidence to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The first fossils of flying insects date from the Carboniferous
Period, roughly 360 million years ago, and they show jointed wings
capable of flapping, not rigid ones designed for gliding.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest insects with winglike appendages lived in an
aquatic environment. They shared a common ancestor with
crustaceans, such as shrimp, which also have jointed legs and
jointed exoskeletons.
</P>
<P>
   Crustaceans swim by furiously beating their segmented legs,
aided by branches that grow from their joints. In insects,
Kukalova-Peck thinks _ and recent genetic comparisons of
crustaceans and insects have pretty much cinched the case _ the
flattened branches on the first segment of one pair of legs evolved
into wings.
</P>
<P>
   Even at an early, stubby stage, those proto-wings, while useless
for gliding, might have allowed an early insect to escape spiders
or scorpions that lived alongside it on floating mats of
vegetation. Extending those wings to catch the wind, the insect
might have found it could sail across the water. Flapping them
clumsily like a chicken, it might have discovered that a system
adapted to locomotion through water also worked tolerably well in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   While Kukalova-Peck was rethinking flight evolution, a zoologist
named Charles Ellington was starting to rethink the biomechanics of
insect flight. The dominant view then, put forward by Ellington's
adviser at Cambridge University, Torkel Weis-Fogh, was that most
insect wings work like airplane wings. Sure, they move up and down,
but that motion generates lift the same way a fixed airplane wing
does: When air flows over the wing, it moves down to follow the
wing's slightly tilted surface. That downward flow lowers the air
pressure above the wing, lifting it just enough to keep the
airplane _ or bug, Weis-Fogh believed _ aloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he'd pretty well sewn up the aerodynamics of insect
flight,'' Ellington says.
</P>
<P>
   When Ellington and other researchers put a variety of bugs in
wind tunnels, however, the conventional lift they measured was
never more than half of what was required to lift the weight of the
animal, and often less than a third. Apparently, insects had some
secret that aeronautical engineers lacked.
</P>
<P>
   When an insect wing flaps, its front edge goes down and forward
and then up and backward, tracing a flattened figure eight. That
motion leads insect wings to attack the oncoming air at a high
angle.
</P>
<P>
   An airplane wing, on the other hand, has a relatively small
angle of attack, almost parallel to the direction of travel.
Increase the angle (by tilting the leading edge upward) and you
increase the lift, but only up to a point. Tilt it more than 18
degrees, on a typical commercial airplane, and the airflow pulls
away from the upper surface and the lift vanishes. This is called
stalling.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of flapping insect wings, Ellington discovered, is
that they are always on the edge of stalling, the point of maximum
lift.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Ellington took a hawkmoth (wingspan: four
inches) and tethered it to the end of a wind tunnel. He then
blasted it with strobe-lit ``smoke'' created from oil droplets and
filmed it as it flapped for its life. (To give it a rest, he let it
grab onto a Kleenex.)
</P>
<P>
   Stereo photographs revealed a crucial feature in the flow of
smoke over the moth's wings: a large vortex nestled on top of the
leading edge. That vortex, Ellington says, generates 70 percent of
the moth's lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vortex is like a tornado,'' he says. ``It sucks the wing
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But why doesn't the vortex pull away from the wing, as it would
on a stalling airplane? To see that kind of detail, Ellington
needed an insect bigger than a hawkmoth. He needed the Flapper. The
Flapper is a robotic hawkmoth (wingspan: 40 inches) that Ellington
built himself. Its wings have four rotation axes that allow them to
turn nice, slow figure eights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about three seconds to do one wing beat,'' Ellington
says. ``It's wonderful _ you just pull up a chair and sit and look
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   When smoke hits the leading edge of the Flapper's wing, you do
see a vortex form, but that vortex immediately takes a sharp turn
and spirals out along the wing toward the tip. By draining air
outward, that spiral keeps the vortex from growing so big it must
detach from the wing and create a stall.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the spiral flow is simple: As the wing pivots, the
tip travels farther than the base and so moves through the air
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the outer parts of the wing are moving faster, they're
generating more lift, and there's more suction out there,''
Ellington says. ``So there's a pressure gradient sucking air to the
tip.''
</P>
<P>
   A stable leading-edge vortex, Ellington thinks, is what keeps
most insects aloft. True, it doesn't explain their aerial
acrobatics, but another phenomenon, recently discovered by Michael
Dickinson at the University of California at Berkeley, might help.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each downstroke and upstroke _ as it enters the
turns of the figure eight _ an insect wing rotates, shedding the
leading-edge vortex. For an instant, the rotation accelerates the
airflow over the top of the wing, thus generating a burst of even
greater lift. By controlling the timing of those wing flips, the
insect can steer the direction of the lift. That may have something
to do with how H. hinei wrighti manages to turn in mid-flight and
pursue a passing female at 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   With military funding, Ellington and Dickinson are both now
trying to build flying microvehicles. To be useful for
surveillance, Ellington says, the vehicles would need to generate
enough lift to carry an instrument payload and ideally be able to
hover.
</P>
<P>
   Insects are masters at high-lift hovering. But building a
flapping robot with a six-inch wingspan that can be steered and
won't shake itself to bits may still be beyond the skill of human
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, Ellington says, that a microhelicopter, with
propeller blades that imitate insect wings _ short, wide blades
with a high angle of attack _ will turn out to be an easier
solution.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a microflapper would certainly be more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on flapping flight all my career,''
Ellington says. ``It's always been my ultimate goal to have a
little radio-controlled flying insect. I mean, that's what it's all
about! The day that can be done, we'll have really understood
flapping insect flight. We're starting to get close to it now. But
we're not quite there.''

   Sometimes archaeologists must scrape and sift through tons of
dirt to find a single tiny fragment of the past. And sometimes the
past surges up at them in such abundance that they need cranes and
trucks to haul it away.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Bruni has the latter problem. He just happened to be in
the right job at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year Bruni was an obscure Etruscologist, a student of
the people who preceded the Romans in central and northern Italy.
Among other things, he had dug up the burial mound, or tumulus, of
an Etruscan prince just outside Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruni is also the scientific director of the Soprintendenza
ai Beni Archeologici della Toscana, the government agency that
protects archaeological sites in Tuscany. His agency had classified
the area around the tumulus, which happened to include an old
railway station called San Rossore, as archaeologically protected.
</P>
<P>
   When the Italian national railway, the Ferrovie dello Stato,
decided to build a new control station at San Rossore, it had to
come to Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   Before construction started, Bruni's team sampled the site to a
depth of about 20 feet. They found nothing surprising _ mostly
traces of Roman farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 1, 1998, just below the depth where the
archaeological survey had stopped, workers at the northeast corner
of the site sliced through a wooden ship from the second century
A.D.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Ferrovie thought it might get away with handing
over that one ship and moving its building 33 feet to the south,
but it soon turned out there was more than just one ship. Bruni's
team has since found parts of 17 ships and is now excavating eight
that are more or less intact.
</P>
<P>
   The ships date from around 200 B.C. to A.D. 500, but there may
well be older ones to come; a stone pier and wooden breakwater at
the south end of the site, Bruni says, date from the fifth century
B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently this plot of land, which is just over six miles from
the sea, was once a small harbor off a large Pisan lagoon that has
since filled with silt.
</P>
<P>
   Bruni is digging up ships that sank in that harbor, along with
their contents: incense burners and oil lamps, fish hooks and
sewing needles, and many, many amphorae. Those large earthenware
jars once brought goods to Pisa from all over the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   What isn't so well known, and what these ships promise, is the
sort of detail that makes history come alive _ details about
ancient Pisa itself, about ancient ships and about the life of an
ancient harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Pisa was several centuries old when the Romans took it over. It
was the Etruscans who built the breakwater and pier Bruni's team
has found, and so Pisa must have been a substantial Etruscan port.
</P>
<P>
   During the Punic Wars of the third and second centuries B.C. _
when Rome defeated Carthage and so became the dominant power in the
western Mediterranean _ Pisa became a Roman naval base. But the
city _ about 200 miles north of Rome _ did not become a Roman
colony until the reign of Augustus. It acquired temples then, a
theater and baths. Of all that, nothing is left.
</P>
<P>
   One place where you find bits and pieces of the Roman city, it
turns out, is in the harbor. In the stratum just above the first
ship, Bruni's team found fragments of mosaics, of frescoed walls
and of marble columns. Bruni thinks he knows where the rubble came
from.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, when he did some digging in the Piazza dei
Miracoli, where the medieval cathedral and its leaning bell tower
now stand, he found traces of grand Roman edifices. In the fifth
century, when those buildings were declining and falling along with
the rest of the Empire, the inhabitants of Pisa apparently chucked
the debris into the nearby harbor.
</P>
<P>
   By then perhaps it had silted up enough to be most useful as a
dump. The harbor lay at a bend in a river whose course has since
shifted some miles to the north of Pisa. It was not far from that
river's confluence with the Arno, which still flows through the
city center _ and which is still prone to flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At different times the harbor would have received loads of silt
from both rivers, as well as from the sea, which was close by.
Picture Pisa in Roman times, Bruni says, like the Venice of today:
a city built on islands in a vast lagoon and traversed by canals.
</P>
<P>
   Rapid silting up of the harbor covered the ships Bruni's team is
now excavating and preserved them from decay. Although hundreds of
ancient shipwrecks have been found before underwater, in general
the only significant ship parts to survive the millennia were
protected by cargoes of indestructible amphorae.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only the hull or the bottom of the hull of practically
all of them,'' says Lionel Casson, a professor of classics emeritus
at New York University and an expert on ancient seafaring. ``We're
lucky enough that some of the ships fell over and rested on their
sides, so we have the sides that the amphorae fell on top of and
protected. The higher on a ship you go, the more interesting the
information gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Pisan ships are preserved right up to the
gunwales, their planking a bit worm-eaten and waterlogged _ the
workers hit groundwater at the site even before they hit ship _ but
otherwise beautifully intact.
</P>
<P>
   In one ship, called ship B, the cargo is preserved: Amphorae
were still stacked in the hold, still held upright by a ballast of
rock. Some of the rock is lava from Vesuvius, which indicates the
ship had come from the Bay of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   The amphorae contain residues of what appears to be wine, as
well as peaches, cherries, plums and walnuts. A coin with the head
of Augustus suggests that the ship's last journey occurred in the
late first century B.C. For some reason it sank when it arrived in
Pisa; perhaps its cargo was not worth the effort for divers to
salvage it.
</P>
<P>
   Pisa is not Pompeii, although it is tempting to see it that way.
Pompeii is a snapshot taken on the morning of Aug. 24, A.D. 79,
when an ash cloud buried the city; the harbor Bruni is excavating
is a collage assembled over the course of a millennium, which makes
it trickier to analyze.
</P>
<P>
   So far, researchers have been more concerned with excavating and
preserving their find than with analyzing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a race against time,'' Bruni says. ``When we expose the
boats to the air, the wood decays very rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   As the boats are uncovered they are immediately re-covered with
a protective shell of fiberglass, which may also help make it
possible to move them someday without breaking them.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Bruni, the railway has decided to build its
offices elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Only after the ships have been removed from the site, rinsed in
fresh water and injected with a chemical solidifier, will it become
possible to study their construction with care.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask Bruni for the most interesting aspect of his dig, he
says it is the way in which the harbor at San Rossore is like
Pompeii _ in its preservation of the commonplace, of ordinary
objects that seem almost as precious to us now as the more glorious
bits of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things you don't normally find in digs,'' Bruni
says, ``things made of materials that are destroyed by time. Wooden
dishes and vases, cords and sacks, wicker baskets, leather sacks,
cloth ... It's everyday life we're seeing here.''

   Sometimes archaeologists must scrape and sift through tons of
dirt to find a single tiny fragment of the past. And sometimes the
past surges up at them in such abundance that they need cranes and
trucks to haul it away.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Bruni has the latter problem. He just happened to be in
the right job at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year Bruni was an obscure Etruscologist, a student of
the people who preceded the Romans in central and northern Italy.
Among other things, he had dug up the burial mound, or tumulus, of
an Etruscan prince just outside Pisa.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruni is also the scientific director of the Soprintendenza
ai Beni Archeologici della Toscana, the government agency that
protects archaeological sites in Tuscany. His agency had classified
the area around the tumulus, which happened to include an old
railway station called San Rossore, as archaeologically protected.
</P>
<P>
   When the Italian national railway, the Ferrovie dello Stato,
decided to build a new control station at San Rossore, it had to
come to Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   Before construction started, Bruni's team sampled the site to a
depth of about 20 feet. They found nothing surprising _ mostly
traces of Roman farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   But on Dec. 1, 1998, just below the depth where the
archaeological survey had stopped, workers at the northeast corner
of the site sliced through a wooden ship from the second century
A.D.

   When a male horsefly (hybomitra hinei wrighti) spies a suitable
female, he chases after her, catches her in midair, and they fall
to the ground copulating. The behavior is not surprising, but the
speed is.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Butler, an entomologist at the University of Florida, once
got a male Hybomitra to chase a plastic pellet fired from an air
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which it caught in midair and dropped,'' Butler says. From the
speed of the pellet, he calculated the fly was going at least 90
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are far from fully understanding such biomechanical
marvels, but in the past few years they have made an excellent
start. For one thing, they now have a plausible story for how
insect flight evolved. And if they can't quite say how a bug
manages to catch a speeding bullet, they at least have an
aerodynamic explanation for why it can stay aloft.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the key insight is this: Insects are not like
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   If an aeronautical engineer had been in charge of the evolution
of flying insects, he would have gotten them started with the
simplest form of flight: gliding. He would have had them grow rigid
wings on either side of their skeletons, crawl up a tree, and then
jump off.
</P>
<P>
   Once they mastered gliding, the insects could graduate to
flapping, hovering and buzzing annoyingly in our ears at night.
That, at least, was the prevailing evolutionary theory until the
1980s, when Jarmila Kukalova-Peck, a paleontologist at Carleton
University in Ottawa, came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the theory I hope I murdered,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kukalova-Peck pointed out that the gliding theory not only
lacked practicality _ until their wings grew long enough to glide,
bugs who jumped out of trees would have fallen on their mouthparts
_ but there was no fossil evidence to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The first fossils of flying insects date from the Carboniferous
Period, roughly 360 million years ago, and they show jointed wings
capable of flapping, not rigid ones designed for gliding.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest insects with winglike appendages lived in an
aquatic environment. They shared a common ancestor with
crustaceans, such as shrimp, which also have jointed legs and
jointed exoskeletons.
</P>
<P>
   Crustaceans swim by furiously beating their segmented legs,
aided by branches that grow from their joints. In insects,
Kukalova-Peck thinks _ and recent genetic comparisons of
crustaceans and insects have pretty much cinched the case _ the
flattened branches on the first segment of one pair of legs evolved
into wings.
</P>
<P>
   Even at an early, stubby stage, those proto-wings, while useless
for gliding, might have allowed an early insect to escape spiders
or scorpions that lived alongside it on floating mats of
vegetation. Extending those wings to catch the wind, the insect
might have found it could sail across the water. Flapping them
clumsily like a chicken, it might have discovered that a system
adapted to locomotion through water also worked tolerably well in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   While Kukalova-Peck was rethinking flight evolution, a zoologist
named Charles Ellington was starting to rethink the biomechanics of
insect flight. The dominant view then, put forward by Ellington's
adviser at Cambridge University, Torkel Weis-Fogh, was that most
insect wings work like airplane wings. Sure, they move up and down,
but that motion generates lift the same way a fixed airplane wing
does: When air flows over the wing, it moves down to follow the
wing's slightly tilted surface. That downward flow lowers the air
pressure above the wing, lifting it just enough to keep the
airplane _ or bug, Weis-Fogh believed _ aloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he'd pretty well sewn up the aerodynamics of insect
flight,'' Ellington says.
</P>
<P>
   When Ellington and other researchers put a variety of bugs in
wind tunnels, however, the conventional lift they measured was
never more than half of what was required to lift the weight of the
animal, and often less than a third. Apparently, insects had some
secret that aeronautical engineers lacked.
</P>
<P>
   When an insect wing flaps, its front edge goes down and forward
and then up and backward, tracing a flattened figure eight. That
motion leads insect wings to attack the oncoming air at a high
angle.
</P>
<P>
   An airplane wing, on the other hand, has a relatively small
angle of attack, almost parallel to the direction of travel.
Increase the angle (by tilting the leading edge upward) and you
increase the lift, but only up to a point. Tilt it more than 18
degrees, on a typical commercial airplane, and the airflow pulls
away from the upper surface and the lift vanishes. This is called
stalling.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of flapping insect wings, Ellington discovered, is
that they are always on the edge of stalling, the point of maximum
lift.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Ellington took a hawkmoth (wingspan: four
inches) and tethered it to the end of a wind tunnel. He then
blasted it with strobe-lit ``smoke'' created from oil droplets and
filmed it as it flapped for its life. (To give it a rest, he let it
grab onto a Kleenex.)
</P>
<P>
   Stereo photographs revealed a crucial feature in the flow of
smoke over the moth's wings: a large vortex nestled on top of the
leading edge. That vortex, Ellington says, generates 70 percent of
the moth's lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vortex is like a tornado,'' he says. ``It sucks the wing
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But why doesn't the vortex pull away from the wing, as it would
on a stalling airplane? To see that kind of detail, Ellington
needed an insect bigger than a hawkmoth. He needed the Flapper. The
Flapper is a robotic hawkmoth (wingspan: 40 inches) that Ellington
built himself. Its wings have four rotation axes that allow them to
turn nice, slow figure eights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about three seconds to do one wing beat,'' Ellington
says. ``It's wonderful _ you just pull up a chair and sit and look
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   When smoke hits the leading edge of the Flapper's wing, you do
see a vortex form, but that vortex immediately takes a sharp turn
and spirals out along the wing toward the tip. By draining air
outward, that spiral keeps the vortex from growing so big it must
detach from the wing and create a stall.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the spiral flow is simple: As the wing pivots, the
tip travels farther than the base and so moves through the air
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the outer parts of the wing are moving faster, they're
generating more lift, and there's more suction out there,''
Ellington says. ``So there's a pressure gradient sucking air to the
tip.''
</P>
<P>
   A stable leading-edge vortex, Ellington thinks, is what keeps
most insects aloft. True, it doesn't explain their aerial
acrobatics, but another phenomenon, recently discovered by Michael
Dickinson at the University of California at Berkeley, might help.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each downstroke and upstroke _ as it enters the
turns of the figure eight _ an insect wing rotates, shedding the
leading-edge vortex. For an instant, the rotation accelerates the
airflow over the top of the wing, thus generating a burst of even
greater lift. By controlling the timing of those wing flips, the
insect can steer the direction of the lift. That may have something
to do with how H. hinei wrighti manages to turn in mid-flight and
pursue a passing female at 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   With military funding, Ellington and Dickinson are both now
trying to build flying microvehicles. To be useful for
surveillance, Ellington says, the vehicles would need to generate
enough lift to carry an instrument payload and ideally be able to
hover.
</P>
<P>
   Insects are masters at high-lift hovering. But building a
flapping robot with a six-inch wingspan that can be steered and
won't shake itself to bits may still be beyond the skill of human
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, Ellington says, that a microhelicopter, with
propeller blades that imitate insect wings _ short, wide blades
with a high angle of attack _ will turn out to be an easier
solution.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a microflapper would certainly be more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on flapping flight all my career,''
Ellington says. ``It's always been my ultimate goal to have a
little radio-controlled flying insect. I mean, that's what it's all
about! The day that can be done, we'll have really understood
flapping insect flight. We're starting to get close to it now. But
we're not quite there.''

   Jerry Butler, an entomologist at the University of Florida, once
got a male Hybomitra to chase a plastic pellet fired from an air
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which it caught in midair and dropped,'' Butler says. From the
speed of the pellet, he calculated the fly was going at least 90
miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are far from fully understanding such biomechanical
marvels, but in the past few years they have made an excellent
start. For one thing, they now have a plausible story for how
insect flight evolved. And if they can't quite say how a bug
manages to catch a speeding bullet, they at least have an
aerodynamic explanation for why it can stay aloft.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the key insight is this: Insects are not like
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   If an aeronautical engineer had been in charge of the evolution
of flying insects, he would have gotten them started with the
simplest form of flight: gliding. He would have had them grow rigid
wings on either side of their skeletons, crawl up a tree, and then
jump off.
</P>
<P>
   Once they mastered gliding, the insects could graduate to
flapping, hovering and buzzing annoyingly in our ears at night.
That, at least, was the prevailing evolutionary theory until the
1980s, when Jarmila Kukalova-Peck, a paleontologist at Carleton
University in Ottawa, came along.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the theory I hope I murdered,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kukalova-Peck pointed out that the gliding theory not only
lacked practicality _ until their wings grew long enough to glide,
bugs who jumped out of trees would have fallen on their mouthparts
_ but there was no fossil evidence to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The first fossils of flying insects date from the Carboniferous
Period, roughly 360 million years ago, and they show jointed wings
capable of flapping, not rigid ones designed for gliding.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest insects with winglike appendages lived in an
aquatic environment. They shared a common ancestor with
crustaceans, such as shrimp, which also have jointed legs and
jointed exoskeletons.
</P>
<P>
   Crustaceans swim by furiously beating their segmented legs,
aided by branches that grow from their joints. In insects,
Kukalova-Peck thinks _ and recent genetic comparisons of
crustaceans and insects have pretty much cinched the case _ the
flattened branches on the first segment of one pair of legs evolved
into wings.
</P>
<P>
   Even at an early, stubby stage, those proto-wings, while useless
for gliding, might have allowed an early insect to escape spiders
or scorpions that lived alongside it on floating mats of
vegetation. Extending those wings to catch the wind, the insect
might have found it could sail across the water. Flapping them
clumsily like a chicken, it might have discovered that a system
adapted to locomotion through water also worked tolerably well in
the air.
</P>
<P>
   While Kukalova-Peck was rethinking flight evolution, a zoologist
named Charles Ellington was starting to rethink the biomechanics of
insect flight. The dominant view then, put forward by Ellington's
adviser at Cambridge University, Torkel Weis-Fogh, was that most
insect wings work like airplane wings. Sure, they move up and down,
but that motion generates lift the same way a fixed airplane wing
does: When air flows over the wing, it moves down to follow the
wing's slightly tilted surface. That downward flow lowers the air
pressure above the wing, lifting it just enough to keep the
airplane _ or bug, Weis-Fogh believed _ aloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought he'd pretty well sewn up the aerodynamics of insect
flight,'' Ellington says.
</P>
<P>
   When Ellington and other researchers put a variety of bugs in
wind tunnels, however, the conventional lift they measured was
never more than half of what was required to lift the weight of the
animal, and often less than a third. Apparently, insects had some
secret that aeronautical engineers lacked.
</P>
<P>
   When an insect wing flaps, its front edge goes down and forward
and then up and backward, tracing a flattened figure eight. That
motion leads insect wings to attack the oncoming air at a high
angle.
</P>
<P>
   An airplane wing, on the other hand, has a relatively small
angle of attack, almost parallel to the direction of travel.
Increase the angle (by tilting the leading edge upward) and you
increase the lift, but only up to a point. Tilt it more than 18
degrees, on a typical commercial airplane, and the airflow pulls
away from the upper surface and the lift vanishes. This is called
stalling.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of flapping insect wings, Ellington discovered, is
that they are always on the edge of stalling, the point of maximum
lift.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Ellington took a hawkmoth (wingspan: four
inches) and tethered it to the end of a wind tunnel. He then
blasted it with strobe-lit ``smoke'' created from oil droplets and
filmed it as it flapped for its life. (To give it a rest, he let it
grab onto a Kleenex.)
</P>
<P>
   Stereo photographs revealed a crucial feature in the flow of
smoke over the moth's wings: a large vortex nestled on top of the
leading edge. That vortex, Ellington says, generates 70 percent of
the moth's lift.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vortex is like a tornado,'' he says. ``It sucks the wing
up.''
</P>
<P>
   But why doesn't the vortex pull away from the wing, as it would
on a stalling airplane? To see that kind of detail, Ellington
needed an insect bigger than a hawkmoth. He needed the Flapper. The
Flapper is a robotic hawkmoth (wingspan: 40 inches) that Ellington
built himself. Its wings have four rotation axes that allow them to
turn nice, slow figure eights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about three seconds to do one wing beat,'' Ellington
says. ``It's wonderful _ you just pull up a chair and sit and look
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   When smoke hits the leading edge of the Flapper's wing, you do
see a vortex form, but that vortex immediately takes a sharp turn
and spirals out along the wing toward the tip. By draining air
outward, that spiral keeps the vortex from growing so big it must
detach from the wing and create a stall.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the spiral flow is simple: As the wing pivots, the
tip travels farther than the base and so moves through the air
faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the outer parts of the wing are moving faster, they're
generating more lift, and there's more suction out there,''
Ellington says. ``So there's a pressure gradient sucking air to the
tip.''
</P>
<P>
   A stable leading-edge vortex, Ellington thinks, is what keeps
most insects aloft. True, it doesn't explain their aerial
acrobatics, but another phenomenon, recently discovered by Michael
Dickinson at the University of California at Berkeley, might help.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each downstroke and upstroke _ as it enters the
turns of the figure eight _ an insect wing rotates, shedding the
leading-edge vortex. For an instant, the rotation accelerates the
airflow over the top of the wing, thus generating a burst of even
greater lift. By controlling the timing of those wing flips, the
insect can steer the direction of the lift. That may have something
to do with how H. hinei wrighti manages to turn in mid-flight and
pursue a passing female at 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   With military funding, Ellington and Dickinson are both now
trying to build flying microvehicles. To be useful for
surveillance, Ellington says, the vehicles would need to generate
enough lift to carry an instrument payload and ideally be able to
hover.
</P>
<P>
   Insects are masters at high-lift hovering. But building a
flapping robot with a six-inch wingspan that can be steered and
won't shake itself to bits may still be beyond the skill of human
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, Ellington says, that a microhelicopter, with
propeller blades that imitate insect wings _ short, wide blades
with a high angle of attack _ will turn out to be an easier
solution.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a microflapper would certainly be more fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on flapping flight all my career,''
Ellington says. ``It's always been my ultimate goal to have a
little radio-controlled flying insect. I mean, that's what it's all
about! The day that can be done, we'll have really understood
flapping insect flight. We're starting to get close to it now. But
we're not quite there.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As fighting erupted Monday outside the Freetown home
of Foday Sankoh, the leader of the rebel forces in Sierra Leone,
diplomats in New York continued to struggle with a conundrum that
is pivotal to the prospects for peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
   What should they do with this man whom they know to be a beast?
</P>
<P>
   No one at the United Nations questions that a trial of Sankoh, a
former army corporal and TV cameraman who took control of the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in 1991, would end with his
conviction of some of the worst human-rights crimes ever seen. But
would such a trial now help Sierra Leone?
</P>
<P>
   It was last July's peace accord, which was meant to bring an end
to nine years of civil war, that ensured Sankoh's continued
influence on his country.
</P>
<P>
   In return for a pledge to disarm, he was given a cabinet
position in the new government as well as an amnesty from
prosecution for him and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows the truth that Sankoh is totally to blame for
the violence at the moment,'' one senior western diplomat at the
U.N. commented. ``In a normal world that would put him beyond the
pale.''
</P>
<P>
   The crimes committed by soldiers loyal to Sankoh during Sierra
Leone's nine years of civil war have been well documented by groups
such as Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   In a brutal quest to suppress all opposition in the population,
they routinely hacked limbs from civilians and raped women.
Children as young as ten were forced to fight with the rebel
militia.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 10,000 children, some given cocaine and scarred by
the initials RUF carved into their flesh, were pressed into
fighting. Sankoh kept discipline by ordering the execution of any
commanders who challenged him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unspeakable acts of brutality carried out by Sankoh's men
_ the systematic mutilation of civilians including children and the
elderly _ are really the most sickening that the world has
witnessed in these atrocity-filled years,'' noted Reed Brody,
Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody has to stand up to Sankoh. And it had better happen
now.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no illusions at the U.N. that Sankoh has utterly
disregarded the promises he made last July.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in New York estimate that only about a quarter of the
estimated 16,000 rebels under his command have entered U.N.
disarmament camps and handed over their weapons. And most of those
have been in areas far away from the country's diamond mines.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any reason to suppose that the RUF has honored the
agreement to suspend mining of diamonds in Sierra Leone until full
peace has been restored.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, perhaps the greatest irony of the July peace accord was
the provision giving Sankoh oversight of diamond mining policy.
Some officials in New York believe that it was the prospect of U.N.
peacekeepers finally closing in on the diamond districts that
prompted Sankoh to order the violence of the last several days,
which led to the abduction of up to 500 U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   They also see him testing the depth of the resolve of the U.N.
peacekeeping mission. ``The U.N. will stand firm and face him
down,'' one Security Council source insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the Council will then seek finally to remove
Sankoh from the picture entirely and attempt to impose justice on
him, perhaps through a court dedicated to unearthing the crimes
committed in Sierra Leone or a commission of inquiry, is far less
clear, however. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Just when you thought it was safe to pass a shop
with your child, here comes the latest craze _ Pokemon on your
mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
   Bandai, the Japanese toymaker that has made a speciality of
generating playground crazes, has started testing its latest scheme
on Tokyo's schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The company which unleashed Tamagotchis and Power Rangers on the
world now has a partnership with Nintendo, giving it the right to
use the games maker's Pokemon characters.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon craze began two years ago in Japan, but has branched
out to a global market of fascinated children. It has generated a
series of collectable trading cards, a film, endless toy figures
and a video game.
</P>
<P>
   But now the company has taken the fad one stage further. In
Japan, where a huge number of schoolkids own mobile phones, Bandai
is offering constant telephone access to the Pokemon phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-teen users simply call the service each morning and
download one of the 200 Pokemon characters to their phone. All day,
the screen will show an image of the cartoon monster, and make its
individual noise.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme is the fledgling service of what experts believe will
prove to be the future of Bandai. The database of figures is just
one of a potentially vast range of other services.
</P>
<P>
   Since launching in January, 1.5 million kids have signed up, and
the number is growing by 100,000 a month. If it continues to rise
that fast, say analysts, revenues will soon outstrip the main
business of toymaking.

   L'ANSE AIX MEADOWS, Newfoundland _ A spring snow fell all night
and all day and buried the land down to water's edge. Drifts piled
high against the walls of the sod houses. The mind's eye could see
the place as it was 1,000 years ago when Vikings, led by Leif
Ericson, first wintered here while exploring the coasts of a
country they called Vinland.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at the northern tip of Newfoundland, is what
archaeologists agree is the first and still only authentic site of
Viking settlement in North America, 500 years before the voyages of
Columbus. The ruins of eight houses and workshops, some with their
thick walls and pitched roofs meticulously restored, will be a
focus for this year's millennial commemoration of all things
Viking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement has led us to Vinland, at last,'' said Dr.
Birgitta Linderoth Wallace, an archaeologist with Parks Canada who
has studied the site for years.
</P>
<P>
   The excavations have not only confirmed elements of truth in the
sagas of the seafaring adventurers from Norway and the rest of
Scandinavia who crossed the North Atlantic and, for a brief time,
tasted the berries and grapes in North America, their Vinland. They
have also inspired new scholarship revising the legendary image of
the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they were feared warriors who plundered the coasts of
Europe and the British Isles, especially between 750 and about
1050; the term Viking, strictly speaking, refers only to men who
went on raids.
</P>
<P>
   But they were also farmers and herders at home and no less
sophisticated in arts and invention than other medieval Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   They were successful ship builders who engaged in ever-widening
trade, east to Russia and south to Rome and Baghdad. In their
Iceland colony at the end of the 10th century, these people created
the first democratic parliament. Their further western expansion
brought about the first tenuous contact between the Old World and
the New.
</P>
<P>
   These new interpretations of the Vikings and their Norse
descendants are illustrated in an exhibition, ``Vikings: The North
Atlantic Saga,'' which opened recently at the National Museum of
Natural History in Washington and will run through Aug. 13. It will
then move to the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research is described in detail in the exhibition's
elaborate companion book, published by the Smithsonian Press, and a
new translation of the Norse sagas has been issued, appropriately,
by Viking Press.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William W. Fitzhugh, the exhibition's principal curator,
said that as travelers and traders the Vikings were ``catalysts
that transformed European societies,'' and as explorers they took
the first steps to ``reconnect human populations into a single
global system.''
</P>
<P>
   They were presumably the first Europeans to lay eyes on
descendants of the people who had long before migrated into the
Americas, where one branch of humanity had lived unknown to the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime at the end of the 10th century, halfway between today
and the birth of Christ and Rome's heyday, Ericson set out from the
Greenland colony in a sturdy longboat with a soaring prow and a
large square sail. Another seafarer, drifting off course, had
sighted land to the west, and Ericson went to see for himself.
</P>
<P>
   According to the sagas, Ericson's party first headed northwest
across Baffin Bay and came upon a rocky coast they called
Helluland, present-day Baffin Island. Then they sailed south,
hugging the shore, to the wooded place they named Markland,
probably Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they entered a shallow bay and waited for high tide to
bring them ashore to a green meadow. Here at L'Anse aux Meadows,
they established a base camp, their beachhead in Vinland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think this site is Vinland itself,'' said Tamara
Ricks, acting supervisor of the National Historic Park here. ``But
it really was the gateway to Vinland. Over a period of about 10
years, we think, several Viking parties probably spent three to
five years in total here, wintering over, hunting and fishing and
repairing their boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinland proper, scholars conclude, lay to the south along the
coasts around the Gulf of St. Lawrence, in Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick. Of Vinland, Adam of Bremen wrote in 1070, ``There grow
wild grapes.'' Climate studies suggest that grapes never grew in
Newfoundland, but probably did grow in Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt that Vikings traveled to these southern
coasts, it was dispelled when archaeologists found butternuts, a
white walnut, buried in the ruins here. The closest place where
butternuts grow is New Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   Until the discovery of this site, the very fact of a Viking
presence anywhere in North America was questioned as possibly
little more than a myth, like trolls and elves. Then along came
Helge Ingstad and his wife, Dr. Anne Stine Ingstad, an
archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   An Arctic explorer in the Norse tradition, Ingstad followed a
hunch and an Icelandic map from the 1670s, which identified a place
on the north coast of Newfoundland as ``Promontorium Winlandiae.''
</P>
<P>
   After scouting out other coasts, he arrived at the small fishing
village here in 1960. He asked a fisherman, George Decker, if there
were any strange ruins in the vicinity. In an interview in
Washington, where he attended the opening of the Viking exhibition,
the 100-year-old Ingstad of Oslo, still keen of mind, recalled the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, follow me,'' he said Decker told him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decker took me west of the village to a beautiful place with
lots of grass and a small creek and some mounds in the tall
grass,'' Ingstad remembered. ``It was very clear that this was a
very, very old site. There were remains of sod walls. Fishermen
assumed it was an old Indian site. But Indians didn't use that kind
of buildings, sod houses.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next eight summers, Ingstad and his wife, now deceased,
and an international team of archaeologists excavated the site.
Their first reports of discovery were not believed. Then they came
upon remains of a blacksmith shop, he said, ``one of our most
important finds.'' In the middle was a huge flat stone for the
anvil, with charcoal and lumps of iron scattered about. A few of
the pieces had been forged into nails. This was the earliest
evidence of iron processing in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The Ingstads uncovered the outlines of eight houses, three of
which were where the people lived, perhaps 25 to 35 in each long
dwelling. Built in the style of Icelandic houses, the walls were
six feet thick, two layers of sod between a layer of gravel for
drainage. The roofs were made of turf laid over a timber frame.
Radiocarbon analysis dated the artifacts at between 980 and 1020 _
the time of Ericson's and subsequent expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   The Ingstads' work ``proved that Norsemen, Vikings if you will,
actually were in America 500 years before Columbus,'' Fitzhugh
said.
</P>
<P>
   In later excavations, Wallace, of Parks Canada, uncovered even
more artifacts confirming the site's Viking origins. Geochemical
analysis of pieces of jasper, used to make sparks for starting
fires, revealed trace elements found only in Greenland or Iceland.
In the ground outside one of the houses was a bronze pin with a
ring head, in a Norse style and probably made in Britain. The
Vikings used such pins as fasteners for their cloaks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 800 artifacts archaeologists also found soapstone oil
lamps, a bone needle and more iron nails. Some of the smaller
houses appeared to be workshops for carpenters and weavers. A
spindle whorl attested to work with textiles, and since Vikings
considered this women's work, at least some of the expeditions must
have included women.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of evidence of any barns, Wallace said, indicated
that this was not a farming settlement, but a base camp for the
Vikings as they surveyed the region for likely places for more
permanent occupation.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay for the exhibition's companion book, Wallace wrote,
``The silent ruins of the L'Anse aux Meadows site tell a
fascinating story of the people who built them, when they were
there, what they did and why they were there.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Long afterward, though, Vikings from Greenland repeatedly
visited the shores of Labrador for timber and food. Archaeologists
have found Norse artifacts, including spun yarn, there and on
northern Baffin Island. Since neither the early Eskimos nor their
immediate Inuit successors spun yarn or worked wood by sawing,
nailing and mortising, Dr. Patricia Sutherland of the
Archaeological Survey of Canada said, the artifacts pointed to
extensive contacts with the Greenland Norse for several centuries.
Beginning this summer, Sutherland will conduct new studies of these
artifacts and search for more in the Canadian Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   But archaeologists hold out little hope of finding another
Viking camp like L'Anse aux Meadows. Some previous finds have
turned out to be misleading or bogus. A Norse penny minted in the
late 11th century turned up at an Indian site in Maine, but it is
generally thought to have gotten there by trade. A stone tower in
Newport, R.I., once hailed as Viking, was actually built in the
17th century. Both Minnesota's Kensington Stone, bearing Norse
writing, and Yale's Vinland Map are now widely judged to be modern
fakes.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 15th century, the Norse also had to abandon
Greenland. After centuries of relative warmth, which had favored
North Atlantic travels, the global climate took a frigid turn, and
the colony's trade with Norway declined sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The era of Viking marauding had long since passed. To some
scholars the Norman invasion of England in 1066 was the last great
Viking raid; many Normans were descended from helmeted Vikings who
had earlier seized their land. And now the era of Viking western
expansion had also ended. All that was left were the sagas, and
ruins of some sod houses on a bleak Canadian coast.
</P>
<P>
   Writing of the Vikings who had to give up their Vinland dreams,
Sigurdsson said, ``You spend the rest of your life boasting of the
great time you had with your mates when you spent the summers
sailing across the seven seas and finding new and previously
unheard of lands, just like the Icelandic sagas tell us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week's heavy snow on the restored houses evoked a vision of
the Vikings' first winter here: Labrador, their Markland, is barely
visible across the strait leading from the Atlantic Ocean into the
Gulf of St. Lawrence. A small fishing boat rests on a wooden stand.
Fish hang drying on a rack. Firewood is stacked near the entrance
to the long house. Smoke, rising through a roof hatch, is swept
away in the stiff wind.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, people lounge on benches facing a fire for warmth and
cooking. They sharpen knives and axes, carve pieces of wood and
mend clothing, garments of wool from home and animal skins from
their travels. By the light of a soapstone lamp in a corner,
someone fingers the ring head of the bronze pin, calling up
memories of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, they spin stories of seas they have sailed and
places they have found, stepping stones of land across the North
Atlantic, first the Faeroe Islands northwest of Scotland, then
Iceland and Greenland, now here at the gateway to Vinland. Someday
their tales would be written down as the Norse sagas. The ones
about Vinland would scarcely be believed, at least not until the
discovery of these ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Serious Viking exploration of Vinland probably lasted little
more than a decade. After Ericson's single expedition, his role as
Vinland explorer was assumed by Thorfinn Karlsefni, who once led a
party of 160 men and women in three ships. They stayed three years,
and his wife, Gudrid, gave birth to a boy, Snorri, presumably the
first European born in America.
</P>
<P>
   One of the advantages of the L'Anse aux Meadows camp, scholars
say, was its safe distance from native Indians. But at other
settlements, the Vikings had several bloody encounters with the
Indians, whom they called Skraelings, a derogatory Old Norse word
meaning wretch. In a time before gunpowder, the Vikings with spears
and axes held no arms advantage over the Indians with bows and
arrows, and the Indians outnumbered them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internal conflicts as well as attack from the natives
eventually led to their departure,'' concluded Dr. Gisli
Sigurdsson, a Norse scholar at the Arni Magnusson Institute in
Reykjavik, Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been to the Moon, but we haven't yet established bases
there,'' Wallace said. ``The same was the case for the Norse and
Vinland.''

   LONDON _ Luscious lips, full breasts and big penises may hold a
deadly secret. For increasingly they are being made from corpses
donated to save lives.
</P>
<P>
   The use in cosmetic surgery of bodies given to medicine is part
of a booming industry in human spare parts. It is worth hundreds of
millions of dollars a year in the United States, despite a law
banning the sale of human tissue. Some of the firms involved are
planning to bring their products to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A single body can be worth over $110,000 (pounds sterling70,000)
to the industry, twice as much if its bones are also ``harvested.''
But experts say that grieving relatives are not told of the profits
to be made from their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who donate have no idea that tissue is being processed
into products that, per gram or per ounce, are in the price range
of diamonds,'' said Professor Arthur Caplan, of the University of
Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics. ``They are not told that it
will be used for cosmetic purposes rather than life saving.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for those who receive the tissue, it is like eating a hot
dog. You can enjoy it, but it's often better not to ask what is in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 20,000 dead Americans became the raw material for this
ultimate recycling industry last year, four times as many as were
used for the transplanting of vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   Glossy sales catalogues display some 650 different products made
from the bodies, and a single corpse can provide material for 100
living patients.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the uses do bring medical benefits, the industry
stresses. Tendons mend sports injuries, while a gel made of human
skin tissue can fill holes left by operating on tumors and treat
incontinence in women.
</P>
<P>
   And every year dentists give some 200,000 Americans powdered
human bone from corpses to treat damaged gums and jaws.
</P>
<P>
   But products made from human skin are also used to bulk out the
lips of models and actresses, and _ at over $1,000 (pounds
sterling650) an injection _ to thicken penises, augment breasts,
and iron out wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   The British Association for Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons and the
British Dental Association say products from corpses are only
rarely used in Britain, and the major products used in the U.S. are
not yet licensed in this country. &QL;

<P>
   Like most Parisian maitre d's, the one at L'Avenue _ Paris'
latest must-be-seen-in spot _ takes great pleasure in turning away
sneaker-wearing Americans when they arrive sans reservations. Only
after he's told that Vincent Perez will be joining me (the news
causes a nearby waitress to drop her tray holding two empty
champagne glasses and an ashtray) does the attitude vanish and a
table open up.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans who aren't familiar with the 35-year-old
Swiss-born actor, it's a little like showing up at New York's
hotter-than-hot Pastis and saying you're meeting Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while seated by the window, Perez smiles politely for a
group of girls pressing their faces up against the glass to take a
closer look, then blushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we shouldn't have come here,'' he says, covering the
side of his face with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction to Perez's smoldering good looks would most
likely be the same at any venue in Paris. He has been one of
Europe's leading matinee idols for the last 15 years. His
performance as Catherine Deneuve's lover in 1993's Oscar-winning
``Indochine'' still has women _ and a lot of men _ quivering.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is Kim Basinger's leading man in ``I Dreamed of Africa,''
a saga of a European couple's life in Kenya. It's a role that's
certain to bolster his sex appeal stateside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think the only way for a European actor to make
it is to have an international career,'' he says. ``The film
business here in France is overintellectualized. That's the way
people have to prove themselves here. I'm not interested in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's not about to pack it all up and move to Hollywood.
That would be too much for his family to bear. Perez lives with his
wife, former model Karine Sylla, their baby daughter, Iman, and
Sylla's six-year-old daughter, Roxanne, from her relationship with
Gerard Depardieu.
</P>
<P>
   The irony of having familial ties to the legend of French cinema
isn't lost on the younger actor. After all, it was his role
opposite Depardieu in 1990's ``Cyrano de Bergerac'' that truly made
Perez a superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Gerard.'' he says. ``When we get together we share a
steak, a few glasses of wine and some laughs. We have the kids to
talk about _ not cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   Buttoning his coat up high and slipping on his dark sunglasses
to leave the restaurant, Perez insists he's able to maintain some
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a way of becoming transparent when I'm on the street,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   As he crosses the avenue Montaigne, head down, window-shoppers
stop and point. &QL;

<P>
   Like most Parisian maitre d's, the one at L'Avenue _ Paris'
latest must-be-seen-in spot _ takes great pleasure in turning away
sneaker-wearing Americans when they arrive sans reservations. Only
after he's told that Vincent Perez will be joining me (the news
causes a nearby waitress to drop her tray holding two empty
champagne glasses and an ashtray) does the attitude vanish and a
table open up.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans who aren't familiar with the 35-year-old
Swiss-born actor, it's a little like showing up at New York's
hotter-than-hot Pastis and saying you're meeting Brad Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while seated by the window, Perez smiles politely for a
group of girls pressing their faces up against the glass to take a
closer look, then blushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we shouldn't have come here,'' he says, covering the
side of his face with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction to Perez's smoldering good looks would most
likely be the same at any venue in Paris. He has been one of
Europe's leading matinee idols for the last 15 years. His
performance as Catherine Deneuve's lover in 1993's Oscar-winning
``Indochine'' still has women _ and a lot of men _ quivering.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is Kim Basinger's leading man in ``I Dreamed of Africa,''
a saga of a European couple's life in Kenya. It's a role that's
certain to bolster his sex appeal stateside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think the only way for a European actor to make
it is to have an international career,'' he says. ``The film
business here in France is overintellectualized. That's the way
people have to prove themselves here. I'm not interested in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's not about to pack it all up and move to Hollywood.
That would be too much for his family to bear. Perez lives with his
wife, former model Karine Sylla, their baby daughter, Iman, and
Sylla's six-year-old daughter, Roxanne, from her relationship with

<P>
   Late last year, every wrist in Los Angeles, New York and London
seemed to be sporting at least one colorful powerbead bracelet, if
not an armful.
</P>
<P>
   Pink, rumored to attract love, was the most popular, followed
closely by green (for money) and orange (for joy). The wearers must
have been getting results, because the hottest accessory to have on
your arm right now is your very own color therapist.
</P>
<P>
   Color therapy is based on the theory that colors bring about
emotional reactions and can correct energy imbalances. Aleta St.
James, an ``emotional healer'' and ``success coach,'' has used the
practice for 27 years to heal emotional blocks and balance the
body's seven chakras. Patients include designer Todd Oldham and
model Carolyn Murphy, who says, ``Aleta helped me become a better
person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I use my intuition with my patients to find out where the
trauma is,'' St. James explains. ``If, for example, it's in the
heart, I put my hands there. I shoot the healing color into them _
in this case green for acceptance and love _ like a laser beam out
of my hands, eyes and heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan E. Moses, an L.A.-based naturopath and self-styled
``minister of health'' takes a slightly different approach, using
color in conjunction with Chinese medicine to balance the body's
yin and yang and ``restore personal power.''
</P>
<P>
   To determine which parts of the color spectrum his patients need
more (or less) of, he asks them to say their name while looking at
five different colors _ yellow, red, green, blue and gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever color they show a loss of energy in front of is their
deficient color,'' he says. ``It's usually their favorite, and
that's why _ because they need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood screenwriter Rick Krause is a convert to Moses'
technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I have excessive heat,'' Krause says. ``That means I
have too much red and I have to stay away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   After his consultation with Moses, Krause went out and bought a
new blue carpet and a blue bedspread.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm wearing a blue sweater right now,'' he says. ``What
he's done has worked for me. I get more done, I function on a
higher level and it's doubled my energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Color therapy may seem like a New Age fad, but in fact it's one
of the oldest practices around, dating back to Ancient Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not an exact science. Different cultures have
different traditions, and there's plenty of room for
interpretation. Seeing red might anger a bull, for example, but it
increases egg laying in chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Westerners believe blue to be an appetite suppressant, while
Chinese medicine prescribes blue for weight gain. Green may be the
traditional color of envy, but feng shui recommends wearing green
underwear to secure a raise at work.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such contradictions, it's an area that has become
red-hot in the beauty and alternative healing industries. Of
course, adding a new dimension to the use of color is a no-brainer
for cosmetics companies, who have been quick to explore the new
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophy started early with its Rainbow Kit, a color therapy
bubble bath launched four years ago. According to creator Christina
Carlino, sales are at a higher level now than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like feng shui, color therapy is becoming very popular because
people are starting to think in terms of energy,'' says Christina
Bornstein (aka Tina) of Tony &AMP; Tina, which has based its makeup
line on the vibrational therapy of color and is currently
researching a book on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands are great places to receive and transmit energy, so nail
polish is a good way to wear color.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony &AMP; Tina nail polishes are named after the vibes they
supposedly emit: clarification (yellow), courage (deep red), solace
(pink).
</P>
<P>
   Even the usually sensible Elizabeth Arden has joined the party,
prescribing plum lipstick for passion and neutral for serenity.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're brave enough to self-administer a dose of color
healing, you can try Color Therapy from Rainbow Inc., which has
everything from rose-tinted spectacles for a bit of Tibetan color
visualization to color music CDs featuring compositions based on
the harmonic relationship between color and notes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, medical studies have begun to show a
scientific basis for color therapies. The American Journal of
Psychology found that using red and green light to treat depression
reduced symptoms by 20 percent after two hours, and a 1997 study by
The Biology of the Neonate journal reported that three hours of
blue-light phototherapy eliminated jaundice in five out of 10
babies studied (the other five experienced moderate relief with
green-light phototherapy).
</P>
<P>
   And in opthamology, color is a widely accepted method of
treatment. Optometrist Joseph Shapiro of Manhattan's Unlimited
Vision employs Syntonic therapy, a method developed in the 1930s by
Dr. Riley Spitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syntonic therapy is color therapy for visual imbalances _ such
as eye-muscle problems, lazy eyes and tunnel vision,'' Shapiro
explains, ``I cure my own migraines by thinking of a color in the
blue-violet range.''
</P>
<P>
   But doctors warn against making too many claims for color
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no controlled studies on the relationship
between color and healing,'' says Stephen Josephson, a clinical
psychologist who teaches at Cornell and Columbia. ``I accept that
pinks and reds stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, blue and
green are relaxing, and yellow can enhance concentration. I'm sure
that studies in the future will show that we're affected by
everything from humidity to the moon to light _ but as a field,
color therapy is unexplored territory.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing, however, is clear: Certain colors do make us feel
better. And that's enough to keep a lot of people thinking pink, or
yellow or green.
</P>
<P>
   ``If color gets us moving into a positive state of mind quickly,
then that's great,'' St. James says. ``Sometimes, you just don't
have time to meditate.'' &QL;

 By ROBERT FISK  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BSALIM, LEBANON _ Did the American ambassador to Israel decide
the target of Israel's bombardment of Lebanon Friday? Incredible as
it seems, Martin Indyck's intervention appears to have done just
that.
</P>
<P>
   By urging Israel to suspend a plan to attack Syrian facilities
in Lebanon during its latest attack on the country's civilian
infrastructure, the plea led to the bombing raids _ with
American-made missiles _ on Lebanese power stations.
</P>
<P>
   In the rubble of this smoldering Lebanese electricity plant
Friday, I found the remains of the American-made rockets that
destroyed at least $2 million of transformers, installed only four
years ago by the French government.
</P>
<P>
   Fired by the Israelis a few hours earlier, they were Hellfire
air-to-ground missiles, made by Boeing-Lockheed at its plants in
Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Even more extraordinary, however, is the report that the U.S.
ambassador to Tel Aviv intervened on the targeting.
</P>
<P>
   Impeccable diplomatic sources have told The Independent that the
Israelis originally intended to retaliate for Thursday's Hezbollah
rocket attacks across the border by hitting installations belonging
to Syria's 21,000 troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But hours before the air assaults were to begin, these sources
say, Martin Indyck, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, appealed to the
Israelis to spare Syrian targets _ on the basis that their
destruction might make a reopening of Syrian-Israeli peace talks
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Israeli air force instead targeted Lebanese
civilian objectives, including the Bsalim power station.
</P>
<P>
   The report of Indyck's intervention _ and the diplomatic source
is connected to the highest authorities _ is remarkable. That a
U.S. ambassador can, in effect, decide the target of Israel's bombs
is one thing. But Indyck also happens to be the former head of
AIPAC, the most powerful Jewish-Israeli lobby group in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He has frequently intervened in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
but never _ so far as has been recorded _ in Israel's military
adventures in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any doubt about the American missiles. The Israelis
admit they fired five rockets at the Bsalim switching station in
the mountains above Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   I tore the manufacturers' computer coding off one missile
fuselage, whose Lot number was MGP976801. The ``M'' shows it was
once sold by the Boeing company to the U.S. Marine Corps; indeed,
it appears to be part of a batch given to Israel in 1991 as a quid
pro quo for not joining in the Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   One of the same set of Hellfire 114C missiles _ with similar
manufacturers' codes _ was fired by the Israelis into a Lebanese
ambulance in 1996, killing four children and two women.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis destroyed four of the nine electrical transformers
at Bsalim. ``They are leaving the others for later,'' a young power
worker muttered with fury. ``They can hit what they want here. How
can we possibly retaliate?''
</P>
<P>
   Clouds of toxic smoke drifted down from the burned-out
equipment, its power lines dangling impotently, its heavy iron
punctured by rocket holes.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the cynical and preposterous nature of the war in
Lebanon that dates and details become confused _ often deliberately
_ by the protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore important to remember that the staff at the
Bsalim switching station _ which converts 110 into 220 volts after
receiving power from the Lebanese national grid _ saw Israeli
troops stealing maps of the facility from their offices at Bsalim
during Israel's 1982 siege of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, these maps were put to use when the
Israelis staged their first bombing attack on Bsalim after six
Israeli occupation soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon. France
rebuilt the station with Italian equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's early-morning raid followed the Katyusha attacks on the
Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which killed an Israeli soldier and
wounded at least 16 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But these Hezbollah attacks were retaliation for two earlier
Israeli assaults on Lebanese civilians. In the first of these, 16
Lebanese civilians were wounded and in the second two Lebanese
Christian women _ one of them 80 years old _ were killed by an
Israeli shell. Their corpses were found at dawn on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the single exception of the dead Israeli soldier, the
targets of both the Hezbollah and the Israelis were civilian. And
the Bsalim power station was in a Christian area of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the first time that Muslim Hezbollah
guerrillas have retaliated for the deaths of Christian civilians in
Lebanon, traditionally sympathetic to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also badly damaged an electricity switching station at
Badawi outside the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli and attacked
the village of Britel in the Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   When a flurry of Katyushas were again fired over the border
Friday morning, the Israelis air-raided two villages just outside
the United Nations area of operations in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a dangerous, expensive 24 hours of warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars of damage have been caused to Lebanon's
infrastructure, much of the country is without power _ and Israel's
chances of a peaceful withdrawal from southern Lebanon this spring
are further away than ever. &QL;

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BSALIM, LEBANON _ Did the American ambassador to Israel decide
the target of Israel's bombardment of Lebanon Friday? Incredible as
it seems, Martin Indyck's intervention appears to have done just
that.
</P>
<P>
   By urging Israel to suspend a plan to attack Syrian facilities
in Lebanon during its latest attack on the country's civilian
infrastructure, the plea led to the bombing raids _ with
American-made missiles _ on Lebanese power stations.
</P>
<P>
   In the rubble of this smoldering Lebanese electricity plant
Friday, I found the remains of the American-made rockets that
destroyed at least $2 million of transformers, installed only four
years ago by the French government.
</P>
<P>
   Fired by the Israelis a few hours earlier, they were Hellfire
air-to-ground missiles, made by Boeing-Lockheed at its plants in
Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Even more extraordinary, however, is the report that the U.S.
ambassador to Tel Aviv intervened on the targeting.
</P>
<P>
   Impeccable diplomatic sources have told The Independent that the
Israelis originally intended to retaliate for Thursday's Hezbollah
rocket attacks across the border by hitting installations belonging
to Syria's 21,000 troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But hours before the air assaults were to begin, these sources
say, Martin Indyck, the U.S. ambassador to Israel, appealed to the
Israelis to spare Syrian targets _ on the basis that their
destruction might make a reopening of Syrian-Israeli peace talks
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Israeli air force instead targeted Lebanese
civilian objectives, including the Bsalim power station.
</P>
<P>
   The report of Indyck's intervention _ and the diplomatic source
is connected to the highest authorities _ is remarkable. That a
U.S. ambassador can, in effect, decide the target of Israel's bombs
is one thing. But Indyck also happens to be the former head of
AIPAC, the most powerful Jewish-Israeli lobby group in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   He has frequently intervened in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
but never _ so far as has been recorded _ in Israel's military
adventures in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any doubt about the American missiles. The Israelis
admit they fired five rockets at the Bsalim switching station in
the mountains above Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   I tore the manufacturers' computer coding off one missile
fuselage, whose Lot number was MGP976801. The ``M'' shows it was
once sold by the Boeing company to the U.S. Marine Corps; indeed,
it appears to be part of a batch given to Israel in 1991 as a quid
pro quo for not joining in the Gulf War against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   One of the same set of Hellfire 114C missiles _ with similar
manufacturers' codes _ was fired by the Israelis into a Lebanese
ambulance in 1996, killing four children and two women.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis destroyed four of the nine electrical transformers
at Bsalim. ``They are leaving the others for later,'' a young power
worker muttered with fury. ``They can hit what they want here. How
can we possibly retaliate?''
</P>
<P>
   Clouds of toxic smoke drifted down from the burned-out
equipment, its power lines dangling impotently, its heavy iron
punctured by rocket holes.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the cynical and preposterous nature of the war in
Lebanon that dates and details become confused _ often deliberately
_ by the protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   It is therefore important to remember that the staff at the
Bsalim switching station _ which converts 110 into 220 volts after
receiving power from the Lebanese national grid _ saw Israeli
troops stealing maps of the facility from their offices at Bsalim
during Israel's 1982 siege of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, these maps were put to use when the
Israelis staged their first bombing attack on Bsalim after six
Israeli occupation soldiers were killed in southern Lebanon. France
rebuilt the station with Italian equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's early-morning raid followed the Katyusha attacks on the
Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona, which killed an Israeli soldier and
wounded at least 16 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But these Hezbollah attacks were retaliation for two earlier
Israeli assaults on Lebanese civilians. In the first of these, 16
Lebanese civilians were wounded and in the second two Lebanese
Christian women _ one of them 80 years old _ were killed by an
Israeli shell. Their corpses were found at dawn on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the single exception of the dead Israeli soldier, the
targets of both the Hezbollah and the Israelis were civilian. And
the Bsalim power station was in a Christian area of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed to be the first time that Muslim Hezbollah
guerrillas have retaliated for the deaths of Christian civilians in
Lebanon, traditionally sympathetic to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also badly damaged an electricity switching station at
Badawi outside the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli and attacked
the village of Britel in the Bekaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
   When a flurry of Katyushas were again fired over the border
Friday morning, the Israelis air-raided two villages just outside
the United Nations area of operations in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, a dangerous, expensive 24 hours of warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars of damage have been caused to Lebanon's
infrastructure, much of the country is without power _ and Israel's
chances of a peaceful withdrawal from southern Lebanon this spring
are further away than ever. &QL;

GOVERNMENT REJECTS CEASE-FIRE OFFER BY REBELS IN SRI LANKA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Though it is on the defensive militarily,
the Sri Lankan government on Monday night firmly rejected a
separatist Tamil group's offer of a cease-fire in exchange for the
government's promise to withdraw tens of thousands of its troops
from the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who survived an assassination
attempt by a separatist suicide bomber, said in a nationally
televised address Monday evening that the government would stay and
fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The rebel group is
notorious for its suicide attacks and has been labeled a terrorist
organization by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The eye patch that had covered Kumaratunga's eye, injured in the
December assassination attempt, was gone Monday when she calmly
declared, ``We shall leave no room for the LTTE to again fasten
their fascist grip on half a million Tamil people in Jaffna.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kumartunga's decision was a risky one. The Tigers have been
on a stunningly successful military march to reclaim Jaffna, the
cultural capital of the Hindu Tamil-dominated north in this
majority Buddhist Sinhalese nation.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the 18-year civil war _ which has claimed
more than 60,000 lives in a nation with a population no larger than
that of New York state _ the rebels control Elephant Pass, which
the leader of the political opposition has called the doorway to
the fortress of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995 the government has controlled Jaffna, but for five
years before that the Tigers ran what was essentially a separate
state there.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Pass is a narrow strip of land connecting the mainland
to the peninsula and is the site of the most heavily fortified
military base in the country. On April 22, with military moves like
those of a powerful conventional army, the rebels took the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that with the Tigers, who seek a separate Tamil
homeland, in control of the pass, it will be very difficult for the
government to defend Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the government banned political rallies and union
strikes and tightened a vise of press censorship in what it said
was an effort to protect national security but that the opposition
said was an attempt to hide its own failings.
</P>
<P>
   The outlawed Tigers said Monday in a statement issued from their
London office that they are willing to observe a cease-fire once
the government surrenders Jaffna, which the rebels said could open
the way to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels said the government's rejection of the offer could
lead to ``disastrous consequences of heavy military casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a large force of demoralized government troops trapped
on the Jaffna peninsula and hostage to the Tigers have led some
human rights leaders and political officials to hope that India,
the region's great power, would intervene.
</P>
<P>
   India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, met Monday with
the leaders of 20 political parties to discuss the military
conflict in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   India has a much larger Tamil population than Sri Lanka in its
politically potent southern state of Tamil Nadu. And India
supported Sri Lankan Tamil militants, including the Tigers, in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But India worries about stirring nationalist feeling among its
own Tamil citizenry. And both Sri Lanka and India have an interest
in holding together their ethnically and religiously diverse
nations.
</P>
<P>
   So on Monday, India ruled out military intervention, though it
was not clear if it would refuse to assist in evacuating troops. In
the late 1980s, India lost more than 1,000 of its own troops on a
lengthy peacekeeping mission in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The parliamentary affairs minister, Pramod Mahajan, said after
the meeting Monday that India would only consider mediating between
the Tigers and the Sri Lankan government if both sides wanted
Indian help.
</P>
<P>
   The role of mediator had fallen earlier this year to Norway,
which was one of the countries the Tigers had deemed an acceptable
intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the political opposition in Sri Lanka, Ranil
Wickremesinghe, said in an interview Monday night that he believes
Norway and India might work together to try to broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter, personal feuding between Kumaratunga and
Wickremesinghe, who heads the United National Party, has been an
important element in a failed attempt to get the government's peace
plan through Parliament. The opposition party had opposed the
government's attempt to change the constitution to give the Tamils
greater autonomy in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Kumartunga and Wickremesinghe have had their own peace
talks, but any agreement they reach may be overtaken by military
developments that _ up to now _ are tilting in favor of the Tigers.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hits just keep on coming. Baseball is in the
middle of a festival of firepower, a home-run heat wave, and it
shows no sign of ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off on a record pace again for dingers, dongs and
back-back-back backs,'' wrote Sports Illustrated's Leight
Montville. ``The ball is juiced, the strike zone is about the size
of a sheet of Xerox paper, the fences in the new parks are as close
as the kitchen telephone. Everyone is hitting home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 season, when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa punched their
way through the long-standing record of 62 runs in a season,
galvanized the country. But the totals keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   There were 931 home runs in April, a record for the month and
nearly 200 more than last April. There were 980 last May, the most
ever in one month, but there is still plenty of the season left,
and the balls keep flying into the bright summer skies.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport that is almost a branch of numerology, the shift has
been catalogued in minute detail. There were 5,528 HRs last year,
an average of 2.3 per game; this year that average is running at
2.6 per game.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1968, there was an average of 1.38 homers per game. The
records keep falling: last month, 57 homers were shot in one day.
</P>
<P>
   All of this ought to bring joy, one would have thought; there
are few finer things than hearing the bat make contact and then
tracing the ball's arc on its way into the stands, watching the
fans scramble for it.
</P>
<P>
   But the home-run bonanza has longtime fans uneasy, and the
commentators are worried. Baseball (like cricket) is not, to the
cognescenti, a matter of smacking the ball around the park: it is a
game of subtlety, tension, strategy and timing.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball commissioner, Bud Selig, has been publicly sanguine
about the change, which is reshaping the game before his very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just see how this plays out,'' he said last month. ``Of
course we have concerns,'' he told the Associated Press. ``We
always have concerns. But at this stage we're just sitting back and
monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   He has hired two scientists to look at the balls, but that seems
unlikely to yield anything much.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't entirely clear why the runs are stacking up, though
some guesses can be hazarded. The ball parks are getting smaller as
more intimate, old-style stadiums come back into fashion. Then
again, some people believe that the wood used in manufacturing the
bats could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The increased number of teams with expansion may be a factor _
some wonder if there are enough talented pitchers to go around, in
effect _ but it seems more likely that the reasons lie at the other
end of the ball's arc.
</P>
<P>
   The hitters have gotten stronger and better, and that isn't just
evolution. In some cases, the use of dietary supplements and other
chemicals has helped: McGwire admitted to taking androstenedione,
though he later stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me as non-cyclical is that hitters have an
incentive to bulk up _ more weight-training and dietary supplements
_ and there's not a corresponding advantage available to
pitchers,'' said Steve Hirdt of Elias Sports Bureau. ``It doesn't
help them to get much bigger and they can't be throwing
year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been one concrete result from the hitfest, though,
which is clearly negative and a cause for concern. As the balls
come hurtling back, pitchers are getting hit _ some have suffered
broken bones _ and they are getting frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a nasty series of violent incidents as
pitchers have thrown beamers straight at hitters and, on occasion,
punches have been thrown, culminating in a series of brawls between
the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good time for pitchers, there's no doubt,'' the
Dodgers' Kevin Brown said. ``There are a lot of ways to get hurt
out there, the way the ball's flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the game's top tier are winding up the runs to
bring back the fans. If that is true, it is not working. The sport
has not benefited from the batting bonanza in terms of bums on
seats: indeed fan attendance has never recovered from the 1994
labor problems which killed that year's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices have pushed up, so the bank accounts are looking
comfortable in any case.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, as with military technology, things usually
shift between the defensive and the offensive. Just as barbed wire
and machine guns could stop massed infantry, so tanks later
outflanked the static style of warfare that was dominant during the
First World War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the pitcher's mound was reduced and it may be that the
sport's hierarchy decides the advantage has shifted too far. Until
then, the records will tumble. &QL;

WHEN FETAL TESTS WEIGH HEAVY ON PROSPECTIVE PARENTS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1960s, researchers began diagnosing hereditary disorders
by examining the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetuses carried by
pregnant women considered at high risk.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, amniocentesis had become available to women of
advanced maternal age. Now, amniocentesis is routine. In testing,
about three tablespoons of amniotic fluid with discarded fetal
cells are withdrawn from the uterus, cultured in the lab and
inspected for abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Most often amniocentesis gives assurance. About 97 percent of
those having tests find their fetus does not carry any of the
disabilities for which the test is done.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, the tests have left prospective parents with
difficult decisions that generations before never faced. Following
are edited transcripts of interviews with women who used the test
over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   They were interviewed for ``Testing Women, Testing the Fetus:
The Social Impact of Amniocentesis in America'' (Routledge, 1999),
by Dr. Rayna Rapp, a professor of anthropology at the New School
for Social Research. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A PSYCHOLOGIST, 34: When I received that phone call, everything
slowed down. I don't get hysterical, I get methodical under stress.
I didn't flip out until I found myself in the car, going to pick up
my husband, sobbing on the highway. We found out that our fetus had
spina bifida [a neural tube defect caused by an opening in the
spine with mild to severe effects). It showed up in the amniotic
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed everyone I could find: parents, teachers, doctors
and nurses who dealt with spina bifida kids. I wanted to know what
life with a little spina bifida child was like. They were very
upbeat. One nurse made it clear it would be a full-time job, not
easy, but very rewarding, that this child would accomplish a lot.
But the work those families were doing, well, it was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when we could see the hole in his spine, that did me in.
That's when we chose to end the pregnancy. The consequences? Well,
we pulled apart, we had to work back together again.
</P>
<P>
   AN EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATOR, 43: We're always called to
crossroads, they aren't things we seek, they're situations that
befall us. When I found out my baby had Down syndrome, I had to
rely on my daughter, on my mother and my sisters. They saw me
through the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever befalls you, you go on. I'm grateful for the test. I'm
still grieving, but it's better this way.
</P>
<P>
   A LEGAL SECRETARY, 37: I'm not sorry I had the amnio. I don't
believe in abortion; I'm too religious for that. But the test
helped me get my head wrapped around it, that I was having a baby
with Down syndrome. When my doctor told me the news, he wanted me
to have an abortion. But I didn't want that.
</P>
<P>
   I did some research; I visited this group home for adult
retarded people. It was nice. They looked happy, they had jobs,
they went bowling. It really made me think. Stevie's growing up
real nice. Just being with a child like that makes people think. I
believe Stevie was put on earth for some reason: it's not ours to
know. I go along from day to day, marveling at what Stevie
accomplishes.
</P>
<P>
   As long as he's home with me, I don't think he's slow. Now he's
counting to 10, pretty soon, he's bound to be potty-trained. Then
once in a while, I'll take him somewhere with other kids and I
really get slapped in the face. It's different when you have a
different kind of child.
</P>
<P>
   A LAWYER, 42: At my age I'd be foolish _ I think anyone would be
foolish _ not to have an amnio. Some problems can be avoided, and
I'm glad to know my baby is healthy. Plus we now know it's a girl.
I'm just thrilled!
</P>
<P>
   A WAITRESS, 31: Among my cousins, there's a lot of slow
children. Some go to special schools. The family doesn't like to
talk about it. So you can imagine, I was scared when I came up
pregnant. But they told me about this needle test. I took it; it
didn't hurt. I was just a little nervous waiting. And in the end,
the news was so good.
</P>
<P>
   A GENETICS COUNSELOR, 36: So now we know it's a second girl. Oh,
Frank and I are very pleased, but we aren't going to tell our
parents: they can find out after the birth. Now, all they need to
know is that the baby is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   A HOUSE CLEANER, 41: When they told me what the baby would
suffer [an inevitably fatal condition), I decided to abort. But it
was Easter, so I couldn't do it, until after.
</P>
<P>
   A COLLEGE PROFESSOR, 37: They called it ``an error in cell
division.'' It feels like the cells could have a car crash, and
produce this wreckage, and that's the extra chromosome, that's Down
syndrome. And we both knew exactly what we were going to do. I felt
like a minor figure in a major tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   After my abortion, I understood adoption much better. Because it
can't be predicted how your child will be from getting your genes.
And you don't need your kids to be genetic copies; they might be
unlike you anyway. For some, I know it's guilt. For me, it was
astonishment. And overwhelming grief. I feel like I fell off the
edge of this earth. I've been falling through space so long I don't
remember which end is up.Who could possibly understand this?
</P>
<P>
   A WAITRESS, 19: My sister, she can't walk [because of spina
bifida), she can't see. When I got pregnant the first time, I was
very young, 15 _ 16 when I had my baby. I talked with my mother:
she really wanted me to have the tests. I wanted it too; she had
such a cross to bear. Oh, we love my sister, it's just that God
made her special.
</P>
<P>
   I was only concerned if my own baby couldn't walk or talk. The
test wasn't hard, I wasn't worried, I just didn't want my baby to
be like my sister. We're against abortion, so maybe I would have
carried that cross, like my mother did. But then again, it's a case
where I think I would have had an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, my baby didn't have what my sister had, but
they found something else, my son has an extra sex chromosome: They
said he'd be sterile, he might be slow. There's no reason to abort
for that. As it turns out, my son looks normal, he acts normal,
he's learning real well in school.
</P>
<P>
   A NURSE'S AIDE, 47: My doctor was so angry with me: He couldn't
believe I wouldn't take the test when he wanted me to. ``How could
you let this happen?'' he yelled at me, when my baby was born with
Down syndrome. ``You're 40!'' But I think something else: even
though he's mentally retarded, he could be a good person. It's just
like finding out you have a new job. You just do it, and you accept
it, that's all there is to it.

NOVEL INSULTS ISLAM, STUDENT PROTESTERS CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas Monday
to break up a demonstration by students protesting a 17-year-old
novel they said insulted Islam.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the protest Monday morning at Al Azhar
University, the most prestigious Islamic educational institution in
the Middle East, about 2,000 students hurled rocks and insults at
police and chanted ``God is great'' and ``Back to Islam.'' After
several hours of intermittent clashes, the security forces were
able to drive the few hundred remaining protesters into a dormitory
and disperse the rest late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first open violence between government forces and
Muslim fundamentalists in several years. A sometimes bloody Islamic
insurgency against the secular Egyptian government in the early
1990s has largely been subdued, and a huge government crackdown has
put thousands of suspected militants into prison.
</P>
<P>
   Security officials said they had arrested some student
protesters, although the Ministry of Interior refused to say how
many. At the scene, students and a hospital security guard said at
least eight people had been injured by police fire and dozens were
being treated after being overcome by the tear gas, although there
was no independent confirmation of this.
</P>
<P>
   The book that provoked the demonstration, ``Banquet of
Seaweed,'' was written by Haider Haider, a Syrian, and first
published in Cyprus in 1983. The novel then came out in Lebanon in
1992 and in Syria in 1993. Last November, Egypt's Ministry of
Culture reprinted it in connection with a project to promote major
works of modern Arabic literature.
</P>
<P>
   The book drew little public notice until last week, when a Cairo
newspaper long associated with the Islamic fundamentalist movement,
El-Shaab, published what it said were excerpts from Haider's novel
that insulted the prophet Mohammed and Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Several Al Azhar students interviewed at the demonstrations said
they had not read the book _ Egyptian officials have said they
recalled all copies once the controversy over the Haider book
erupted last week _ and knew about it only from the El-Shaab
articles.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his home in Latakia, Syria,
Haider, 64, denounced the campaign against his novel as
``ignorant'' and said that lines from the book were taken out of
context by ``Islamic hardliners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are launching an attack against enlightenment,'' he said.
``They are fighting to take us back to the age of darkness and
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition journalists and politicians have called for the
resignation of the Egyptian minister of culture, Farouk Hosni, over
the past few months over a number of issues, including his proposal
to build a new museum for Egyptian antiquities in Cairo.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hits just keep on coming. Baseball is in the
middle of a festival of firepower, a home-run heat wave, and it
shows no sign of ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're off on a record pace again for dingers, dongs and
back-back-back backs,'' wrote Sports Illustrated's Leight
Montville. ``The ball is juiced, the strike zone is about the size
of a sheet of Xerox paper, the fences in the new parks are as close
as the kitchen telephone. Everyone is hitting home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 season, when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa punched their
way through the long-standing record of 62 runs in a season,
galvanized the country. But the totals keep climbing.
</P>
<P>
   There were 931 home runs in April, a record for the month and
nearly 200 more than last April. There were 980 last May, the most
ever in one month, but there is still plenty of the season left,
and the balls keep flying into the bright summer skies.
</P>
<P>
   In a sport that is almost a branch of numerology, the shift has
been catalogued in minute detail. There were 5,528 HRs last year,
an average of 2.3 per game; this year that average is running at
2.6 per game.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1968, there was an average of 1.38 homers per game. The
records keep falling: last month, 57 homers were shot in one day.
</P>
<P>
   All of this ought to bring joy, one would have thought; there
are few finer things than hearing the bat make contact and then
tracing the ball's arc on its way into the stands, watching the
fans scramble for it.
</P>
<P>
   But the home-run bonanza has longtime fans uneasy, and the
commentators are worried. Baseball (like cricket) is not, to the
cognescenti, a matter of smacking the ball around the park: it is a
game of subtlety, tension, strategy and timing.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball commissioner, Bud Selig, has been publicly sanguine
about the change, which is reshaping the game before his very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just see how this plays out,'' he said last month. ``Of
course we have concerns,'' he told the Associated Press. ``We
always have concerns. But at this stage we're just sitting back and
monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   He has hired two scientists to look at the balls, but that seems
unlikely to yield anything much.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't entirely clear why the runs are stacking up, though
some guesses can be hazarded. The ball parks are getting smaller as
more intimate, old-style stadiums come back into fashion. Then
again, some people believe that the wood used in manufacturing the
bats could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The increased number of teams with expansion may be a factor _
some wonder if there are enough talented pitchers to go around, in
effect _ but it seems more likely that the reasons lie at the other
end of the ball's arc.
</P>
<P>
   The hitters have gotten stronger and better, and that isn't just
evolution. In some cases, the use of dietary supplements and other
chemicals has helped: McGwire admitted to taking androstenedione,
though he later stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me as non-cyclical is that hitters have an
incentive to bulk up _ more weight-training and dietary supplements
_ and there's not a corresponding advantage available to
pitchers,'' said Steve Hirdt of Elias Sports Bureau. ``It doesn't
help them to get much bigger and they can't be throwing
year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been one concrete result from the hitfest, though,
which is clearly negative and a cause for concern. As the balls
come hurtling back, pitchers are getting hit _ some have suffered
broken bones _ and they are getting frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a nasty series of violent incidents as
pitchers have thrown beamers straight at hitters and, on occasion,
punches have been thrown, culminating in a series of brawls between
the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good time for pitchers, there's no doubt,'' the
Dodgers' Kevin Brown said. ``There are a lot of ways to get hurt
out there, the way the ball's flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the game's top tier are winding up the runs to
bring back the fans. If that is true, it is not working. The sport
has not benefited from the batting bonanza in terms of bums on
seats: indeed fan attendance has never recovered from the 1994
labor problems which killed that year's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices have pushed up, so the bank accounts are looking
comfortable in any case.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, as with military technology, things usually
shift between the defensive and the offensive. Just as barbed wire
and machine guns could stop massed infantry, so tanks later
outflanked the static style of warfare that was dominant during the
First World War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the pitcher's mound was reduced and it may be that the
sport's hierarchy decides the advantage has shifted too far. Until
then, the records will tumble. &QL;

FANS STILL BELIEVE IN KENNY ROGERS, WHO'S BACK ATOP COUNTRY CHARTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to Kenny Rogers is like eating your mom's meatloaf. He
is country music's comfort food: You know what you're going to get
every time, and you know you're going to like it.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be the most adventurous meal you've ever had, but it
will fill the tummy and maybe even trigger a childhood/better days
flashback or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't surprise you,'' says Neil Pond, editor of Country
Weekly. ``He's exactly who you think he is. He does what he does
well. I think that line in ``The Gambler'' is really true _ he does
know when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em, and right now he's
holding two big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hits _ the hugely popular ``Buy Me a Rose'' and, before
that, ``The Greatest,'' both from his latest CD, ``She Rides Wild
Horses'' _ have meant a career resurgence of major proportions for
the 61-year-old Houston native who, between 1977 and 1981, was
perhaps the world's most popular male singer.
</P>
<P>
   Long pegged as a musician whose most successful days were behind
him, Rogers has roared back into the mainstream country fray.
Currently at No. 2 on the country singles chart, ``Rose'' is
Rogers' first Top 10 single since ``The Vows Go Unbroken'' hit No.
8 in late 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses'' has sold more than 500,000 copies and peaked at No. 6
on the Billboard country charts; it's currently at No. 11, which
means it's outselling Alan Jackson, Kenny Chesney, LeAnn Rimes and
Reba McEntire.
</P>
<P>
   Penned by Don Schlitz, the man who wrote ``The Gambler,'' ``The
Greatest'' tells the story of a little boy in love with baseball
and the simple joy in believing in himself. It's a cute, sweet
song, one that has received airplay in some ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Rose,'' the CD's second single, has garnered more
interest. The message is pure romantic sentimentality: A wife is
frustrated by her hardworking husband forgetting to do the little
things: buying her a rose, calling from work, opening the door for
her. At the end, the narrative shifts from third to first person
and Rogers, with backing vocals from Alison Krauss and Billy Dean,
promises to do better. ``I'm gonna make things right for the rest
of your life,'' he sings, to the collective sighs of women across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really touched a nerve _ it's made people stop and
listen,'' says Linda O'Brian, music director of KSCS/96.3 FM in
Dallas-Fort Worth. ``You get a lot of men dedicating it to their
wives. They'll say, `She's at home with my two little kids and I
was just thinking of her.' It just nails 'em. It's a very sweet
song, especially if you've been married awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Nashville's WSIX/97.9 FM, like KSCS, has ``Rose'' in heavy
rotation, which means both stations played it about 40 times last
week. O'Brian and WSIX program director Mike Moore agree that the
song is requested by younger, as well as older, people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear stories from listeners,'' Moore says. ``We get calls
from wives who say, `I wish my husband would talk that way' and
calls from husbands who say, `You know, maybe I don't do enough of
the little things for my wife.' We have heard people say it's
helped them reassess their marriages and why they got together in
the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   With covers of Sarah McLachlan's ``I Will Remember You'' and ``I
Can't Make You Love Me'' (a hit for Bonnie Raitt several years
ago), ``Horses'' definitely has its eye on giving Rogers more of a
contemporary sheen.
</P>
<P>
   But it's done so well precisely because it sounds so much like
old Kenny Rogers: the mellow voice and tempo, bed of acoustic
guitar, solid pop hooks and hopeful messages of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This caught a lot of people by surprise,'' says Smokey Rivers,
assistant program director for KPLX/99.5 FM in Dallas-Fort Worth.
``The guy has a track record and he just pops up once in a while,
hits one out of the park. This is a pop song but if you think back
to the '80s, with songs by Anne Murray and others, we haven't had a
lot of those recently, those real nice ballads.''
</P>
<P>
   And in this way, Rogers' age actually helps him: From his cover
of ``Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town'' to ``Islands in the
Stream'' to ``The Gambler,'' his songs were never told from a cocky
kid's point of view. Which means, Pond says, that people feel like
he's an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel like they've grown up with him,'' Pond says. ``He
sings about grown-up topics, and because he's not new and hip and
edgy, he appeals to a settled, more mature crowd, people over 40
who have been bounced around a bit. There's a quality to his fame
and his voice that suggest he's been around the block in love and
life.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's definitely true. Rogers grew up poor in a housing
project, and by age 25 had been married three times. (In 1997, he
married wife No. 5, Wanda, an Atlanta waitress almost exactly half
his age whom he had met in the early '90s.)
</P>
<P>
   He worked with a variety of groups and first found fame in 1968
as part of the First Edition with ``Just Dropped In (To See What
Condition My Condition Was In).'' There would be several more hits
before his 1977 career-making hit ``Lucille,'' which was followed
closely by ``Daytime Friends,'' ``Sweet Music Man,'' ``Love or
Something Like It,'' ``She Believes in Me,'' ``The Gambler,''
``Coward of the County,'' ``Don't Fall in Love With a Dreamer,''
``Love the World Away'' and ``Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1981, Rogers was the most popular artist in country, a
successful TV actor with the CBS movie ``The Gambler,'' a regular
multiple-category winner at the American Music Awards, and very
rich.
</P>
<P>
   The hits never really dried up altogether, but Rogers settled
into a comfortable middle-of-the-road type of stardom, lending his
name to a chain of chicken restaurants, doing TV specials and
movies, touring and releasing several books of photography.
</P>
<P>
   There were also few odd moments along the way. These include
three high-profile liposuction surgeries and, more troubling, the
1992-'93 sex-line scandal: Three women accused Rogers of coaxing
them into high jinks on a private 800 number.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers never denied the conversations, saying at the time that
he was simply disappointed that private conversations between
consenting adults had become public, and the women's case was
tossed.
</P>
<P>
   He recently told London's Daily Telegraph that at the time, he
was going through ``a serious midlife crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had this cloud of guilt over me from that day forward,
and I hate it. ... It was stupid,'' he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But Moore says that many people in the country community think
Rogers handled the sex-line incident well in that he 'fessed up to
some of the allegations and admitted he shouldn't have done what he
did.
</P>
<P>
   And neither this _ nor the well-publicized liposuction
surgeries, nor the cheesiness of the TV movies _ has hurt him with
the fans. If anything, his trials and tribulations and occasional
missteps have made him seem more human, more real.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sentimental, and he's been very public about his weight
and his sex life _ he went on TV and said he did it, and America
got over it very quickly,'' Moore says. ``There's a candor to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also see him singing into his old age, like Frank
Sinatra. Right now, everything's coming together for him. His
career path and his age seem to have led him to this place.''

   The baseball commissioner, Bud Selig, has been publicly sanguine
about the change, which is reshaping the game before his very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just see how this plays out,'' he said last month. ``Of
course we have concerns,'' he told the Associated Press. ``We
always have concerns. But at this stage we're just sitting back and
monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   He has hired two scientists to look at the balls, but that seems
unlikely to yield anything much.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't entirely clear why the runs are stacking up, though
some guesses can be hazarded. The ball parks are getting smaller as
more intimate, old-style stadiums come back into fashion. Then
again, some people believe that the wood used in manufacturing the
bats could make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The increased number of teams with expansion may be a factor _
some wonder if there are enough talented pitchers to go around, in
effect _ but it seems more likely that the reasons lie at the other
end of the ball's arc.
</P>
<P>
   The hitters have gotten stronger and better, and that isn't just
evolution. In some cases, the use of dietary supplements and other
chemicals has helped: McGwire admitted to taking androstenedione,
though he later stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``What strikes me as non-cyclical is that hitters have an
incentive to bulk up _ more weight-training and dietary supplements
_ and there's not a corresponding advantage available to
pitchers,'' said Steve Hirdt of Elias Sports Bureau. ``It doesn't
help them to get much bigger and they can't be throwing
year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been one concrete result from the hitfest, though,
which is clearly negative and a cause for concern. As the balls
come hurtling back, pitchers are getting hit _ some have suffered
broken bones _ and they are getting frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been a nasty series of violent incidents as
pitchers have thrown beamers straight at hitters and, on occasion,
punches have been thrown, culminating in a series of brawls between
the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good time for pitchers, there's no doubt,'' the
Dodgers' Kevin Brown said. ``There are a lot of ways to get hurt
out there, the way the ball's flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that the game's top tier are winding up the runs to
bring back the fans. If that is true, it is not working. The sport
has not benefited from the batting bonanza in terms of bums on
seats: indeed fan attendance has never recovered from the 1994
labor problems which killed that year's World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket prices have pushed up, so the bank accounts are looking
comfortable in any case.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer term, as with military technology, things usually
shift between the defensive and the offensive. Just as barbed wire
and machine guns could stop massed infantry, so tanks later
outflanked the static style of warfare that was dominant during the
First World War.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the pitcher's mound was reduced and it may be that the
sport's hierarchy decides the advantage has shifted too far. Until
then, the records will tumble. &QL;

MICROSOFT SPLIT-UP MEANS MACRO EXPENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Do you think if the Justice Department gets its
way and breaks up Microsoft into separate companies, we'll have
another fiasco like when they broke up Ma Bell? Remember when you
could call one number for service and get help? Now you don't know
who or where to call for your telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   _ All Broken Up
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ALL: It's an unsettling picture all right: Bill Gates
giving you a call just as you sit down to dinner, trying to
convince you to switch operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else the government touches, you can be certain
the Microsoft decision will make life more confusing and expensive.
The latest scheme would break Microsoft into competing companies,
one selling Windows and another selling applications programs, such
as Word or Excel. Great. It's hard enough getting all that stuff to
work together now. I can't wait until the software engineers stop
talking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just got an old computer from work, a Dell
486/66. I am going to give it to my sister to use as a word
processor. The problem is that it's password-protected. Please help
us, Doc. You never know. My sister might go nuts and want me to buy
her a real computer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sister's Keeper
</P>
<P>
   DEAR KEEPER: What do I tell you people about never throwing away
the manuals? Nobody ever pays attention.
</P>
<P>
   Power-on passwords are generally a dumb idea, not because you'll
inevitably forget the secret word, but because they're so easy to
defeat. You should go to support.dell.com for the specific
instructions for your model, but it'll likely be one of two
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   On some models, you can unplug the internal battery for a couple
of minutes, then hook everything back up. The chip that keeps track
of your system specs _ and the password _ will have lost its
memory. Did I mention you should run the setup program first so you
can record the settings? Whoops.
</P>
<P>
   The other possibility involves removing a jumper from the
motherboard, firing up the computer, shutting it down, then
replacing the jumper. Please don't just go pulling jumpers at
random. Find the right one in your documentation or on the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   And, this may seem a little too obvious, but did you ask whoever
had the computer before what the password is? I guess that makes
too much sense, unless you don't want anybody to know you took home
office equipment. Ohhhhh! I get it now. My lips are sealed.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I would like to know if you can set the
computer to turn on at a set time. I work the night shift and would
like to come home and have the machine up and running waiting for
me.
</P>
<P>
   _ No Time to Lose
</P>
<P>
   DEAR NO TIME: Well, I think that's just plain loony. Unless you
can have it make a martini at the same time, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Plug a power strip into one of those timers that don't fool
burglars while you're on vacation. Just make sure it can handle the
wattage. The lawyers made me say that in case your house burns
down.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I think your column is strictly to satisfy your
overrated ego.
</P>
<P>
   _ Disenchanted
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DIS: And it took you this long to figure that out? Say,
were you by any chance the one playing the banjo in
``Deliverance''?

EVEN FOR DIE-HARD FAN, COULD AN ALL-HOCKEY TOUR BE TOO MUCH OF A
GOOD THING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, Horst Wallman and his family enjoy a traditional
sort of vacation _ sunning themselves on the shores of the
Mediterranean. But one week a year for the past eight, Horst, a
strapping insurance salesman with white-blond hair and an earring,
ventures across the Atlantic from his home in Germany. Here, he
travels by bus from city to North American city, from arena to
arena, gorging himself on professional hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Horst tells me this as we walk from our downtown hotel through a
chilling March mist to the Molson Centre, the cavernous new arena
that is home to the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey
League. Horst watches NHL hockey two nights a week in Germany via
satellite dish, he says. The three or four months a year without
hockey are bad for him, causing symptoms of withdrawal. That sort
of obsession is why he comes each year to North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends think I'm crazy,'' Horst says, smiling proudly in
the rain.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't. I know there is a subspecies of humans for whom
hockey is embedded deep in the DNA, because, I, too, am one of
them. So are the nine others who have joined Horst and me on a
strange, weeklong odyssey across eastern Canada and the
Northeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   We will travel by plush tour bus, sometimes for six hours at a
stretch, from the Canadian capital of Ottawa to Montreal, from
Montreal south across the U.S. border to Boston, Boston to New
Jersey via New York City, then back to Montreal. A few hours of
sightseeing will be built into each day. In Boston, for instance, I
will stumble across the grave of Paul Revere. In each city, our
hotels are the finest, the sort of places where bellboys wear caps
and uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   But a great hockey buffet is our purpose, our reward. Each
night, we have splendid seats for a total of five NHL games
involving eight different teams. Each of us has paid about $1,500
(not including airfare) to a Canadian tour group for the privilege.
For me, this trip is work; an editor made me do it. As much as I
love hockey, spending this kind of money for so much hockey seemed
a little excessive.
</P>
<P>
   But something tells me that Horst thinks it's a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   DAY ONE: OTTAWA: A steady drizzle falls the day I land in Ottawa
and though the snow is gone, it is Canadian cold. The route
downtown from the airport traces the Rideau Canal, upon which
locals ice skate to work in the winter. I wonder if they bring
pucks and practice stick-handling along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Our hotel is the Chateau Laurier, an old, castlelike edifice
where the Canadian prime minister lived in the 1930s. With a few
hours until our tour group is to meet, I borrow an umbrella from
the hotel concierge and walk over a bridge and up a hill to the
Parliament building of Canada, a magnificent, century-old edifice.
I pass a huge statue of Queen Elizabeth II on horseback, doubting,
somehow, that Her Majesty still rides. The gothic Peace Tower of
the Parliament building rises majestically into the afternoon murk.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pleasing whiff of nostalgia about all this. I grew up
playing hockey in a small town in northern Minnesota, closer to
Canada than almost anyplace else. I once knew more about Prime
Minister Pierre Trudeau than I did about President Jimmy Carter.
Bob and Doug McKenzie, the beer-swilling hosers from television's
``The Great White North,'' were friends of mine. (Well, not really,
but I went to college with plenty of Canadians just like them.) But
after moving to Texas in 1982, Canada seemed on another continent,
and now I am very happy to be back.
</P>
<P>
   Our tour group convenes in the lobby of our hotel a short time
later. We have been brought together by Roadtrips, a Winnipeg,
Manitoba, tour company. Roadtrips was the brainchild of a man named
David Guenther, who led spring break tours while still in college.
That led to golf weekends, then hockey tours. In business since
1992, Roadtrips is the leader in hockey adventures like ours. But
with the explosion in this kind of travel _ at least half-a-dozen
companies specialize in sports-oriented trips _ the company now
offers trips built around everything from the World Series to
NASCAR races.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, I expect to meet fat cats with nothing better to do
with their time and money, but as far as I can tell, no member of
our group is rich. Instead the group includes a young couple from
Denver, season ticket holders to games of the Colorado Avalanche;
two brothers and a sister from a small town in Minnesota; a young
woman who is an accountant in upstate New York; a retired mechanic
in the Canadian Air Force from Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   And there is Gwen Goryl and her husband, Walt. Gwen grew up in
England, where she played field hockey, taking considerable delight
in whacking her opponents across the ankles with her stick.
Naturally, then, she took passionately to ice hockey when she moved
to the United States in 1961. She settled in New England,
surrounded by fans of the Boston Bruins, so Gwen adopted the
Philadelphia Flyers, just to be contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when we meet, Gwen, a tiny, fiery woman with short blond
hair, is wearing an oversized Flyers jersey. Gwen tells me that she
and her husband, a mild-mannered ex-policeman, joined our hockey
tour from their retirement home near Orlando, Fla., where Gwen
watches several hockey games on television each week. Walt says he
knows better than to disturb his wife while she watches hockey.

LEGAL BATTLE OVER COPYING ON THE WEB SURE TO MOVE BEYOND MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today it is music, but tomorrow the legal battle over copying
information and sharing it via the Internet is virtually certain to
shift to video and software.
</P>
<P>
   While the rock group Metallica is pursuing an Internet service
that it says is facilitating illegal copying of the band's
recordings, the software for reproducing and disseminating
information is evolving rapidly. As a result, a more dramatic
confrontation may be looming over the ability to copy any kind of
digital information _ music, video, software or documents _ freely
and almost instantly, to any location on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America and two musical
acts have sued a Silicon Valley software developer, Napster Inc.,
in an effort to stop computer users from illegally posting and
copying songs over the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other, more powerful software programs are
being created and distributed that will make it far more difficult,
and perhaps impossible, to stop the worldwide sharing of programs,
files or recordings.
</P>
<P>
   The groups and companies pursuing the new technologies _
programs that in effect create vast digital libraries spread across
potentially hundreds of thousands of large and small computers _
range from iMesh, an Israeli start-up company that aspires to
become an international commercial digital distribution system, to
a small group of free software developers intent on building a
global network of computers impervious to censorship.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of these programmers say they have deliberately
set themselves on a collision course with the world's intellectual
property laws and express the hope that the outcome of the clash
over digital copyrights will be a world in which all information is
freely shared. In any case, the new programs have the potential to
change the basic terms of the discussion about intellectual
property.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Clarke, a 23-year-old Irish programmer, is finishing a
program called Freenet that is intended to make it possible to
share any kind of information anonymously while rendering it
virtually impossible to remove the information from the Internet
once it is placed there.
</P>
<P>
   The first version of Freenet was posted on the World Wide Web in
March. Clarke, who lives in London and is employed as a programmer
by a small electronic commerce firm, said last week in a telephone
interview that there had been more than 15,000 downloads of the
early versions of his product, indicating that hundreds or perhaps
thousands of network servers on the World Wide Web were already
running the program.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is confident that corporations trying to develop
complex technologies to encrypt information or otherwise halt the
free sharing of computer data will ultimately fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have two words for these companies: Give up,'' he said.
``There is no way they are going to stop these technologies. They
are trying to plug holes in a dam that is about to burst.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude, plus the fact that millions of users have come to
rely on easy access to digital information via the Internet,
suggests that the issue may quickly outstrip the current debate
over copyright infringement between the recording industry
association and a variety of Internet music distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no shortage of gray hairs from worrying about these
programs,'' said Talal Shamoon, a Silicon Valley executive who
heads the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a technology and
entertainment industry working group.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts believe that the intellectual property laws
are being used in an effort to grapple with technologies they were
never intended to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copyright law is not the right tool in the case of many of the
new technologies,'' said Pamela Samuelson, a digital technology and
copyright expert at the School of Law at the University of
California at Berkeley. ``The question will quickly become whether
other governments have reasons to try to regulate these new systems
or whether the U.S. government has the ability to regulate them.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, law enforcement officials are only beginning to wrestle
with the implications of new technologies that will permit the
anonymous, instant, global distribution of information of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously looking at all of these,'' said Christopher
Painter, deputy chief of the Justice Department's computer crime
and intellectual property section. ``It makes our job more
difficult and makes it harder to find the people who are
perpetrating crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Freenet, which Clarke conceived while he was an undergraduate at
the University of Edinburgh, is intended to function without any
centralized control point. ``Freenet is a near-perfect anarchy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Internet digital distribution program, Gnutella, created
by software developers at America Online's Nullsoft subsidiary, has
the same distribution approach employed by Freenet, meaning there
is no central directory of what information the system contains.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Napster, which is limited to digital music files,
Gnutella makes it possible to distribute video, software and text
documents as well.
</P>
<P>
   America Online declared Gnutella an ``unauthorized freelance
project'' in March, just hours after it was made available on the
Internet. But since it was developed under an ``open source''
programming approach, independent programmers have continued to
refine Gnutella even though the project was officially canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Many computer industry executives contend that if the recording
industry's suit against Napster succeeds, it will simply lead
digital music enthusiasts to use alternatives, like Gnutella and
Freenet, which are even less open to copyright enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``So are all the musicians and record companies going to
continue their suits against Napster?'' a Gnutella user who
identified himself as Panicst8 wrote in a recent network posting.
``It seems kind of pointless or have they just not figured out yet
that Gnutella is about 10,000 times more effective at locating what
you want?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Freenet goes several steps beyond Gnutella in an effort to
protect the anonymity of those who publish or copy information
electronically. It encrypts the piece of data and scrambles the key
to its location within the system. That means not even the
operators of individual servers know whether something is on their
disks. And Freenet incorporates a digital ``immune system'' that
responds to any effort to determine the location of a piece of
information by spreading the information to other nodes of the
network.
</P>
<P>
   Freenet relies on a system of volunteers who run the program on
network computers, or servers, Clarke said, and it will even be
difficult for the operators of individual servers, or ``nodes,'' to
determine which computer holds any particular file.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Freenet will move information over the Internet in
such a way that the most popular data is also the most widely
distributed. In the future, he said, if a piece of information that
is popular in one country, like Britain, becomes popular in another
country, like the United States, the information will be relocated
to use the Internet more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this whole thing catches on, I think that people will look
back in 20 to 40 years and look at the idea that you can own
information in the same way as gold or real estate in the same way
we look at witch burning today,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   For technologists like Shamoon, systems like Freenet present a
challenge, but not an insurmountable one. In addition to his
industry role with the Secure Digital Music Initiative, Shamoon is
senior vice president for media at the InterTrust Technologies
Corp., a Silicon Valley company that builds systems for protecting
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the possibility of the transmission of viruses and
other harmful programs as being one of the obvious risks inherent
in communities where no basis for trust exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a trust standpoint, the current generation of tools such
as Gnutella and Freenet is a nightmare for the same reason that
badly constructed social communities are a nightmare,'' Shamoon
said. The recording industry will survive, he argues, if it is able
to offer its users new things of value.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of dangers here,'' he said. ``But as a
society, we're very adept at adapting to compensate for these
things.''

UNDATED: watches hockey. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We pile onto our tour bus and arrive at the arena to watch the
Ottawa Senators and Philadelphia Flyers warm up. At first,
Philadelphia clearly dominates, peppering shots at the Ottawa
goaltender, Tom Barrasso, who flops around on the ice like a walrus
at Sea World. But Philadelphia leads by only one goal as the game
enters the final period. Then the Flyers' goalie, an aging fellow
named John Vanbiesbrouck, allows an easy game-tying goal. The
Flyers eventually lose, 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Back on the bus after the game, I notice Gwen staring out the
window, her face pinched into a tight frown. I am tempted to hurl
some gentle ribbing in her direction, but she anticipates me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even start,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   DAY TWO: MONTREAL: At times over the week, we watch movies
(''The Waterboy,'' ``The Mummy'') to pass time on the road. But
mostly we sleep, or look out the windows, or talk hockey. I mean
really talk hockey, down to the ridiculous minutia common to, say,
fantasy baseball league owners. This is how Jeff Wills and I occupy
most of the two-hour bus ride from Ottawa to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff is the tour guide for Roadtrips. He is a smart, happy young
guy who left his small hometown in northern Ontario to get a
business degree. But his years as a hockey player and die-hard
hockey fan are probably more important credentials for his current
job.
</P>
<P>
   As we discuss the NHL playoffs, bus driver Brian Beaucamp calls
out over his shoulder, ``Get out your passports, we're leaving the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Brian was only kidding. We were merely crossing the
provincial boundary from Ontario into Quebec. Quebec only wishes it
were a separate country, a country where the people would speak
only French. For generations, Quebecers have fought the pollution
of their culture by English-speakers. I think this a bit quaint,
tantamount to Cajuns wanting to secede from Louisiana. But in
Quebec, blood has been spilled over the issue. As we near Montreal,
I strain to recall my two years of high school French 25 years ago.
I remember how to count to 10, and say, ``merci beaucoup.'' I doubt
that will suffice.
</P>
<P>
   But at our hotel, when the bellboy says ``Bonjour,'' I say
``Bonjour'' in reply, feeling quite cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   After check-in, our group walks a few blocks to the Molson
Centre, where a pert guide named Denise gives us a tour of the
arena in heavily-accented English. This is sacred ground for a
hockey fan, because the Montreal Canadiens are this country's
equivalent of the New York Yankees, winners of 24 Stanley Cups.
Denise leads us to the team's Hall of Fame, a hushed, dimly lit
place that contains the busts of legends like Bernie ``Boom Boom''
Geofrion; Maurice ``The Rocket'' Richard; Jacques Plante and Jean
Beliveau, names that would mean nothing to the average Texan. But
these are hockey's Ruths, its Gehrigs, its DiMaggios.
</P>
<P>
   I am stirred to be reminded how integral hockey is to the
Northern culture, a ritual passed down over many generations. In
Texas, by comparison, despite the success of the Stars, hockey
still seems like a novelty, entertainment a notch or two above pro
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   With a few hours to kill, I walk the bustling, rain-slickened
streets of downtown Montreal. All the women look like Celine Dion,
who was born here. All the men look like Celine's middle-aged
husband, Rene Angelil. This is a city of great cathedrals and Old
World charm, but also of the boutiques, bookstores and strip joints
that crowd each other along St. Catherines Avenue. I turn from St.
Catherines onto Crescent Street, pass the Hard Rock Cafe, and step
into a Russian restaurant that offers wild boar, which I had never
eaten. (I have now. It tastes like roast beef.)
</P>
<P>
   The Molson Centre is packed for the game between the Canadiens
and Boston Bruins. I have a spectacular seat, center ice about 10
rows up. Three young men sit next to me during the game, jabbering
in French and getting very drunk. In front of us sits a row of
brave supporters of the Bruins, dressed in the jackets and jerseys
of the opposition. Among them is a middle-aged man with a
salt-and-pepper pompadour and a nasty overbite.
</P>
<P>
   After each goal by the Canadiens, one of the drunk guys next to
me ruthlessly taunts the Boston fan, screaming in French and
putting his fingers to his mouth, imitating walrus tusks.
</P>
<P>
   This is terribly bad form, I think. Yet I'm happy when the
Canadiens score in the last minute to win the game. Thousands of
French-speaking men and women pour happily from the arena into a
frigid night, just as they have here for a century, and walking
with them, I feel a part of something old, something substantial.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   DAY THREE: BOSTON: Somewhere in upstate New York, Jeff Wills
tells me about a man and woman who met during last year's East
Coast NHL tour. One thing led to another. When they returned to
their respective homes in Canada, they tried a long-distance
romance, but it ended after a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found out hockey was all they had in common,'' Jeff says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else is there?'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   We pass Fenway Park and unload at our hotel in the Back Bay
section of Boston, a city I've never seen. I'm told the arena is a
long walk across downtown, so I set out down Boylston Street,
passing the enormous Boston Public Library and churches dating to
Colonial times. The late afternoon is bright and warm, and several
young people toss a Frisbee on Boston Common, a massive green-space
reminiscent of New York's Central Park. On the other side of the
Common, tucked into the shadows of several brownstone buildings, is
a tiny cemetery. Tablet-sized gravestones tilt precariously in the
Old Granary Burial Ground, as if a strong wind would blow them over
altogether. Much of the writing on the headstones has eroded in the
330 years since the first person was buried here, but I manage to
find Paul Revere's resting place, and the graves of Ben Franklin's
parents. The body of John Hancock is here, too, buried near four
victims of the Boston Massacre.

UNDATED: the Boston Massacre. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston is like that, a history lesson on every corner, and I
begin to resent the approach of tonight's hockey game, which
intrudes on my time for sightseeing. I stand beneath the balcony of
the Old State House, where the Declaration of Independence was
first read, and pass the Old South Meeting House where Benjamin
Franklin was baptized.
</P>
<P>
   At the arena, I burn up a roll of film taking ice-level
photographs of the St. Louis Blues warming up, hoping to prove to
my son that I am not making this up. The Blues defeat the Bruins in
a close game. As I file out of the arena, I realize an NHL game
every night in an interesting new city is beginning to seem normal.
On my long hike back to the hotel, the dome of the Massachusetts
State House blazes over the darkened Boston Common. Later, I learn
the dome was cast by Paul Revere.

   DAY FOUR: NEW YORK/NEW JERSEY: Our bus motors past Yankee
Stadium, then churns down Second Avenue through the bustling
streets of Harlem, then to Mid-town. As we step out in front of
Madison Square Garden, Walt Goryl goes to find a hot dog from a
sidewalk vendor, for this seems the thing to do in New York. The
faces of the Heglund siblings from Minnesota betray a mixture of
incredulity and terror.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people and tall buildings make me dizzy,'' says Leslie
Heglund, a legal secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Our now-weary group shuffles along a guided,
behind-the-scenes-tour of Madison Square Garden, and the Heglunds
snap some photos when the Empire State Building appears through a
window. I find the Garden tour unspectacular. For me, the highlight
is a size-18 basketball shoe left in a locker room by one of the
New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's back on the bus, through the Lincoln Tunnel to a
barren expanse of New Jersey _ tonight's destination. The arena of
the New Jersey Devils is located here, for some reason, and as we
drive to the game, we see the lights of Manhattan teasing us to the
East. I wish I was in Times Square, not in another arena, which,
unlike baseball parks, all look more or less the same on the
inside. The Devils trounce the Atlanta Thrashers as we watch. Maybe
my mother was right. There can be too much of a good thing. Even
hockey.

<P>
   DAY FIVE: MONTREAL: The most satisfying moments of the trip come
on the last day. In the afternoon, after we cross the St. Lawrence
River back into Montreal, I stroll around Old Montreal, its narrow
streets and spectacularly old buildings. I step inside the Notre
Dame Basilica, the massive, neo-gothic church where hundreds of
votive candles flicker, where the wall behind the altar is
illuminated a brilliant blue, where stained-glass windows depict
moments of Montreal's religious history dating to the 1600s. I
eavesdrop on a tour leader, who says Celine Dion was married here.
</P>
<P>
   At the Molson Centre, a plump lady sings the American national
anthem, then ``O Canada,'' before the Canadiens game with the
Buffalo Sabres. The Canadiens must win this game to make the
playoffs, and the buildup has continued in the newspapers and bars
all week. As the respective anthems are finished, I think I have
never heard a hockey venue as loud as this one. All the ghosts of
Montreal's hockey past seem to be lurking.
</P>
<P>
   But another legend plays tonight for the Sabres. He is Dominik
Hasek, the goaltender called the Dominator, who rejects one
Canadiens shot after another. When Buffalo scores to take the lead,
a stout older man who has been up and down in his seat the entire
game says something to me in French. I dig deep into my memories of
high school language class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Je ne parle pas francais, monsieur,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   So he speaks to me in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want the Canadiens to win?'' he asks me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I need to leave and go to the bar,'' he says. ``Every
time I sit here, the Canadiens lose.''
</P>
<P>
   He shuffles past me and storms out of the arena.
</P>
<P>
   But Hasek is impenetrable, and the Canadiens lose anyway. The
crowd shuffles into the cold Canadian night, quietly, as if after a
funeral. I share their dour mood, but for a different reason. Their
team won't make the playoffs, but my hockey buffet is over, and I
have plenty of room for dessert. I'm with Horst. At $1,500, this
trip was a bargain.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ed Moose knew the cell-phone craze had gone too
far when one customer at his trendy San Francisco restaurant picked
up the phone to talk to another customer sitting at the other end
of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the first instance of such behavior to hit this
city _ capital, after all, of the world digital revolution. Moose
knew of other restaurants where three or four customers at a single
table would be deep in conversation, not with each other but with
their separate interlocuters on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   This was more than Moose could stand, so he took action. He was
sick of the constant chirping emanating from the bowels of
handbags, the sight of customers gesticulating into empty space
with one hand while clamping the other to their right ear, so he
decided to ban cell phones from his establishment altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it coming and I wanted to stop it before it became
bad,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Moose's restaurant is a hot spot for the movers
and shakers of San Francisco's political and media worlds, many of
whom like to wear mobiles on their hip just like gunfighters with
their weapons in the Old West; the cellular crowd has now been
banished to the pavement, along with that other group of
Californian outcasts, the smokers.
</P>
<P>
   And Moose's establishment is hardly alone in taking a stand.
Several other restaurants in San Francisco, and in Silicon Valley
an hour's drive to the south, have already taken similar steps.
</P>
<P>
   Golf clubs, country clubs, San Francisco's celebrated ACT
theatre, the Museum of Modern Art, even a Silicon Valley branch of
Alcoholics Anonymous have all told mobile-phone users to switch off
or get lost.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pressure is increasing to ban cell-phone use in cars
_ there has already been one attempt to push legislation through
the state assembly and another attempt may not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   At least one host on San Francisco's public radio station, KQED,
has told listeners he won't take their calls if they are in their
cars and moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a total backlash going on,'' said Carolanne Lynch, bar
manager at Dine, a restaurant in San Francisco's so-called
Multimedia Gulch area where everyone has a cell phone but nobody is
allowed to use them any more.
</P>
<P>
   If the backlash is beginning in San Francisco (there is nothing
comparable going on even in Los Angeles, 400 miles to the south),
it is partly because it is the epicenter of cell-phone use in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 15 percent of America's 90 million mobile
subscribers are in California, and well over half of those are in
the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   But it also speaks to San Francisco's rebellious nature and the
deep social divisions that the dot.com revolution has created.
</P>
<P>
   Only in a city as contrary as San Francisco would the mayor,
Willie Brown, declare his undying hatred of mobile phones and even
claim not to have one. (The claim has been skeptically received,
but the point is well taken).
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times this one guy's goddamn cell phone went off,''
Brown fumed last week following a much-interrupted press conference
on affordable housing. ``I think the state of California has got to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   His erstwhile challenger for the mayoralty, the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors' president, Tom Ammiano, would agree. He has
stipulated that people attending his meetings do as he does and
switch their mobiles off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rude. It's self-centered and somewhat pretentious, I'd
say,'' Ammiano said. ``Particularly annoying are the little musical
numbers. I really don't want to hear `Row row row your boat' when
we're taking testimony about someone being evicted. It trivializes
the whole democratic process of a committee or board meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudeness isn't the only problem. Mobiles cause traffic accidents
and, as a result, cost the city money it resents having to spend.
</P>
<P>
   One intersection where a mobile-wielding driver killed a
pedestrian recently has been kitted out with special smart lights
that flash on the asphalt when a pedestrian steps onto the
crossing.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights were inaugurated last month, Brown made sure he
was there to lord over the proceedings. In San Francisco, embracing
hi-tech lights is good politics; whipping out a mobile _ in the
street, in your car, over lunch _ has become a big no-no. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ A struggling new musical, ``The Wild Party,''
received seven nominations, including one for best musical; a
mother and daughter were pitted against each other in a
leading-actress category; and two actors who alternate roles in
``True West'' wound up competitors when the Tony Award nominations
were announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nine days ago, ``The Wild Party,'' which opened last month to
mixed reviews after a version by the Manhattan Theater Club ended
its run, was selling at just 50 percent capacity. Some people
expected it to close if it was not nominated for best musical. But
its seven nominations, only one less than for the acclaimed revival
of ``The Music Man,'' have given it a new lease on life, at least
until the awards are announced on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really fabulous,'' said George Wolfe, the director and
a co-producer of ``The Wild Party,'' who wrote the musical with
Michael John LaChiusa. ``It's the Broadway community embracing new
work.''
</P>
<P>
   LaChiusa, who also wrote ``Marie Christine,'' had a big day
Monday, with both of his shows drawing nominations for best book
for a musical and best original score, although neither has been a
hit. ``Marie Christine'' closed in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiss Me Kate'' led the nominations, announced at Sardi's
restaurant, with 12 nods in categories from best musical revival to
best orchestration.
</P>
<P>
   The Tony nominations pointed up the increasingly gray area of
what constitutes a new musical these days, given that the three
shows nominated with ``Wild Party'' in the best musical category
defy conventional definitions. They are ``Contact,'' a dance play
performed to recorded music whose eligibility has prompted protest
from the musicians union, Local 802; ``James Joyce's `The Dead,'''
a play with parlor songs that recently closed; and ``Swing!,'' a
dance show. ``Aida,'' a more traditional musical, was not nominated
for best musical, although it received five other nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The races that promise to be particularly close are for best
play, best revival of a musical and best performance by a leading
actor in a play. In the best play category, the acclaimed
production of Michael Frayn's ``Copenhagen'' will compete with
``Dirty Blonde'' by Claudia Shear; Sam Shepard's ``True West,''
which successfully lobbied for consideration as a new play although
it was previously produced off Broadway in 1980 and 1982; and ``The
Ride Down Mount Morgan'' by Arthur Miller, which recently earned
attention when its star, Patrick Stewart, complained from the stage
about what he considered inadequate promotion by its producers, the
Shubert Organization. Stewart was not nominated.
</P>
<P>
   The race for musical revival has heated up since ``The Music
Man'' opened on April 27, creating head-to-head competition with
``Kiss Me, Kate,'' which opened in the fall. The two musicals are
also vying for awards for best performance by a leading actor in a
musical (Brian Stokes Mitchell for ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and Craig
Bierko for ``The Music Man'') and for best performance by a leading
actress in a musical (Rebecca Luker for ``The Music Man'' versus
Marin Mazzie for ``Kiss Me, Kate'').
</P>
<P>
   The competition for best actor is complicated by the nominations
of both Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly for their
performances in ``True West,'' despite efforts by the play's
producers to have the actors, who alternate roles every three
performances, considered jointly as one candidate. The two actors
are up against Gabriel Byrne for ``A Moon for the Misbegotten;''
Stephen Dillane for ``The Real Thing''; and David Suchet for
``Amadeus,'' all of whom received strong reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's nominations for the Tony Awards, which are presented by
the American Theater Wing and the League of American Theaters and
Producers, found some shows competing against themselves. For best
performance by a featured actress in a musical, for example, Laura
Benanti and Ann Hampton Callaway were nominated from ``Swing!,''
and Deborah Yates and Karen Ziemba were nominated from ``Contact.''
Also in that category was Eartha Kitt, nominated for ``The Wild
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kevin Chamberlain and Bob Stillman of ``Dirty
Blonde'' are competing against each other for best performance by a
featured actor in a play.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stroman will be competing against herself for best
direction of a musical and for best choreography, having been
nominated in both categories for both ``Contact'' and ``The Music
Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The director Michael Blakemore also received two nominations,
though in different categories, one for ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and one
for ``Copenhagen.'' The last time this happened was 10 years ago,
also to Blakemore, although he won for neither his direction of the
musical ``City of Angels'' nor of the play ``Lettice and Lovage.''
</P>
<P>
   For best actress in a play, Rosemary Harris, nominated for
``Waiting in the Wings,'' is competing with her daughter, Jennifer
Ehle, nominated for ``The Real Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Two musicals that have closed each received five nominations:
``James Joyce's `The Dead''' and ``Marie Christine.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John was nominated for the ``Aida'' score and the show
received three other nominations (for its star, Heather Headley,
and for Bob Crowley for its scenery and for Natasha Katz for
lighting ). Julie Taymor's ``The Green Bird'' received only two
nominations, one for best costumes (Constance Hoffman) and one for
best performance by a featured actor in a play (Derek Smith).
</P>
<P>
   The first hour of design and creative awards will be broadcast
on PBS on June 4 at 8 p.m. The remaining two hours will be
broadcast on CBS from Radio City Music Hall with Rosie O'Donnell as
host.

 By JAMES J. CRAMER  
 c.2000 TheStreet.com  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something very old-fashioned, almost Sam Walton-like, is
happening on the Web and I like it: The value-added notion is
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to when you first heard of the Web. For me, it was
because of Amazon. I love books. I love libraries. But I'm also
very lazy about my leisure time. If I have free time, I want to
spend it with my wife and kids, not shopping or looking for books.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon was perfect for me because I could research and order
books when everyone else was asleep, so I didn't waste time.
Frankly, I was immune to cost; time is my most precious asset and
Amazon gave me that. It was a value-added proposition.
</P>
<P>
   My second experience with the Web was with Yahoo! I always
wanted to find out what the news was on Reuters. I could pay $1,400
a month for a Reuters feed. But on Yahoo! Finance, I got the same
feed for free. More value-added.
</P>
<P>
   Then I fell in love with Motley Fool and the idea of people
interacting to help each other make money. It later got a bit
corrupted -- what hasn't been when it comes to chat? -- but I loved
the community sense of it. True value-added.
</P>
<P>
   But then all heck broke lose. People forgot the value-added
proposition. They began to create companies that didn't need to
exist in order to bring the company public, which was a giant
branding event. Most of these companies were simply catalogues in
disguise. In fact, they weren't as good as catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   True, there would be exceptions. I like the sites that match
buyers with sellers nationally, eBay and priceline and HotJobs
being the best examples. They have value-added.
</P>
<P>
   But online sporting goods? Online shoes? Online suits? Online
pants? Online groceries? Where is the real value-added there?
Aren't these just 800 phone lines? And how come many of these Web
sites had to go into catalogues anyway? What's the deal with that?
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of this process will be pretty easy to name, soon.
All you have to do is ask if they have a value-added that can't be
produced by an 800 line or a catalogue. If they do, maybe they'll
make it, but if they don't, forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the reason it's so hard to get value-added out of the
Web is because the Web culture is free. TheStreet.com has been
about as successful as anyone charging for the Web, and yet people
scorn us as fools to charge for value-added, as if value-added has
to be given away on the Web even though it would be expensive in
print.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about this because of something that happened last
week. I was on a New Media panel hosted by New York Magazine and
Industry Standard, and someone asked if there was anything still
investible out there on the Web, particularly in content.
</P>
<P>
   I immediately spoke proudly of an investment I made personally
and for my firm, in Powerful Media. (You may have seen the
advertising for it as Inside.com. I am writing regularly for it
when it gets underway shortly.)
</P>
<P>
   John Huey, our moderator and the editor of Fortune, immediately
whacked me on the head with E-Business, his new magazine, which, I
can tell from the welt it left, will be a huge commercial success.
Ton of advertising in it. John pointed out that I am friends with
the guys behind Powerful Media. To which I responded that you don't
give friends a couple of million bucks if you think they're going
to lose it for you.
</P>
<P>
   It was all done in jest. But I did want to point out at that
session that the reason I'm investing in Powerful Media is that
it's an intensely value-added product, the first of what I call the
next generation of Web periodicals designed to blow away the
off-line competition.
</P>
<P>
   Inside.com is not a newspaper. It doesn't aspire to that. It
doesn't aspire to be a newsletter, either. It doesn't aspire to be
Variety or Hollywood Reporter, two very expensive publications that
will be outdated the moment they come off the presses because of
Inside.com.
</P>
<P>
   Inside.com reminds me of one of my favorite movies, ``Desk
Set.'' In it, Katherine Hepburn runs this group of people who know
everything and can answer anything, until they are replaced by a
fumbling, stupid computer. This piece of Luddite celluloid is
pretty much on the mark. Computers have continually let us down as
a source of information because, in the end, they are programmed by
humans.
</P>
<P>
   If Tracy had brought in Inside.com instead of that clunking
piece of hardware, Hepburn would have had to quit.
</P>

<P>
   Something very old-fashioned, almost Sam Walton-like, is
happening on the Web and I like it: The value-added notion is
coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to when you first heard of the Web. For me, it was
because of Amazon. I love books. I love libraries. But I'm also
very lazy about my leisure time. If I have free time, I want to
spend it with my wife and kids, not shopping or looking for books.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon was perfect for me because I could research and order
books when everyone else was asleep, so I didn't waste time.
Frankly, I was immune to cost; time is my most precious asset and
Amazon gave me that. It was a value-added proposition.
</P>
<P>
   My second experience with the Web was with Yahoo! I always
wanted to find out what the news was on Reuters. I could pay $1,400
a month for a Reuters feed. But on Yahoo! Finance, I got the same
feed for free. More value-added.
</P>
<P>
   Then I fell in love with Motley Fool and the idea of people
interacting to help each other make money. It later got a bit
corrupted -- what hasn't been when it comes to chat? -- but I loved
the community sense of it. True value-added.
</P>
<P>
   But then all heck broke lose. People forgot the value-added
proposition. They began to create companies that didn't need to
exist in order to bring the company public, which was a giant
branding event. Most of these companies were simply catalogues in
disguise. In fact, they weren't as good as catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   True, there would be exceptions. I like the sites that match
buyers with sellers nationally, eBay and priceline and HotJobs
being the best examples. They have value-added.
</P>
<P>
   But online sporting goods? Online shoes? Online suits? Online
pants? Online groceries? Where is the real value-added there?
Aren't these just 800 phone lines? And how come many of these Web
sites had to go into catalogues anyway? What's the deal with that?
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of this process will be pretty easy to name, soon.
All you have to do is ask if they have a value-added that can't be
produced by an 800 line or a catalogue. If they do, maybe they'll
make it, but if they don't, forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the reason it's so hard to get value-added out of the
Web is because the Web culture is free. TheStreet.com has been
about as successful as anyone charging for the Web, and yet people
scorn us as fools to charge for value-added, as if value-added has
to be given away on the Web even though it would be expensive in
print.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about this because of something that happened last
week. I was on a New Media panel hosted by New York Magazine and
Industry Standard, and someone asked if there was anything still
investible out there on the Web, particularly in content.
</P>
<P>
   I immediately spoke proudly of an investment I made personally
and for my firm, in Powerful Media. (You may have seen the
advertising for it as Inside.com. I am writing regularly for it
when it gets underway shortly.)
</P>
<P>
   John Huey, our moderator and the editor of Fortune, immediately
whacked me on the head with E-Business, his new magazine, which, I
can tell from the welt it left, will be a huge commercial success.
Ton of advertising in it. John pointed out that I am friends with
the guys behind Powerful Media. To which I responded that you don't
give friends a couple of million bucks if you think they're going
to lose it for you.
</P>
<P>
   It was all done in jest. But I did want to point out at that
session that the reason I'm investing in Powerful Media is that
it's an intensely value-added product, the first of what I call the
next generation of Web periodicals designed to blow away the
off-line competition.
</P>
<P>
   Inside.com is not a newspaper. It doesn't aspire to that. It
doesn't aspire to be a newsletter, either. It doesn't aspire to be
Variety or Hollywood Reporter, two very expensive publications that
will be outdated the moment they come off the presses because of
Inside.com.
</P>
<P>
   Inside.com reminds me of one of my favorite movies, ``Desk
Set.'' In it, Katherine Hepburn runs this group of people who know
everything and can answer anything, until they are replaced by a
fumbling, stupid computer. This piece of Luddite celluloid is
pretty much on the mark. Computers have continually let us down as
a source of information because, in the end, they are programmed by
humans.
</P>
<P>
   If Tracy had brought in Inside.com instead of that clunking
piece of hardware, Hepburn would have had to quit.
</P>
<P>
   Because this service is so value-added, and can answer so many
questions and inquiries in real time, the notion of not paying for
it, simply because it's on the Web, seems totally harebrained.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Inside.com is that it gives you tons of
information for free that others now pay a ton to get. It does it
to get you in. When you see the paid stuff, you will want that,
too. To me, that's Yahoo! meets AOL.
</P>
<P>
   While I'm ranting, let me add one other thought: If you really
think that nobody will ever pay for something on the Web when that
same something is available only for big bucks off-line, and the
Web product is speedier and better, I think you'll be proven very
wrong, very shortly.
</P>
<P>
   I know that's an out-of-favor position. But, believe me,
companies that come public now are going to have to have more going

ROY JONES JR. IS BEGINNING TO THINK OF LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Roy Jones Jr. shuffles forward and throws a few
pillowy jabs unworthy of his reputation as pound for pound the
world's best fighter. Early in a recent sparring session, at his
warehouse gym hidden in a local industrial park, he looked
uninterested, unmotivated, almost bored.
</P>
<P>
   One word altered his mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showtime,'' Alton Merkerson, head coach in the Jones camp,
said from outside the ropes midway through the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Jones quickly changed personas, snapping his lethal double jab
at will and smoothly moving his opponent around the ring. The pop
of his punches suddenly matched the volume of the rap music blaring
from the stereo system.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, boxing's undisputed light heavyweight champion
can still summon his vast talents on command. Yet at 31, despite
his success, Jones finds himself in a midcareer crisis and
wondering what challenges remain inside the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm smarter than I've ever been, but not as sharp as I've ever
been,'' Jones says. ``It'll take a lot of mental work and
motivation to get me as sharp as I was. It'll take some bigger
fights and tougher opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Jones meets Richard Hall for the World Boxing
Association light heavyweight championship in Indianapolis. Hall's
record (24-1, 23 knockouts) would seemingly make this one of Jones'
tougher title defenses. But Jones calls it a business fight, which
will be his last on Home Box Office. His contract with the cable
network then calls for him to make one more pay-per-view
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Hall, Jones doesn't see much ahead for himself among
light heavyweight contenders. Jones said he was seriously
considering moving up to the heavyweight division. He has already
scouted a potential opponent, too: Lennox Lewis, the 6-foot-5-inch,
247-pound heavyweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm touching 190 pounds right now,'' Jones said, grinning
slyly. ``I never used to get that high. One more pound, and hello
heavyweights.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding Lewis, Jones said: ``If he got to where no one would
beat him, if Tyson or anybody else can't do it, I'd step up and
take my shot. As a true champion, I can't turn it down. I know he'd
feel the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People think he'd run right over me,'' Jones continued. ``It
won't happen that way. I like Lennox. I respect him as a champion
because he'll fight anybody. He's good, but he can be beat. He's
big, he's strong, but he wears down quick. He takes punches on the
chin just like everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd be hell to beat, and hard to get to, but I'd sure try.''
</P>
<P>
   A bout between Lewis and the 6-foot Jones sounds more like a
promoter's fantasy than a fighter's reality. But during an hourlong
interview at his rented home on Sarasota Bay and later at his
training site, Jones was serious about a future fight with Lewis. .
</P>
<P>
   Depending on his fight schedule in the spring, he sets up camp
here in order to play for the Gulf Coast SunDogs of the U.S.
Basketball League. One of six co-owners of the team, Jones is also
the starting point guard.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the workout, Jones had pulled into the
Manatee Community College parking lot and emerged from a white
Cadillac DeVille already wearing his gold and purple SunDogs
uniform. He played three consecutive games last week, averaging two
points and about 32 minutes of hustle in victories over Washington,
Long Island and Kansas, arriving for warmups at the Hal Chasey
Gymnasium about 90 minutes after his boxing workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Tired or not, Jones blends easily into the offense; he is a
passing guard, not a scoring threat, and plays decent defense,
spending most of his time jockeying in the low post against
opponents several inches taller than him. Even if he wasn't a
co-owner, he would be good enough to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball keeps my mind working,'' Jones said. ``It keeps me
wanting to improve. I do the intangibles. I tip the ball. I do all
the little things. That's my role. I love it. I don't get that
tired sparring.''
</P>
<P>
   As in his five previous USBL seasons, Jones figures he won't
miss more than two of the SunDogs' 30 games, including one the
night of the Hall fight. He always shows up for practices and
shoot-arounds. After fighting Hall on Saturday in Indianapolis, he
plans to rejoin the team Monday night for a game against the Long
Island Surf in West Hempstead, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, fear of a hand or other injury has never affected
Jones' dedication to playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why be scared of that?'' Jones said. ``If it ain't broke, I'm
still fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Jones played a USBL game in Jacksonville and defended
his title that same night. Another time, he worked out for nine
rounds in Sarasota, boarded his Lear jet and flew to Atlantic City,
played 42 minutes and returned immediately after the game so he
could train the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   At the recent Boxing Writers Association dinner in Manhattan,
Jones accepted his award as Boxer of the Decade for the '90s,
arrived back here at 3 a.m. and was the first player at the
SunDogs' 10 a.m. practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's unbelievable,'' said Sundogs coach Rex Morgan, who is
also a part owner of the team. ``When he gives you a commitment, he
stands by it. Sometimes after heavy sparring, his hands swell up
and hurts his shot, but he still plays. He's gotten a lot better,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Basketball doesn't substitute for roadwork in Jones' training
regimen. If anything, the game helps him more with hand-eye
coordination. Mostly, he plays because it doesn't feed his ego. In
that sense, Jones compared himself to Michael Jordan, who allowed
himself to be humbled by baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``In boxing, most guys are too arrogant. They always want to
think they're the best,'' Jones said. ``I don't want that. I'm not
big on pride like that. My pride shows up in boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   At a crossroads inside and outside the ring, Jones prepares for
another title defense against another No. 1 contender. Like the
others, Hall is not given much of a chance to win simply because
he's fighting Roy Jones Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Jones said: ``There's always somebody out there. People just
don't see it because they're comparing them to me. But they're out
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard. Everybody's out to beat you. Last year, some people
thought Reggie Johnson beat me _ that got me going a little bit.
But there's not many of those anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ring, responding to Merkerson's call for ``Showtime,''
Jones began firing more heated combinations that forced his
partner, the light heavyweight Billy Lewis, to back off and
regroup. As Jones heated up, the others working out in the gym
followed his lead. Between rounds, Jones ordered the compact disc
changed to DMX's ``The Kennel,'' a song with a hauntingly deep bass
and monotone refrain:
</P>
<P>
   One more road to cross
</P>
<P>
   One more risk to take
</P>
<P>
   Gotta live my life
</P>
<P>
   Like there's one more move to make.
</P>
<P>
   Jones nodded approval, apparently motivated enough for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm dominant; I'm on top,'' he said. ``I want to
take advantage of me. I want to take what God gave me and use it to
the fullest. I can't duck behind nobody because I call my shots. I
got it set up that way. Me and my ego have come this far together,
and it's gonna stay that way. That way, you never run out of
challenges.'' &QL;

 &HT;    The Internet has spawned dozens of travel sites, but that hasn't
diminished the ambitions of book publishers. Just witness the
hundreds of new travel guides that have arrived in time for the
summer travel season. Here's a selection.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet, long the bible for backpackers, has covered two
of the most popular destinations in the United States. ``Las
Vegas,'' by Scott Doggett (Lonely Planet, 2000; $15.95), has tips
on how to play the ``Great Room-Rate Game'' and get a better deal
at hotels. There's advice on choosing the best of the legendary
hotel buffets. And there are reviews of every major show, from the
illusionists Siegfried &AMP; Roy (``the hottest ticket in town'') to
``Mystere,'' which features Cirque du Soleil performers. If the
guide saves readers a few extra bucks for the blackjack table, it's
probably worth buying.
 &HT;    Hawaii is the other destination that Lonely Planet is focusing
on. ``Oahu,'' by Ned Friary and Glenda Bendure (Lonely Planet,
2000; $14.95), evaluates the hotels and restaurants on Waikiki, but
also opens up the rest of this oft-overlooked island for visitors.
 &HT;    The hidden side of Hawaii is also the subject of ``Diving &AMP;
Snorkeling in Hawaii,'' by Casey &AMP; Astrid Witte Mahaney (Lonely
Planet, 2000; $17.95), which covers all the islands.
 &HT;    Fodor's ``Around Los Angeles with Kids'' by Lisa Oppenheimer
(Fodor's, 2000; $10), and ``Around New York City with Kids,'' by
Mindy Bailin (Fodor's 2000; $10), are pocket-sized guides that fit
perfectly in a glove compartment, purse or backpack.
 &HT;    Each one features 68 activities for parents and kids and is
written by a local parent. The organization is terrific: no more
than two pages per activity, suggestions for ``Kid-Friendly Eats''
and enough facts to keep short attention spans intrigued. There are
similar guides for Chicago, San Francisco and Washington D.C.
 &HT;    ``Rome &AMP; the Heart of Italy,'' by Dana Facaros and Michael Pauls
(Cadogan, 2000; $17.95), devotes barely two well-chosen pages to
Roman hotels; double that for restaurants. But it does what Cadogan
guides do best: It provides a real sense of history, written in a
highly readable style.
 &HT;    This is the guide to take along while wandering through the
Forum and the Coliseum during this Jubilee Year. It also covers the
surrounding area of Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise for those who want to
venture a bit farther.
 &HT;    Dorling Kindersley Travel Planners are something new from the
publishers who brought out the much-acclaimed Eyewitness Travel
Guides. They come in a cardboard folder and include a heavily
detailed and annotated map as well as a slim ``Index-Gazetteer &AMP;
Survival Guide.''
 &HT;    The maps include notations of major sights, city highlights,
walks and entertainment venues. The idea, presumably, is that after
reading about a destination in an Eyewitness guide, all one really
needs are these detailed destination maps. They're priced at $9.95,
and they currently include such destinations as ``Florida,''
``Great Britain &AMP; Ireland'' and ``Spain.''
 &HT;    For those who really like to travel light, Cognoscenti MapGuides
are the size of a folded road map, with a detailed street map on
one side and essential information on hotels, restaurants,
nightlife and entertainment elsewhere.
 &HT;    The ``Cognoscenti New York City'' (Cognoscenti, 2000; $7.95) has
broken down restaurant and hotel suggestions by neighborhood. It
mentions Caffe Regio for authentic espresso in the Village and
Sylvia's Soul Food Restaurant as a Harlem landmark. It also gives
capsule descriptions for the best museums in New York, from the
Pierpont Morgan Library to the Frick Collection.
 &HT;    In truth, there's enough information here to keep a visitor
happy for a very long weekend. And best of all, the weight is
negligible. Other cities covered include London, Paris, Rome and
Washington D.C.
 &HT;    Signpost Guides is a new series from Thomas Cook Publishing that
refer to themselves as a ``Driving Guide for the Independent
Traveler.'' That they are, with detailed maps and ratings for
beaches, architecture, scenery and children's activities, along
with loads of colorful photographs. There are just enough
recommendations for accommodation and dining in each area.
 &HT;    The writing tends to be informed and gently opinionated. If
there's a criticism to be levied, it's that the guides tend to
spread themselves a little too thin when covering larger areas such
as British Columbia, California or New England.
 &HT;    The regional guides, such as ``Catalonia and the Spanish
Pyrenees,'' by Tony Kelly (Thomas Cook Publishing/Globe Pequot
Press, 2000; $22.95) and ``The Dordogne and Western France,'' by
Eric and Ruth Bailey (Thomas Cook Publishing/Globe Pequot Press,
2000; $22.95) are the standouts in the series.
 &HT;    Mountain Bike America is another new series, this one from
Outside America and Globe Pequot Press. These guides are aimed at
both beginners and true devotees of the sport. They're written by
local cyclists, with very detailed maps, difficulty ratings and
photographs to get even the most sedentary riders jazzed.
 &HT;    ``Mountain Bike America Colorado,'' by Stephen Hlawaty (Outside
America/ Globe Pequot, 2000; $17.95), comes in at 433 pages, with
49 well-mapped trail rides and, best of all, ``The Great Escape:
Telluride to Moab Hut to Hut.'' This seven-day trip from Colorado
to Utah might be considered the Holy Grail for mountain bikers.
 &HT;    Other guides in this series focus on Boston, New
Hampshire/Maine, Moab and Philadelphia. So saddle up.

 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The Internet has spawned dozens of travel sites, but that hasn't
diminished the ambitions of book publishers. Just witness the
hundreds of new travel guides that have arrived in time for the
summer travel season. Here's a selection.
 &HT;    Lonely Planet, long the bible for backpackers, has covered two
of the most popular destinations in the United States. ``Las
Vegas,'' by Scott Doggett (Lonely Planet, 2000; $15.95), has tips
on how to play the ``Great Room-Rate Game'' and get a better deal
at hotels. There's advice on choosing the best of the legendary
hotel buffets. And there are reviews of every major show, from the
illusionists Siegfried &AMP; Roy (``the hottest ticket in town'') to
``Mystere,'' which features Cirque du Soleil performers. If the
guide saves readers a few extra bucks for the blackjack table, it's
probably worth buying.
 &HT;    Hawaii is the other destination that Lonely Planet is focusing
on. ``Oahu,'' by Ned Friary and Glenda Bendure (Lonely Planet,

``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By ADELE MALOTT  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When Perry G. headed to sea with his teen-age daughter and
70-something parents in tow, he wondered what had possessed him to
think that four people who have nothing in common except familial
genes and a bit of history could enjoy each other's company during
a weeklong cruise.
 &HT;    Although the personalities involved ranged from Type-A adult to
teen-age cynic, the quartet's patience and creativity helped make
the trip memorable.
 &HT;    Today's family travel options feature cruise-ship quarters,
hotel suites, tot-size meals, budget-stretching ticket options and
kid-proof adventures, such as white-water rafting for all ages.
 &HT;    Some locations cater to trouble-free family reunions. Some trips
are crafted especially for grandparents and their grandchildren who
live far apart and who use summer vacations to keep in touch. And
the family-travel business is booming _ nearly half the adults in
the United States took at least one child on a trip in the past
five years, and 16 percent brought their grandchildren.
 &HT;    Like Perry G., the Shaver family also booked a cruise. Two
mature travelers and their granddaughter explored the Pacific from
Tahiti to Los Angeles aboard the Golden Princess (800-774-6237 or
www.princess.com) with stops at locations such as Bora-Bora,
Moorea, Papeete and Honolulu. As the Shavers describe it, ``Our
10-year-old, who tended to confuse Tahiti with Tasmania, became an
expert on South Pacific geography.''
 &HT;    Between stops, the Shavers made use of many of the ship's
services, including Kidville, the ship's youth center that is
staffed by counselors and that operates from 9 a.m. to midnight
daily, and a full-scale, no-charge laundromat. Princess has added a
Junior Cruiser menu in their ship's 24-hour restaurants.
 &HT;    The Beasly family, whose four generations range in age from 3 to
83, traveled throughout the American West for 10 days on a reunion
trip that was developed for them by Maupintour's Special Groups
Department (800-255-4266 or www.maupintour.com). The Beaslys met in
Salt Lake City and moved from one national park or monument to the
next _ from Yellowstone to Mt. Rushmore, with its lighting show,
and then on to Cody, Wyo., for the rodeo and a float trip on the
Shoshone River.
 &HT;    For several years, Warren River Expeditions (800-765-0421 or
www.raftidaho.com) has offered a one-week trip on the Salmon River
exclusively for grandparents and their grandchildren. Other
outfitters in Idaho offer trips that range in length from three
hours on the Boise River to multiday expeditions on the Salmon
River.
 &HT;    One of the most popular places for intergenerational travel is
in and around Orlando, Fla., which is home to Walt Disney World.
There, Holiday Inn SunSpree Resort (800-366-6299 or
www.kidsuites.com) in Lake Buena Vista pioneered its Kidsuites, an
idea now adopted by other hotels. Kidsuites give kids their own
space, their own entertainment and their own beds in rooms that
reflect different fun themes, such as outer space, magic castles,
forts and tree houses. The play area sleeps two to four children
and comes equipped with its own TV, VCR and Nintendo.
 &HT;    With so many choices for multigenerational travel, it's best to
consult a travel professional who can find a trip that matches you
family's interests or who will create a trip just for your group.
Who knows _ as your adventure comes to close, you may hear your
little ones express their delight in the same way the Shavers'
10-year-old grandchild did: ``This trip has been fabulous, and a
lot of other words I can't spell. I will remember it my whole
entire life.''
 &HT;    WARNING: When traveling with your grandchildren, don't forget to
take proper legal documents that will allow you to deal with any
unexpected medical problems and that prove you have the parents'
permission to have the children in your custody.
 &HT;    Here are some ideas for summer travels with your grandkids.
 &HT;    
 VAIL GRANDKID PACKAGE  
 &HT;    The Sonnenalp Resort of Vail is offering a Summer 2000
Grandparent-Child package from June 15 to 24 that includes five
nights' lodging, a fondue dinner at the Swiss Chalet, a Bully Ranch
dinner, daily breakfasts and ``fun coupons.'' The coupons may be
redeemed for activities such as river rafting, jeep tours, guided
fishing excursions and horse-trail rides.
 &HT;    Or adults in need of a well-deserved ``timeout'' can use a
coupon for selected spa treatments while their children amuse
themselves by joining one of the free KidVentures programs, from
panning for gold, to alpine sliding, to hiking or swimming.
 &HT;    The package is priced at $2,675 for two grandparents and one
child age 12 or younger, provided the child stays in the
grandparents' room. The package is also available from April 23 to
June 15 and from Sept. 24 to Nov. 22 for the lower price of $1,809.
 &HT;    For more information, call (800) 654-8312, or visit
www.sonnenalp.com on the Web.
 &HT;    
 ALABAMA SPACE CAMP  
 &HT;    Space Camp in Huntsville, Ala., is a five-day program in which
``cadets'' engage in activities related to space science, from
flying a multi-axis trainer to guiding a shuttle into space.
 &HT;    For grandparents who want to explore Alabama on their own for a
few days, Space Camp (800-637-7223) offers hands-on programs for
youngsters _ $699 for children ages 9 to 11; $799 for those ages 12
to 14. There are also grandparent- or parent-child weekends for
$658 per pair, provided the child is between the ages of 7 and 11.
 &HT;    Space-camp programs run every weekend in spring and summer and
during selected weekends during the fall and winter.
 &HT;    
 EUROPEAN GRANDTRAVEL  
 &HT;    Grandtravel, a tour company that specializes in
intergenerational tours, will showcase the history and tradition of
London and the artistry and elegance of Paris in a 10-day, two-city
tour that combines learning and fun. Six departures are scheduled
starting June 20.
 &HT;    The tour begins in London, and then moves to Paris via the
high-speed Eurostar train. The cost: $5,360 per adult, $5,175 per
child. Grandtravel programs are developed by teams of teachers,
leisure counselors and psychologists and include counseling for
participants prior to departures.
 &HT;    Another tour _ a 15-day exploration of the French countryside,
from Paris to Nice _ departs June 16 and July 7. The former is for
children ages 12 to 17, the latter for children of all ages. The
cost: $7,695 for adults, $7,590 for children.
 &HT;    For more information, call (800) 247-7651, or visit
www.grandtravel.com on the Web.
 &HT;    
 CAMP SNOOPY KIDS  
 &HT;    Radisson Resort at Knott's Berry Farm has a package that is sure
to enthrall the kids _ a night in an elaborate Peanuts-themed
double room, along with breakfast, full day admission to the park
and amenities, such as vouchers for in-park Snoopy Kids Meals and
snacks. The $249 rate (tax excluded) is for two adults and two
children under 12. For more information, call (800) 333-3333, or
visit www.radisson.com on the Web.

forts and tree houses. The play area sleeps two to four children
and comes equipped with its own TV, VCR and Nintendo.
 &HT;    With so many choices for multigenerational travel, it's best to
consult a travel professional who can find a trip that matches you
family's interests or who will create a trip just for your group.
Who knows _ as your adventure comes to close, you may hear your
little ones express their delight in the same way the Shavers'
10-year-old grandchild did: ``This trip has been fabulous, and a
lot of other words I can't spell. I will remember it my whole
entire life.''
 &HT;    WARNING: When traveling with your grandchildren, don't forget to
take proper legal documents that will allow you to deal with any
unexpected medical problems and that prove you have the parents'
permission to have the children in your custody.
 &HT;    Here are some ideas for summer travels with your grandkids.
 &HT;    
 VAIL GRANDKID PACKAGE  
 &HT;    The Sonnenalp Resort of Vail is offering a Summer 2000
Grandparent-Child package from June 15 to 24 that includes five
nights' lodging, a fondue dinner at the Swiss Chalet, a Bully Ranch
dinner, daily breakfasts and ``fun coupons.'' The coupons may be
redeemed for activities such as river rafting, jeep tours, guided
fishing excursions and horse-trail rides.
 &HT;    Or adults in need of a well-deserved ``timeout'' can use a
coupon for selected spa treatments while their children amuse
themselves by joining one of the free KidVentures programs, from
panning for gold, to alpine sliding, to hiking or swimming.
 &HT;    The package is priced at $2,675 for two grandparents and one
child age 12 or younger, provided the child stays in the
grandparents' room. The package is also available from April 23 to
June 15 and from Sept. 24 to Nov. 22 for the lower price of $1,809.
 &HT;    For more information, call (800) 654-8312, or visit

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The temperature in New York City soared past 90 degrees Monday
for the second consecutive day as sunshine and breezes from the
west brought midsummer heat to the region. The unseasonable warmth
will persist Tuesday as daytime readings near record levels.
Noticeably cooler conditions will cover eastern New England as a
front slipping south from Canada delivers chillier air.
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms will erupt in the middle Mississippi Valley
and southwestern lakes as a jet stream disturbance intercepts a
flow of humid air from the Gulf States. The storms will produce
heavy rain, hail and isolated tornados. The risk for flooding will
be heightened in areas recently affected by heavy rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Cool and unsettled weather will cover the Northwest while the
Southwest deserts stay sunny and hot.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WILD FLUCTUATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend the temperature in Boston fluctuated wildly as the
city teetered between midsummer heat and the chill of early spring.
On Saturday, the temperature tumbled from a midnight reading of 70
degrees to the lower 50s in the afternoon as ocean-chilled air
arrived from the east. On Sunday, the temperature jumped from 68 to
89 degrees between 2 and 4 p.m. The 21-degree climb occurred as a
strengthening wind from the west sent the ocean-chilled air back to
sea. Tuesday, a front will waver across eastern New England,
setting the stage for another rapid temperature change in Boston. &QL;

ULSTER PROTESTANTS WAGE A LIBEL SUIT IN WASHINGTON
</HEADLINE>
  By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington is the odd arena for a $100 million libel trial in
which two car dealers from Northern Ireland are challenging a small
Colorado publisher and an author who accused them of participation
in a secret ruling committee of Protestant terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the dispute is Sean McPhilemy's book
``Committee: Political Assassination in Northern Ireland,''
published in 1998 by Roberts Rinehart. British publishers, who
operate under much tougher libel laws than those in the United
States, declined to issue the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Committee'' grew out of a 1991 British documentary
produced by McPhilemy, who says that an influential group of about
60 middle-class Protestant business professionals in County Armagh
forged links in the 1980s with British special police forces and
Unionist paramilitary group, bankrolling a terrorist campaign that
led to nearly 60 killings of Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers David and Albert Wesley Prentice are among the
businessmen cited by McPhilemy. They are pressing their libel claim
against McPhilemy and Roberts Rinehart, a press near Boulder,
Colo., that says it has stopped publishing new books partly because
of trouble obtaining loans with a lawsuit clouding its future.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed in Washington because McPhilemy heavily
promoted the book there, said William W. Taylor, the attorney for
the businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The Prentice brothers and their relatives are expected to
testify. So is McPhilemy, who lives in England, and Frederick R.
Rinehart, a founder of the press and the scion of an old-line New
York publishing family that once was part of Holt, Rinehart &AMP;
Winston.
</P>
<P>
   Jury selection is expected to start Tuesday in the trial, which
is being heard by Washington Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Alprin.
The witness lists for both sides indicate that the jury may soon be
presented with a crash course in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   McPhilemy's defense lawyers have listed 40 witnesses, among them
Harold Evans, the former Random House publisher and former editor
of The Sunday Times of London, and Colin Wallace, the former press
officer for the British army in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The witness list for the Prentice brothers includes some 40
names, including David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist
party in Northern Ireland, who testified earlier this year in a
libel case in London arising from the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, McPhilemy won a libel suit that he filed against
The Sunday Times of London for describing his documentary on a
secret ruling committee as a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   For his documentary and book McPhilemy relied heavily on
information provided by a Unionist supporter, James Alfred Sands,
who was the only direct witness to provide the producers with taped
descriptions of the committee's structure, meeting locations and
members.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Sands has changed his statements several times,
recanting and then reversing himself. He has told journalists that
he would testify in the libel trial, but it is unclear whether
either side will risk calling him.
</P>
<P>
   McPhilemy's lawyers said that they intended to argue that the
author balanced his portrayal of the Prentices by including a
blanket denial from everyone accused of committee involvement,
along with information about a Royal Ulster Constabulary
investigation that absolved them. Sands will also figure in the
defense because the lawyers contend that the paperback version of
the book appeared after Sands disavowed his recantation and offered
fresh details about the Prentices last May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envy the jury on this case,'' said Jack Holland, the
author of five books about Northern Ireland and a correspondent for
The Irish Echo, the New York-based weekly. Holland elicited Sands'
most recent comments, in which he said he offered information to
McPhilemy as a joke. ``It's going to be hard for anyone to sort out
the tangled history. Plus the interpretation of that tangled
history is going to be warped by political agendas.''

&HT;     SAN ANTONIO LOOKS TO HELP DOMINICAN REPUBLIC; WIN PAN AMERICAN
GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JERRY BRIGGS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Organizers of San Antonio's bid for the 2007 Pan
American Games are ready to give a boost to the Dominican Republic,
which plays host to the event in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Antonio Flores, executive director of the San Antonio bid
team, wants to do all he can to make certain the Games in Santo
Domingo rate as a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for them to be as successful as they can be,''
Flores said. ``If they don't reach their potential, then it can't
be as great a hemispheric occasion as we want it to be for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores plans to explore ways to provide assistance to the
Dominican Republic, which was ravaged by Hurricane Georges in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he believes it might be possible to solicit U.S.
companies that could advise Dominican officials on
telecommunications, public safety or on the effort to organize
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Solidarity between nations in the Western Hemisphere, Flores
said, is the ``buzzword'' after the Pan American Sports
Organization (PASO) meetings in Costa Rica last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're laying out strategy for continued contact with (PASO
officials) and identifying programs for solidarity with other
nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flores and Susan Blackwood, executive director of the San
Antonio Sports Foundation, will attend meetings of national sports
officials in Brazil at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings of the Association of National Olympic Committees
will convene in Rio de Janeiro the week of May 22.
</P>
<P>
   Rio de Janeiro and San Antonio have been announced as bidders
for the 2007 Games. Guadalajara, Mexico, one of the finalists for
2003, also is widely believed to be interested.

Y CHROMOSOME BEARS WITNESS TO STORY OF THE JEWISH DIASPORA 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a new technique based on the male or Y chromosome,
biologists have traced the diaspora of Jewish populations from the
dispersals that began in 586 B.C. to the modern communities of
Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis provides genetic witness that these communities
have, to a remarkable extent, retained their biological identity
separate from their host populations, evidence of relatively little
intermarriage or conversion into Judaism over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Another finding, paradoxical but unsurprising, is that by the
yardstick of the Y chromosome, the world's Jewish communities
closely resemble not only each other but also Palestinians, Syrians
and Lebanese, suggesting that all are descended from a common
ancestral population that inhabited the Middle East some four
thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence H. Schiffman, chairman of the department of Hebrew
and Judaic Studies at New York University, said the study fit with
historical evidence that Jews originated in the Near East and with
biblical evidence suggesting that there were a variety of families
and types in the original population. He said the finding would
cause ``a lot of discussion of the relationship of scientific
evidence to the manner in which we evaluate long-held academic and
personal religious positions,'' like the question of who is a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in Tuesday's Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, was conducted by Dr. Michael Hammer of the
University of Arizona with colleagues in the United States, Italy,
Israel, England and South Africa. The results accord with Jewish
history and tradition and refute theories like those holding that
Jewish communities consist mostly of converts from other faiths, or
that they are descended from the Khazars, a medieval Turkish tribe
that adopted Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by Hammer and colleagues is based on the Y
chromosome, which is passed unchanged from father to son. Early in
human evolution, all but one of the Y chromosomes were lost as
their owners had no children or only daughters, so that all Y
chromosomes today are descended from that of a single genetic Adam
who is estimated to have lived about 140,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, all men should therefore carry the identical
sequence of DNA letters on their Y chromosomes, but in fact
occasional misspellings have occurred, and because each misspelling
is then repeated in subsequent generations, the branching lineages
of errors form a family tree rooted in the original Adam.
</P>
<P>
   These variant spellings are in DNA that is not involved in the
genes and therefore has no effect on the body. But the type and
abundance of the lineages in each population serve as genetic
signature by which to compare different populations.
</P>
<P>
   Based on these variations, Hammer identified 19 variations in
the Y chromosome family tree. The ancestral Middle East population
from which both Arabs and Jews are descended was a mixture of men
from eight of these lineages.
</P>
<P>
   Among major contributors to the ancestral Arab-Jewish population
were men who carried what Hammer calls the ``Med'' lineage. This Y
chromosome is found all round the Mediterranean and in Europe and
may have been spread by the Neolithic inventors of agriculture or
perhaps by the voyages of sea-going people like the Phoenicians.
</P>
<P>
   Another lineage common in the ancestral Arab-Jewish gene pool is
found among today's Ethiopians and may have reached the Middle East
by men who traveled down the Nile. But present-day Ethiopian Jews
lack some of the other lineages found in Jewish communities, and
overall are more like non-Jewish Ethiopians than other Jewish
populations, at least in terms of their Y chromosome lineage
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The ancestral pattern of lineages is recognizable in today's
Arab and Jewish populations, but is distinct from that of European
populations and both groups differ widely from sub-Saharan
Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Each Arab and Jewish community has its own flavor of the
ancestral pattern, reflecting their different genetic histories.
Roman Jews have a pattern quite similar to that of Ashkenazis, the
Jewish community of Eastern Europe. Hammer said the finding
accorded with the hypothesis that Roman Jews were the ancestors of
the Ashkenazis.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Ashkenazi Jews' long residence in Europe, their Y
signature has remained distinct from that of non-Jewish Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   On the assumption that there have been 80 generations since the
founding of the Ashkenazi population, Hammer and colleagues
calculate that the rate of genetic admixture with Europeans has
been less than half a percent per generation.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish law tracing back almost 2,000 years states that Jewish
affiliation is determined by maternal ancestry, so the Y chromosome
study addresses the question of how much non-Jewish men may have
contributed to Jewish genetic diversity. Hammer was surprised to
find how little that contribution was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that wherever Jews were, they were very much
isolated,'' he said. The close genetic affinity between Jews and
Arabs, at least by the Y chromosome yardstick, is reflected in the
Genesis account of how Abraham fathered Ishmael by his wife's maid
Hagar and, when Sarah was then able to conceive, Isaac. Although
Muslims have a different version of the story, they regard Abraham
and Ishmael, or Ismail, as patriarchs just as Jews do Abraham and
Isaac.

&HT;     KIDS TO GET CHANCE FOR MOCK BALLOTING IN THIS FALL'S ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new group called Youth-e-Vote announced Monday
that it will offer schoolchildren across the country a chance to
take part in online mock balloting for president, governor and
members of Congress this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more important to our system of government than the
active and informed participation of today's youth,'' said Joseph
Mohen, chief executive officer of election.com, a Garden City,
N.Y.-based online voting company that is providing its technology
free of charge to the youth-vote project.
</P>
<P>
   ``By exposing students to the political process at a young age
Youth-e-Vote (will help) turn the tide of the so-called voter
apathy in this country,'' Mohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Youth-e-Vote will mail all U.S. schools information seeking to
encourage them to register for the student vote on its Web site,
www.youthevote.net. The group is also trying to provide Internet
access for schools currently without online capabilities so their
students can vote.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters will ballot on the Youth-e-Vote Web site between Oct.
23 and Nov. 2. Results will be available the day voting ends. Every
registered school will provide pupils with passwords to ensure one
vote per student.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating the youth-vote effort is Doug Bailey, founder and
publisher of the political newsletter Hotline and president of the
Freedomchannel.com political Web site. ``We will work as hard as we
know how for geographic, income and ethnic balance among
participating schools,'' Bailey said. ``No school that wants in
will be left out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes the online vote will encourage more young
people to become interested in politics and that the students who
vote online will urge their parents to vote in the real election.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential election about half of all registered
voters went to the polls, and fewer than a third of citizens aged
18 to 24 voted.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey cautioned that the children's vote should not be used to
predict the outcome of the real election.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Jarvis, a communications professor at George Washington
University here, said the youth vote will provide a good test for
online balloting because the so-called ``digital divide'' between
the wealthy and the poor in terms of access to technology is
smaller among young people than among older groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis heads Youth-e-Vote's efforts to connect more schools to
the Internet by soliciting donations of money and computers from
local companies.
</P>
<P>
   She said that because youngsters are less likely than older
people to be afraid of new technology, the students will more
comfortable voting online.

&HT;     KIDS TO GET CHANCE FOR MOCK BALLOTING IN THIS FALL'S ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new group called Youth-e-Vote announced Monday
that it will offer schoolchildren across the country a chance to
take part in online mock balloting for president, governor and
members of Congress this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more important to our system of government than the
active and informed participation of today's youth,'' said Joseph
Mohen, chief executive officer of election.com, a Garden City,
N.Y.-based online voting company that is providing its technology
free of charge to the youth-vote project.
</P>
<P>
   ``By exposing students to the political process at a young age
Youth-e-Vote (will help) turn the tide of the so-called voter
apathy in this country,'' Mohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Youth-e-Vote will mail all U.S. schools information seeking to
encourage them to register for the student vote on its Web site,
www.youthevote.net. The group is also trying to provide Internet
access for schools currently without online capabilities so their
students can vote.
</P>
<P>
   Youngsters will ballot on the Youth-e-Vote Web site between Oct.
23 and Nov. 2. Results will be available the day voting ends. Every
registered school will provide pupils with passwords to ensure one
vote per student.
</P>
<P>
   Coordinating the youth-vote effort is Doug Bailey, founder and
publisher of the political newsletter Hotline and president of the
Freedomchannel.com political Web site. ``We will work as hard as we
know how for geographic, income and ethnic balance among
participating schools,'' Bailey said. ``No school that wants in
will be left out.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes the online vote will encourage more young
people to become interested in politics and that the students who
vote online will urge their parents to vote in the real election.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential election about half of all registered
voters went to the polls, and fewer than a third of citizens aged
18 to 24 voted.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey cautioned that the children's vote should not be used to
predict the outcome of the real election.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Jarvis, a communications professor at George Washington
University here, said the youth vote will provide a good test for
online balloting because the so-called ``digital divide'' between
the wealthy and the poor in terms of access to technology is
smaller among young people than among older groups.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis heads Youth-e-Vote's efforts to connect more schools to
the Internet by soliciting donations of money and computers from
local companies.
</P>
<P>
   She said that because youngsters are less likely than older
people to be afraid of new technology, the students will more
comfortable voting online.

   MOMS-MARCH _ WASHINGTON _ Parenting in America has come to this:
Before letting their kids play at a friend's home, mothers
routinely ask if there's a gun in the house and, if so, whether it
has been safely locked away. Caren Appel started inquiring after
her 9-year-old daughter, Molly, was visiting a pal in an Atlanta
suburb and the friend's 5-year-old brother walked in with a
parent's gun. On Mother's Day, Appel will join a predicted 100,000
marchers in the nation's capital on a quest for ``sensible''
gun-control legislation. With hundreds of thousands of mothers also
assembling in 20 other cities, organizers believe this ``Million
Mom March'' will be the largest rally ever for gun control. (Dart,

ISRAEL ACCELERATES PREPARATIONS TO WITHDRAW FROM LEBANON 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After the cross-border violence late last week,
Israel is speeding up its preparations to withdraw troops from
southern Lebanon in case Prime Minister Ehud Barak decides to do so
before his self-imposed July 7 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Senior military officials expect to be pulling out under fire,
and several have indicated that they may as well withdraw as soon
as possible and cut the losses they could sustain over the next two
months.
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli soldier and two Lebanese civilians were killed in
intensified fighting last week.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and his advisers dropped hints Monday, not for the first
time, that the withdrawal date could be advanced, perhaps doing so
as a way to pressure Lebanon into helping curb the violence or into
negotiating a withdrawal arrangement. A precipitous withdrawal
could plunge southern Lebanon into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The hints could also be aimed at Syria _ an 11th-hour prod to
remind the Syrians, whose forces control Lebanon, that they are
running out of time to resume peace talks before a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could be straightforward expressions of intention. But
for the moment, Barak has indicated that he wants to conduct the
withdrawal under the auspices of the United Nations, with full
international support. And that would make it less likely that
Israel could pull out before July _ though still possible.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials already consider time very short to obtain
Security Council approval for a plan, organize the nations that
would contribute peacekeeping forces and make practical
arrangements by July 7.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has been grappling with U.N. requirements for the
withdrawal that have provoked intense internal debate in the
military and government. The major issue is a U.N. demand that the
Israel-backed South Lebanese army be dismantled when the withdrawal
takes place, and that the Khiam Prison, run by the militia and
assailed by international human rights groups, be shut down and its
detainees released.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Antoine Lahad, the commander of the Lebanese militia, asked
the Lebanese government Monday to grant blanket amnesty to his
officers and soldiers, who are considered traitors and face harsh
prison terms or death sentences. Lahad has maintained that without
pardons, his men will choose to stay and fight rather than
emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli official said the government may seek U.N.
intervention on behalf of the militia members, suggesting that
persuading Lebanon to revoke their sentences would make it easier
to disarm them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Israeli newspaper Maariv reported Monday that the Israeli
army is already scaling back its transfer of arms and ammunitions
to the South Lebanese army and that it is considering collecting
heavy armaments like tanks, ammunition and armored personnel
carriers. Ephaim Sneeh, the deputy defense minister, said the
militia forces would need to retain some weapons to defend
themselves after the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is anticipating that U.N. peacekeeping forces will
help quell violence after the pullout, it is especially anxious for
help from the United Nations during the withdrawal itself. The
United Nations will be called on to certify that Israel has indeed
withdrawn from Lebanese territory as promised. That will be
important for Israel, which is expected to assert, and seek
international backing for its assertion, that guerrilla forces can
no longer legitimize violent attacks on its northern border.
</P>
<P>
   The certification will be conditioned on Israel's full
withdrawal and its compliance with all demands, like dismantling
the Lebanese militia and closing the Khiam prison.
</P>
<P>
   Barak showed his inclination to accede to international
specifications when he quelled internal debate on two points.
Military officials were pressing to keep some outposts directly
over the border after the withdrawal, and idea that he, a former
general, squelched. And he also quieted disgruntlement about
letting an outside force delineate the border line to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Many Arab leaders are poised to suspect that Israel will not
comply fully.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt's foreign minister, Amr Moussa, expressed concerns Monday
that the Israeli withdrawal would not be complete ``on land, sea
and air.''
</P>
<P>
   To determine whether Israel fully withdraws, U.N. officials will
use a 1923, internationally recognized line between Israel and
Lebanon, with mutually agreed upon amendments. Terje Roed-Larsen, a
U.N. peace envoy who is in the region to make preparations for the
withdrawal, said he has encountered ``no fundamental disagreement''
over this line.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, did tell Larsen
that it considers a piece of territory on the edge of the Golan
Heights to be Lebanese as well. That demand could cause problems,
because if the border is disputed then the completion of the
withdrawal will be, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell if this is worrisome,'' a U.N. official
said, but the issue will have to be resolved in the next couple of
weeks so the plan can be approved.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Just how many horses will Fusaichi Pegasus
face at the Preakness Stakes on May 20? That is the question.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the trainers Sunday morning talking about
their charges, the second leg of the 2000 Triple Crown could have
as few as four horses and most likely won't have more than eight
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Already ruled out of the race are runner-up Aptitude, China
Visit, Curule, Deputy Warlock, The Deputy, Commendable, Ronton and
Graeme Hall.
</P>
<P>
   On the fence at this time are third-place finisher Impeachment,
More Than Ready, Wheelaway, Captain Steve, War Chant, Trippi,
Exchange Rate, Anees and Hal's Hope.
</P>
<P>
   That means of the 19 starters in Saturday's 126th Kentucky
Derby, just Captain Steve and High Yield have made plans to ship to
Pimlico Race Course. They will join Red Bullet, who skipped the
Derby after being defeated by Fusaichi Pegasus at the Wood
Memorial, as this year's Triple Crown threat's chief competition.
</P>
<P>
   That is, of course, if trainer Neil Drysdale ships Fusaichi
Pegasus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was fine this morning,'' Drysdale said. ``Somebody dropped
something and he bounced, so he was nice and bright this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to see how he comes out of this race first before we
go on to the next. As you well know, they're fragile animals and
sometimes things look easy and sometimes something shows up in the
wash. So, literally, we'll just go one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for everyone campaigning 3-year-old thoroughbreds
is to decide just how many times they want to face the dominating
performances that Fusaichi Pegasus, purchased in July 1998 by
Japanese businessman Fusao Sekiguchi for $4 million, has come up
with his last three times out.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday's cruise through the pack to a 11/2-length
victory over Aptitude, Fusaichi Pegasus destroyed the field in the
final 1/8-mile at the Wood, showing that the California-trained
horse can handle the tracks on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't bode well for the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with Fusaichi Pegasus,'' said High Yield's
trainer D. Wayne Lukas. ``All the fears about him were put to rest
when he went over there and did what he had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good one. When he's good, he's good. I'm hoping that he
isn't good every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenine Sahadi, who trains The Deputy, made it clear that her
colt was due for some serious rest and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will go back to California on Monday, and I am going to
give him a month to kick back,'' she said. ``He is fine this
morning; he ate his dinner last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``His temperature was normal, and he scoped clean after the
race. I don't have any excuses.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Big Bush-McCain summit day
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain says he wants to learn more about George W. Bush's
reform plans when they meet Tuesday in Pittsburgh for the first
time since Bush knocked McCain out of the race back in March.
``He's said he's a reformer with results,'' McCain told the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ``That's his slogan. I'd like to know what
those are and how I can be helpful in achieving a reform agenda.''
Bush, in New York today for Cardinal John O'Connor's funeral, said
of the meeting with McCain: ``I'm confident we'll have a
conversation that will cover a lot of subjects, none more important
than reform _ reform of our Social Security system. ... ``I don't
anticipate any changes on his part or my part, but there's a lot of
area for us on which to agree, and I look forward to having that
discussion.'' McCain said he'd urge Bush to appoint retired Gen.
Colin Powell as secretary of state. He also said he wouldn't
necessarily refuse a Cabinet position himself, such as secretary of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET JITTERS AND SOCIAL SECURITY
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore raised alarms about George W. Bush's Social Security
plan even before Bush described it, saying it would be ``bad for
American families and bad for our economy'' because retirement
money would be exposed to a fickle stock market. Addressing
publishers in New York, where he was attending Cardinal John
O'Connor's funeral, Gore also asserted more broadly that Bush would
subject the nation to ``short-term irresponsible decisions'' on
many issues, including the budget, taxes, education, the
environment and guns. Because of the funeral, Bush postponed plans
to unveil a Social Security initiative that would allow Americans
to invest part of their payroll taxes in the stock market in
pursuit of higher returns. Gore instead would use interest savings
from paying down the national debt to shore up the Social Security
system through 2054.
</P>
<P>
   AND YOU THOUGHT PRIMARY SEASON WAS OVER
</P>
<P>
   Two top Republicans will battle it out Tuesday for a chance to
replace the only Democrat in Nebraska's congressional delegation,
Sen. Bob Kerrey. Attorney General Don Stenberg and Secretary of
State Scott Moore are expected to lead the four-candidate GOP
primary race. The winner is likely to take on ex-Gov. Ben Nelson,
who faces only token opposition in the Democratic contest. In other
races Tuesday, former Nebraska Cornhusker football coach Tom
Osborne, probably the the most popular person in the football-crazy
state, is running for the House as a Republican. And in West
Virginia, Republican Gov. Cecil Underwood faces a painting
contractor, a housewife and an unemployed construction worker in
the GOP primary. Underwood, 77, was so confident that he did not
campaign and plans to spend election night watching a minor league
baseball game. Oh yes, there also are now-meaningless presidential
primaries in both states.
</P>
<P>
   SO HAVE YOUR PHOTO ID HANDY AND SMILE SWEETLY
</P>
<P>
   Low voter turnout among young people could be more than just
apathy, Cox' Scott Montgomery reports. Melissa Fried of Washington
Township, Ohio, knows she looks young, even for an 18-year-old, but
she didn't expect her youthfulness to be such a burden when she
went to vote in the Ohio primary this year. Poll workers ``really
questioned'' her about her age. ``Three times they asked me how old
I was and I kept telling them,'' Fried said. Then, she said, they
huffed impatiently because she didn't know how to use the key-punch
voting system. The workers may only have been being vigilant,
protecting the integrity of the election rolls, but the result made
Fried feel unwelcome as she cast her first ballot: ``I thought it
was going to be a nice experience, but the whole time I felt like I
wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   WORD IMPERFECT PROGRAM
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has never been considered much of a wordsmith,
but bit by bit he's developing a political dictionary all his own.
For example, when Al Gore distorts Bush's record and proposals, at
least as Bush sees it, Gore is not ``lying.'' Bush never uses that
word. Rather, Gore is behaving in a ``disappointing'' manner. And
while Bush says he'll soon identify numerous ways in which the
government can save money, none of these plans will be ``cuts'';
they will be ``savings'' that make the government more
``efficient'' _ kinder, gentler terms. Bush fully acknowledges he's
playing this word game, and this unspoken but unmistakable
admission has precipitated endless rounds of semantic jousting
between him and reporters, who are constantly trying to get him to
say what he clearly means.
</P>
<P>
   PATAKI PACS MOSTLY FOR HIM
</P>
<P>
   New York Gov. George Pataki is continuing to raise money through
two political action committees that he set up outside New York to
enhance his national profile. The stated purpose of those PACs,
which bear the name ``21st Century Freedom,'' is to help Republican
candidates around the country who share his views. But campaign
records show that most of the total of $892,573 raised so far has
been used to benefit Pataki by building new political alliances and
subsidizing an increasingly expensive political apparatus that
helped him win two terms as governor. The out-of-state PACs _ one
was formed under federal law, and the other in Virginia, where
there are no limits on contribution amounts _ have channeled
$67,433 to state and federal races outside New York. Yet they have
paid at least $126,944 to Pataki's pollster, $118,046 to his
political consultants, and another $190,653 to a half-dozen
campaign aides who are or have been on his payroll for years.
</P>
<P>
   ROBB-ALLEN SHOOTOUT SHAPES UP IN VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   For Virginia Democrats, Sen. Charles Robb is the last man
standing. For Republicans, he's the one obstacle to dominating
every statewide elected office and government institution. Now, as
Robb seeks a third term, he faces an all-out blitz from ex-Gov.
George Allen in a contest that seems certain to make Robb's
bruising battle against Oliver North six years ago look like a
cakewalk in comparison. By the end of March, Allen had raised $5.2
million in direct campaign contributions to Robb's $2.8 million. If
Robb is worried, he hasn't shown it. Often stiff and awkward in his
25 years as a politician, the ex-Marine and son-in-law of President
Johnson appears relaxed and confident, and with reason. He, after
all, has never lost an election, even when at an overwhelming
financial disadvantage.

   OH, THAT'S RIGHT, ANYONE CAN SEE IT

   So where did Handgun Control Inc. get that video footage used in
a new TV ad showing a National Rifle Association official bragging
that George W. Bush is in the gun lobby's pocket and if he becomes
president the NRA would practically be working out of the White
House? U.S. News &AMP; World Report reports that it was taped by an NRA
member who got the brilliant idea of posting it on the Internet,
thinking it would propel members to Bush. Instead, supporters of Al
Gore and the anti-gun group ``just stumbled across it'' and
downloaded it for their own use.

   STAND BY YOUR MAN _ BUT SOMEWHERE ELSE

<P>
   Rudy Giuliani's personal problems keep stealing the spotlight in
his Senate race. The New York Post reported that Giuliani's wife,
Donna Hanover, angered Roman Catholic Church officials by holding a
press conference about her troubled marriage just outside St.
Patrick's Cathedral as Cardinal John O'Connor lay in state inside.
Though Giuliani's relationship with ``very good friend'' Judith
Nathan came out of the shadows last week, Hanover told reporters,
``This marriage and this man have been very precious to me.'' But
others thought Hanover's comments intruded on a tribute to another
man who was quite precious to many. ``You don't call a press
conference at a wake,'' one church official was quoted as saying.
``It's grossly inappropriate.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Big bucks. Boardroom intrigue. Back room
political and publishing deals.
</P>
<P>
   The first week of former political consultant Clint Reilly's
antitrust suit to block Hearst Corp. from buying the San Francisco
Chronicle presented an extraordinary inside look at the intertwined
relationship between the daily newspaper business and politics.
</P>
<P>
   The trial continues Tuesday before U.S. District Judge Vaughn R.
Walker. Some of the alleged machinations _ including San Francisco
Examiner Publisher Tim White's testimony that he offered Brown
favorable editorials in return for his support _ have stunned media
professionals and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reilly's lawsuit has certainly exposed the plumbing of San
Francisco politics and publishing,'' said Richard DeLeon, chairman
of the history department at San Francisco State University. ``It's
kind of sobering.''
</P>
<P>
   And this week's likely witnesses may break more sheetrock:
Reilly, who spent about $4 million of his own money on his 1999 bid
to be mayor and then tried to buy The San Francisco Examiner; Ted
Fang, publisher of the free San Francisco Independent, who backed
Mayor Willie Brown and won a deal to buy The Examiner; and Hearst
Corp. President Frank Bennack, who faces questioning about what he
knew of White's politicking.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's lawyer, contends the machinations are
part of Hearst's attempt to illegally gain a newspaper monopoly.
However, legal experts say the case hinges largely on less dramatic
factors like antitrust law, newspaper economics and how the judge
defines newspaper competition.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that Hearst's plans to buy the Chronicle for
$660 million and sell its San Francisco Examiner to the Fang family
will give Hearst an illegal newspaper monopoly in San Francisco
that will reduce the number of news sources and views and raise
advertising and subscription rates.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly claims Hearst's plan to give the Fangs a $66 million
subsidy to offset publishing costs is a ``sham'' because it would
cost more to run a viable competitor, and thus a Fang Examiner is
doomed to fail. Reilly's own bid requested a larger subsidy,
according to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, the Chronicle and the Fangs have denied Reilly's claims.
And the U.S. Justice Department concluded Hearst's plans will
result in economic competition between newspapers in San Francisco
for the first time in 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are control of San Francisco's newspapers, and whether
Hearst will own the Chronicle, which has the prime morning position
in one of the nation's most lucrative media markets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, each trial day has brought another surprise, making the
future of the city's newspapers national news:
</P>
<P>
   Monday: White testified that he offered the mayor favorable
treatment in his paper's editorial pages in return for Brown's
support of Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. For his part, the
mayor lobbied White to drop a separate business suit between Hearst
and his allies the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: Hearst put White on leave and said it would investigate
whether he breached journalistic ethics. John B. Sias, president of
Chronicle Publishing, admitted that contrary to his sworn
declaration, he didn't know The Examiner's and the Chronicle's
respective operating costs,and joked that he had been exposed as a
``perjurer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: Hearst Senior Vice President James Asher testified
that Ted Fang could personally earn a $500,000 salary and a
$500,000 bonus as part of the subsidy Hearst agreed to pay the
Fangs to take The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday: Asher testified that the Fangs' offer to use their
political clout to help win local support for the Chronicle
purchase was ``a consideration'' _ although a ``minor'' one _ in
Hearst's agreeing to the Fang deal.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: Asher testified that Hearst got ``intelligence'' about
the discussions on the Chronicle sale within the Chronicle
Publishing Co.'s board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disclosures are eye opening,'' said Stephen Barnett, a
professor at UC-Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law, ``but their
relationship to the law that the court has to apply isn't clear.''
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented trial will determine the future of San
Francisco's daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the afternoon Examiner and the morning Chronicle
have had a joint operating agreement, an exemption from antitrust
law under which they share printing, circulation and marketing and
all revenue. After paying costs of the combined operations they
split profits, and each paper pays the costs of its independent
editorial staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements are allowed under the 1970 Newspaper Preservation
Act, which is meant to keep alive newspapers that might otherwise
fail so communities could benefit from competing sources of news
and editorials.
</P>
<P>
   At one point about 25 cities had joint operating agreements, but
now San Francisco's is one of a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, a few suits unsuccessfully claimed the
agreements violated antitrust laws. But Reilly's suit has resulted
in the nation's first trial over the break-up of a joint operating
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's lawyer, claims Hearst ``abused'' its
position in the joint operating agreement to get an unfair
advantage in buying the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto says the terms of Hearst's sale of The Examiner to the
Fangs are designed to doom it and leave Hearst's Chronicle the only
paper in town.
</P>
<P>
   He also argues that Hearst's plans violate antitrust laws and
the Newspaper Preservation Act. He contends that _ in return for a
profitable exemption from antitrust laws _ the act imposes a
special duty to keep papers in print.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a Hearst lawyer, has argued that the Newspaper
Preservation Act does not apply to the dissolution of joint
operating agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Halling's key defense is that The Examiner is a failing
newspaper and could not survive outside its profit-splitting
agreement with the larger Chronicle. There can be no antitrust
violation, he says, if the business to be closed would have failed
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto sought to show that Hearst believed it could compete as
an independent paper, and that shutting The Examiner to buy the
Chronicle was an antitrust violation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of last week's testimony concerned whether The Examiner is
failing.
</P>
<P>
   White testified that in recent years Hearst has made a profit
from The Examiner under its joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, for example, after both The Examiner and the Chronicle
paid their joint costs, they split the remaining $80 million in
revenue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst took its half and paid the costs of The Examiner's 200 or
so editorial staff and was left with $23 million in profit, White
testified.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Hearst's profit was $20.5 million, he added, and Hearst
has projected profits of $21 million in 2000, $22.8 million in
2001; $23.3 million in 2002; and $25 million in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But Hearst has said in court that, outside of the agreement, The
Examiner would not be able to compete against the Chronicle, whose
465,535 daily circulation is more than four times The Examiner's
108,968.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of newspaper revenue comes from advertising,
and advertising is based on circulation, according to undisputed
court testimony.
</P>
<P>
   White, who came to The Examiner from Hearst's Albany Times Union
in 1999, testified that Hearst sought to make the Chronicle owners
think that after the joint operating agreement expired in 2005
Hearst would make The Examiner a morning paper competing directly
with the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   White said that in April 1999 he told Chronicle President Sias,
``It's our intent to stay and publish independent of the agency.''
</P>
<P>
   But White testified that scenario was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe that we could go head to head,'' said White,
noting there has been a steady decline in the number of smaller
metropolitan papers around the country. ``I had little confidence
that we'd be able to deliver on that threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea, he said, was to convince the Chronicle's owners they
faced a costly newspaper war and were better off selling to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Alioto injected corporate intrigue into the trial
when he introduced an e-mail suggesting back-channel communications
between Chronicle Publishing Co. and Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   The June 22, 1999, e-mail said Richard Rosenberg, a member of
the Chronicle board of directors, had divulged the company's
internal boardroom discussions about plans to sell the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail said he passed the information on to Steven B. Falk,
head of the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which handles joint
operations for the Chronicle and The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Falk then gave the information to George Irish, head of Hearst's
newspaper division.
</P>
<P>
   Irish fired off the e-mail to Bennack, saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve told me that Rosenberg opined that if we waited until
the end of the process, they may find themselves flush with cash
and decide to keep the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick told Steve that there is still a great deal of long
standing dislike of Hearst among some of the (Chronicle)
shareholders, and a strong offer up front could lead to their
acceptance without the longer process,'' Irish wrote.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand Friday, Hearst Senior Vice President Asher
testified that the e-mail was ``intelligence'' that Hearst
considered in submitting its bid for the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto suggested that Rosenberg acted unethically in leaking
inside information, but Asher said he'd had no thought of that at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, who at the time was on the board of directors of Bank
of America, could not be reached for comment Saturday. Falk said
Saturday that he never spoke to Rosenberg about it and that a
Chronicle executive had given him the information. ``My assumption
was that they wanted to get the message through me to Hearst,''
Falk said.
</P>
<P>
   But the testimony that sparked the most controversy last week
was White's Monday statement that at an Aug. 30, 1999, lunch he had
offered Brown editorial support in exchange for Brown backing
Hearst's effort to buy the Chronicle. The Fangs and local
politicians - including Brown - had opposed Hearst's initial plans
to buy the Chronicle and possibly close The Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was then running for re-election as mayor against Reilly,
and had complained about The Examiner's coverage of his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto asked White: ``Is it not correct that you were in fact
intending to convey to Mayor Brown that his support for Hearst's
proposed acquisition of the Chronicle would result in more
favorable treatment for him in Examiner,`` a trial transcript
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' said White.
</P>
<P>
   White then clarified: ``That wouldn't affect the journalism
side. It would affect the editorial side. In the editorials.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Hearst issued a statement in which White said he had
been ``tired and confused'' during his testimony. Examiner
Executive Editor Phil Bronstein, who was also at the lunch,
insisted there were no negotiations of press coverage of kind.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto countered that White gave similar testimony to the
Justice Department in December.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto contended that Hearst was making White a scapegoat, and
that other Hearst executives, including Irish and Bennack, had
known of White's statements _ Hearst spokeswoman Debra Shriver and
Halling denied that.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, news of White's testimony triggered a storm of
reaction in newspapers, radio and television. In their own front
page message to readers, The Examiner staff condemned any trading
of editorial support for political favors, and in a petition 80
Chronicle staffers called on Hearst to treat White fairly but fully
investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto has contended that White's comments to Brown are part of
Hearst's alleged maneuvering to acquire an illegal monopoly.
Halling has denied that, saying the local politics are irrelevant
to antitrust law that will decide the case. Walker has said he is
considering the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this trial has done is show a lot of people the inner
workings of the mainstream media,'' said David Lee, a San Francisco
media consultant and executive director of the Chinese American
Voters Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that all San Franciscans are concerned about,
that our newspapers are independent from the business part of the
operation,'' Lee said.

 &HT;    PROGRAM OFFERS TROUBLED WOMEN INMATES A 'NEW PATHWAY'
 &HT;    1070&AMP;add. For release Sunday, May 14.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Calif. _ ``If I wouldn't have came(cq) to prison, I'd be
be dead right now,'' said Eshelle Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Following a therapy session, part of a ground-breaking program
aimed at helping female inmates, Scott said she was trapped in an
abusive relationship with a man who introduced her to witchcraft
and beat her nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   Depressed, she found comfort in drugs and killing animals. Angry
about a beating, she said, she once decapitated her boyfriend's
mother's cat and left it on the woman's doorstep. Finally, she was
convicted of burning churches and sentenced to a 63-month term.
</P>
<P>
   At the Federal Correctional Institution here, Scott participated
in the inaugural class of New Pathways, a pilot program aimed at
addressing the special needs of female inmates who have been
physically or sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``best thing that ever happened to me,'' said the
25-year-old Corpus Christi, Texas, native.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for New Pathways was born in 1994 after a study here
found that 55 percent of the prison's inmates had been abused
physically or sexually as children or adults, said Dr. Davina
Kotulski, co-creator of the program.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of slowing a rapid rise in the national prison
population _ and an even faster rise in female inmates _ a team of
psychologists at the prison submitted a proposal to the Federal
Bureau of Prisons in 1998. The first New Pathways class started
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The program fits in with the bureau's plans of addressing
special needs for female inmates, said spokesman Daniel Dunne, and
prison officials here said it may be expanded to other prisons
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   New Pathways has four phases. In the first, which lasts 12
weeks, inmates are encouraged to open up and trust others. They
also learn techniques for managing anger and stress, such as deep
breathing and taking ``time outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The second phase focuses on helping the women recover from their
past traumas.
</P>
<P>
   They practice ``expressive art,'' making collages illustrating
their abuse and anger and playing games that encourage openness in
personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   In another exercise, each group member chooses a past traumatic
experience, and the classmates re-enact it as she watches. The
class then acts out the same scene with a positive twist.
</P>
<P>
   This allows the women to get ``feedback from group members and
it helps them see their own trauma,'' said Tracy Henderson, prison
trauma specialist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very challenging. It's very emotional. But it's one of
the most cathartic and healing aspects of the program,'' Kotulski
added.
</P>
<P>
   Phase three teaches the inmates ways to build their self-esteem
and think positively.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth and final phase is after care. Until they leave the
prison, inmates who successfully complete the first three phases of
the program will meet monthly to discuss topics that encourage
continued development of the techniques they learned.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other prison reform programs, inmates volunteer for New
Pathways, said Dr. Stephen Formanski, chief psychologist at
FCI-Dublin. There is no financial incentive, nor are inmates'
sentences reduced for participating, he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Pathways' $8,000 price tag in its first year is far less
than the prison's $45,000 drug rehabilitation program, in which
most New Pathways clients also take part.
</P>
<P>
   Participants said New Pathways' unusual group setting is more
helpful than one-on-one therapies they've had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still going to have treatment and everything, but this
right here has been more treatment than I had ever had, and it's
helped me cope with a lot of things,'' said Jo-Lynn Anderson, 39,
who was sexually abused by her stepfather and physically abused by
her mother. ``For a long time I didn't want to share with anybody''
the problems she had experienced. Anderson was nearing the end of a
four-year sentence for drug distribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in this group, it's taught me that other people have
problems,'' added Anderson, who prior to the program inflicted pain
on herself, breaking all her knuckles by punching her cell walls as
a way to relieve her mental pain. ``It might not be the same, but
we all have different problems and it really helped me to be able
to talk to these ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie, 40, who asked that her last name not be published, said
the program had transformed her into a new person. She was
convicted of using an automatic weapon during a bank robbery, the
latest in a series of offenses for which she has been imprisoned
over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My crimes over the years have gotten worse,'' said Debbie.
``Until I came to this program, my feelings were pretty much cold
and heartless as far as valuing other people's lives. I didn't
understand what empathy was until I went through this program. I
didn't realize I had victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think that the crimes I did really affected other
people. It was a job to me,'' she said. ``I went to work every day
and I did these crimes and they were violent. But if I was to
continue the way I was going, I would have gotten released from
here and gone out and committed more crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Chacon, 24, of El Paso, Texas, also said she had gone
through a rebirth because of the program. Mental abuse and too much
responsibility forced on her by relatives led Chacon to sell drugs
to support her family, she said. She has served two years of a
three-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wouldn't have came(cq) here, many other things could have
happened to me out there, and I wouldn't have learned everything
that I learned about myself in here,'' she said. ``I didn't come to
realize who I was till I got here. I have learned a lot in this
group. I've learned that before you can give to other people you
have to give to yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural set of classes ended April 28, and it is too early
to determine the success of New Pathways.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials are optimistic that many graduates will become
productive members of society. Kotulski said several have
aspirations, once they are free, to help women like themselves. But
officials realize the inmates are not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that every woman who graduates from this program
is going to go out and live a perfect life and be totally drug- and
crime-free and not go back to abusive relationships,'' Henderson
said. ``But at least I know that there are a few out there who know
how to get themselves out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said New Pathways may eventually be expanded to
other prisons around the country. Formanski said he has already
gotten calls from a few prisons, including the Federal Correctional
Institution in Bryon, Texas, that are considering starting similar
programs.
</P>
<P>
   None of its programs are structured quite like New Pathways, but
the state of Georgia has group therapy programs that officials say
have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``During each of these classes, inmates are able to talk about
their problems with other inmates who have similar problems,'' said
spokeswoman Abigail Morgan. ``It gives them another way them to
better cope with their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with reform programs at the nation's prisons and jails,
more people are being locked up. About 1,860,520 adults were
imprisoned in 1999, an increase of 60,000 over the previous year,
according to a recent Bureau of Justice Statistics report.
</P>
<P>
   The number of women prisoners doubled since 1990 to more than
87,000 in 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Scott, the convicted church burner, life will be
completely different when she is released. She plans to get a job,
a home and try to be a mother to her 3-year-old daughter who she
has seen once through a glass since giving birth to the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to her on the phone but she still doesn't know me, and
that's going to be very, very hard for me,'' Scott said.

GEORGE BELL NAMED EXCITE CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/NYTimes.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excite(at)Home (ATHM:Nasdaq), the high-speed Internet access
company and Web portal, has named its chief executive and
president, George Bell, as its chairman, the company said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bell, 43, a former documentary filmmaker who once served as
senior vice president of Times Mirror Magazines, became chief
executive of Excite in 1996 and chief executive of the combined
Excite and At Home companies in January.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman, Bell replaces Tom Jermoluk. Jermoluk will remain a
director, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The move was widely expected, and the company's stock gained
3/8, or 2.09 percent to 18 5/16 in Monday midday trading.
(ExciteHome finished down 7/16, or 2 percent, at 17 1/2.)
</P>
<P>
   Jermoluk has not played a role in day-to-day operations since
quitting the chief executive post. He told Business Week last month
that the past year, during which he has devoted much of his time to
negotiating with cable companies, has been the worst of his life.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T(T:NYSE), Cox Communications(COX:NYSE) and Comcast
Communications(CCZ:NYSE), have large stakes in the company. But the
cable companies, facing lawsuits and regulatory pressure, now plan
to rescind the company's right to exclusively deliver high-speed
Internet access across their lines.
</P>
<P>

BOEING NAMES NEW CFO 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 TheStreet.com/NYTimes.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ending two weeks of speculation, aerospace giant Boeing(BA:NYSE)
named Michael M. Sears as its new chief financial officer Monday,
following the surprise departure of former CFO Deborah C. Hopkins,
who left Boeing to become CFO of Lucent Technologies(LU:NYSE), in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, 52, was most recently president of Boeing's military
aircraft and missiles unit, and is a 30-year veteran of the
company. He has held executive positions in each of Boeings' three
business sectors: defense, space and commercial aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Sears replaces Deborah Hopkins, who at 45 was one of the highest
ranking female executives in corporate America. As CFO at
Seattle-based Boeing, Hopkins was widely credited with a sharp
improvement in Boeing's finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike will bring fresh, operational thinking to the aggressive
target-setting efforts we have put in place,'' said Phil Condit,
chairman and chief executive of Boeing, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Skowronski, Boeing's vice president of finance and
treasurer, has filled in as temporary CFO since Hopkins quit, and
will return to his post.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald E. Daniels will step in to fill Sears' position as
president of Boeing's military division. Daniels, 54, formerly
served as the president and general manager of the company's U.S.
Navy and Marine Corps programs.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing also announced Monday that Harry C. Stonecipher, will
remain president and chief operating officer of the company for at
least a year past his scheduled retirement in May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing stock had not traded in after-hours markets following the
announcement Monday. Boeing shares closed down 1 1/4, or 3.2
percent, at 38 1/4.

   UNDATED _ My daughter wanted to know if it was true that Whitney
Houston is addicted to drugs. I told her I didn't know, but I hope

<P>
   UNDATED _ While the dot-com demonstrators attempt to convince
lawmakers (who won't be anywhere near Capitol Hill on a weekend)
that they echo the majority voice of American motherhood, keep this
in mind: The Million Mom March is violating federal law. At least
that's the view from here. Hardly a soul can question the

the ``Time Out Chair,'' which threatens to unseat politicians who

the government for snatching Elian Gonzalez from his Miami

George W. Bush offers the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket. For one

   UNDATED _ Packing for a trip should be a no-brainer. So how come
I can survive two weeks in Europe with a backpack and a coin purse,
but for a three-day weekend in Houston, I take a huge wheeled
suitcase and an extra bag of shoes? We talk to packing experts _
yes, there are such things _ who tell us their favorite tricks. By

<P>
   Jim Courier peered into the Centre Court crowd, found the face
of his mother, Linda, and screeched joyously: ``Me? In a Wimbledon
final?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the last place he expected to be: ``Grass and I haven't
gotten along too well.'' But the man multitudes of French admirers
called ``Beeg Jeem'' had beaten two-time champ Stefan Edberg, whose
fondness for the green stuff exceeded a cow's. Even though Courier
then lost the 1993 title bout narrowly, in four tough sets to his
pal, Pete Sampras, who would become Mr. Wimbledon, he had joined a
select handful of tennis players (12) to grace all four major
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Man, did he grace them _ in a way Rocky Marciano graced title
fights: hyper-combatively, slugging away until his opponent
dropped. For as long as it took.
</P>
<P>
   Marciano retired unbeaten as heavyweight champion. James Spencer
Courier retired Monday as an ex-world champ himself, having stood
boisterously at No. 1 in 1992. The two of them beat everyone who
counted during their time. If Rocky was the Brockton Blockbuster,
Jim was the Dade City Destroyer, also a product of a blue-collar
town, his in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no nostalgia,'' he said over the phone from his
Orlando home. ``Deep down I knew it was time to go. I've got great
memories, of course. The greatest, I guess, was beating Andre
(Agassi) to win the French in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first of his four major titles that guarantee him
an alcove in the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport,
R.I., in five or so years. He repeated at the French in 1992, lost
his crown in the finale to Sergi Bruguera the following year, the
lone American male to shoot for the title three straight years in
that traditional trap for his countrymen, the clay pit named Roland
Garros.
</P>
<P>
   Although the few Yanks who won there never said as much as one
important French word (``merci'') in accepting the prize, Courier
wowed all Gaul by making his thank-you speeches in French. It
helped to have had a French girlfriend. But it was also a mark of
his curiosity, an active mind he displayed in trying to immerse
himself in the various cultures on the planetary tour. Airport,
hotel, and courts are the grand-tour destinations of the usual
players. Courier liked to wander the towns, absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave a lot, all of myself in playing tennis, but I got as
much from the game, the opportunities, as I gave,'' he said. ``I
lost matches, sure, but I never felt regrets about any of them, and
that I hadn't given everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It feels good to leave all-square. That's obvious in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Courier added Australian titles in 1992-93, beating Edberg both
times, but lost to the Swede in the 1991 US Open final. Six major
finals _ four titles. Altogether, 23 triumphs in 36 finals.
</P>
<P>
   He's the first to signal the inevitable breakup of that old gang
of his, the finest crop of American men ever. It includes Agassi,
Sampras, Michael Chang _ 23 majors among the four _ plus Todd
Martin and MaliVai Washington, who reached major finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't go on much longer,'' said Courier. ``I hope Americans
appreciate the guys the rest of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Courier's hair and intensity matched the crimson courts of
Roland Garros, where he made his first breakthrough, ranked No. 47
while stunning No. 5 Agassi in the third round. They'd sparred
hundreds of times as boarders at Nick Bollettieri's finishing
school at Bradenton, Fla. But Bollettieri had indicated that Agassi
was his star pupil, and Courier's reaction was crimson, too, as it
often was in quick-tempered early days. Feeling slighted, he fled
Bollettieri and was the champ two years later, embracing his
initial major a year before Agassi got his.
</P>
<P>
   Although the brawny Courier will be only 30 in August, he has
``given it all at the office. I felt my enthusiasm waning.''
Courier's physical demands on himself set him apart as a demolition
derbyist in short pants and white cap. Making virtually every
stroke a Sunday punch, he intimidated with relentless groundies and
withering returns. A lefthanded-hitting shortstop as a kid, he
powered his two-fisted backhand with a baseball swing. One of the
great shots of the '90s was his backside boogie: the quick shuffle
to the left to deliver a demoralizing inside-out forehand. It took
him to the top, and kept him among the elite for a long time. But
he wore down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally knew it at San Jose in February,'' he said. ``I was
in the semis against Flip (Mark Philippoussis), which should have
been great. But I was having a miserable time. I wasn't excited. So
that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbreviating this, his 12th professional year, Courier has made
more than $14 million in prize money, plus plenty in endorsements.
He could have continued playing his way out of the range of soup
kitchens, but, ``It wouldn't have been fun, so what's the point?''
He was always true to himself and the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My old coach, Jose Higueras, sums up the feeling in a
sentence: `The day you wake up in the morning and don't want to get
better, it's time to quit.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The flame probably went out after his brilliant revival in the
3-2 US Davis Cup victory over Britain a year ago as he beat Tim
Henman and Greg Rusedski, both much higher-ranked, in five-set
thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   A ``big disappointment'' then was his inability to reach that
altitude again three months later at Longwood in the Cup
quarterfinal, losing to Aussie Pat Rafter in straight sets on
opening day. That made the 4-1 US defeat a certainty. Shortly
thereafter, in the same court, Courier presented further evidence
of deterioration and decline, unable to break serve in a 6-4, 6-4
beating by Sargis Sargsian in the first round of the US Pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out happily,'' he said. ``My passion now is music,
playing (drums and guitar), singing, and writing songs. I'll be
back at Wimbledon, in a TV booth, for TBS. One of my songs is
called `Letting Go.' Appropriate, huh? But it's not about tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was a fun day at Wimbledon. Me? In a Wimbledon
final? I feel the same way about my career. Me? Making it in this
game? It's what I always wanted when I went to Bollettieri's at 13.
We all had our eyes on it, and I feel grateful to have got it.''
</P>

THE SECRET TO PACKING? SMALL SUITCASES HOLD FEWER WORRIES
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by PACKING-GIZMOS and PACKING-RESOURCES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Packing a suitcase should be the easiest part of planning a
trip, a piece of cake compared with things like finding a cheap
flight or a decent hotel that's located near the things you want to
see.
</P>
<P>
   So how come I can survive 10 days in Mexico with a backpack and
a coin purse, but a three-day trip to Houston requires a giant
wheeled suitcase and an entire bag devoted to shoes? Why can I fly
to Italy with three changes of clothing and a raincoat, but when I
drive to Missouri for a long weekend with my family, the whole
trunk of the car gets filled with things I just can't live without?
</P>
<P>
   With a weekend trip to New Orleans looming _ the kind of trip
for which I traditionally end up lugging along a steamer trunk full
of junk _ I panicked. This time, I wanted to pack smart, to travel
lightly. So I went to a few packing experts _ yes, this is now a
viable job description _ to find out what I've been doing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Secretly, I also hoped they'd come to my house and pack for me.
But I'd settle for them wading through the wealth of books, videos,
Web sites, seminars, and gizmos and gadgets that supposedly make
your luggage hold more and your clothes less wrinkled, and telling
me what really worked.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out mine is a common problem; people most often overpack
on short trips, when they are less disciplined and plan poorly,
says Mona Williams of The Container Store.
</P>
<P>
   And overpacking ``is related directly to security,'' says Anne
McAlpin, who oversees a packing empire that includes books,
seminars and videos, and who has been called the world's best
packer by no less than Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think, `Maybe I need this, maybe I need that, what's going
to happen with the weather.' And the next thing you know, you're
taking all these things.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlpin, and everyone else consulted, insists you don't have to
spend a load of money on fancy gadgets or luggage. (Though, of
course, they're all running businesses; each pushed a favorite item
or two.)
</P>
<P>
   First, they counseled, make a written list. Not the night before
you leave, but a few days ahead, says Rita Mathis, a merchandise
manager for Voyagers, The Travel Store in Fort Worth. Mathis is all
for making an obsessive-compulsive kind of list, figuring out
exactly what you're going to do and then matching your outfits to
that list. Maybe even make it into a little chart. If you don't
know when you're going to wear it, it doesn't go along. And if you
need something new, you have time to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   The chart-making seems a little extreme, but I go along with it.
Taking cues from McAlpin, I limit myself to two pairs of shoes
(three is her absolute limit, no matter where or for how long
you're going) and a limited color scheme. (Everything goes with
black.) I even check with the hotels to see if they provide hair
dryers, irons and certain toiletries. (They did. Big space-saving
move.)
</P>
<P>
   Following Mathis' lead, I cross a few things off, realizing I
don't really need a long black skirt or a sweat shirt in humid New
Orleans. And I write myself a note to buy a white sweater in the
next three days. (Which, however, I completely forgot about until I
got to the airport. Whoops.)
</P>
<P>
   The game plan continues. I get an early start on packing, piling
clothes in the spare bedroom two days early, and even putting them
in the suitcase the evening before the flight. Plenty of room.
Checking things off the list, I feel smug; this is going smoothly.
(But then, at the last minute, seeing that I had extra room, I
tossed in an extra dress and an extra silk T-shirt. Neither of
which I ended up wearing. Sensing a pattern here?)
</P>
<P>
   The suitcase also holds a few of the secret weapons recommended
by the experts: A roll of duct tape, for emergency repairs. (Never
used it.) A cadre of plastic zippered bags, for storage and
laundry. (Very useful.) A couple of Shout stain-removal pads for
unexpected spills. (I didn't remember I had them, but they would
have been useful if I had.)
</P>
<P>
   The final results? I get everything crammed into the smallest of
my rolling bags, one that can easily be carried aboard most
flights. You're supposed to take only what you can carry yourself,
so this is a very good thing. I was more comfortable, having only
one small bag to schlep through the airport.
</P>
<P>
   As for clothes, I brought plenty, just the wrong ones _ which
wasn't the experts' fault but mine, for not watching The Weather
Channel. I wished I'd listened to them and brought more jewelry, to
add variety to my same-old outfits. I also wished for another pair
of shoes. (But I've always wanted that.)
</P>
<P>
   But actually, it's not the tips and the gizmos and the packing
techniques that I'll remember before my next trip; it's these words
from McAlpin, the kind of sound bite that landed her on Oprah's
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get away from it all,'' McAlpin says, ``don't
take it all with you.''

GERMANY RENAMES BASE IN HONOR OF SOLDIER WHO DEFIED HITLER

<TEXT>
<P>
   RENDSBURG, Germany _ Germany renamed a base Monday after a
soldier in Hitler's army who disobeyed orders, saved hundreds of
Jews and was executed by the Nazis for his acts.
</P>
<P>
   The honoring of Anton Schmid, an army sergeant whose conscience
was moved by the suffering of Jews in the Vilnius ghetto, appeared
particularly significant because his name replaced that of an army
general, Guenther Ruedel, who fought in two world wars and had been
held up as a hero and example in the first decades after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Many Germans have long held the notion that Nazi atrocities were
not the work of the army but of Hitler's elite SS and fanatical
death squads. A government decision to strip the general's name
from a base and, for the first time, identify a military
institution with a soldier who saved Jews is deeply significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not free to choose our history, but we can choose the
examples we take from that history,'' said Rudolf Scharping, the
defense minister, a Social Democrat. ``Too many bowed to the
threats and temptations of the dictator, and too few found the
strength to resist. But Sgt. Anton Schmid did resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Vienna and drafted into the German army after the
Anschluss of 1938, Schmid found himself stationed near Vilnius, in
the fall of 1941. The Germans had entered Lithuania not long
before. There he witnessed the herding of Jews into two ghettos and
the shooting of thousands of them in nearby Ponary.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to his wife, Stefi, Schmid described his horror at
the sight of this mass murder and of ``children being beaten on the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on: ``You know how it is with my soft heart. I could not
think and had to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   This courageous assistance involved the saving of more than 250
Jews whom Schmid managed to hide and the supplying of materiel and
forged papers to the Jewish underground.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested in January 1942, and summarily tried before a Nazi
military court on Feb. 25, Schmid was executed on April 13. His
death, Scharping said Monday, should be an example to a modern
German army committed to freedom and truth _ ``an army in a
democracy and for that democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Scharping chose to deliver his message to young recruits on the
55th anniversary of Germany's unconditional surrender, a
humiliation that was the prelude to the slow construction of an
entirely different post-war army.
</P>
<P>
   But it has taken 55 years to honor the example of Schmid, who is
relatively little known, and the decision was by no means welcomed
by everybody. A former commander of the base, Baron Hans von
Falkenhausen, refused to attend the ceremony in protest of the
removal of Ruedel's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two world wars, General Ruedel served the fatherland in
outstanding ways,'' he said in a letter to Scharping, adding that
he respected Sgt. Schmid but could not accept the removal of the
name that had stood on this barracks in northern Germany for the
past 35 years as ``an example to hundreds of officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruedel was a prominent figure in the organization of Germany's
air defenses and was never linked to any atrocities in his military
actions. But in August 1942, he agreed to become an ``honorary
judge'' of the ``People's Courts'' of the Nazi regime, vehicles for
the administering of Hitler's brutal whims.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz Stern, the American historian of Germany, was invited
Monday to be the honorary speaker at the ceremony and he described
these so-called courts as an ``absolute perversion of justice and
decency.''
</P>
<P>
   Condemning Ruedel in unusually vehement terms, he said there
could be no ``honorable link to the hangman, only entanglement in
abhorrent ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Scharping said it was only recently discovered what role Ruedel
played in the courts, particularly in the sentencing to death of
thousands of people after the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler
in July 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I made the decision myself that a change of
name was necessary,'' he said. ``The model for the modern German
army must be the likes of Sgt. Schmid. It is possible that the
names of other barracks will be changed by the end of 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister's determination is certain to meet further
resistance. An exhibition last year, ``The German Army and
Genocide,'' was bitterly contested because it sought to illustrate
how completely the German armed forces were a tool of the Nazis
even if the access of ordinary soldiers to Hitler's murderous
designs was limited.
</P>
<P>
   It was an illustration of how extraordinarily rare acts such as
Schmid's were that, in its first honoring of such a soldier, the
German government found itself obliged to name an Austrian.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Berlin and Vienna have been strained by
Germany's strong support for sanctions against an Austrian
government that includes the rightist party of Jorg Haider.
</P>
<P>
   If Schmid's acts were enormously rare, he evidently saw nothing
extraordinary in them. ``I merely behaved as a human being,'' he
said in his last letter to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, ``Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality
of Evil'', Hannah Arendt singled out the example of Schmid as
illustrating the lesson that, ``Under conditions of terror, most
people will comply but some people will not.'' She continued:
``Humanly speaking, no more is required, and no more can reasonably
be asked, for this planet to remain a place fit for human
habitation.''

CLINTON ASKS ARKANSAS PANEL NOT TO RESCIND HIS LAW LICENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has pleaded with an Arkansas
disciplinary panel not to take away his law license, arguing that
he has been a good public servant and insisting again that he did
not technically lie before a federal judge, according to court
papers filed by his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In an 80-page brief, backed by hundreds of pages of exhibits,
Clinton and his lawyers provided the first glimpse of how they will
argue that he is still fit to practice law even though he was found
in contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief, Clinton maintains that his answers under oath in
the presence of a federal judge denying a sexual relationship with
Monica Lewinsky were technically accurate. Much of the brief, in
fact, is an effort to press yet again his claim that he was
truthful in saying he had not engaged in sexual relations with
Lewinsky because the oral sex in which they engaged did not fit the
definition of sexual relations that had been approved by the judge
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said in the brief that his more than 20
years of public service should persuade the panel to be lenient and
not impose any sanction more harsh than a reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee on Professional Conduct of the Arkansas Supreme
Court is set to decide as early as this month whether to discipline
Clinton by revoking or suspending his license or imposing a lesser
penalty, such as issuing a letter of reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's brief in the disciplinary case was not disclosed but
portions of it were reproduced in the opposing brief filed by the
Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative group based in
Atlanta that has been pressing Arkansas to revoke Clinton's license
to practice law.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Glavin, the director of the Southeastern Legal
Foundation, said he was disclosing his organization's brief and
urged Clinton and his lawyers to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   But David Kendall, Clinton's lawyer, declined to do so Monday.
Kendall did not take issue with Glavin's account of the Clinton
brief but in a statement he criticized Glavin and his organization
for releasing their brief, asserting the action was part of a
long-running partisan campaign against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Foundation isn't interested in issues relating to Arkansas
lawyers and legal services,'' he said. ``It's just interested in
attacking the president any way it can.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that Richard Mellon Scaife has given the Foundation
money and that Kenneth Starr has helped raise funds for it. Scaife,
a reclusive billionaire, has donated millions of dollars to
anti-Clinton causes; Starr was, until last fall, the Whitewater
prosecutor whose report of Clinton's relationship with Lewinsky
resulted in the impeachment of Clinton by the House in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary case involves Clinton's statements under oath
on Jan. 17, 1998, when he gave a deposition in the sexual
misconduct lawsuit brought against him by Paula Jones. In the
presence of U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who was
presiding over the civil lawsuit, Clinton said he had never engaged
in a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and he denied that he had
ever been alone with her but for a fleeting moment.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton acknowledged in August 1998 that he had had an
``improper'' physical relationship with Lewinsky, Wright ruled that
his behavior constituted contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   She said that ``the president deliberately violated this court's
discovery orders, thereby undermining the integrity of the judicial
system, and that sanctions must be imposed to redress the
president's misconduct and to deter others who might consider
emulating the president's misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavin said that the bar's disciplinary rules do not require
that Clinton lied, only that he was purposely deceptive. He said
that the president has already admitted to that by saying that he
misled the public and authorities with his comments about his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to take away the president's license to practice law
has run a course similar to other Clinton problems like Jones'
lawsuit; the president and his lawyers hope to treat the matter as
inconsequential but it does not go away and only grows in
importance because of the existence of a dogged opponent who has
turned the matter into a legal issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall had asked the disciplinary committee in March to
postpone its consideration of the case until after Clinton left
office, but the committee rejected that proposal.

GM HIRES STAR RENAULT DESIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors, which has struggled for years to make
its cars less boring, announced on Monday that it had hired a star
designer who helped transform Renault from an also-ran in the
European auto industry into one of the industry's most feared
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Asensio, 37, is widely thought to be the most important
influence in three of Renault's biggest hits of the 1990s: the
small, quirky Scenic minivan and the Clio and Twingo small cars.
The Scenic in particular restored Renault's lost luster as an
innovative automaker, becoming the best-selling vehicle in Britain.
Scenic is the first non-British automobile to achieve the top
ranking there.
</P>
<P>
   Asensio has been the director of medium car design and the
third-ranking designer over all at Renault. She was considered the
heir apparent to run Renault's design department someday. At GM,
she will hold a new position as director of advanced automobile
design, overseeing the eight brand design managers who come up with
future models for various GM divisions like Cadillac, Chevrolet and
Buick.
</P>
<P>
   She will report to Wayne Cherry, GM's vice president for design,
and will be the highest-ranking woman ever in GM's design
department. But she will rank lower than Jerry Palmer, GM's
executive director of design, who also reports to Cherry and who
oversees design changes to models currently in production.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whether Asensio can breathe life into GM's designs will depend
on further progress in changes already underway. The company's
leaders were so intent on restoring its financial stability in the
early and mid-1990s that they tended to choose cautious designs
that were supported by large committees of designers relying on
extensive market research. But GM has begun experimenting recently,
and has committed itself to building six of the nine well-received
concept vehicles shown at the Detroit and New York auto shows this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry said he admired Renault's aggressive designs. ``The thing
I appreciate about Renault's style is they've taken risks, and most
designers admire that,'' he said. ``They've dared to bring out some
different vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   GM wants to show similar imagination, Cherry said, adding that,
``there's a renewed emphasis here from top management on design.''
</P>
<P>
   Asensio became well known in design circles at a young age. She
graduated at the top of her class from France's top design school,
said Carl L. Olsen, a former design director at Citroen who was one
of the school's outside examiners. ``It was obvious immediately
that she had a very exciting career in front of her,'' Olsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of Asensio's designs at Renault has been the
efficient use of space inside vehicles. The Scenic, which is not
sold in the United States, is roomy on the inside but shorter than
American minivans, which allows for easier parking on crowded
European streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to have a minimum amount of space on the road
and a maximum amount of space in the car,'' she said in a telephone
interview today from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Asensio said she knew what it meant to move from Paris to
Detroit. She studied here for a year in 1987 at the Center for
Creative Studies, one of the world's top automotive design schools,
and returned for a year in 1990 when Renault and Chrysler
collaborated on a sport utility vehicle design that never went into
production. She designed the first Scenic right after her return to
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Detroit, I know it's very different than Paris but the
GM offer is very interesting to me,'' she said, adding that she had
been fascinated when GM showed its latest concept vehicles at the
Geneva auto show in March. ``I'm more interested in the job than in
the town.''

AHEAD OF THE PACK: HOW THREE METHODS RATE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies ART OF PACKING) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are the newest packing gizmos worth the money? We road-tested
two products _ and an old standby _ on a recent three-night trip.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Eagle Creek Pack-It Folder
</P>
<P>
   Cost: Medium size, $25.
</P>
<P>
   What it's for: Saving space, producing less-wrinkled clothing.
</P>
<P>
   How it's supposed to work: You fold garments around a stiff
packing sleeve, which you then remove; clothes look the way they do
when they've been folded at the dry cleaner's. You then stack the
folded garments in the canvas bag and fasten the Velcro-equipped
sides tightly around them, producing one neat package of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   How it worked: Once I got the hang of how to fold items, it was
easy to pack the folder. (After you've done a couple of garments,
you don't really need the stiff sleeve.) My 18-inch-size folder was
supposed to hold 12 garments. I put in two sweater sets, two pairs
of pants, and a man's dress shirt and tie, and it could easily have
held several additional items. The package fit neatly into a small
rolling suitcase, and after a day of travel, most of the garments
were less wrinkled than if I'd just packed them any old way.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: On a short trip, when I was living out of a suitcase,
the folder sometimes seemed like more trouble than it was worth, as
you had to unpack the whole thing to reach a single item. But the
device did keep things neat and would be especially useful on a
longer trip; I'll definitely use one again.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Space Bag Travel Genie
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $9.99 for a set of two medium and one large.
</P>
<P>
   What it's for: Saving space.
</P>
<P>
   How it's supposed to work: These plastic bags, with a zippered
seal on one end and an air-release valve on the other, are supposed
to squeeze excess air out of garments, enabling you to pack up to
75 percent more. You load items into the bag, zip it shut, and then
slowly roll it together, pushing the air out through the valve.
</P>
<P>
   How it worked: I used one of the smaller bags for a single
polyester crepe dress; the bag compressed the dress to next to
nothing, but when I unpacked it, it was so wrinkled that ironing
seemed like a lost cause. On the way home, a pair of dress pants
and a silk T-shirt rolled into a thin package about the size of a
legal pad. Eight hours later, they were very wrinkled, but they
needed to be dry cleaned anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Good for dirty laundry or maybe a big fluffy sweater or
parka, but regular clothes get far too wrinkled to make it worth
the effort. I'd take it only on a long trip on which I expected to
fill my luggage with souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Plastic zippered storage bags, quart- or gallon-size
</P>
<P>
   Cost: About $2 for a box of 20.
</P>
<P>
   What it's for: Storage.
</P>
<P>
   How it's supposed to work: Um, for storing food. But in the past
few years, I've used them for shoes, toiletries, wet swimsuits,
delicate souvenirs, dirty laundry, used film, stacks of receipts
and snacks for the plane ride.
</P>
<P>
   How it worked: I filled two with potentially leaky toiletries,
then took another couple for laundry or in case one of the bags
tore. (One did.) This little precaution averted a major mess: I
didn't sufficiently tighten the lid on a bottle of hair goop, but
the sticky leakage stayed confined to the bag rather than ruining
my clothes. Another bag kept my dusty walking shoes from getting
dust all over everything else. Also, the leftover bags held dirty
laundry nicely, though without the space-saving feature of the more
expensive travel bags.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Won't leave home without 'em.

MISSIONARY TELLS TALE OF CHECHNYA CAPTIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY ETTENBOROUGH  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Herb Gregg carries inside his pocket a small, white candle,
pressed flat and tucked inside a pouch.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sole reminder that he keeps with him of his nearly
eight months of captivity in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   This memento isn't about his captors' daily arguments over
whether he should live or die.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about the beatings and the isolation in a dim room the
size of an elevator.
</P>
<P>
   It's not about the right finger that was chopped off and mailed
to his missionary organization with a videotape demanding $3
million in ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The candle is about the changes that God made in the life of the
man from Mesa and about the hope he said he found in the midst of a
terrifying ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   In his daughter's comfortable home in Mesa, 53-year-old Gregg
looks nothing like the thin, shaggy-haired, bearded man who stepped
off a plane in Moscow nearly a year ago, after Russian Interior
Ministry troops freed him from Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
   His brownish hair is cut short. His clothes are clean and
pressed. The smile, though, is the same one he flashed then when
asked what would he say to his captors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That God really loves them,'' he answered.
</P>
<P>
   He prays for the men who forced him into a car on Nov. 11, 1998,
on his way home from a youth basketball game in Dagestan, in the
southern part of Russia. He and his wife, Linda, taught English at
the university there as missionaries with the Evangelical Alliance
Mission, based in Wheaton, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just young men, a lot of them the age of my son. I
could see them trapped in this terrible darkness . . . trapped more
than I was,'' Gregg said this week. Until recently, he had declined
interview requests since his June 29 release.
</P>
<P>
   Only God, in his mysterious ways, knows why he was captured and
why he was spared, Gregg said.
</P>
<P>
   He has theories: He and his wife have more work to do; God
wanted to show people that he still performs miracles.
</P>
<P>
   But, mostly, Gregg believes that the experience was about the
changes in his spiritual life, represented by the candle.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the middle of his captivity, he was given a few matches
and the candle to light briefly while he ate.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when he was sure he was going to the killing camp for
hostages whose ransoms went unpaid, he prepared. He put the
precious candle in his pocket, along with matches and some
bandages, torn from the lining of a coat.
</P>
<P>
   But they never came for him.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the candle in his pocket changed. It flattened, in
the same way Gregg's ego and pride were flattened, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a still person. For 33 years, I've been running around
all over the world. So God stopped me in my tracks, and the Holy
Spirit started pinpointing (areas of sin). . . . He gave me a
revival in that little washroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg described himself as an intense man and an impatient one,
driven to do the next thing and reach the next goal. The man who
returned home is more gentle, patient and kind, more appreciative
of ordinary things.
</P>
<P>
   Before reuniting with him, Linda Gregg, 52, worried about her
husband's mental state. She knew that some prisoners of war, for
example, never recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked into his eyes, I saw peace and joy and love,''
she said. ``I think it's a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The main goal in taking Gregg hostage was to get ransom money to
buy weapons to fight the Russian government. Gregg knew his mission
agency's policy: No ransoms will be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he asked God that the ransom would be paid, that he would
be released, that his hand would not be cut off and that he would
not be sent to the death camp.
</P>
<P>
   He also prayed for his family, especially his grandson, Caleb,
who was born with Fanconi anemia, a rare and fatal genetic
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his captivity, he received no news from his family.
He said he didn't know whether Caleb was alive.
</P>
<P>
   Coming home to his family, holding his grandson again, learning
that his daughter was pregnant with twins _ girls now 3 months old
_ is hard to describe, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like it's too good to be true. It's like coming
into a dream from a nightmare,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg said he worked with a trauma counselor but hasn't had
nightmares or flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   He and Linda have spent the year resting, recovering and
visiting churches in the Valley and in the United States where
congregations prayed for him. They stayed with their married
daughter in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, the Greggs will go to another dangerous country
to teach English, to make friends and to share about the love of
Jesus, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are too great, and the eternal aspect is too
important, to just sit around and not go,'' he said. ``If you
really believe what Scripture says, you share it.''
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare, it's 3-year-old Caleb's life that is on their
minds. A bone marrow transplant could lengthen his life, but
there's no family match.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is happiness, said their daughter, Amy Glover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to see every day as a gift,'' she said. ``We see
Caleb's life as a gift. We see my dad's life as a gift. When you
can do that, you can really rise above in a healthy way, not in a
way you are pretending things don't hurt, but you can face it and
still have joy and peace in your heart. We have learned to be so
thankful for one another.'' &QL;

BRITAIN PLEDGES TROOPS TO SECURE SIERRA LEONE AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (With: SIERRA-LEONE and SIERRA-LEONE-U.N.) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain said Monday that it was sending at least 700
troops to Sierra Leone to secure the airport so that Europeans
there could safely leave. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the
British soldiers were not going as ``combat troops,'' but he did
not rule out their assisting the U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Parliament, Cook said, ``We must not allow a few
thousand rebels to prevent the end to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the British takeover of the airport would also allow the
United Nations to bring in reinforcements for its peacekeeping
force, which is 3,000 short of its mandated strength of 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Iain Duncan Smith, the shadow defense secretary for the
Conservatives, said he supported the action, but he added: ``The
concern I would have is that it is clear in their mandate that they
are there to get the British nationals out, but not to get sucked
into a civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Geoffrey Hoon said the relatively large number
of troops was necessary to ensure that the British force would be
able to operate in such a chaotic situation. ``We have to make sure
they have the resources to protect themselves as well as those they
are seeking to evacuate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair's chief spokesman, Alastair Campbell,
declined to discuss how long the troops would remain and whether
they would have a broader mission than just holding the airport and
getting people out of the country safely. ``I'm not going to
predict all eventualities,'' he said. ``We have a very difficult
and worsening situation and British forces have been sent for a
very specific purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Office on Monday ordered the estimated 500 Britons
living in Sierra Leone to leave the embattled country, where about
300 U.N. troops have been taken hostage by rebels and another 200
are missing as a fragile peace breaks down. Cook told Parliament
that the rebels and their leader, Foday Sankoh, bear full
responsibility for the current outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
   He said Britain would evacuate an additional 250 Europeans and
50 citizens of commonwealth nations. The British High Commission in
Freetown was giving people instructions on how to proceed, though
it was not clear when the actual departures would start. ``Our
immediate advice to British residents in Freetown is to stay
indoors,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   An advance force of 250 British paratroopers crossed into the
country from Senegal on Monday and another 200 were flying there
from Brize Norton Air Force Base in Oxfordshire. The Royal Navy's
helicopter-carrier Ocean, the frigate Chatham and three support
vessels will arrive near West Africa, off the coast of Sierra
Leone, early next week, Cook said. All told, as many as 1,600
troops would ultimately be involved.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cook said that reasons for keeping the British troops there
would be reviewed daily, but he did not put any time limit on their
stay. ``We will weigh the value of its presence against the
security and safety of those who are in it,'' he told Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, pressed Cook to say
that the army had only the one mandate of ``getting British
nationals out.'' He brought forth a testy response from Cook by
asserting that ``the sorry tale of Sierra Leone shows that, with
the best will in the world, there are limits to what can be done by
the United Nations attempting to keep the peace that has never been
properly struck.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook countered: ``It does seem to me that the message that
should go out from this House is not one that we are about to
accept the collapse of the U.N. operation, or, between the lines,
that we might be secretly gratified to see the collapse of the U.N.
operation. We are all wanting to work to make a success of that
European operation and will take every possible step that we can,
as Britain, to do so.''

BEETHOVEN AND KADDISH ECHO THROUGH A NAZI CAMP SITE
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAUTHAUSEN, Austria _ In this land of musical effervescence and,
lately, political uproar, silence spoke louder than either after an
account of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony by Sir Simon Rattle and the
Vienna Philharmonic on Sunday evening. The performance, at which
the audience had been asked not to applaud, took place at the
quarry of a former Nazi camp here, 120 miles east of Vienna. And
although it had been in planning stages for four years, mostly
without opposition, it recently became a hot issue.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the idea said it trivialized an infamous
slaughterhouse of the Holocaust. Others labeled the Philharmonic's
action merely as ineffectual given the rise of Joerg Haider and his
pugnacious right-wing Freedom Party. And the strongest opposition
came from survivors of the Mauthausen camp and its dozens of
satellites throughout Austria, and those who claimed to speak for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to keep it a holy place,'' said Leon Zelman, 73, the
director of the Jewish Welcome Service of Vienna, which helps
refugees revisit Austria. Zelman, a survivor himself, hatched the
notion of such a concert in 1995 to call attention to a part of
Austrian history too often studiously ignored, in hopes that the
effort would serve as a bridge to a more enlightened future.
</P>
<P>
   The quarry looks even today like the unholiest of holy places.
At one end a curving stone staircase, broad, rough and steep, rises
186 steps. Prisoners were endlessly forced to lug heavy stones up
the steps, sometimes only to be arbitrarily pushed back down to
their deaths. Their captors possessed a hellish repertory of lethal
means: gas, gunshots, medical ``experiments,'' overwork,
undernourishment. In all some 105,000 died at Mauthausen: Jews,
non-Jews from all over Eastern Europe and elsewhere, homosexuals,
Communists, ``antisocials.''
</P>
<P>
   Any concerned parties who stayed away from the music on
principle should know, at least, that there was nothing of the
circus about it. It began with addresses: by Elisabeth Orth, an
Austrian actress who was the host of the evening, which was
broadcast live in major cities and slightly delayed on national
television; by Thomas Klestil, the president of Austria, and Franz
Fischler, a member of the European Commission, who had signed on as
patrons; by proxy from the Holocaust survivor and author Elie
Wiesel, who canceled his plans to attend as a protest against
Haider; and by Hellsberg.
</P>
<P>
   The evening continued with Jewish prayers of mourning: Kaddish,
recited by Paul Chaim Eisenberg, the chief rabbi of Vienna; and
``El Moleh Rachamim,'' sung by Samuel Barzilai, the chief cantor,
accompanied by members of the Vienna Philharmonic and the Wiener
Singverein.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the very presence of the Vienna Philharmonic, with its
own dark history, on such an occasion was a problem for some. ``The
Philharmonic is part of the history of Austria,'' Zelman
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Just how integral a part is made clear with the coincidental
publication in the United States of ``Alma Rose: Vienna to
Auschwitz,'' by Richard Newman, Canadian music critic. The
protagonist, it may be recalled from Fania Fenelon's book,
``Playing for Time,'' became the leader of a women's orchestra in
Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she died at 37, probably from botulism.
</P>
<P>
   The book also tells the story of her father, who had been a
revered concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic for 57 years
before being unceremoniously dismissed with the other Jewish
players on the day of the Austrian Anschluss in 1938. By the end of
the war 50 percent of the members of the orchestra were Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Zelman's close friendship with members of the
orchestra, including Resel and Hellsberg, that gave shape to the
idea in the first place. And Zelman argues forcibly that the sins
of the fathers should not be visited on the present players.
</P>
<P>
   Hellsberg, who is also the orchestra's archivist and the author
of an unsparing history, ``Demokratie der Koenige'' (``Democracy of
Kings''), expanded on the evening's basic purpose in his address.
``We wished to think of those members of the Philharmonic who were
victims of the Nazis,'' he said. ``They were our predecessors,
royal and imperial court musicians, highly decorated professors and
teachers at the academy, highly respected artists who were
humiliated, driven to death or murdered. We want to pay our
respects to them by performing a work that they often performed
under the leading conductors of their times.''
</P>
<P>
   And that work, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, was the final bone of
contention, chiefly because of its use of Schiller's ``Ode to Joy''
in the finale. The planners fastened chiefly on the text's
visionary passages, like ``Alle Menschen werden Brueder'' (``All
men become brothers''). But yes, there was joy: even if, for
Beethoven, a joy hard won, as Sir Simon, the conductor, pointed out
at the news conference, elaborating on his description in a printed
statement of the work's journey from ``deepest darkness to
fellowship, generosity and light.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it was done outdoors and rather crudely amplified, and
because of all the emotional and even moral overtones accruing in
the quarry, it was easier to evaluate the run-up performance of the
work on Sunday morning, at the orchestra's splendid home in the
Musikverein. Sir Simon led a dynamic performance, and the amateur
Singverein improbably matched the orchestra at every turn. The
performance swept all before it.
</P>
<P>
   At the evening performance the audience of 11,000 was asked to
refrain from applause, and against all odds it did. The silence was
overwhelmingly eloquent, showing respect and awe for the occasion.
Even the birds in the surrounding trees, which had been singing
their own joyous songs throughout, were quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Candles, which had been distributed to all, were lighted
onstage, and in the audience, where many had already been
illuminated during the anthem to brotherhood. The stage emptied in
sustained silence.

   The names are cataloged alphabetically according to conflict. I
click on the heading for the Vietnam War, scroll down the long list
and stop at random. The name on the computer screen is Donald W.
Evans Jr.
</P>
<P>
   That's your answer.
</P>
<P>
   All this week, the 25th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,
newspapers and TV programs will be filled with writers, politicians
and historians trying to explain to us what the war in Southeast
Asia was all about.
</P>
<P>
   It was all about Donald W. Evans Jr.
</P>
<P>
   According to the information accompanying his Medal of Honor
citation, Evans was a 23-year-old specialist fourth class in the
U.S. Army. A medic. The army's Center for Military History
maintains a Web site (www.army.mil/ &QL; 
cmh-pg/moh1.htm) that lists the full texts of all the Medal of
Honor citations.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,400 of the medals have been awarded, beginning with
the Civil War. Nineteen individuals have earned two, and 574 were
awarded posthumously. What the recipients did is summed up in a
single long paragraph, not often well-written, occasionally
ungrammatical, consistently too terse and cliche-ridden.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Evans' citation describes his actions on Jan. 27, 1967, at a
place called Tri Tam. It reads in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``He left his position of relative safety with his platoon which
had not yet been committed to the battle to answer the calls for
medical aid from the wounded men of another platoon which was
heavily engaged with the enemy force. Dashing across 100 meters of
open area through a withering hail of enemy fire and exploding
grenades, he administered lifesaving treatment to 1 individual and
continued to expose himself to the deadly enemy fire as he moved to
treat each of the other wounded men and to offer them
encouragement. Realizing that the wounds of 1 man required
immediate attention, Sp4c. Evans dragged the injured soldier back
across the dangerous fire-swept area to a secure position from
which he could be further evacuated. Miraculously escaping the
enemy fusillade, Sp4c. Evans returned to the forward location. As
he continued the treatment of the wounded, he was struck by
fragments from an enemy grenade. Despite his serious and painful
injury he succeeded in evacuating another wounded comrade, rejoined
his platoon as it was committed to battle and was soon treating
other wounded soldiers. As he evacuated another wounded man across
the fire covered field, he was severely wounded. Continuing to
refuse medical attention and ignoring advice to remain behind, he
managed with his waning strength to move yet another wounded
comrade across the dangerous open area to safety. Disregarding his
painful wounds and seriously weakened from profuse bleeding, he
continued his lifesaving aid and was killed while treating another
wounded comrade.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 239 Medals of Honor awarded in Vietnam. You can read
one citation a day for the rest of the year and know what the war
was all about. Forget the politicians and the historians and the
hacks like me. Remember what poet W.H. Auden said:

`HALF A HEART': UNCERTAIN PATH TO REUNION FOR MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end of review)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rosellen Brown has long been interested in that place where
private concerns intersect with public values, where the personal
and the political collide. In ``Civil Wars'' (1984) she depicted
the disintegration of a marriage against the backdrop of the civil
rights movement. In ``Before and After'' (1992) she examined the
fallout from a terrible crime on a family and the community it
belongs to. And in her latest novel, ``Half a Heart,'' she looks at
the ways in which race affects a woman's relationship with the
half-black daughter she hasn't seen in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are moments in ``Half a Heart'' where Brown's
gift for rendering her characters' inner lives shines through, the
novel feels far more programmatic than her earlier books, as though
she were struggling to execute a paint-by-numbers picture of an
unfamiliar subject. Its plot too often wobbles into the
predictable; its characters too often behave like stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, we learn, Brown's heroine, Miriam Vener, was a
civil rights advocate who moved to Mississippi, had an affair with
a black teacher and allowed him to take custody of their baby
daughter, Veronica. Since then Miriam has retreated into the
monied, bourgeois world of her youth. She is now married to a
wealthy doctor, has three lovely children and lives in an opulent
house in a gracious Houston suburb where her neighbors have no idea
of her secret past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her friends were given no way to suspect that her children
were replacement children,'' Brown writes, ``her life a replacement
life, her love a replacement love. Sometimes she felt as though she
lived beside a graveyard that she circled the long way around,
holding her breath, to avoid walking through it.''
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with this novel is that Brown never makes
Miriam's long-ago decision to abandon Veronica remotely plausible.
Why would Miriam _ who, we are repeatedly told, is a fiercely
liberal-minded woman _ assent to her former boyfriend's argument
that she would have difficulty, as a white woman, raising a child
of mixed race? Why did she make no effort to retain custody of
Veronica or reach a joint-custody agreement? Why did she allow 17
years to pass before making an effort to get in touch with Veronica
or see how she was doing? Why, given her and her husband's enormous
financial resources, did she make no effort to see whether Veronica
needed help paying for school?
</P>
<P>
   Though she makes vague allusions to Miriam's passivity and shame
over having an out-of-wedlock child, Brown does not provide a
persuasive explanation for her heroine's curious behavior. As a
result Miriam comes across as a curiously hardhearted woman: a wimp
when it comes to fighting for the child she says she loves, a
hypocrite when it comes to matters of race.
</P>
<P>
   Miriam's behavior, once she has reacquainted herself with
Veronica, is equally difficult to understand. Brown writes that she
feels ``a kind of liquid joy flooding her veins'' at the prospect
of getting Veronica to press charges against a police officer for
sexual harassment even though a lawyer tells her that the case is
unwinnable, even though Veronica herself worries that such charges
would expose her to terrible humiliation. For Miriam, apparently,
it is simply a chance to relive the civil rights actions she
participated in as a young woman.
</P>
<P>
   As for Veronica, she is often as unsympathetic as her mother.
She has decided to accept Miriam's overtures because she sees her
as ``a cash cow'' who can bankroll her college education and acting
ambitions. She just has to work ``her way around to getting her
hands on the keys to the safe,'' even if that means having to
accept a hug here and there. She sees Miriam, so eager to
re-establish a mother-daughter bond, as ``desperation on toast.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a compelling story might be told about two such
difficult women trying to come to terms with each other, but Brown
repeatedly subverts the emotional through-line of her narrative by
setting up sentimental confrontations in which her characters
discuss the color of their skin. They consequently seem less like
individuals reacting to the social pressures of the world around
them than race-obsessed people parroting racial cliches.
</P>
<P>
   When Veronica tells her father that she wants to go to Stanford,
he asks her why she wants to go to ``White Folks' Heaven.'' When
Veronica goes on a date with a white boy, she turns to him and
says, ``So what can you tell me about black life in this wonderful
country?'' And when one of Miriam's old friends from the civil
rights days meets Veronica, she thinks, ``It was such a relief to
see her brown-sugar skin'' in Miriam's house. ``It was home.''
</P>
<P>
   While passages devoted to the characters' daily routines are
energized by the sort of emotional detail that distinguished
Brown's earlier books, this novel frequently lapses into
embarrassingly flabby romance novel prose. Of Miriam's anger, Brown
writes, it ``was building its bonfires on all sides of her, fed by
the past, fed by the present, and there was no place in it finally,
thank God, for tears.'' And of Miriam's grief after abandoning
Veronica, ``She was metal, she was stone, not wood, not anything
that had ever breathed or grown or leafed out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such prose is uncharacteristic of the usually meticulous Brown,
just as this novel feels like an uncharacteristic lapse in her
career, a story told more as a melodramatic made-for-television
movie than a heartfelt work of fiction.

CHINESE MARK EMBASSY BOMBING ANNIVERSARY WITH LOOK TO FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ One year ago Monday, university students were hurling
bricks at the U.S. Embassy in a rage over the NATO bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade that killed three and injured 20. Now,
they spent a balmy Monday attending classes or playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government, which last year railed against American
perfidy and imperialist ambitions, commemorated the bombing in a
low-key manner, as well. A government spokesman restated China's
position that the American explanation that the attack resulted
from targeting errors remains inadequate. An editorial in the
People's Daily called on Chinese to channel their continued anger
into strengthening the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese say they still believe the bombing had to have been
intentional, meant to warn or punish China, and resentment
persists. But now, the government and people want most to see the
China trade bill pass Congress this month, solidifying economic
ties by ending the annual review of China's trade status and
insuring that American companies benefit from the United
States-China trade agreement that was negotiated in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities do not want to goad the United States before the
vote on the disputed legislation to grant China permanent trade
privileges, and passed the word that demonstrations would not be in
order.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with students at People's University here Monday
found no sentiment for renewed rock throwing in any case, but
instead an appreciation of the political divisions in the United
States over China and serious concern about the trade vote.
</P>
<P>
   Zhou Jiubo, 21, who is studying management, was at the U.S.
Embassy in May heaving bricks. ``We were all hot-headed and
angry,'' he recalled. ``But now we've taken to heart the
government's advice to study hard and make China strong. We need to
make our country stronger so it won't be subject to bullying any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao Bingling, 22, a law student, said, ``We haven't forgotten
about the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   What now worries her more, she said, is the congressional trade
vote, which many here see as a litmus test of American attitudes.
If the bill is defeated, she said, ``I think there will be a very
strong reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People would see that as a slap in the face for China, showing
that Americans despise our country,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-American relations are improving, but have not recovered
to where they were before the NATO attack and the anti-American
outpouring that followed in several Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   An unrealistic euphoria about a possible ``strategic
partnership'' had gripped some officials on both sides after
President Clinton's visit in 1998, when he bantered with President
Jiang Zemin and became a hero to many Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   China's adamant opposition to the NATO campaign in Kosovo,
coupled with the embassy bombing, led to feelings of betrayal, and
Chinese strategists focused more sharply on the chances of future
conflict with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On the American side, too, the events were sobering reminders of
the many enduring differences, whether over America's military role
in Asia or human rights, that insure a rocky relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Clinton administration moved quickly to mend ties,
and the Chinese, as soon as wounded pride would allow, reopened
their doors to American officials. Late last year, they made
sweeping trade concessions in a deal to secure American support for
China's entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   And Beijing and Washington reached agreements to compensate for
the Chinese victims and property damage in the embassy bombing, as
well as for damage to American diplomatic missions in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the bombing, Chinese experts gave more attention to the
potential for confrontation in the Sino-American relationship,''
said Yang Mingjie, a foreign policy expert at the Chinese Institute
of Contemporary International Relations, a government research
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the Chinese national strategy is still to promote economic
development, and I don't think the government wants to change
policy and portray the United States as a potential enemy,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commentary Monday in the People's Daily, the prime
mouthpiece of the governing Communist Party, praised the Chinese
people for their unity in the face of ``hegemonism'' by an unnamed
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this contest between justice and evil and between truth and
power politics, we launched a firm struggle and won a major
victory,'' it said without elaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inadvertently, the article displayed the contradictions
that face the Communist leaders as they simultaneously condemn
``Westernization'' and urge greater openness to the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hostile international forces are redoubling their pressures on
us, undertaking to Westernize and divide us,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   But it then added, ``Reform and opening up remain the key to
building a strong and prosperous country.''

   NORTHERN IRELAND: PROTESTANT OPTIMISM
</P>
<P>
   A key Protestant politician predicted that the Ulster Unionist
Party would accept the Irish Republican Army's offer to open its
secret arms arsenal to international inspection as a basis for
agreeing to re-enter the Northern Ireland home rule government with
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political allies. John Taylor, the unionists'

<P>
   Ken Livingstone, the leftist gadfly who won the race for
London's first elected mayor despite Prime Minister Tony Blair's
efforts to block his candidacy, was sworn into office without
ceremony. Livingstone said he intended to cooperate with the
national government but warned he might go to court to get greater

   Groups representing unions and employers held their first

   Two more suspected Breton separatists are being held for
questioning in the bombings of two McDonald's restaurants in
Brittany, the police announced, bringing to five the total of
suspects in custody. A McDonald's employee was killed in the April
19 bombing. More than 1,000 demonstrators met in Rennes, the

   CHECHNYA: RUSSIAN BOMBER LOST

<P>
   Russian military officials say a bomber was lost in bad weather
over southern Chechnya and may have been shot down. Pro-Chechen
Internet sites _ often unreliable _ said the plane was downed by a
shoulder-fired antiaircraft missile, and displayed photographs of
what was said to be part of an aircraft wing. Russian officials,
seeking to shield the crew, refused to say where the plane went
down; the Chechens said a hunt for the ``pilot-terrorist'' was
under way.

   Prime Minister Ehud Barak angered Palestinians by saying he is

Jerusalem he was set to give them as a ``down payment'' on a future
territorial transfer. His statements soured negotiations, which

<P>
   In a new surge of violence that has claimed 16 lives in Chiapas
state since February, three villagers were killed and three wounded
by four gunmen in an Indian township. The attack, attributed by
officials to a land dispute, came soon after the first visit to the
township by Bishop Felipe Arizmendi after he took over the
turbulent diocese last week. The township, Chenalho, was the site
of the December 1997 massacre of 45 Indians.

   MEXICO: MAYORAL PROTEST

   About 150,000 supporters of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the

   SIERRA-LEONE-U.N. (United Nations) _ As he scrambled on several
fronts to stave off the collapse of the U.N. peacekeeping mission
in Sierra Leone, Secretary General Kofi Annan met here Monday with

that the United States might help transport reinforcements to the
unstable West African country. ``We are looking at ways we can be

   EBAY-AUCTION (Undated) _ On April 28, a California man who uses
the handle ``golfpoorly'' put a half dozen items up for sale on
eBay, the online auction company. Along with an unopened roll of
twine, a never inflated basketball, a Mexican voodoo mask, a
Netgear network card and a pewter frame, he offered a ``great big
wild abstract painting'' that he said was bought years ago at a
garage sale in Berkeley and has a small hole inflicted by a son
wielding a bicycle. He asked for bids to open at a quarter. On
Monday bids for that painting, which may be a 1952 work by Richard
Diebenkorn, were up to $135,605. If the sale, which ends Monday
night, goes through, and if the painting is genuine, it would be
not only a stunning and serendipitous investment for ``golfpoorly''
but also probably the second-highest price paid online for a work
of art. By Judith H. Dobrzynski.

   DELAY-TRADE (Washington) _ After a bill-signing ceremony in the
Oval Office last month, President Clinton sidled up to an unlikely
ally in his fight to pass a decisive trade bill with China, the
administration's top foreign policy goal. ``We talked about what
each of us has to do and we gave each other some advice,'' said
Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the House majority whip and one of
Clinton's most vitriolic critics on Capitol Hill, who refused to
discuss the details of the conversation. With the crucial vote just
over two weeks away, DeLay, who led the charge to impeach Clinton,
now finds himself in the improbable role of the president's chief
water-carrier and potential legacy-builder in an all-out battle to
grant China permanent normal trading privileges. By Eric Schmitt.

PILATES METHOD FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR CONTROLLED FORM OF EXERCISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Dancers do it.
</P>
<P>
   But they're not the only ones _ not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilates Method comprises more than 500 specifically designed
low-impact, controlled movements that engage body and mind in
creating more flexibility, better balance and greater strength.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Glover credits Pilates (pronounced puh-LAH-teez) with
correcting a painful misalignment in his left hip resulting from a
childhood accident. He is the financial backer of a new Pilates
studio in Hollywood. Other Pilates devotees from the rich and
famous set include Dustin Hoffman, Drew Barrymore, Madonna, Monica,
Melanie Griffith and Jodie Foster.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trend that started strong on both coasts and is now
gaining converts in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Pilates' movements stretch and strengthen muscles to promote
complete body conditioning and balance. Emphasis is on
concentration; smooth, controlled movements; correct body
alignment; and proper breathing, says Zoe Stein Pierce, a Fort
Worth dancer and certified Pilates instructor at Dancescape Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Pilates works on the deep muscles of the abdomen, lower back and
buttocks, ``the powerhouse'' of the body, in Pilates jargon. These
strong muscles, centered in the middle of the body, enable the rest
of the body to move freely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilates starts in your middle, where everything connects, and
works its way out,'' says Stein Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to mat or floor exercises, Pilates includes work on
some jungle-gym-type equipment with springs and belts and stirrups
and bars that provide the extra resistance or added momentum
necessary to get the most out of a particular movement.
</P>
<P>
   With names like the Universal Reformer, the Cadillac, the Small
Barrel and the Wundachair, Pilates equipment can be a little
intimidating, and in fact should not be used without specific
instructions, Stein Pierce says.
</P>
<P>
   Named for Joseph Pilates, the German gymnast who developed the
exercises before moving to New York City in 1926, Pilates became
the best-kept secret of graceful dancers with perfect posture in
the 1930s and '40s. George Balanchine and Martha Graham frequented
his studio and sent their students to Pilates.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is still popular with ballet dancers, for both
training and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Harris, 25, wanted to dance the lead in the Houston
Ballet's performance of ``Sleeping Beauty'' at Bass Performance
Hall last May. She wanted it more than anything in the world _
almost.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was 16 when she left her home in Arlington to enroll in
the Houston Ballet Academy. She was 23 when she was promoted to
soloist for the company's 1997-'98 season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, she was a star when the company was
preparing to go on tour with ``Sleeping Beauty'' _ but she was a
star whose right knee hurt so badly she couldn't always walk on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heartbreaking,'' Harris says. ``I wanted to dance
Aurora here at home so badly. It was my dream, and it was coming
true, but I had been struggling with my knee all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more than I wanted to dance the lead in ``Sleeping
Beauty,'' I wanted to be able to walk when I'm 60.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris underwent two knee surgeries and months of rehabilitation
centered around Pilates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilates was part of my training with the Houston Ballet
Academy,'' says Harris. ``They have a huge Pilates studio right
there at the school. So I had been doing Pilates for years. I
sought out Pilates to help me rehabilitate after my surgery last
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris is in Pilates training at Dancescape, with plans to
obtain certification as an instructor through the PhysicalMind
Institute in Santa Fe, N.M. It is one of several organizations that
certify Pilates teachers. Another is the Pilates Studio Worldwide,
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a feel-good class,'' says Pam Heston, directing a
small group of students, including Harris, recently at Dancescape.
``Don't make it work.... It should be so easy. You don't hold
positions, like in yoga; you move through them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pilates is also especially appealing to baby boomers who may
also be doing aerobic exercise and weight training and just want to
get their bodies more flexible and not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``My general population ranges from their early 20s to about
65,'' says Karen Camelet, who teaches Pilates about 25 hours a week
at No Quitters Personalized Training in Fort Worth. She also dances
for the Bruce Wood Dance Company and works with young dancers at
Gayle Corkery School of Ballet to help them develop stronger, more
graceful bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilates is so popular right now, and the kids love it,'' she
says. ``People are always coming up to ask me about it after they
read an article with some movie star talking about it in ``Vogue''
or some other magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilates just makes me feel really strong _ strong from my
core,'' Camelet says. ``I get injured less and know more about how
my body works and how much I can push myself.''
</P>
<P>
   David Estes is a Fort Worth chiropractor who practices Pilates
and likens it to the wellness branch of chiropractic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilates helps individuals correct a lot of the same problems I
see in my treatment,'' Estes says. ``Exercise can be crazy. The
only thing the average person gets from exercise is to strengthen
his or her imbalances. Pilates is a deliberate, healthy way to move
through space, rather than a clumsy, unhealthy way that's likely to
injure you.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for everything. Bad backs and sore necks are caused
by bad fronts. If you don't have integrity in your abdominal
muscles, it will hurt sooner or later in your back. Human beings
are not meant to sit all day. We should be moving all the time,
every day, in a wide range of motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People today stay in one spot and do one type of motion all
day. We should be in constant motion,'' Estes says. Research for

KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMY COMMANDER IS SLAIN OUTSIDE HIS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia_ A well-known commander of the disbanded
Kosovo Liberation Army was shot and killed Monday outside his home
in the southern town of Prizren as he headed to work.
</P>
<P>
   The reason behind the shooting of the former leader, Ekrem
Rexha, was not immediately clear, although it was thought to be
politically related given his years with the guerrilla army. The
commander, who was better known by his war pseudonym, Commander
Drini, had headed one of seven regional zones of the liberation
army during its war against the Serb military and police forces.
And he also had served on the army's general staff during the three
months of the NATO bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In his years with the liberation army, Drini was always aware
that hardline ethnic Albanian nationalists in Kosovo did not trust
him or like the fact that he was ethnic Torbesh, or Muslim Slav.
</P>
<P>
   His death also comes just three weeks after the killing of
another former KLA commander and hero, Besim Mala, who was shot
dead in a dispute with a business associate in the capital of
Kosovo, Pristina. The argument and shooting, in which both men
died, was over the ownership of a cafe in downtown Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after KLA guerrillas came down from the hills as
NATO forces arrived and Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo, old
comrades in the liberation army are having major disagreements and
even turning their guns on each other in local power struggles. And
as the international administration in Kosovo prepares the province
for local elections in October, many Albanians say they are afraid
that a wave of political violence lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the liberation army, Drini has been working in the
local administration in his hometown of Prizren as an environment
and safety officer, and was thought to be aspiring to be the town's
future mayor. He was considered to be an intelligent and urbane
man, who said he spoke seven languages. He was also widely liked
and respected by international observers who dealt with him both
during and after the war.
</P>
<P>
   A professional soldier and a former officer in the Communist-era
Yugoslav People's Army, Drini taught at the army's military staff
college in Sarajevo. He fought in the Croatian army during that
country's war and returned to his native Kosovo to join the
liberation army in the late 1990s as the conflict there escalated.
</P>
<P>
   He was commander of Pashtrik zone in southwestern Kosovo, and
when NATO began its bombing campaign, Gen. Agim Ceku, the commander
of the liberation army, brought him onto the general staff and made
him chief of operations. He organized a special battle group in the
Pagarushe valley in central Kosovo where some of the heaviest
fighting against Serbian forces occurred, according to one western
military observer who monitored events.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Ceku and a few others helped professionalize the
general staff during a critical time. His contribution was to move
away from big unit tactics to a more classic guerrilla style
operation,'' the observer said. ``They brought a lot of stability
to the general staff when the KLA was close to falling apart in the
first weeks when they were really being pounded. I think he
provided some real leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Drini left the liberation army almost immediately after the war
ended, declining to continue as the guerrilla army was disbanded
and transformed itself into the civilian Kosovo Protection Corps.
He was aware that some liberation army members distrusted him
because of his ethnic origin and his background in the people's
army. But friends said that he left the liberation army because he
saw that the new force would be nothing like a real army.
</P>
<P>
   At 8.30 a.m. Monday, after drinking tea with his brother, he
stepped out of his house to go to work, according to local reports.
He found his car had a flat tire and was just returning to the
house when three men in a red car drove by. They opened fire with
an automatic weapon. His brother tried give him first aid, but
Drini died almost immediately, the reports said.

   EDITORS:
</P>
<P>
   This is another installment in a period communique to editors
who receive The New York Times News Service. If you have seen
earlier copies, you know what it is all about, and I recommend you
save yourself time and skip to the first subhed.
</P>
<P>
   For editors who missed earlier explanations, here it is:
</P>
<P>
   As executive editor of this wire service, I want to make contact
with the people who read and use what we produce. So I am sending
this periodic newsletter to give editors occasional glimpses inside
The Times, illuminating who we are, how we think and why we do what
we do. I hope wire editors will pass this along to managing
editors, executive editors, department heads _ anybody who might be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE FIELD  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEWCOMER IN RUSSIA: Patrick E. Tyler, a distinguished foreign
correspondent whose byline was out of the paper for more than a
year while he mastered a new language, is now in The Times' Moscow
bureau. Before his crash course in Russian, Pat was in China, in
the Beijing bureau.
</P>
<P>
   VETERAN IN CHINA: Craig S. Smith is now the Times correspondent
in Shanghai. Formerly with The Wall Street Journal reporting from
the same city, he succeeds Seth Faison, who has taken a leave from
The Times to write a book.
</P>
<P>
   SPANNING TWO CONTINENTS: Anthony DePalma has undertaken a novel
new assignment for the business desk. He is the hemispheric
business correspondent, charged with illuminating the growing
economic relationships that stretch from Canada to Patagonia. Tony
is now based in the New York office, returning from Toronto where
he had covered Canada for several years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE HOUSE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AN AWARD: The Times has a staff award in memory of Nathaniel
Nash, the correspondent who died in a plane crash in Croatia four
years ago _ the same crash that killed the U.S. trade
representative, Ron Brown. The award is given to a reporter ``who
excels in business or economic news, nationally or abroad, just as
Nahaniel did.'' This year's recipient is Steve Lohr, a senior
writer for the Business Day section who has been a foreign
correspondent, beat reporter, editor, technology writer and much
more. For nearly two years, his name been one of the reporters
assigned full time to the Microsoft cae, and he is often the one
who performs the high wire act of writing the news analysis sidebar
on deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A PROMOTION: The Times's design director, Tom Bodkin, has been
added to the newspaper's masthead as an assistant managing editor.
Joe Lelyveld, the executive editor, said Tom's elevation was in
recognition of his work in leading the paper through a series of
perilous transitions. As custodian of the look of The Times, he
brightened and modernized the paper's appearance over a period of
years, and finally, three years ago, he guided the paper through
its transition to color. Editors who read the ASNE's publication
The American Editor may have noticed Tom's essay in the last issue,
in which he discussed his ideas on newspaper design.

&HT;     DEATHS DUE TO MEDICAL ERRORS MAY BE MORE WIDESPREAD THAN
ESTIMATED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A widely publicized report saying that as many as
98,000 people die each year in the United States from medical
errors is conservative, and the number is probably much larger than
that, one of the study's authors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) is low because
it looked only at deaths of patients at hospitals, said author
Janet M. Corrigan, IOM's director of health care services. The
Institute is a private, nonprofit organization that provides health
policy advice under a congressional charter to the National Academy
of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan told reporters at a Capitol Hill briefing Monday that
the study did not look at medical-error deaths at nursing homes,
emergency rooms or in doctors' offices. The mortality estimates are
low also, she said, because most of the information was based on
medical record reviews. ``Medical errors are a problem that has
been hidden,'' Corrigan added.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine's November report estimated that
medical errors cause 44,000 to 98,000 deaths every year in American
hospitals. Newspapers across the country headlined the story, and
the study spurred many hearings and briefings in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan said lawmakers should create a national center for
patient safety costing $30 million to $35 million a year for the
first few years and $100 million annually after that. The center
would collect data on medical errors and measures to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   She said current private-sector efforts to stop medical errors
``don't go far enough and don't have broad-based support.''
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan also said medical providers need to computerize patient
information since computers can catch human errors, especially in
medications. ``It's hard to justify an industry that still writes
all kinds of information on paper,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances M. Murphy, acting deputy secretary for health policy
and management at the Department of Veterans Affairs, said a
department pilot program in patient safety in Topeka, Kan., has cut
errors in giving medications to patients by two thirds this year.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said patients in the program wore wrist bands with bar
codes _ such those used on supermarket items _ with medical
staffers checking the patients' codes against bar codes on
medications to ensure that drugs were administered correctly and
didn't cause adverse interactions with other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Carmela Coyle, senior vice president for policy at the American
Hospital Association, which represents 5,000 hospitals, said
Congress should create an environment ``so doctors and nurses
(would feel) comfortable to come forward to report medical errors''
without fear of reprisal.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle suggested that lawmakers should take steps to encourage
voluntary medical-error reporting for the less serious mistakes to
prevent them from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   If medical providers fear legal action by revealing errors,
``people won't come forward,'' she said. ``At the core of any
successful reporting system is confidentiality for the caregiver,
the patient and the hospital. She said Congress must prevent
``fishing expeditions'' by malpractice lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle suggested that reporting be made mandatory in cases where
patients are ``seriously and permanently'' harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestions came in a panel discussion sponsored by the
Alliance for Health Reform, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group, and the
Commonwealth Fund, a philanthropic group that focuses on health
care. Sens. John D. Rockerfeller, D-W.Va., who chairs the alliance
and Bill Frist, R-Tenn., who is its vice-chairman, presided over
the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Frist predicted that ``there will be legislation (passed) in
some shape or form on the next several months ''
</P>
<P>
   But Rockefeller said in an interview later that Congress should
not move quickly. ``This is the kind of issue that is best
ingested, and then there is a little reflux and a little more
ingestion,'' he said.

   RWAKITURA, Uganda _ Uganda and Rwanda agreed on Monday to
withdraw all their troops from the third largest city in Congo and
to let United Nations forces take over the area.
</P>
<P>
   If the two nations stick to their pledges, the city, Kisangani,
and its immediate surroundings will become the first ``neutral''
region of Congo, controlled neither by President Laurent Kabila's
government nor by his enemies. Security Council members who
brokered the deal say they will urge Secretary General Kofi Annan
to start sending monitors backed by troops as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the agreement finally completed today in a meeting
between seven Security Council members on a peace mission to Africa
and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, allows virtually every
African leader involved in the Congo war to retreat from the
conflict without appearing to back down. Backtracking by any one of
them could sink the delicate process of untangling a complex war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United
Nations and the leader of the Security Council mission, said after
the agreement was announced here that Rwanda and Uganda, close
allies, were eager to put a clash last week over Kisangani behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something both presidents want,'' Holbrooke said. ``It
was not imposed on them by the Security Council. We just happen to
be in the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke spoke by telephone today with Kabila and President
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who supports Kabila with 12,000 troops,
and said they were pleased with the agreement. Mugabe told the
delegation on Saturday that he was prepared to discuss a withdrawal
but would not be the first to leave. Kabila has always argued that
the war is not a civil war but a result of an invasion by Rwanda
and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of some Congolese rebel groups met the Security Council
delegation. But they are not seen as much of a problem if their
backers in Rawnda and Uganda choose to revive the flagging peace
accord, which was signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni said after the talks here that he and President Paul
Kagame of Rwanda would meet on Sunday to plan their moves in
cooperation with the United Nations mission and a military
commission that represents all six nations in the conflict,
including Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
   Museveni said the tensions with Rwanda on Congolese territory
are ``taking us away from our legitimate problems, which are the
presence of the Interahamwe there and the use of Congo by Sudan to
send terrorists into Uganda.''
</P>
<P>
   The Interahamwe are ethnic Hutu militias responsible for
carrying out a genocidal campaign against Tutsi and their moderate
Hutu supporters in Rwanda in 1994. When a Tutsi-led government took
over that year, the Hutu fled to eastern Congo, then Zaire. At that
time, Rwanda and Uganda were backing Kabila in his drive against
Zaire's dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. About a year after Kabila took
power in Kinshasa, Rwanda and Uganda took up arms against him.
</P>
<P>
   Part of an agreement announced on Sunday in Kigali, the Rwandan
capital, calls for a program to identify the Interahamwe still in
Congo and offer them reintegration into Rwanda or settlement in a
third country.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats who are skeptical of Rwanda's promises, saying
Kagami's government has successfully exported its major problem
with militant Hutu and has no reason to want to see them
rehabilitated. Also, some diplomats say, if densely populated
Rwanda is really in Congo for the natural resources _ diamonds,
gold, timber and rich agricultural land _ the Interahamwe serve as
a convenient excuse for keeping troops there.
</P>
<P>
   Kisangani, called Stanleyville in colonial times, is an
important city of nearly two million people and the capital of a
diamond-producing province, Orientale. It has long been an
important port, built on the Congo River at the point where it
ceases to be navigable for trade. Some United Nations officials in
Kinshasa, the Congo capital, saw the perennial fighting in
Kisangani as a squabble over spoils. If that is the prime
motivation, keeping Kisangani neutral may not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said today that sending in United Nations forces to
the city would ``now become, in our recommendation, the most urgent
next action.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the crisis in Sierra Leone would hamper recruiting
for a Congo operation, a far more complex mission, Holbrooke said:
``None of us in the delegation think that what's happening in
Sierra Leone or even in the Horn of Africa directly affects the
Lusaka peace process on Congo. However, we all recognize the
political context in which these decisions are made. That's
undeniable.'' &QL;

OLYMPIC BEACH VOLLEYBALL SITE IN SYDNEY DRAWS PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Noisy critics of the Sydney Olympics kicked
sand in the eyes of the organizers Monday in a beach protest staged
to attract television coverage and force concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators won network news play here and elsewhere
around the country, but did not win a retreat by officials from a
decision to stage Olympic volleyball at Bondi Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Bondi, a Sydney suburban surf center which is an Australian icon
and tourist favorite, is scheduled to be the location for the beach
volleyball competition. Monday morning, it was the scene of six
hours of political theater about a minor sport that rarely rates
attention.
</P>
<P>
   From dawn about 100 residents opposed to digging up their
neighborhood beach scuffled on the sand with 200 police trying to
keep order with a minimum of headlines while shielding 200 workers
starting foundations for a 10,000-seat arena. That construction
requires shifting about 6,000 tons of sand, excavations that worry
environmentalists and surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the police also deployed two motorboats, a helicopter
and 10 mounted officers, but employed minimal force in moving
activists who buried themselves to the neck in the sand before a
stalled bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   They declined to charge the 25 protesters they briefly detained,
instead driving them a few miles away before they were released.
</P>
<P>
   The protest group, Bondi Olympic Watch, includes environmental
activists, local retailers, young surfers and aging beach regulars
who swim, sunbathe, fly kites and jog year round at the mile-wide
Pacific bay five miles east of downtown Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The group's spokesman, Lenny Kovner, 53, a theater director and
television writer, and a former volleyball player, said 400
opponents of the volleyball competition have signed pledges of
civil disobedience to stop or stall construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not against the Olympics or volleyball, but we oppose
taking much of our beach away for five months for a 10-day event,
which will leave the community nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Building the $7 million arena will entail driving 360 steel
pylons 20 feet into the fine white sand to support 50-feet high
bleachers. Surrounding the framework will be hundreds of 30-foot
long plastic tubes, each filled with about 100 tons of sand to keep
high tides from eroding the foundations.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the demonstrators claim erection of the temporary
volleyball center, to be dismantled in October, will damage the
beach, reduce public access by half and disrupt trade and
transportation for months in an already crowded precinct, where
about 20,000 people live within a few blocks of the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of Olympic site operations, John Quayle,
said, ``Some disturbance is to be expected with any Olympic
facility.'' He promises ``the least possible impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The site manager, Jackie Murdoch, said that Bondi will get a
$600,000 improvement of its beach-front community center from the
Olympic budget.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters say firm guarantees of repair of any
environmental damage and major financing for new cultural
facilities would satisfy most complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Bondi residents, vowing to continue opposition, have scheduled a
recruiting rally for May 14, when construction pauses and the beach
is busy with weekend crowds. &QL;

WIND-SWEPT FIRE, ONCE CONTROLLED, THREATENS LOS ALAMOS LAB 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ An effort by the National Park Service to set a
controlled fire in a densely wooded area of New Mexico has blown
out of control, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people and
threatening the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where some of the
country's most sensitive nuclear weapons research is conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The park service began on Thursday to burn thick stands of
Ponderosa pines and conifers that had accumulated in the Bandolier
National Monument after years of suppressing natural fires, the
park service said. But the efforts, for which officials had
extensively planned, quickly went awry when fierce winds, gusting
up to 45 mph, suddenly blew the blaze beyond the fire breaks that
had been prepared and blackened hundreds of acres throughout the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Roark, a spokesman for the nuclear laboratory, said that
the fire had burned right up to the western edge of the lab, which
covers 42 square miles. He said that the lab had been closed, with
only about 500 emergency personnel on duty and the other 10,000 or
so employees sent home.
</P>
<P>
   Roark said that the fire was threatening some bunkers where high
explosives are stored. The bunkers are made of hardened concrete
and earth, and survived a previous fire in 1977, so the lab was
fairly confident there would be no problems this time. He added
that nuclear materials, such as the plutonium used in bombs, were
stored in separate facilities that were not near the area where the
fire has been spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Coburn, the fire marshall at the Los Alamos County Fire
Department, said that roughly 2,000 acres had already been burned
and that about 500 households south of the city, near Los Alamos
Canyon, had been evacuated. Many more people had voluntarily left
the area. He said the city looked like a ghost town, with the air
thick with heavy, dark smoke and ash swirling in the stiff winds.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials with the forest service said that, at best, the
fire might be contained in a few days if the winds die down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were in the acceptable limits when they began
the burn, but the winds this time of year are very unpredictable,''
said Coburn. He added that as of Monday afternoon no injuries had
been reported and no homes had been destroyed, but the fire was
within several hundred yards of a residential area.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Judson, an official with the National Park Service, said
that the fire had been planned for months, with the critical
question of when it would be set. She said there was a fairly
narrow window of opportunity, and that the service had seized it,
but the sudden appearance of winds had quickly pushed the fire
beyond the intended boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bandolier National Monument is well known for its archaeological
sites, many of them clusters of ancient stone homes once occupied
by native Americans. Judson said that, after years of putting out
fires in the area, the park service decided the forests of trees as
tall as 150 feet had grown too dense and a fire was deemed the best
means of thinning it and beginning a natural process of new growth.

   As executive editor of this wire service, I want to make contact
with the people who read and use what we produce. So I am sending

   &UR; IN THE FIELD  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEWCOMER IN RUSSIA: Patrick E. Tyler, a distinguished foreign
correspondent whose byline was out of the paper for more than a
year while he mastered a new language, is now in The Times' Moscow
bureau. Before his crash course in Russian, Pat was in China, in
the Beijing bureau.
</P>
<P>
   VETERAN IN CHINA: Craig S. Smith is now the Times correspondent
in Shanghai. Formerly with The Wall Street Journal reporting from
the same city, he succeeds Seth Faison, who has taken a leave from
The Times to write a book.
</P>
<P>
   SPANNING TWO CONTINENTS: Anthony DePalma has undertaken a novel
new assignment for the business desk. He is the hemispheric
business correspondent, charged with illuminating the growing
economic relationships that stretch from Canada to Patagonia. Tony
is now based in the New York office, returning from Toronto where
he had covered Canada for several years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE HOUSE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AN AWARD: The Times has a staff award in memory of Nathaniel
Nash, the correspondent who died in a plane crash in Croatia four
years ago _ the same crash that killed the U.S. trade
representative, Ron Brown. The award is given to a reporter ``who
excels in business or economic news, nationally or abroad, just as
Nahaniel did.'' This year's recipient is Steve Lohr, a senior
writer for the Business Day section who has been a foreign
correspondent, beat reporter, editor, technology writer and much
more. For nearly two years, his name been one of the reporters
assigned full time to the Microsoft cae, and he is often the one
who performs the high wire act of writing the news analysis sidebar
on deadline.
</P>
<P>
   A PROMOTION: The Times's design director, Tom Bodkin, has been
added to the newspaper's masthead as an assistant managing editor.
Joe Lelyveld, the executive editor, said Tom's elevation was in
recognition of his work in leading the paper through a series of
perilous transitions. As custodian of the look of The Times, he
brightened and modernized the paper's appearance over a period of
years, and finally, three years ago, he guided the paper through
its transition to color. Editors who read the ASNE's publication
The American Editor may have noticed Tom's essay in the last issue,
in which he discussed his ideas on newspaper design.

   TEXAS-DEMS (Austin, Texas) _ The once-mighty Texas Democratic
Party, whose fabled leaders Lyndon B. Johnson and Sam Rayburn once
dominated not just the state but the nation, has fallen on very
hard times. Of today's 29 officials elected statewide in Texas,
none are Democrats. And much to the chagrin of the Democratic state
chairwoman, Molly Beth Malcolm, several Democratic legislators are
out campaigning with none other than George W. Bush, the
second-term Republican governor and soon-to-be GOP presidential
nominee. Few people in Texas would argue that Democrats are
powerless or obsolete, particularly since the party still controls
the congressional delegation and the Texas House of
Representatives. But Democrats here are consumed by a parochial,
less glamorous agenda, such as legislative races and preparing for
the 2002 gubernatorial race. And few elected Democrats are willing
to make trouble for their popular governor. By Jim Yardley. (1650

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: We had a heavy lunch at one of our
conferences, and afterward I half-jokingly suggested that it was
time for the company to implement a nap policy. One of the vice
presidents sneered at me and shook his head, and my own manager
made a crack about sleeping on the job. Did I violate some
corporate rule? R.C.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It sounds like some of the top-siders in your company
slept through a couple of important developments in management. In
the first place, some humor, joking, and even half-joking are
important at work, and that's no joke. Secondly, a growing number
of companies have awakened to the fact that napping at work is
starting to become more acceptable. You can even hear terms such as
``power nap'' being tossed around.
</P>
<P>
   There are studies showing that a brief nap during the day can
help the body, the brain, and even productivity. After a nap, it
has been found that people are re-energized and able to focus more
effectively on their work. With this in mind, a few companies have
even put in special rooms for napping during a break.
</P>
<P>
   Additional research is starting to show that napping leads to
reduced stress, accidents, and errors. This does not mean that
employees should zonk out for an hour or two in the afternoon, but
a brief nap of approximately 15 to 20 minutes has been found to be
quite effective.
</P>
<P>
   Although you were half-joking about naps, what you were saying
was more than a half-truth.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a new sales manager, and he thinks he knows
everything. He has these nasty little suggestions for just about
everything we do, and he has poured all this additional paperwork
on us. How do we deal with him? W.K.
</P>
<P>
   A: It does not sound like your new sales manager has sold
himself very well to you or the rest of the team. When managers
give constructive suggestions to employees, this can actually be an
effective way to coach, guide, and educate. However, nasty little
suggestions are an entirely different matter, and they are
typically little more than insults, criticism, or blame. Your
manager may think he knows everything, but the fact that he takes
this approach automatically shows that he does not.
</P>
<P>
   His lack of understanding about the role of paperwork today also
points to some gaps in his knowledge of everything. For example, if
there is a trend in the amount of paperwork for salespeople, it is
pointing toward less. Some companies are using sales software
packages, and it is also possible to have all of the administrative
aspects of selling handled on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since your new sales manager is into suggestions, you and your
associates need to make a few to him. Tell him about the measurable
benefits associated with having more two-way communication and
discussions with the troops, and suggest to him that he take a look
at some of the highly effective alternatives to paperwork for
salespeople. If he reacts with more nasty little suggestions, then
perhaps you should make a few little suggestions to his manager.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Management retained a consultant to help our department run
better, but he seems to know nothing about our department's
technology, and very little about how to manage. We are open to new
ideas, but we haven't heard one yet. This seems like a colossal
waste of time and money. Any thoughts? H.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: There is an old definition of a consultant as being someone
who borrows your watch and then tells you what time it is.
Sometimes even this can be a valuable service, but at other times
it can simply be a rehashing of old news.
</P>
<P>
   If you truly believe that this consultant does not know what he
is doing, you should document the specific incidents that support
this belief and discuss them with management. However, it is
important to note that there is a consulting strategy in which the
consultant tries to draw as much information as possible from the
staff, purposely avoiding making any suggestions or recommendations
during the process in order to avoid influencing the results. In
such a case, it makes more sense to judge the consultant after he
has presented his findings, analysis, and recommendations. If the
consulting project is anywhere near completion, management may
postpone acting on your concerns about him until they have his
report in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The larger issue is that the consultant did not establish his
credibility with you and your associates at the outset, a time when
he also should have clarified the steps, methodology, and
objectives of the project. Perhaps the consultant needs a
consultant.

THIS TIME AROUND, NO MORE MMMBOP ON HANSON ALBUM
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go ahead, blame Hanson for the teen-dominated state of the Top
40.
</P>
<P>
   When the towheaded trio from Tulsa burst on a scene choked with
woe-is-me grunge and I-can't-stand-myself alternative rock three
years ago, only one member of the band was old enough to drive.
</P>
<P>
   That initial Hanson single, the infectious ``MMMBop,'' changed
everything, stealing the spotlight from rock cynicism and
refocusing it on youthful, optimistic hitmakers like the Spice
Girls and Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, since 1997, the charts have been overcome by the
likes of `N Sync, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Westlife and
the rest. And Hanson, which on May 9 releases its long-anticipated
new album, ``This Time Around,'' was the catalyst for that
bubblegum youthquake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, a lot has changed,'' admits singer-keyboardist Taylor
Hanson, 16. ``There's been a dramatic change in the climate of the
music scene. There's not a whole lot we did to adapt, but we're
aware of it. When (Hanson's debut disc) 'Middle of Nowhere' came
out, grunge was thriving and then all the other groups came
along.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22 million Americans aged 13 to 19 reportedly have
disposable income to the tune of $140 billion a year and their
choices in music, film and TV clearly reflect a desire to see
people their own age in the spotlight. And their tastes are
notoriously fickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think we're going to see first-week numbers
like we do with 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys,'' predicts Anita
Bond, manager of Tower in Sherman Oaks. ``I think the young girls
that liked Hanson back in the 'MMMBop' days have moved on. It might
have a respectable first week, but I don't know about the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Hanson brothers _ Isaac, Taylor and Zac _
realize many of their first fans have probably switched allegiances
to some of the newer teen groups. But instead of hiring a fashion
coordinator and choreographer in order to compete with the 'N Syncs
of the world, the home-schooled trio set out to make a
classic-rock-tinged new record that seems to clear a path to an
older audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good rock record,'' said Bob Bell, senior rock buyer
for the Wherehouse Music chain. ``It's not necessarily a teen or
Top 40 record. But it's a hard one to predict because Hanson isn't
in the same genre with 'N Sync and Backstreet. They were a very
unique phenomenon. There really wasn't any other band like them. I
certainly hope and expect they built enough of a fan base that the
new album will do well.''
</P>
<P>
   While Taylor Hanson concedes the band's early fans have grown,
``In an ideal world, the fans grow and evolve at the same rate as
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson's success came after years playing the county fair
circuit as a family act singing doo-wop to prerecorded tapes. Under
the guidance of their father, Walker, the siblings broadened their
horizons, traveling to Austin's South By Southwest music conference
to perform a cappella for whomever would listen.
</P>
<P>
   During the next two years, Mercury Records took notice, sending
the boys to Hollywood to craft ``Middle of Nowhere'' with producing
team the Dust Brothers (Beck, Beastie Boys) and professional
songwriters like Barry Mann, Cynthia Weil and Desmond Child.
</P>
<P>
   ``MMMBop,'' which evoked comparisons to the Jackson 5, quickly
went to No. 1 in 22 countries and was named single of the year in
the prestigious 1997 Village Voice poll. It had been seven years
since New Kids on the Block peaked in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is always changing,'' drummer Zac, 14, said. ``What's
kind of funny is when the first record came out, Hanson was softer
than what was out there. And now our new record is harder than
what's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Recorded in Los Angeles, ``This Time Around'' (Island) shows
Hanson has become a credible rock 'n' roll band still able to crank
out great singles like the album's piano-driven title track.
Taylor, in particular, has matured into a convincing blues-rock
singer while guests on the leaner, harder-edged disc include Beck
turntablist DJ Swamp, most recently seen on the wheels of steel at
the Greek Theatre last weekend, John Popper (of Blues Traveler),
Sly &AMP; the Family Stone's Rose Stone and Texan teen guitar slinger
Jonny Lang.
</P>
<P>
   ``People that like real musicians are going to go nuts for this
record,'' trumpets Lyor Cohen, president of the Island/Def Jam
Music Group. ``The striking thing is how great the songs are and
how naturally the guys have matured.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson appears May 9 on CBS' ``Rosie O'Donnell Show'' and May 10
on MTV's ``Total Request Live.'' The trio will go on tour at the
end of July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we've grown up a bit probably makes it easier for
some people to accept us,'' Taylor says. ``I think it bothered some
people that here were three really young guys making this good,
real music.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now becomes: Is there room at the inn for a young
band that sounds nothing like Backstreet or Aguilera and a bit like
a more restrained Black Crowes?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a place for everything,'' Taylor said. ``The teen
stuff is not music we listen to, but obviously lots of people do.
But who knows what the next big thing will be _
reggae/jazz/slamgrass?''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the music scene that's changed, either. Hanson's
voices are lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time goes by,'' Zac said. ``There's been some physical
changes, sure. But the band itself hasn't changed. You can see a
natural evolution in the music. We're still writing about the same
things.''
</P>
<P>
   After ``Middle of Nowhere'' sold more than 8 million copies
worldwide, three Hanson albums were released over two years: a
holiday disc (``Snowed In''), a rarities collection (``3 Car
Garage'') and a live album (``Life From Albertane''). All were seen
as filler until ``This Time Around'' could be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a conscious decision to let all the attention die
away,'' Taylor said of the delay. ``What happened was we went on
tour in the summer of '98, and that pushed the record back. We had
a real longing to play. We'd been missing being in a band and
playing shows with all the media attention that was going on. Then
there was a year of writing songs, demoing them and meeting with
producers. Before all of this, we were just three guys in a band.
Now we have fans all over the world.''

MUSCLING INTO THE HALL TO SUBMIT TO THE `RING' 
(CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK) 
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No ``Ring'' cycle guarantees customer satisfaction.
Wagner's four-evening, weeklong operatic monster, known officially
as ``Der Ring des Niebelungen,'' has too many spiritual and
physical moving parts to inspire consensus. Barter and negotiation
occupy the minds and hearts of every audience member: What must I
surrender to gain what I most value? The trades are not easily
made.
</P>
<P>
   Magnificent Wagnerian voices are, more often than not, housed in
outsize and virtually immobile bodies. Those who look the parts too
often cannot sing them, at least not for the hour-after-hour,
day-after-day schedules that these events demand. Good voices of
less muscularity can manage Wagner in smaller opera houses (the
tenor Siegfried Jerusalem comes to mind). But at the Metropolitan
Opera, where the last of three ``Ring'' cycles ran its course last
week, size and presence equal to a 3,800-seat house are demanded.
Next to the Met's presentations, those in Vienna or London seem
like chamber music (not necessarily a bad thing).
</P>
<P>
   Next, what is it we want to see? Wagner's gods and demigods have
been parsed by every psychiatric, social, religious and political
faction one can think of. Those unsatisfied by the face value of
high and ancient people committing low deeds have had many
metaphors to turn to. George Bernard Shaw reimagined the ``Ring''
as class struggle, and the evils of capitalism have run amok
through ``Ring'' productions ever since. Surreal collisions of
modern and ancient dress and props continue to create the images
that ambitious directors hope will make Wagner relevant for us
right now.
</P>
<P>
   The Met's 13-year-old production takes another tack. Otto Schenk
and Gunther Schneider-Siemssen peer through Wagner's eyes, as
midway through the 19th century he assembled in his mind the
spears, swords, helmets, rocks and trees through which his dubious
characters would move. The era's creaky stage machinery would be
updated, however, with crafty backlighted projections,
psychologically calculated color-codings and all the magic tricks a
well-equipped new opera house can muster.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wagnerites have been alternately dismayed and relieved.
Conservative German listeners, ignoring snide critical comments in
their own newspapers, flock to the United States _ to Seattle,
Chicago, San Francisco or New York _ hoping to escape the drastic
interpretations their countrymen present them with. I have stayed
at hotels during American ``Ring'' cycles and heard barely a word
of English. Hip Americans appalled by a literalism they call
listless and archaic flock to Bayreuth or Vienna, eager to be
brought up to date by the latest vision of Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The principle trade-off last week involved eyes for ears.
Musically, there was orchestra playing under James Levine
breathtaking for its clarity and sophistication. Visually,
suspension of disbelief was stretched to its breaking point but
rescued by consistent singing quality. Jane Eaglen as Brunnhilde
was a trumpet of triumphant proportions. Eaglen's physical size
cannot be put aside out of politeness. Virtually immobile and
nearly dwarfing last week's Siegfried, Stig Andersen, her
contributions to theater during the early stages of this cycle
consisted of a raised arm or two and none-too-convincing plays of
joy and sorrow across the face.
</P>
<P>
   But then there is the sound of that voice, which by its physical
presence alone occupies the role. And then there were Brunnhilde's
final sequences in ``Gotterdammerung,'' in which all disbelief
melted away, allowing both eye and ear to be equally moved.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, who is from Denmark, handled one of opera's truly
punishing roles with admirable reliability. His tenor is in good
health, he moves well and there are blessedly few retreats into
barking semi-speech.
</P>
<P>
   The size of Andersen's voice would fill a smaller hall, say
Covent Garden or the Vienna Staatsoper, more fully. One had a hard
time hearing him in early acts, but gratitude for what he was and
forgiveness for what he was not in this impossible part gradually
formed a truce.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, James Morris soldiered satisfyingly on. Deborah Voigt
and Placido Domingo as Sieglinde and Siegmund knew that their
duties were relatively brief, and brilliantly held nothing back.
Levine's Wagner remains very slow, but I for one do not mind. One
values the breathing space that frames every detail. Nothing crude
or careless could escape notice at these tempos, and one hears
neither quality.
</P>
<P>
   The final barter: the production. I find some of the scenes
insipid (Act 1 of ``Siegfried,'' for example, or the start of Act 3
in ``Gotterdammerung''). Also, a Mark Morris or some choreographer
like him should be brought in to do something about the Rhine
Maidens and the Valkyries, whose gyrations are embarrassing. The
great virtue of the Met's ``Ring,'' on the other hand, is that it
does not get in the way. There are no metaphors of modern life to
puzzle out.
</P>
<P>
   I have always been fascinated by the many serious musical people
who ardently champion the original intents and historical
integrities of 18th-century performance style and at the same time
dismiss the Met's ``Ring'' as hopelessly old-fashioned. Just as I
love Stokowski conducting Bach, I wouldn't mind seeing Wotan as
Homer Simpson or Norns as the Supremes. But, if you want Wagner
faithful to his time, New York may be the place to be.

COMMENTARY: AMERICA'S LABOR PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's going on with the American labor movement?
</P>
<P>
   In March the Teamsters started lobbying the Clinton White House
to award one of the Teamsters' largest employers, UPS, a much
sought after new air route for landing cargo planes in China. At
the same time, the Teamsters have been lobbying against the
administration's effort to grant China permanent normal trade
relations or entry into the World Trade Organization, which would
actually spur U.S.-China cargo trade. ``It seems that the Teamsters
want us to have more cargo flights to China, but no cargo,'' said
one U.S. official. They want more trade in empty boxes.
</P>
<P>
   This is almost as interesting as the dockworkers' union marching
in Seattle against more globalization and free trade, which is like
the milkmen's union coming out against cows. No trade, no
dockworkers. No milk, no milkmen. But then you also have the United
Auto Workers opposing the trade deal with China, which is strange
since today virtually no U.S.-made car can be sold in China, but
under the Clinton-negotiated WTO deal all U.S.-made cars can be
sold, financed and distributed in China.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was the lovely scene during the
recent anti-IMF protests in Washington when that hate-mongering
isolationist Pat Buchanan joined forces with the Teamsters and
their boss James Hoffa. Buchanan told cheering Teamsters that as
president he would tell the Chinese to either shape up or ``you
guys have sold your last pair of chopsticks in any mall in the
United States,'' and that he would appoint Hoffa as America's top
trade negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   How did the U.S. labor movement go from being a progressive
force to being the leading opponent of free trade and pal of Pat
Buchanan? I posed that question to former labor secretary and now
Brandeis University professor Robert Reich.
</P>
<P>
   His short answer is that U.S. labor unions have come to totally
distrust U.S. business, and are convinced that free trade is simply
a vehicle for moving manufacturing jobs abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the labor leaders today are being pushed by their
rank and file, who never liked Nafta and who do not trust American
business to keep jobs in this country,'' said Reich. ``Even though
the business cycle in recent years has improved things for the
country as a whole, labor does not feel that it has really shared
fully in the expansion. It feels that manufacturing jobs are still
vanishing _ whether because of technology or globalization and free
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor's response, therefore, has been to try to slam America's
doors shut, even though it is obvious that globalization and free
trade have contributed mightily to America's economic expansion.
What to do? Congressman Sander Levin's thoughtful proposal for
better monitoring of China's worker and human rights behavior is
laudable, but I don't think labor really cares about either.
</P>
<P>
   What we need is a business-government-labor summit that tries to
defuse at least some of labor's real concerns in return for a
tempering of its opposition to trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the business community is really serious,'' says Reich,
``it should combine the China trade deal with legislation that
would give labor a ban on the permanent replacement of striking
workers, something labor has sought for years, and it would also
treble the fines against any company that illegally fires workers
for trying to form unions. In recent years more companies have been
using the threat of permanently replacing striking workers, and the
practice of illegally firing workers for trying to form unions has
been on the rise, because the penalty structure is just a slap on
the wrist.``
</P>
<P>
   This is worth considering. Free trade and the new economy have
been very good for the United States, but the gains have been
unequally distributed, particularly when it comes to blue-collar
workers. My attitude toward labor is: Tell us what we can do to
ameliorate that _ short of putting up walls and closing doors that
will only hurt us all in the long run. Sure, we could redistribute
income through tax policy, but that isn't going to happen. So why
not try Reich's idea: Strengthen workers' ability to negotiate
wages, severance and security on their own behalf within the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Pie-in-the-sky? Maybe. But some way has to be found to persuade
labor to loosen its grip on the door, and one way could be this
bargain: You let go of the door and we'll empower you to better
thrive with it open.

COMMENTARY: WAVING THE STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Happy National Teacher Day! There's still time, people, to send
your children's instructor a little remembrance _ a box of cookies,
a nice book, some Microsoft stock you aren't using anymore.
Meanwhile let's take a moment to discuss the ever-soaring state of
Standards in Education.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Higher Standards require well-qualified teachers, and
it is for this reason that 39 states have adopted basic skills
tests for new faculty. Unfortunately, 36 of these states waive said
test when they're short on staff, leaving a certain number of
students in the hands of educators who have not necessarily proven
their ability to name the days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you may find it strange that individuals who cannot pass
a basic skills test would go into teaching in the first place.
Perhaps they were lured by the opportunity, offered in many
overcrowded districts, to eat lunch at 10 o'clock in the morning.
Perhaps they felt peculiarly suited to a career where salaries
begin, on average, at $8,000 a year less than other professions and
end, on average, at $24,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, we have not seen so much political commitment to
better schools since the 1988 campaign, when George Bush and
Michael Dukakis each announced he intended to become the
``education president.'' The golden age of pedagogy that everyone
expected to flow from this contest somehow failed to arrive. Now Al
Gore and George W. Bush trade assault e-mail on the subject every
single day. Bush cannot talk enough about the way he's improved the
schools in Texas. He is particularly voluble about having ended
social promotion, about how he insisted that no Texas child go from
the third grade to the fourth until he or she could read at grade
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to have high standards,'' he told a county
Republican gathering a while back, using a Bushian gesture that
indicates the height he had in mind was about five feet.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the first kids who will ever be affected by that
policy are currently in kindergarten. This is the classic political
approach to the setting of standards on any topic. You want to be
strict about the required levels of achievement, but loose about
the timetable. The ideal due date, in fact, is the year after
whoever sets the standards leaves office. If Bush is lucky, by the
time Texas third graders start getting held back, he'll be in
Washington preparing for his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing the things you can accomplish with long-term
projections. Residents here in New York have already been informed
that come 2004, the state debt will suddenly shrink to manageable
proportions and our high school seniors will be able to pass
challenging tests in math, english, science, history and global
studies in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   In the bad old days, New York reserved what we call Regents
exams mainly for students who planned to go to college. But now
we're going to test everybody _ the special ed students, the kids
who arrived last week from Guatemala. And why not? Every child is
important, and just because he or she is going to school in double
shifts or studying science in a laboratory that was built when
Teddy Roosevelt was a teen doesn't mean we don't care enough to
demand the very best.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is necessarily as crazy as it seems. Some school
officials seem to be setting themselves up for a standards debacle
in hopes that when the great disaster finally occurs and kids start
failing in droves, an outraged public will ante up the money for
smaller classes, better-paid teachers, newer buildings, etc. The
only problem with this theory is that a whole generation of
students will wind up being used for cannon fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's worried about the kids caught in the middle,''
says Abigail Thernstrom of the Massachusetts state board of
education.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to Bush, Texas is actually making an attempt to set
the bar higher without whopping it over the heads of the children
who happen to get caught in the transition. This year the teachers
started getting additional training, and the students' skills are
being tested regularly so those who start to fall behind can get
special tutoring. A timetable that actually prepares kids for the
standards they're supposed to meet is definitely not silly.
</P>
<P>
   Bragging about it as if anything has actually happened, however,
is ridiculous.

 &HT;    Bush attends O'Conner's funeral; meets with McCain
 &HT;    By Ken Herman

<TEXT>
<P>
   Probable GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush is on a two-day
mission to get right with an important voting bloc and a former foe
who may be able to sway another important voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush was among the high-profile mourners at
Manhattan's St. Patrick's Cathedral for the funeral of Cardinal
John O'Connor, the Catholic leader to whom Bush made amends after
speaking at Bob Jones University, a school with anti-Catholic
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Pittsburgh, Bush meets privately with former foe John
McCain, the senator with whom Bush exchanged harsh words _
including some sparked by the Bob Jones speech _ during the primary
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of the reclamation project,'' said University of
Texas government professor Bruce Buchanan, a close observer of the
Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush cancelled a planned Monday speech on Social Security policy
in order to join the 3,500 invited guests at O'Connor's funeral.
Buchanan said it was a significant move by Bush, who has been
criticized for skipping events such as meetings of Hispanic
journalists and African-American mayors.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's funeral was a can't-miss event for Bush, according to
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is justifiably worried about sending signals to
Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral, former Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn noted the
political upside of mixing church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be associated with the hierarchy of the Catholic
Church is one way to ingratiate yourself with the Catholic people
across the country,'' said Flynn, now the U.S. ambassador to the
Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Catholic University political scientist John K.
White said Bush saw a good opportunity and seized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to represent himself as a different kind of candidate
than the person he represented himself as during the primary
season,'' said White. ``It's very obvious that Catholics are going
to play a crucial role in the election. For him not to come to the
funeral would have been a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In late February, Bush used a letter to O'Connor to try to undo
damage done to his campaign as a result of the speech at Bob Jones
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``On reflection, I should have been more clear in disassociating
myself from anti-Catholic sentiments and racial prejudice,'' Bush
told O'Connor. ``It was a missed opportunity, causing needless
offenses, which I deeply regret.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain used Bush's speech at Bob Jones to try to turn Catholic
voters against Bush. It worked in Michigan, where McCain took a
crucial win that sent shivers of doubt through some Bush backers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush, who is counting on Catholic votes as part of
his victory formula, praised O'Connor as ``a man who stood for the
disadvantaged and the impoverished, and he was a strong voice for
life in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the only Catholic in the presidential race filed
for ballot status in Texas. Former Republican Pat Buchanan
submitted petitions with 129,000 signatures. To qualify as an
independent candidate, Buchanan needed signatures of 56,116
registered voters who did not cast ballots in the March primaries
or April runoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Secretary of State's Office will now review the
signatures.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who said there is little significant difference
between Bush and Gore, also is seeking the Reform Party's
presidential nomination. The party has until May 30 to come up with
the 37,380 signatures to get its candidates on the Texas ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh today, Bush and McCain will huddle privately for
the first time since the Texas governor clinched the nomination in
March. During primary season, Bush blasted McCain as ``a man that
says one thing and does another, a person who says he will run a
positive campaign then approves the scripts of anti-Catholic
bigotry in a state like Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bush had only nice things to say about McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to talking to John about education and campaign
funding reform,'' he added. ``I don't anticipate any changes on his
part or my part, but there's a lot of area for us on which to agree
and I look forward to having that discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Monday he's got an agenda in mind for today's
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's said he's a reformer with results,'' McCain said.
``That's his slogan. I'd like to know what those are and how I can
be helpful in achieving a reform agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more things that we agree on than we disagree on,
and I believe he would be a good president of the United States,''
McCain said. ``There is no point in me looking back in rancor or
anger or bitterness in the campaign. It's over.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he will issue a ``strong statement'' in support of
Bush, and will reiterate his lack of interest in being his running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, however, did open the door to a cabinet post.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preference would be to remain in the Senate,'' he said.
``But you can't say I would refuse to serve in one of those
capacities. It's not the same as vice president.''

UN WEIGHS RETURNING NIGERIAN PEACEKEEPERS TO SIERRA LEONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four people were killed in rekindled violence in
Sierra Leone's capital Monday as UN diplomats considered handing
their crumbling peacekeeping operation back to a Nigerian-led
regional force that left the West African country last week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, US military helicopters began evacuating some of
the 170 American civilians who want to leave the nation. British
forces were doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having discussions with the Nigerians, as are others,
to see how we can resolve the situation,'' said Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, following a meeting here with UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan. Giving the operation back to troops from a West
African regional group was among those ``questions that are in the
process of being discussed,'' Albright said, although Washington
later announced it would fly another 700 Bangladeshi UN
peacekeepers into the region, but it was not clear if they would
set foot in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's departure of the Nigerian-led regional peacekeepers
and their replacement by 8,700 poorly equipped UN counterparts led
within days to renewed fighting by the Revolutionary United Front
rebels and the capture of 500 UN troops, who have been held hostage
for several days. One UN soldier has been killed, and the UN Monday
evacuated 266 members of a 321-member civilian staff.
</P>
<P>
   The evacuations gave greater credence to speculation that the
United Nations may again pull out its peacekeepers in the face of a
crisis, as it did in Somalia in 1993 and one year later in Rwanda,
just before the murders of hundreds of thousands in tribal
violence. Sierra Leone's surging rebels killed thousands and
chopped off the limbs of thousands more before a cease-fire
temporarily halted an eight-year civil war in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The UN troops in Sierra Leone have been criticized by the host
government for not fighting back when attacked by the rebels. By
contrast, the Nigerian troops fought the rebels for several years,
sustaining many casualties and recapturing Freetown from the rebels
in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of UN peacekeepers surrounding the home of rebel leader
Foday Sankoh Monday did little to prevent the clashes there that
led to the protesters' deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said at least four people were killed outside Sankoh's
home after his men fired into a crowd of thousands of peace
demonstrators who had been hurling rocks at Sankoh's house. The gun
battle pitted Sankoh supporters against loyalists of one or more
rival factions, including one led by ex-military ruler Johnny Paul
Koroma, who has called for his men to rearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustained shooting was also reported in other parts of the
city,'' said UN spokesman Fred Eckhard while in Freetown, armed
gangs were seen roaming the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Okabe, a UN spokeswoman, said she spoke with an American
newspaper correspondent on the scene who had a gun put to her head
by a rebel after two protesters fell dead at her feet. Corinna
Schuler, a Johannesburg-based journalist for The Christian Science
Monitor, was rescued only when a Nigerian peacekeeper paid off her
attacker, said Okabe.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by a joint UN-rebel team to reach the captured UN
soldiers have failed because of fighting near the town of Makeni,
said Eckhard. The rebels have made no demands and set no conditions
for the hostages' release and continue to deny _ despite visual
evidence from UN helicopters to the contrary _ that the
peacekeepers are being held, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Okabe said a UN helicopter on Sunday trying to resupply a group
of Kenyan peacekeepers in Makeni was shot at by rifle-toting rebels
and was forced to make an emergency landing when its fuel tank was
struck.
</P>
<P>
   The UN High Commissioner of Refugees reported Monday refugees
were being prevented from fleeing across border by rebels. Only 149
known to have fled so far, the UN refugee group said.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said diplomatic efforts were continuing to find a
solution to the crisis. A summit meeting of Western African leaders
from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and Mali is set for Tuesday in
Conkary, the Guinean capital. Libyan leader Moammar Khadafy has
also interceded on the UN's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   If diplomacy fails, Eckhard said, the Security Council faced a
decision to allow UN peacekeepers to fight the rebels or be pulled
out of the country as peacekeepers were in Somalia and Rwanda
during the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The UN peacekeepers are charged with protecting civilians and
the government ``but they do not want to be seen fighting side by
side with the government against rebel forces,'' said Eckhard.
Peacekeeping becomes untenable when neutrality is lost, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council met Monday, but a British diplomat said
withdrawal was not discussed. ``But fighting was, and this could be
done by the West African regional force,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the former colonial power, has sent 700-800 troops to
evacuate European nationals, and took control of Freetown's airport
Monday night, the diplomat said. She said British troops would stay
only long enough to get the Europeans out.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard said Britain has not offered its troops to either free
the UN hostages or to support its peacekeeping mission. ``We can't
be sending British gunboats to fight a civil war,'' the British
official told the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, nevertheless, repeated his call for a rapid reaction
force to be sent to the country. His request last week for such a
force was rejected by Britain and France. ``There are only a few
countries that have such a capability,'' Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the collapse of the cease-fire, the UN peacekeepers had
intended to oversee disarmament and demobilization of both sides,
as well as elections next year, Eckhard said.

GOVERNMENT REJECTS CEASE-FIRE OFFER BY REBELS IN SRI LANKA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: SUBS to update with new 2nd graf; alters content of
president's statement in 3rd graf.) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka _ Though it is on the defensive militarily,
the Sri Lankan government on Monday night firmly rejected a
separatist Tamil group's offer of a cease-fire in exchange for the
government's promise to withdraw tens of thousands of its troops
from the northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The government's director of information, Ariya Rubasinghe,
confirmed that the government had no intention of pulling out of
the small peninsula at the country's northern tip.
</P>
<P>
   President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who survived an assassination
attempt by a separatist suicide bomber, did not refer to the
cease-fire offer in a nationally televised address, but said the
government would stay and fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam. The rebel group is notorious for its suicide attacks and has
been labeled a terrorist organization by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The eye patch that had covered Kumaratunga's eye, injured in the
December assassination attempt, was gone tonight when she declared
in Sinhalese, ``We shall leave no room for the LTTE to again fasten
their fascist grip on half a million Tamil people in Jaffna.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kumaratunga's decision was a risky one. The Tigers have been
on a successful military march to reclaim Jaffna, the cultural
capital of the Hindu Tamil-dominated north in this majority
Buddhist Sinhalese nation. For the first time in the 18-year-old
civil war _ which has claimed more than 60,000 lives in a country
with a population no larger than New York State's _ the rebels
control Elephant Pass, which an opposition leader has called the
doorway to the fortress of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, the government has controlled Jaffna, but for five
years before that the Tigers, who seek a separate Tamil homeland,
ran what was essentially a small state there.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Pass is a narrow strip of land connecting the mainland
to the peninsula and the site of one of the most heavily fortified
military bases in the country. On April 22, with military moves
like those of a conventional army, the rebels took the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government banned political rallies and union
strikes and tightened a vise of press censorship in what it said
was an effort to protect national security, but that the opposition
said was an attempt by the government to hide the government's own
failings.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers said in a statement from their London office on
Monday that they were willing to observe a cease-fire once the
government surrenders Jaffna, which the rebels said could open the
way to peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam wishes to state that it
is prepared to declare a temporary cease fire suspending all armed
hostilities against the Sri Lankan armed forces to facilitate the
beleaguered government troops to be evacuated safely from the
Jaffna peninsula,'' the group's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a large force of demoralized government troops' being
trapped on the Jaffna peninsula and hostage to the Tigers have led
some here to hope that India, the region's great power, would
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, met with the
leaders of 20 political parties on Monday to discuss the conflict
in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   India has a much larger Tamil population than Sri Lanka in the
politically potent southern state of Tamil Nadu. And India
supported Sri Lankan Tamil militants, including the Tigers, in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But India has to worry about stirring nationalist feeling among
its own Tamil citizens. And both Sri Lanka and India have an
interest in holding together their ethnically and religiously
diverse nations.
</P>
<P>
   So India ruled out military intervention, though it was not
clear that it would refuse to help evacuate troops. In the late
1980s, India lost more than 1,000 troops on a long peacekeeping
mission in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The parliamentary affairs minister, Pramod Mahajan, said after
the meeting that India would only consider mediating between the
Tigers and the Sri Lankan government if both sides wanted Indian
help.
</P>
<P>
   The role of mediator had fallen earlier this year to Norway, one
of the nations the Tigers had deemed an acceptable intermediary.
</P>
<P>
   The Sri Lankan political opposition leader, Ranil
Wickremesinghe, said in an interview tonight that he believed that
Norway and India might work together to try to broker a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter feuding between Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe, who
heads the United National Party, has been an important element in a
failed attempt to get a peace plan through Parliament. The
opposition had opposed the government's attempt to change the
Constitution to give the Tamils greater autonomy in the north.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe have been having their
own peace talks, but any agreement they reach may be overtaken by
military developments that _ up to now _ are tilting in the Tigers'
favor.  &QL;

JURY DECIDES IN FAVOR OF DOCTOR IN REGGIE LEWIS RETRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bringing to an end a bitter, divisive saga that
stretched over two trials in two years, a jury has agreed that the
death of Celtics captain Reggie Lewis on a basketball court nearly
seven years ago was not caused by the negligence of his
cardiologist, who had confidently proclaimed that the 27-year-old
did not have a life-threatening heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   The requisite 13 of 16 jurors reached their verdict swiftly
within 30 minutes of being told Monday by Judge Thayer
Fremont-Smith that the lawyers in the case -- intent on avoiding
another mistrial -- would accept a verdict if only 12 could agree.
</P>
<P>
   When the jurors returned to the courtroom shortly before 10 a.m.
they had reached a decision: 13 in favor of Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge
Jr. and 3 against, a slight but significant shift from the 12-4
deadlock reported to the court on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors spent more than 20 hours deliberating before reaching
their decision, which came shortly after they began a fifth day of
deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion to one of the city's highest-profile medical
malpractice lawsuits -- which drew in sports, medical and legal
sectors and fueled persistent public debate -- was oddly
anti-climactic.
</P>
<P>
   With neither Mudge nor Donna Harris-Lewis, Lewis's widow, in the
courtroom, the scene was subdued, the rawest emotion exhibited by a
female juror who wept as the verdict was announced. Mudge's lawyers
shared congratulatory hand shakes and pats on the back, while
lawyers for Harris-Lewis were expressionless.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key finale was in stark contrast to the first trial last
year, when Mudge and his wife, surrounded by jubilant friends and
family, let out a celebratory cheer as they descended a courthouse
elevator after the jury reported that it was hopelessly deadlocked
and the judge declared a mistrial.
</P>
<P>
   Even the spectator gallery -- which last year swarmed with
supporters from both sides -- Monday was filled mainly with
reporters and a clutch of lawyers waiting to begin a new case in
the same courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   At Harris-Lewis's home, police had posted no-parking signs and
stretched yellow tape across her driveway to keep the media away.
Mudge, who is director of cardiac transplantation at Brigham and
Women's Hospital, could not be reached at work and did not return a
message left at his home.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Harris-Lewis's attorney, Neil Rossman, held out
the possibility of an appeal, all indications -- including public
comments by Rossman -- were that the case had finally come to a
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously very disappointed, but I tried the best case I
could try,'' Rossman said. ``I do want to say that we got a fair
trial...and I don't think if we tried the case again we could try a
better case. ... The jury just didn't see it our way.''
</P>
<P>
   In defeat, Rossman nonetheless savored some measure of victory,
principally the ruling by Fremont-Smith that jurors could not
consider evidence of Lewis's alleged cocaine use as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The judge made the ruling after Mudge testified that he did not
change his treatment plan after Lewis allegedly admitted to him
that he had used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got cocaine out of the case once and for all,'' Rossman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Harris-Lewis was handling news of the verdict, Rossman
said she was ``very disappointed, but I guess it's time to move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's lead attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., called the verdict
``a just result.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're very pleased with the verdict,'' said Dailey.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Mudge has fared professionally throughout the case,
Dailey noted that his cardiology practice is ``busier than ever,''
but added, ``To say that a case like this was not personally
traumatic to a physician would not be true.''
</P>
<P>
   On whether there were ever settlement discussions, Dailey said,
``There was talk about possibly trying to resolve it, but it never
came to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and three other cardiologists for
malpractice in May 1996, just months before the litigation would
have been barred by the state's three-year statute of limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the other defendants, Drs. Peter L. Friedman and Mark A.
Creager, were cleared of negligence in the first trial last year.
The fourth defendant, Dr. John D. Rutherford, now in practice in
Texas, settled out of court with Harris-Lewis for $500,000 on the
day that jury selection began in the first trial.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Harris-Lewis's suit spurred furious debate about
her motives. Supporters hailed her as a grieving spouse determined
to clear her husband's name, which had been publicly linked to
cocaine use -- which can cause lasting heart damage -- after he
died. Critics labeled her a greedy widow intent on making money off
her husband's death, and willing to sacrifice his reputation in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Harris-Lewis, who staunchly denies that her
husband used drugs, said the suit was motivated by a 1995 Wall
Street Journal story suggesting that cocaine played a role in her
husband's death, and by Mudge's subsequent contention that Lewis,
two weeks before his death, had admitted using cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, widely regarded before his death as one of the nation's
rising basketball stars, first drew the concern of doctors when he
collapsed in the Boston Garden during a playoff game on April 29,
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Lewis, a National Basketball Association
All-Star, was admitted for tests at New England Baptist Hospital,
where a team of prominent physicians from across the city -- dubbed
the ``Dream Team'' -- concluded that he had a serious heart problem
that could end his basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a bizarre turn of events three days later, Lewis left
the Baptist against medical advice in the middle of the night and
transferred to the Brigham under Mudge's care.
</P>
<P>
   Seven days later, Mudge announced at a press conference that
Lewis suffered only from a benign fainting disorder and would be
able to play basketball again. Eleven weeks later, on July 27,
1993, Lewis collapsed and died while shooting baskets at Brandeis
University, stunning the city and leaving behind a pregnant wife
and year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found no evidence of drugs in Lewis's system, and his
death certificate listed adenovirus, a relatively minor virus
spread by coughing and sneezing, as the cause of scarring found in
his heart.
</P>
<P>
   In her suit, Harris-Lewis accused Mudge of failing to diagnose
her husband with an arrhythmia, an uncontrolled fluttering of the
heart that can cause death.
</P>
<P>
   But Mudge testified that he was considering a second diagnosis
of an arrhythmia. And his lawyers argued that Lewis contributed to
his own death by failing to take his medication regularly and
violating Mudge's orders not to exercise.

 &HT;    S.C. House debates flag's fate today
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old Confederacy will rally in Columbia today. At stake is
whether its battle flag will continue to wave over the copper-clad
dome of the South Carolina Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Generals will wear battle regalia, belles will sashay in hoop
skirts and soldiers will don gray woolen uniforms, if protests
since January are any predictor. They'll sing ``Dixie'' and wave
blood-red banners marked by sea-blue X's with 13 stars, for the 11
states that seceded from the Union and two that didn't officially
secede but sent many troops to the Confederate side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure we'll certainly be well-represented,'' said R.G.
Wilson of Easely, S.C., lieutenant commander-in-chief of the Sons
of Confederate Veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they'll gather for the drama that will unravel inside the
cool granite walls of the Capitol, still marred outside by
Sherman's cannon fire 135 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime past 1 p.m. today, the South Carolina House will begin
debating a bill that would remove the controversial battle flag
from the Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of lowering the flag _ especially at the hands of a
tourism boycott launched by the NAACP _ sends shudders through
ancestors of the Confederacy, who revere the battle emblem as a
stout symbol of Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there would be significant impact in all areas of the
country that have any kind of Southern monuments or historical
display of Confederate battle flags,'' Wilson said Monday. ``There
would be an intense effort on the part of these NAACP-types and
those one-world-view types to eradicate those symbols of our
Southern heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   If the flag falls in South Carolina, Georgia becomes the next
target; like Mississippi, the Peach State weaves the Confederate
battle emblem into its state flag.
</P>
<P>
   As House debate begins, there's no consensus about what to do.
The banner has flown over the Capitol dome since 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Democratic-run Senate sent the
Republican-controlled House a compromise bill that would remove the
battle flag from atop the Capitol dome. The Senate proposes flying
a similarly designed battle flag _ square instead of rectangular _
at the Confederate Soldiers Monument on the Capitol's prominent
north lawn.
</P>
<P>
   However, House Democrats, especially members of the black
caucus, reject that idea because it hangs the banner at one of the
most visible places in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, Republicans refuse to support a Democratic
amendment that would remove the dome's banner and replace it at the
Confederate monument with a bronze likeness of the battle flag. A
memorial with no flying flag is a major obstacle for some
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders say today likely will be spent finding traction
for a plan acceptable to all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any proposal out there right now that will
receive a majority vote,'' House Speaker David Wilkins
(R-Greenville) said Monday. ``Right now, the most viable plan, the
plan that has the best chance of ultimately succeeding, is the
Senate bill, the soldiers monument.'' Like Wilkins, House Minority
Leader Gilda Cobb-Hunter (D-Orangeburg) says a resolution could be
struck before the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is ready to end it, regardless of their position,''
Cobb-Hunter said Monday.

MEDICAL DEVICE MAKERS, REGULATORS SEE IMPROVING RELATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The uneasy relationship between the medical
device industry and its regulators is improving. But both sides
acknowledge &UR;  &LR; they still have a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to give us kudos, but everything ends up as
criticism,'' said Dr. Linda Suydam, the US Food and Drug
Administration's senior associate commissioner, who outlined some
of the structural changes for future agency and industry
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke Monday at the fourth annual conference of the
Massachusetts Medical Device Industry Council at the Westin hotel
here. Also speaking was Dr. Hugh Hill, director of the coverage and
analysis group at the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA),
which determines whether new products approved by the FDA are
effective and should be covered by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Suydam said the FDA has streamlined the approval process for
medical devices by permitting outside groups to help the agency
approve the products. The FDA also has an ombudsman to settle
issues between companies and the agency.
</P>
<P>
   But some Bay State device companies insist the approval process
is still marred by too much bureacracy and the FDA staff is either
not adquately equipped or trained to handle certain issues required
for agency approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think FDA has changed, but the approvals could be still be
done more effecively,'' said Thomas J. Sommer, executive director
of the state's 200-member medical device industry known as
MassMEDIC.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, which
nearly three years ago agreed to pay higher fees to the US Food and
Drug Administration to streamline the drug approval processes, the
medical device makers balked at hefty users fees. One result: drug
makers, once the FDA's loudest critics, are now among its boosters,
citing approvals have been shortened from three years to about a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Device companies argue they shouldn't be compared to the
drug-makers, since their products have short development life
cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Once products are approved by the FDA, medical device companies
complain HCFA is very slow in giving their approval. Several
executives said that, without HCFA approval, it is hard to sell
products that don't have insurance reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said HCFA is in the process of developing new guidelines
and procedures for device reimbursement that will be announced
shortly.

 &HT;    Clinton foes reveal disbarment filings
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton admits he gave misleading testimony that was
morally wrong in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. But his
testimony was not ``false'' and his actions do not justify
disbarring him from the practice of law, according to defense court
filings made public Monday by a group trying to have the
president's law license revoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple moral truth (is) that his behavior in this matter
was wrong,'' Clinton's lawyers said in motions filed before the
Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct. ``He
misled his wife, his friends and our nation about the nature of his
relationship with (Monica) Lewinsky.'' Lewinsky has admitted having
a sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asserts his testimony was not ``false,'' only
intentionally misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Clinton's defense were made public Monday by the
Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation, which first filed a
complaint seeking to make Clinton the first sitting president to be
disbarred. The president's 80-page response to the Arkansas
committee has not been made public, but the foundation's reply to
Clinton's filing disclosed some of the president's defense. The
foundation released its filing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, strongly criticized the Atlanta
legal group Monday, saying it is not interested in issues related
to Arkansas lawyers and legal services. ``It's just interested in
attacking the president in any way it can,'' Kendall said.
</P>
<P>
   By disclosing some of Clinton's defense, Kendall said, the
foundation has engaged in ``just another part of the long-running
partisan mudslinging against the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall also noted that former independent counsel Kenneth Starr
has helped the foundation raise money. Starr spoke at a foundation
event April 29 at the Cobb Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   Foundation President Matthew Glavin said Clinton's lawyers are
arguing against disbarment and suggest that a sanction ``no harsher
and perhaps more lenient than a letter of reprimand would be
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   In its court filing, the foundation noted that Arkansas rules
require lawyers in public office to maintain higher ethical
standards than other attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is no ordinary Arkansas lawyer,'' the foundation
said. ``It is especially important, in order to retain public
respect for the law and the courts, for lawyers holding public
office to avoid misconduct ... which would draw the law and lawyers
into disrepute.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing Clinton's response, the foundation said the president
``spends the bulk of his 80-page brief attempting to show that his
testimony was not `false,' as he defines that term.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas committee could consider disbarment proceedings
against Clinton at its May 18 meeting. It is considering two
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Legal Foundation, which filed its complaint in
September 1998, said Clinton should be disbarred because he lied
under oath and obstructed justice in the Paula Jones lawsuit. The
Arkansas committee also is considering a contempt citation issued
against the president by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright,
who presided over the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton's defense, his lawyers told the committee that
Clinton does not admit to giving ``false'' testimony during his
deposition in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's answers (were) ... an attempt to avoid a
flat-out admission that (Clinton and Lewinsky) were alone
together,'' the president's response said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also asserted that his testimony about his relations
with Lewinsky was immaterial and did no harm to the sexual
harassment lawsuit filed by Jones. Even if it did harm to the
lawsuit, the case was settled and Jones was compensated, Clinton's
filing said.

CANADA   SEEKS IMPROVED TRADE WITH NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If you naturally think of Silicon Valley when someone
mentions the Internet, you're just who Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien wants to set straight.
</P>
<P>
   He'd like Nova Scotia to pop to mind. For information
technology? How about New Brunswick?
</P>
<P>
   Chretien, accompanied by executives from 40 companies in Eastern
Canada, was in Boston Sunday and Monday to try to convince New
England business owners and venture capitalists that Canada is not
just about salmon, oil, and timber anymore.
</P>
<P>
   While Canadian government officials have visited New England
frequently in recent years, it was the first time that Chretien had
led a regional trade mission. He was joined by the premiers of four
Atlantic provinces: New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and
Prince Edward Island.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to more than 500 business men and women at the Park
Plaza Hotel, Chretien's message was simple: Invest in Canada's
Atlantic provinces, where universities are graduating thousands of
new-economy workers and where doing business could soon cost less
than in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is America's biggest trading partner. The relationship
between the two countries overshadows all others in the world, with
more than $1 billion worth of goods and services crossing the
border every day. But this business is far more important to
Canada, where US trade accounts for one-third of its gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   A small fraction of the goods are traded between the Atlantic
provinces and the New England states, about $3.3 billion worth in
1999. But most of the products imported by New England _ natural
resources such as fish, timber, and energy _ fall into the
old-economy category.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien argued that his country offers more, particularly in
the area of technology. Canada is hiring 2,000 new research chairs
at its public universities over the next five years, is the first
major country to connect all of its schools and libraries to the
Internet, and has the world's most advanced coast-to-coast
fiber-optic network, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coupled with this innovative spirit, the prime minister promised
Canada will cut corporate taxes to make it a cheaper place to set
up shop.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Clancy, Canada's consul general in the region, said she is
concerned that with unemployment so low in New England,
electronics-savvy college graduates will start crossing the border
in droves.
</P>
<P>
   New Brunswick, for example, has 10 percent unemployment, and
10,000 men and women in their 20s left the province over the 10
years that ended in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   She hopes to convince US companies to build new plants to the
north. A trade group, Team Canada Atlantic, has also begun a pilot
project in Boston and Dallas to find out how best to ``brand''
Canada to attract American interest.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Hooper, a partner at the Boston venture capital firm
Advent International, said Canada has a lot of work to do. While
Toronto is known for its technology companies, ``I can't think of a
single technology company in the Maritimes to begin with,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses tend to invest based on the cluster theory, she said.
In other words, they gravitate to cities with good technological
universities and start-up companies with good management track
records.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not long after Katheryn and Paul Lowry of Norcross,
Ga., became the first Big Game winners of the millennium, people
with hard-luck tales began lining up to ask for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman wrote to say that she figured we would be buying new
vehicles, so could we please have your old ones?'' Ms. Lowry
recalled Monday. ``We didn't respond to any of the letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Those letters _ along with the FedEx packages and phone calls
from stockbrokers and investment advisors _ surely can be traced to
the press conference the Lowrys agreed to attend after they won the
$46 million Big Game drawing in the final hour of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had wanted to keep it as private as possible,'' Mrs. Lowery
said, who spent some of Monday washing the windows in her home.
``The lottery explained that they thought it would hold down the
media calling. We figured we'd do it and get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   Most jackpot winners sense a direct tie between media exposure
and the number of people who will offer to help you spend your
money. Some winners have been extraordinarily shy in front of press
conference lights and expectant microphones. A few have refused to
attend press conferences at all.
</P>
<P>
   One pervious Big Game winner said it's best to avoid media
attention at all costs after collecting your winnings. But Georgia
Lottery CEO Rebecca Paul noted that lottery must _ when asked _
reveal the name and hometown of Big Game winners, though not their
address of phone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a $5 million jackpot, we don't do publicity if (the
winner) doesn't want it,'' Paul said. ``But even if John Smith who
lives in Atlanta wins the $325 million jackpot, one of you (in the
media) will find him and be on his doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we say to the winners is _ and I believe this _ it's
better to get it all done at once in a controlled setting rather
than have CNN parked in your driveway.''
</P>
<P>
   That take-your-medicine approach has worked out for the Lowrys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had only a few (media) calls since the press
conference,'' Ms. Lowry said. ``People have respected our privacy.
We have not been hounded.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lowrys still live in their three-bedroom home in Norcross
and never felt the need to change their listed telephone number.
Mrs. Lowry, 61, quit her job as a loan processor for a mortgage
company to join her husband in retirement. They plan to build a
summer cabin in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did buy new cars,'' she said. ``Nothing fancy, no Mercedes,
BMWs or Jaguars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lowrys opted to take their winnings in the form of a lump
sum cash payment of $22 million. They received an ``after-tax''
check for $14.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   That still leaves quite a nest egg for the couple, their six
kids and 15 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Even before they received their check, the Lowrys turned to a
CPA she'd worked with for years. He helped them with tax and estate
planning and screened investment brokers who wanted to make sales
pitches. They also hired an attorney, who taught them more about
trust funds and powers of attorney. They rewrote their wills.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was a comptroller at a car dealership,'' Mrs. Lowry
said. ``I'd worked in financial services. We weren't ignorant of
what we needed to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice for (for the next Big Game winner) is take your
time. There's no rush. You've got to do some planning.''
</P>
<P>
   If you win the lottery, here's some on advice on what to do
next:
</P>
<P>
   _ Find an accountant and an estate planning lawyer you are sure
you can trust.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you take you winnings in the form of 26 annual annuity
payments, consider whether you'd be better off to take the cash
option instead. Under a new law, you have 60 days from the date of
the drawing to ``cash out.'' (If you select the cash option at
first, you can't switch to an annuity.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Use the accountant or the lawyer to screen consultants, stock
brokers and others who will approach you with ideas for how to
invest your money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Renew your will and get serious about estate planning. (If you
take the annuity and die before annual payments cease, the balance
becomes part of your state and is mostly taxable. But your estate
probably won't have the cash to pay the tax due).
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep a low profile. The more you speak up on television or get
quoted in the newspaper, the more you can expect to be solicited
for a piece of your winnings.
</P>
<P>
   _ If solicitations are a problem, change your phone number or
get an unlisted number.

CARDINAL EULOGIZED IN FUNERAL RITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He liked to think of himself as a simple priest, and
in the end, his life was celebrated with the same funeral rite
accorded every Catholic, rich or poor, powerful or powerless.
</P>
<P>
   But that Rite of Christian Burial was accompanied by a degree of
pomp unusual even for princes of the church, a tribute to the
extraordinary visibility Cardinal John O'Connor enjoyed throughout
his 16 years as archbishop of New York.
</P>
<P>
   For a few hours Monday, the most powerful political combatants
in the United States _ President Bill Clinton and former President
George Bush, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani
_ put aside their rivalries to join more than 3,000 Catholic clergy
and laity at St. Patrick's Cathedral in paying their respects to
O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   In a spontaneous expression of appreciation reminiscent of the
cheers given O'Connor when he would complete celebrating solemn
Masses, the crowd packed into the cathedral burst into applause as
O'Connor left the sanctuary for the last time, his gleaming
mahogany casket escorted by his siblings and fellow cardinals
around the cathedral's aisles and down the marble steps into the
crypt beneath the sacristy where the bodies of archbishops of New
York are entombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our brother John has gone to his rest in the peace of
Christ,'' said Auxiliary Bishop Robert A. Brucato, the
administrator of the archdiocese of New York until Pope John Paul
II names a replacement, which could be Tuesday. ``Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Bernard F. Law of Boston led the church elite in
celebrating O'Connor's life with a homily that provoked a
remarkable standing ovation when Law said, ``what a great legacy he
has left us in his constant reminder that the church must be
unambiguously pro-life.'' The sustained ovation, which appeared to
originate with a group of priests and then slowly to work its way
through the cathedral, clearly discomfited some of the elected
officials, some of whom support abortion rights and reluctantly
stood with the crowd but did not join in the applause.
</P>
<P>
   The 2 1/2-hour funeral capped five days of public mourning for
O'Connor, who died last Wednesday at the age of 80 after a long
battle against brain cancer. An estimated 150,000 people streamed
through the cathedral over the weekend, attending Masses and vigils
and filing silently by O'Connor's body.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral was open only to those who had obtained tickets, and
hundreds of people gathered on the steamy streets outside the
cathedral to participate as best they could. Streets running
alongside the cathedral were barricaded and law enforcement
officers patrolled inside and outside the cathedral because of the
number of dignitaries in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers and firefighters also packed the pews and joined
the procession into the church, in recognition of O'Connor's strong
ties to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best friend we had,'' said Sgt. Louis Rinaldi of
the Amtrak police force.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral, parts of which were planned by O'Connor himself,
acknowleged in several ways the cardinal's particular priorities.
The first reading, from the book of Wisdom, was given by a nun from
the Sisters of Life, an order O'Connor founded which has a mission
of opposing abortion and euthanasia. A second reading, from the
letter of Paul to the Colossians, was read from the Braille by a
visually impaired woman, because O'Connor had emphasized reaching
out to those who are disabled.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor spent much of his life as a priest working as a
military chaplain, and the funeral, like the daily Mass he
celebrated at St. Patrick's, ran with military precision.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance procession, led by a crossbearer and a thurifer
carrying incense, was packed with deacons, priests, bishops, honor
guards and others. The procession lasted nearly 40 minutes, as the
church dignitaries filed slowly down the center aisle, many pausing
to touch or kiss the casket shrouded in a white pall and topped
with an open Bible and a crucifix.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1:58 p.m., everyone had entered the church, allowing
Vatican Secretary of State Angelo Soldano, the emissary of Pope
John Paul II and the principal celebrant of the Mass, to greet the
crowd and begin the Mass for ``this kind churchman'' promptly as
scheduled at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic funerals do not feature eulogies, so Law sought in his
homily to use the gospel reading, about Jesus's last supper, as an
illustration of O'Connor's faith in the Eucharist and desire to
harness that faith to speak out on church teachings. Law, who was a
close friend of O'Connor and was at his deathbed last week,
recalled that even as O'Connor ceased being able to read or
converse, he could still recite from memory the Eucharistic prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Law acknowledged O'Connor's New York-style personality, saying
``God gifted him with a keen and subtle intellect, an uncommon
rhetorical skill, a knack for the dramatic gesture, a sharp wit and
an outrageous sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Law said O'Connor's reputation was built on his use of those
skills as a fierce advocate for life _ an advocacy that endeared
him to some and drew him criticism from others. Law, like the
Catholic church generally, used the word ``life'' broadly, to
encompass O'Connor's opposition to abortion, euthanasia and capital
punishment and as well as his support for the rights of workers and
for international peace.
</P>
<P>
   Law suggested that O'Connor's own decisions, in allowing his
brain cancer to run its course, was a testament to the church's
teachings on life.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he was dying last Wednesday, as a result of a disease with
terrible consequences, he bore witness one last time to the moral
evil of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He preached most powerfully by his example the necessity of
seeing in every human being, from the first moment of conception to
the last momnet of natural death and every moment in between,
particularly the poor, the sick and the forgotten, the image of a
God to be loved and to be served.''

WINNING MALPRACTICE SUITS A CHALLENGE, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's a daunting statistic: Of all the medical
malpractice lawsuits that go to trial, 94 percent are won by
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   And Monday, as a jury returned a favorable verdict for Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., concluding that the cardiologist was not
negligent in his care and treatment of the late Reggie Lewis, the
statistic seemed to hold true once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a plaintiff's point of view, medical malpractice cases
are the most difficult to win,'' said Boston attorney Andrew C.
Meyer Jr., who frequently represents plaintiffs in medical
malpractice cases.
</P>
<P>
   Even Neil Rossman, the lawyer for Donna Harris-Lewis, Lewis's
widow, acknowledged the challenge of convincing a jury that a
doctor provided substandard care. In comments to reporters after
Monday's verdict, Rossman said trying the case had been ``like
trying to push a boulder up a hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, plaintiffs who sue doctors face a rather high bar when
it comes to convincing a jury that a doctor was negligent.
</P>
<P>
   In medical malpractice cases, jurors are told that it is not
enough to find simply that a doctor made a mistake; they must find
that the care deviated from ``acceptable standards of practice.''
</P>
<P>
   And many attorneys say that conclusion can be difficult to reach
when a panel of jurors -- few, if any, with medical degrees -- are
asked to evaluate testimony that delves into complex, confusing
medical issues.
</P>
<P>
   Add to the mix expert witnesses who frequently offer conflicting
testimony and a jury's task becomes even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   In Mudge's case, for example, his lawyers brought in numerous
consulting physicians who supported Mudge's diagnosis, including
two cardiologists who were cleared of negligence in the first
trial. Rossman, meanwhile, put several witnesses on the stand who
criticized Mudge's care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are always capable of bringing in colleagues to defend
their conduct under almost any circumstances,'' said Meyer, ``and
that makes it very difficult for a jury to determine if a doctor is
negligent.''
</P>
<P>
   Many malpractice attorneys also say that juries tend to be
reluctant to deliver verdicts against doctors, particularly in a
place like Boston, where the city's medical community is held in
particularly high regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the medicine is so far above them, and they're hearing
differing opinions about what was done right and what was done
wrong,'' Meyer said, ``how can jurors possibly come to the
conclusion that a doctor's conduct was below the standard of
care?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to that question is that jurors often can't.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 94 percent figure -- which represents only medical
malpractice cases that go to trial -- tells only part of the story.
Roughly half of all medical malpractice lawsuits nationally are
settled before trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that it's very difficult for plaintiffs to win
medical malpractices cases at trial,'' Boston attorney James P.
McCarthy said. ``But a substantial percentage of cases settle prior
to trial through mediation, sometimes with very substantial
multi-million-dollar settlements.''
</P>
<P>
   The medical malpractice cases most likely to yield a verdict on
a plaintiff's behalf are those that a jury can understand without
medical evidence, such as operating on the wrong leg, giving
extreme overdoses of medications, and other kinds of outrageous
conduct, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Mudge, on the other hand, ``was a very
sophisticated diagnosis and an extremely complex case,'' McCarthy
said. ``And juries tend to give benefit of doubt to doctors in
those cases.''

 &HT;    Lockheed workers to file suit
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of black workers has rejected Lockheed Martin's
overtures to settle their discrimination complaints, making a
high-profile court clash likely for the aerospace manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Workers Against Discrimination, a group of current and former
workers, has scheduled a news conference for today outside Lockheed
Martin Aeronautics Company in Marietta to announce plans for a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys Alexander, Hezekiah Sistrunk, an Atlanta class-action
expert, and Johnnie Cochran, the nationally renowned lawyer, expect
to file suit this week asking a court to certify them to represent
black workers at Lockheed plants nationwide in a racial
discrimination class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit will target both Lockheed and the workers' union,
said Josie Alexander, an attorney for the workers. Alexander said
that the union betrays them by giving lukewarm help in pursuing
complaints about discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A ``good ol' boy culture'' exists in both management and in the
International Association of Machinists &AMP; Aerospace Workers,
Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a minimum the union has acquiesced in the discrimination
and has failed to assist and to adequately represent the
grievances,'' Alexander said. ``Race is a criteria that is used by
Lockheed to eliminate African-Americans. They are not promoted at
the same rate or under the same circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gable, vice president of the union's Local Lodge No. 709,
has said previously that the discrimination complaints would not go
through the union because they didn't involve its contract with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Lockheed, Cobb County's largest private employer,
said the company made a good-faith settlement offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly have worked hard at trying to reach an agreeable
situation,'' said Terry Graham, executive vice president and chief
operating officer. ``Our job is to generate the kind of culture
that is conducive to everyone in the workplace, and I think we have
that kind of culture.''

 &HT;    Shareholder to build support to buy Lodigan
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Battle lines are deepening between Lodgian Inc. and one of its
largest shareholders over continued efforts to buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, William
J. Yung, president of Kentucky-based Edgecliff Holdings Inc., which
owns 11 percent of Lodgian's stock, has asked fellow shareholders
to support his effort to elect up to three nominees to the board of
directors at the next annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Those nominees ``are expected to strongly advocate the sale of
the company to the highest bidder, whether to us or to any
competing bidder,'' Yung said in the filing last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the company's largest stockholder, we have grown
increasingly dissatisfied with the company's performance over the
past year,'' Yung said in the filing. ``Although we have made
repeated overtures to acquire the company in a transaction that
would give stockholders an opportunity to recognize a substantial
premium on their shares, the company has consistently rejected our
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lodgian Chief Executive Robert S. Cole said Yung is ``doing what
he thinks is the right tactic. ... There's no surprise, this is old
news.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has not set a date for its annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC letter also asks shareholder support for a proposal to
prevent the board from adopting bylaw amendments that would impair
an effort to buy the company. Edgecliff has sued Lodgian in a
Delaware court seeking to clear the way to elect three board
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that he is pursing any and all remedies to obtain
board seats,'' said Paul D. Puryear, an analyst with Raymond James
in St. Petersburg, Fla. ``This is just another step in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgecliff, controlled by Yung, has made two proposals to acquire
Lodgian. Lodgian's board has hired Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to
review alternatives, including a possible sale. The company is also
in the process of selling some hotels to reduce debt.
</P>
<P>
   Lodgian owns and operates about 127 hotels in several states and
Canada. Lodgian is a major franchisee of Bass Hotels &AMP; Resorts and
Marriott International chains.

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta plans TV photos
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine sitting in your living room looking at the latest batch
of family photos. But there's not a photo album in sight. Just a
digital image on the TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   Norcross-based Scientific-Atlanta and Eastman Kodak, the world's
largest photography company, agreed Monday to develop a system for
displaying photographs on television sets without using a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Cable subscribers will be able to share photos with distant
family and friends, transporting them over the cable network to a
secure Web server where they can be viewed by computer users and
cable subscribers alike. While personal computers are routinely
used to share digital images, the idea of using the family TV is
brand new.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for the service in Atlanta, at least for now.
MediaOne, Atlanta's major cable TV provider, does not use
Scientific-Atlanta cable boxes, according to spokesman Reg Griffin.
However, Kodak says the deal is nonexclusive, and similar deals
probably will be struck with other set-top box manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Any cable subscriber with a Scientific-Atlanta digital broadband
Explorer box will be able to send pictures from a digital camera
directly to a distant computer on the cable network through a
connection in the cable box. Louise Wasilewski, Scientific-Atlanta
director of business development, said about 1.5 million Explorer
boxes are in use. However, she said the actual market is 30 million
homes _ that's the number of homes located in areas served by cable
systems using Scientific-Atlanta equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak and Scientific-Atlanta expect to make money from service
fees, photofinishing and advertising sales. No fee structure has
been set yet. Scientific-Atlanta makes broadband access equipment
that has allowed cable operators to deliver more channels and
provide digital services such as this one.
</P>
<P>
   Wasilewski says the company will begin trials with Kodak this
fall to make sure the digital photo system works smoothly before
it's rolled out to cable systems across the country. No sites have
been set for the test.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Brumlow, director of worldwide business development for
Kodak, says that the cable-photo arrangement will bring digital
images back into the living room for people to share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fits the paradigm of memories and families,'' he said.
``There are people using digital image services, and they want to
send those pictures to Mom. Mom may not have a PC, but she does
have a digital cable modem. That's a great value proposition,'' he
said. ``It really grows the market for digital cameras, since all
you have to do is plug the camera into the cable box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers really want to participate in the sharing and
posting of their own photographs,'' said Jupiter Communications
analyst Lydia Loizides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photos are an extremely personal and expressive way for people
to share memories, especially as we bring the Internet into it,''
she said. ``It's a very quick and effortless way to store images.
It's a few steps up from the shoebox. In practical terms for
longevity _ film and negatives are fragile and this is a way for
people to store their photos long term.''
</P>
<P>
   Loizides says the advent of broadband has little to do with the
growing demand for posting pictures to the Web or the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the ice cream on the cake,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fulfills an intangible need to create, to share and to
publish. Grandma in Utah will wait 20 minutes to see a picture of
the precious grandbaby's first birthday. It's the definition of
compelling content.''

   On Nov. 20, 1821, the Nantucket whaling ship Essex sank after it
was rammed by a huge sperm whale, the first ever known to
deliberately attack a ship. The incident, which a member of the
crew called an act of ``fury and vengeance,'' was as famous then as
the fate of the Titanic would become in the 20th century (it
inspired Herman Melville's climactic scene in his 1851 novel,
(beginitalic)Moby-Dick(enditalic)). Philbrick recreates the months
at sea with the hard-working men of the Essex, and the chilling
attack and its aftermath, when 20 men in three small boats tried to
save themselves. Only eight survived the following months, which
Philbrick calls ``a kind of terrible laboratory experiment devised
to see just how far the human animal could go in its battle against
the savage sea.'' This is a terrific addition to the list of recent
books about danger and adventure on the high seas.

   National Public Radio's Simon has written a memoir that is a
thinly-veiled excuse to talk about sports. No, we are too kind.
It's not veiled at all. It's a fan's memoir. If you enjoy the
author as host of NPR's (beginitalic)Weekend
(enditalic)(beginitalic)Edition(enditalic), you will enjoy him here
- he is witty, easy company. It helps, of course, if you have your
own feelings about sports, especially sports from Chicago. Simon
has an undying allegiance to that city, forged by incidents such as
when he was in kindergarten and his family moved to San Francisco,
where some evil second-graders tied him to a tree with a jump rope
after he ridiculed them for not knowing White Sox pitcher Billy
Pierce. In addition to Chicago and its athletes, Simon covers his
family traumas - his father's alcoholism, the divorce of his
parents, whom he calls ``the funniest man and the most beautiful
woman in Chicago'' - and his career as a journalist.

   ``Ravelstein, with his bald powerful head, was at ease with
large statements, big issues, and famous men, with decades, eras,
centuries. He was, however, just as familiar with entertainers like
Mel Brooks as with the classics and could go from Thucydides' huge
tragedy to Moses as played by Brooks.'' Bellow might be describing
himself, but isn't - he is describing his late friend Allan Bloom,
the model for Bellow's character, Abe Ravelstein. Like Bloom,
Ravelstein was a debt-plagued academic who wrote a book that sold
like crazy and made him rich (in Bloom's case, (beginitalic)The
Closing of the American Mind(enditalic).) The narrator is Chick,
the Bellow persona whose friendship with Ravelstein is built on
intellect, rivalry and affection. Chick has wives, and Ravelstein
has a boyfriend and a disease, but the core of this novel is the
wise interplay between the friends as they face Ravelstein's
mortality.

</P>
<P>
   (HarperCollins, $24)
</P>
<P>
   The title is a gimmick. Cleese and Bates actually make a
heartfelt effort to explore the volatile mother-child relationship
that haunts so many adult lives today. They interviewed a wide
range of people about their experiences with their mothers,
discussing mothers as martyrs, mothers who interfere with their
children's lives, mothers who don't listen and mothers who withhold
approval. Many people, they discovered, received much of their
mothering from women other than their mothers. Another finding: Our
mothers often do not expect from us all that we think they do. The
authors advise you to keep a sense of humor about your mother,
confront the issues that divide you and communicate with her. Most
of all, you should remember that ``managing your mother is really
about managing yourself.''

algae. Depressing, but informative. To lighten your spirits, the
magazine offers a guide to ``weekends in wilderness - pretty places
you can visit that are only a short drive from the city.'' Of
course, to Audubon, a short drive is like four hours. So fill 'er
up.

   ``GEORGE''
</P>
<P>
   If you stopped looking at this magazine somewhere along the way,
give it a second chance this month. It's been redesigned, and this
is the first issue to bear the stamp of its new editor, Frank
Lalli. It also comes out firing, with a fascinating excerpt from
the autobiography of feminist Betty Friedan, who reveals that her
husband physically abused her. The magazine, which has separate
covers for newsstand and subscriber sales, leads with a story about
Elian Gonzalez, and though you might be sick of that cute little
Cuban boy, this story actually tells the tale of three people who
survived the shipwreck and 11 others who died. My favorite article
is a piece by Jon Stewart, host of (beginitalic)The Daily
Show(enditalic), who is quietly becoming the funniest man on
television. Who else could get away with having Bob Dole as a
sideman?
</P>
<P>
   ``NEW YORKER''
</P>
<P>
   Offers some interesting slice-of-life features on jobs, all told
in the first person. One is the tale of a street vendor who sells
coffee and doughnuts off a cart in lower Manhattan. He hits the
street at 5 a.m. and has to deal with hostile yuppies all day long.
``The worst thing is the customers, almost all of whom are
appallingly hateful, horrible people.''' Hmmm. In New York? Naaa.
Another chronicles the exploits of a basketball coach at a Catholic
school who admits he breaks all sorts of rules recruiting players
and everyone looks the other way. (The school is not named). ``It's
what you have to do to win,'' he explains. Another longer article
follows a car salesman from his first day to his first big sale. In
between, there's some pretty funny stuff, including the inside
chitchat between the sales people. In the end, he ends up -
surprise! - disillusioned and bitter. You'd think a story like that
would have a happy ending, like ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``PRIORITIES''
</P>
<P>
   Provides your daily dose of affirmation. To buy a magazine that
is subtitled ``The Journal of Professional and Personal Success,''
you just have to be something special. They offer a lightweight
feature on former Phoenix Suns Coach Danny Ainge, who gave up one
of the glitziest jobs in the world to spend time with his family.
Oh yeah, and travel around and broadcast games for TNT. Also
features a cover story on uber-director Steven Spielberg, which
apparently was written without actually talking to him. There are
some canned quotes from press releases, and an interview with
Spielberg's wife, actress Kate Capshaw, but no close encounters
with his E.T.-ness. They do, however, have a nice publicity still
of Spielberg sitting next to a dinosaur foot. In the self-help
category, there is a piece on how to survive a downsizing, and
another on how to work at your computer without contracting the
dreaded repetitive-stress injury. By the way, who took my chair?

</P>
<P>
   If you love to fly or just like to watch the planes, the
Birdwatcher Report is for you.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, an aviation enthusiast who works for the city
Aviation Department, compiles the monthly report.
</P>
<P>
   Jones spends his spare time watching and photographing planes
that fly in and out of Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport. He
researches the aircraft, and then writes the Birdwatcher report for
the Aviation Department newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   This month's issue include a report on the plane that brought
former Phoenix Suns guard Dan Majerle to the Valley as a member of
the Miami Heat (a former Malaysian Air System Boeing 727-212.)
</P>
<P>
   There are also photos of different planes at satellite airports
around the Valley, from a Chinese-built copy of a MiG trainer at
Deer Valley Airport to a ``forlorn DC-7'' sitting at Phoenix
Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   The site is linked off the main Sky Harbor page
(http://www.phxskyharbor.com/skyharbr/index.html), which has plenty
more information about the airport.

   MAGAZINE REVIEWS:
</P>
<P>
   ``AUDOBON''
</P>
<P>
   We always thought the skull-and-crossbones label was enough, but
that was before we read (beginitalic)Audubon(enditalic), which has
learned that certain pesticides can be harmful if swallowed.
Cheerfully titled ``The Killer in Your Yard,'' the article offer
alternatives to soaking you lawn in DDT. There is a Big Stupid
Chart that looks toxic itself. After all, it is painted silver.
There is a well-done piece on new diseases that are cropping up in
the ocean, infecting coral reefs, seals, turtles, dolphins and many
other aquatic creatures. Experts believe that the combination of
pollution and global warming are tipping the scales in favor of
``underwater killers'' - bacteria, viruses, parasites and toxic
algae. Depressing, but informative. To lighten your spirits, the
magazine offers a guide to ``weekends in wilderness - pretty places
you can visit that are only a short drive from the city.'' Of
course, to Audubon, a short drive is like four hours. So fill 'er

 &HT;    JEFF SHAARA PICKS UP FATHER'S PEN (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: MOVING IN ``E'' and ``L'' categories) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, no matter where you hide, destiny finds you.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jeff Shaara, who was a rare-coin dealer when his father
died in 1988. Though his dad had written a Pulitzer Prize-winning
book on the Civil War ((beginitalic)The Killer Angels(enditalic)),
Jeff had never shown any interest in writing.
</P>
<P>
   That would soon change.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Michael Shaara's death, the popularity of
historical fiction was surging, fueled by Ken Burns' sweeping
documentary (beginitalic)The Civil War(enditalic)(beginitalic).
(enditalic)In 1993, (beginitalic)The Killer Angels (enditalic)was
made into the Turner film (beginitalic)Gettysburg(enditalic), and
the movie's director suggested that Jeff find someone to write a
sequel and a prequel.
</P>
<P>
   He found someone all right - himself. Two bestsellers later,
Jeff Shaara is still surprised at his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people asked me, how did I get the courage to sit
down and write,'' said Shaara, who will be in Phoenix on May 17 to
promote his new novel, (beginitalic)Gone For Soldiers(enditalic).
``It really didn't take courage, because I had no expectations
{hellip} that any publisher would take this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara knows he'll be known as the son of Michael Shaara, whose
book was recognized as a masterpiece when it was published in 1974
but never enjoyed commercial success. Jeff said his first two
books, (beginitalic)Gods and Generals (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)The Last Full Measure, (enditalic)both of which are
headed to the big screen, were simply the continuation of his
father's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing (beginitalic)Gods and Generals (enditalic)I
showed the manuscript to my sister, and she said, `This is being
written by the ghost of Michael Shaara,''' Jeff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's proud when people compare his style to his father's
but that he never set out to imitate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that works,'' Shaara said. ``Then it becomes all
style and no substance. {hellip} The voice has to come from
somewhere else. I think, certainly, I've been influenced by my
father's style, there's no doubt about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a great compliment when somebody tells me they
see similarities in my style and my father's.''
</P>
<P>
   To produce the Shaara brand of historical fiction, both Jeff and
his dad put the reader into the minds of historical figures,
re-creating conversations during key meetings and battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hearing their thoughts and hearing their words,''
Shaara said. ``By definition, that's fiction. There was nobody
walking around behind these guys with a pad and paper writing down
everything they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some have criticized the re-creation technique, Jeff said
all the work is based on months of research. Shaara pored over
memoirs and eyewitness accounts to re-create history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those meetings are real. {hellip} Any of the commanders in the
book could have said any of the words that I'm putting in their
mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   In what many see as a break with his father, Shaara's new book
is not about the Civil War. Instead, he chose the Mexican-American
War, in which future Civil War commanders like Ulysses S. Grant,
Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson first learned the
art of combat. At that time, the two future Confederate generals
were fighting in the same uniform as Grant under the same Union
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, (beginitalic)Gone for Soldiers
(enditalic)(named for a verse in the Pete Seeger song
(beginitalic)Where Have All the Flowers Gone?(enditalic)) is the
story of two opposing generals, War of 1812 hero Winfield Scott of
the United States and Mexico's Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   To get inside their heads, Shaara found Scott's unpublished
memoirs at West Point and consulted Santa Ana's memoirs, which were
recently translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   Shaara said the Mexican-American War (1846-48) often is
overlooked. Though it allowed the United States to acquire most of
what is now Arizona, New Mexico and California, its short duration
and proximity to the Civil War make it a footnote in most history
books.
</P>
<P>
   There are also strong parallels with Vietnam, Shaara notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was seen as a bully's war, (that) basically we were going
down there to grab land,'' Shaara said. ``The themes are similar.
You have this big muscular country going down and beating on these
little guys. You had a lot of that in Vietnam. There was also the
sense that the soldiers were unappreciated back home.''

 &HT;    COULD ARIZONA'S LISA GRAHAM KEEGAN CUT IT AS EDUCATION
SECRETARY(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Todd Bankofier, vice president of the Arizona Board of
Education, jokingly referred to her as ``Secretary Keegan'' during
a recent board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   That's ``Secretary,'' as in Secretary of Education Lisa Graham
Keegan of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Some think it has a certain ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two influential magazine columnists, including George Will in
(beginitalic)Newsweek(enditalic), have mentioned Keegan, the
state's superintendent of public instruction, as a possible U.S.
Education secretary if George W. Bush is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Few now think the suggestion is far-fetched. In fact, all this
talk about Keegan's candidacy has Arizona folks wondering: Is she
qualified?
</P>
<P>
   The nation's top education post, now inhabited by Richard Riley,
is massive. The U.S. Education secretary is in charge of 175
programs and a $38 billion budget. The federal government pumps
money into such areas as bilingual education, lunches for
low-income students and classroom technology.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan-watchers have mixed views on whether she's ready to
ascend to the federal level. The complicated, well-spoken and
intelligent woman who moved to the state's top education job in
1994 after dabbling in politics in the Legislature has many allies
- and just as many detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Some like Keegan's stance on state testing and the fact that she
so quickly attached Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards to a
high school diploma. They applaud her for cultivating charter
schools, which are publicly and privately funded schools that are
meant to inspire competition and encourage district schools to do a
better job.
</P>
<P>
   And they say she could take her successes in Arizona onto the
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say Keegan's alternative education system is
weakening public education rather trying to fix the problems from
within. They say she isolates those whom her state job is designed
to support, mainly teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this is happening as Arizona continues to land at the
bottom nationally when it comes to its high dropout rate, low
teacher salaries and per-pupil funding.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan is flattered by what she calls all of the ``pundits'
stuff.'' Her staff members were quick to fax the
(beginitalic)Newsweek(enditalic) column to local media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a fifth-grade son and second-grade daughter at
Kiva Elementary School in the Scottsdale Unified School District
acknowledges that she's not loved by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   She's willing to admit that the education system has flaws.
That's the only way to begin the process of change, Keegan said.
But that type of attitude has a tendency to offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fuzzy about opinions,'' Keegan said. ``You have to be
critical of the way things are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it bothers her when folks charge that she's trying to
dismantle public education. Just because she supports private
schools doesn't mean she's anti-public education, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My definition of public education is education that's
supported by the public, by which the child benefits,'' Keegan
said. ``So much of public education is private enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Love her or not, folks agree that Keegan has demonstrated
nimbleness and political savvy in recent months, gliding
effortlessly from Sen. John McCain's camp, where she spent at least
a week on the campaign trail, into the good graces of Bush after
McCain dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret she's hungry for a job in Washington, D.C., a
city she frequents. In 1994, she founded the Education Leaders
Council, a group of reform-minded education chiefs in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   Her national speaking engagements run from Harvard University to
the National Press Club to, most recently, a weekly gathering of
Republican senators. She's also been to Argentina twice to talk
about charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   While state Sen. Chris Cummiskey, D-central Phoenix, may not
agree with Keegan's support of vouchers and other conservative
ideas, he does admit she possesses attributes that make her a good
candidate for U.S. Education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very articulate and good at expressing her perspective
on education,'' he said. ``She's willing to have a thoughtful
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about Keegan, it may be premature to start
taking her national press notices too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Bush campaign officials are mum on the matter,
saying it's premature until the Republican National Convention
rolls around this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no list at this point,'' spokesman Scott McClellan
said. ``The governor will think about that in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan, who is 40 years old and has lived in the state since she
was 3, doesn't spend much time dwelling on her critics. She is
spending her time working on ideas for her job description, should
she find herself in the Bush Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said she would revise the way federal money goes to the
states, tying it more closely to each student instead of funding
programs. She would be an advocate for more charter-school laws and
encourage equal funding to get rid of the disparity between rich
and poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than mandate what states do, however, Keegan sees her
role as one in which she would free them up to increase student
achievement standards.
</P>
<P>
   That's why parent Onnie Shekerjian believes Keegan is qualified
to be education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush wants some one with courage, intelligence and
good common sense, then Lisa certainly should be in his top list of
people,'' said Onnie Shekerjian, who heads up the Arizona Parents
Association for Children's Education and has several children in
East Valley schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the national education chief needs to be in touch with
schools. Some school district officials across Arizona worry that
Keegan isn't, saying she makes decisions and then leaves districts
to carry them out without the needed resources.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, for example, the state Department of Education,
with the blessing of the Board of Education, decided to allow
students with limited English proficiency to have the math portion
of AIMS translated into their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   But officials made the call a week before the test was
administered.
</P>
<P>
   K.R. Scott, a Mountain Pointe High School government teacher who
ran against Keegan in 1998 as a write-in candidate, said Keegan
tends to isolate educators.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that, when she took office, she got rid of
professional education specialists and replaced them with
``political functionaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an inherent distrust of educators,'' Scott added. ``A
lot of people don't feel like they have a voice with her. If you
give her a national stage, I worry about the divisiveness.''

 &HT;    Cisco chief executive No. 1 in Worth's annual ranking
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cisco Systems and its chief executive, John Chambers, are
rapidly replacing Microsoft and Chairman Bill Gates on the covers
of America's business press.
</P>
<P>
   Worth (May) says Chambers was the ``clear choice'' as No. 1 CEO
atop its annual list of the 50 best chief executives. He already
has created more wealth than investor Warren Buffett and will
likely surpass Gates this year, the magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers' portrait also adorns the cover of Fortune (May 22),
whose editor at large, Andy Serwer, says Chambers put together a
``corporate machine'' that enabled Cisco to create more than $400
billion in shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Barron's (May 8-12) to throw cold water on Cisco,
which it describes as ``the most successful company in the hottest
sector of the Internet economy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barron's also calls it ``a modern house of cards'' whose
policy of growth by acquisition ``carries with it the seeds of
self-destruction'' by constantly bidding the price of its targets
higher and higher.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, two Georgia CEOs are on Worth's Top 50 list:
Arthur Blank of Home Depot at No. 8 and James Kelly of United
Parcel Service at No. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Where the whammy is
</P>
<P>
   The premier edition of Fortune's new e-magazine _ eCompany Now
(June) _ offers advice on ``the people you need to see in Atlanta''
to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   Dean of the ``new economy'' is John Imlay, 63, who saved
Management Science America and sold it to Dun &AMP; Bradstreet in 1990.
More than 50 MSA employes have become CEOs of other firms.
</P>
<P>
   The others are attorney John Yates, 43, a partner at Morris
Manning and Martin; Bert Ellis, 46, founder of the Internet
services firm iXL Enterprises; Jeff Arnold, 30, whose WebMD was
merged into Healtheon in a $5.5 billion deal; venture capitalist
Alan Taetle, 36, of Noro-Moseley Partners; and Jeff Levy, 36, who
hosts prospective entrepreneurs at his incubator firm, eHatchery,
twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   The case for a crash
</P>
<P>
   After analyzing 100 years of data, two authors think there's a
67 percent chance of a stock market crash in the coming year, says
Business Week (May 15).
</P>
<P>
   According to London economic consultant Andrew Smithers and
Cambridge University professor Stephen Wright, the stock market
value of all U.S. companies has stretched far beyond the fair value
of the companies' net assets. When that has happened in the past
(Wall Street, 1929; Tokyo, 1989), they said stock prices snapped
with terrible consequences in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   What should investors do with their money? ``Put it into cash,''
they advise.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning...
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is out with a summer special, a ``Best of the Web''
edition that lists hundreds of computer sites for investors,
consumers and executives.
</P>
<P>
   Technology Investor (June) says ``old economy'' stocks are not
the safe haven panicky investors think they are. The theory:
Technology stocks will do better because that's where real economic
growth is.

CHINA TRADE BILL BRINGS TOGETHER TWO UNLIKELY ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a bill-signing ceremony at the White House a
few weeks ago, President Clinton pulled aside an unlikely ally in
his fight to win approval for a decisive trade measure with China,
the administration's top foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about what each of us has to do and we gave each
other some advice,'' said Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House
majority whip and perhaps Clinton's most venomous critic on Capitol
Hill, who refused to divulge details of the private chat in his
rare visit to the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   With the crucial vote just two weeks away, DeLay, who led the
charge to impeach Clinton, now finds himself in the improbable role
of the president's chief water-carrier and potential legacy-builder
in an all-out battle to grant China permanent normal trading
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   If the China measure succeeds, and right now the vote is too
close to call, it will be largely with the support of Republicans,
who are expected to deliver about 150 of the 218 votes needed to
pass it. The measure would allow American companies to benefit
fully from a market-opening accord that paves the way for China to
enter the World Trade Organization. Approval by the Senate appears
more certain.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Clinton needs DeLay, who as the chief Republican vote
counter, brings the power of his vaunted House whip operation as
well as his own widely acclaimed _ and feared _ brass-knuckle
tactics that have earned him the nickname ``The Hammer.'' (``If we
get within four or five votes, we can break some arms on the
floor,'' said one of DeLay's advisers.)
</P>
<P>
   DeLay insists his personal distaste for Clinton, whom he
criticized recently as ``lacking the necessary moral authority to
protect U.S. interests in the world,'' is not clouding his
professional task at hand: rounding up votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a fundamental disagreement with this president about
how he's done his job, but when he's doing something I think is
important I'm going to support him, because he doesn't do it very
often,'' DeLay said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has even gone out of his way to praise the president's
efforts to rally support for the measure. DeLay's chief of staff,
Susan B. Hirschmann, consults regularly with the chief White House
lobbyist, Charles M. Brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a good job, and the president's done a very good
job,'' DeLay said. ``He's done exactly what a president should do
in getting his points across.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-DeLay connection is just one of the odd alignments
spawned from the fight, which has labor unions and conservative
religious groups opposing the measure and soybean farmers and
high-tech executives backing it.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the measure grew on Monday. Alan Greenspan, chairman
of the Federal Reserve, publicly endorsed it. Three former
presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, issued a
letter coordinated by the White House warning that defeat ``would
be read in China as a vote for confrontation and as an argument for
hunkering down, instead of continuing to reach out.''
</P>
<P>
   Some colleagues say DeLay is singing the White House's praises
through clenched teeth, and is consoling himself that helping to
hand Clinton a crowning legislative triumph will cheer the
pro-Republican business community and undermine Beijing's communist
government.
</P>
<P>
   If it is strange to see DeLay and Clinton teaming up, it is
equally strange for the third-ranking House Republican to support a
measure that China passionately wants.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a fierce anti-communist, is the chief author of the
Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, a bill the House passed this year
to strengthen military ties between Taiwan and the Pentagon, which
Beijing strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was DeLay's encounter last spring with China's
ambassador, Li Zhao Xing, offstage at NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him: `Don't take the weakness of this American
president as the weakness of the American people,' '' DeLay
recounted recently to a group of Washington Post reporters and
editors. ``He looked at me kind of funny, so I pulled him real
close, nose to nose, and I repeated it, very slowly. He just turned
and kind of walked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the studio, DeLay said the ambassador stopped
criticizing the United States and ``scooted off'' when the lawmaker
walked up. ``It shows you that if you stand up to a bully, then you
control the bully,'' DeLay said. ``If you kowtow to the bully, the
bully will run your life forever. And that's the way I see these
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese Embassy official said the ambassador had no idea who
DeLay was, and until he read about the incident, thought he had
been accosted by an ordinary American. The two men met later to
discuss the China trade bill, and there were ``no hard feelings,''
the embassy aide said.
</P>
<P>
   So why does DeLay support a measure that his Moral Enemies No. 1
and No. 2 crave so badly? ``Exporting American values undermines
the communist regime in China,'' DeLay explained in the interview.
``Free-market principles, entrepreneurship, the Internet, all these
institutions reflect American values. I see it as a beginning of
the end of communism.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay said he also distinguishes the Beijing government from
ordinary Chinese people. ``They have tasted the sweet taste of
freedom and they're not going to give it back,'' DeLay said in a
speech last week.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate lobbyists have always viewed DeLay's commitment to
trade with China with some suspicion. In a speech on March 16,
DeLay underscored his support for normalizing trade relations with
China, but he also warned that the status might be revoked if trade
ever strengthened the Beijing government rather than weakened it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never be fooled into cheering higher profits while
Communist China harnesses that prosperity to construct an arsenal
of tyranny,'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why many business lobbyists who have met DeLay recently
have been struck by his fervor. ``This man sounded like a true
believer,'' said one leading lobbyist. ``He talked about kicking
butt.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, DeLay and his vote-counters, as well as other top
Republican supporters outside the whip team like Rep. David Dreier
of California, will try to get a firm head count among their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been longing for an opportunity to work with the
president on something other than one of his scandals,'' Rep. Todd
Tiahrt, a Kansas Republican on the whip team who backs the measure,
said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   For now, DeLay is silent on any predictions _ saying only that
the next two weeks ``will be very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the whip of the House,'' DeLay said. ``It's my
responsibility to get the votes to achieve our agenda.''

intelligent woman who moved to the state's top education job in
1994 after dabbling in politics in the Legislature has many allies
- and just as many detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Some like Keegan's stance on state testing and the fact that she
so quickly attached Arizona's Instrument to Measure Standards to a
high school diploma. They applaud her for cultivating charter
schools, which are publicly and privately funded schools that are
meant to inspire competition and encourage district schools to do a
better job.
</P>
<P>
   And they say she could take her successes in Arizona onto the
national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, say Keegan's alternative education system is
weakening public education rather trying to fix the problems from
within. They say she isolates those whom her state job is designed
to support, mainly teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   And all of this is happening as Arizona continues to land at the
bottom nationally when it comes to its high dropout rate, low
teacher salaries and per-pupil funding.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan is flattered by what she calls all of the ``pundits'
stuff.'' Her staff members were quick to fax the
(beginitalic)Newsweek(enditalic) column to local media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of a fifth-grade son and second-grade daughter at
Kiva Elementary School in the Scottsdale Unified School District
acknowledges that she's not loved by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   She's willing to admit that the education system has flaws.
That's the only way to begin the process of change, Keegan said.
But that type of attitude has a tendency to offend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not fuzzy about opinions,'' Keegan said. ``You have to be
critical of the way things are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it bothers her when folks charge that she's trying to
dismantle public education. Just because she supports private
schools doesn't mean she's anti-public education, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My definition of public education is education that's
supported by the public, by which the child benefits,'' Keegan
said. ``So much of public education is private enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Love her or not, folks agree that Keegan has demonstrated
nimbleness and political savvy in recent months, gliding
effortlessly from Sen. John McCain's camp, where she spent at least
a week on the campaign trail, into the good graces of Bush after
McCain dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret she's hungry for a job in Washington, D.C., a
city she frequents. In 1994, she founded the Education Leaders
Council, a group of reform-minded education chiefs in eight states.
</P>
<P>
   Her national speaking engagements run from Harvard University to
the National Press Club to, most recently, a weekly gathering of
Republican senators. She's also been to Argentina twice to talk
about charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   While state Sen. Chris Cummiskey, D-central Phoenix, may not
agree with Keegan's support of vouchers and other conservative
ideas, he does admit she possesses attributes that make her a good
candidate for U.S. Education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very articulate and good at expressing her perspective
on education,'' he said. ``She's willing to have a thoughtful
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the talk about Keegan, it may be premature to start
taking her national press notices too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Bush campaign officials are mum on the matter,
saying it's premature until the Republican National Convention
rolls around this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no list at this point,'' spokesman Scott McClellan
said. ``The governor will think about that in due course.''
</P>
<P>
   Keegan, who is 40 years old and has lived in the state since she
was 3, doesn't spend much time dwelling on her critics. She is
spending her time working on ideas for her job description, should
she find herself in the Bush Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan said she would revise the way federal money goes to the
states, tying it more closely to each student instead of funding
programs. She would be an advocate for more charter-school laws and
encourage equal funding to get rid of the disparity between rich
and poor schools.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than mandate what states do, however, Keegan sees her
role as one in which she would free them up to increase student
achievement standards.
</P>
<P>
   That's why parent Onnie Shekerjian believes Keegan is qualified
to be education secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush wants some one with courage, intelligence and
good common sense, then Lisa certainly should be in his top list of
people,'' said Onnie Shekerjian, who heads up the Arizona Parents
Association for Children's Education and has several children in
East Valley schools.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the national education chief needs to be in touch with
schools. Some school district officials across Arizona worry that
Keegan isn't, saying she makes decisions and then leaves districts
to carry them out without the needed resources.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, for example, the state Department of Education,
with the blessing of the Board of Education, decided to allow
students with limited English proficiency to have the math portion
of AIMS translated into their native languages.
</P>
<P>
   But officials made the call a week before the test was
administered.
</P>
<P>
   K.R. Scott, a Mountain Pointe High School government teacher who
ran against Keegan in 1998 as a write-in candidate, said Keegan
tends to isolate educators.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that, when she took office, she got rid of
professional education specialists and replaced them with
``political functionaries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an inherent distrust of educators,'' Scott added. ``A
lot of people don't feel like they have a voice with her. If you
give her a national stage, I worry about the divisiveness.''

<P>
   By Jodi Picoult
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pocket, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Picoult's latest novel reads like a cross between the Harrison
Ford movie ``Witness ``and Scott Turow's novel ``Presumed
Innocent,'' with a dose of television's ``The Practice'' thrown in
to spice up the legal dilemmas. An Amish teenager named Katie
Fisher is accused of murdering her newborn child after hiding her
pregnancy from her parents and her Amish boyfriend (he's not the
father). Philadelphia lawyer Ellie Hathaway takes her case and
moves in with Katie's family for the duration of the trial, giving
Picoult the descriptive fodder of Amish life (especially
interesting is her portrayal of the austere Aaron Fisher, Katie's
father). When Ellie's old flame, a psychiatrist, comes to evaluate
Katie, he stays on for another romantic go-round with Ellie. It's
all appealing, suspenseful reading, despite unbelievable courtroom
antics and a final scene that is meant as a surprise but reads like
an afterthought. Picoult, who lived among the Amish to research her
book, portrays them unsentimentally but compassionately. Enjoy.

   Leave it to ``The Onion,'' that shameless parody of print
journalism, to badmouth Special Olympians, to suggest that we
prefer Oprah's Book Club because the Drew Carey Book Club is too
challenging, to publish a guest column by JonBenet Ramsey. In other
news, we learn that Mother Teresa was sent to hell in a ``wacky
afterlife mix-up,'' that nine people were drawn and quartered at a
Renaissance Fair, that a new study proves human babies are not
inquisitive but are ``actually extraordinarily stupid.'' Last year
some very serious people published very serious books about the
major events of the 19th century, but ``The Onion'' came along and
aced them all with ``Our Dumb Century: 100 Years of Headlines From
America's Finest News Source.'' Is this book as funny as that one?
No, but it's close enough if you observe the ground rules: Always
remember that nothing is sacred (hence the photo of Christopher
Reeve and his chair bolted to the top of the Washington Monument),
and good taste is checked at the door.

<P>
   Someone should write a book about Ted Conover - or maybe, in a
strange way, he has done it himself many times. His work is
sometimes called ``participatory journalism,'' but that, especially
in this case, seems inadequate to describe it. He has ridden trains
with hoboes in one book (''Rolling Nowhere''), travelled with
illegal aliens in another (''Coy(beginitalic)o(enditalic)tes'') and
mixed with Aspen's elite in ``Whiteout.'' But nothing engages
Conover's imagination like a prison. He tried to get into one as a
journalist, but was turned down, so he went in as a recruit and
spent a year as a corrections officer in Sing Sing, one of the
nation's most troubled maximum-security prisons (the title of his
book is the term for a novice officer). This is his fascinating
look at a disturbing place - every day, he writes, ``your stomach
lets you know, just before the shift starts, what it thinks of this
job'' - and the men who coexist there. It's a revealing book by one
of the most daring and compassionate journalists working today.

   ``I know you may be bored hearing so much about my hair, but
this is what matters when you are 13,'' writes Tarbox. ``Besides,
my hair was the only part of my body that I liked.'' The portrait
Tarbox paints of herself as a Connecticut 13-year-old is indeed
boring, and full of an adolescent's obsession with her flaws. and
her family's shortcomings. It might all be depressingly average,
except for one thing. In a teen chat room on American Online,
Tarbox met a boy named Mark, who was friendly and made good
conversation. They kept in touch, and their friendship began to
seem like destiny. Eventually he flew to Texas to meet her when she
was in Dallas for a swim meet, but there is nothing romantic about
what happened between them in his hotel room. Katie narrowly
escaped disaster, and, after learning from police that Mark was 41,
she and her mother pressed charges against him. This is a story
every parent should read, a cautionary tale about the importance of
love and, more importantly, vigilance. There's nothing boring about
it.

DEFYING BIG LABOR, GORE PUSHES FOR CHINA TRADE MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mich.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the congressional vote on permanent normalized
trade relations for China draws closer, Vice President Al Gore is
stepping up his activities to promote it.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke more forcefully Monday for the agreement than he
usually does. And on Tuesday he plans to attend a White House
meeting with President Clinton and former President Gerald Ford,
among others, to lobby for the measure, which Congress is to vote
on later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been tepid in his support so far for the agreement,
largely because organized labor, which backs him, opposes it. But
speaking up for it serves Gore's political purposes now by helping
to counter the impression, reinforced during the controversy over
Elian Gonzalez, that he does not take principled stands and instead
panders to those whose support he seeks.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of Associated Press publishers and editors here
Monday, Gore did not bring up the China matter, but was asked about
it in a question-and-answer session after his speech.
Uncharacteristically, he delved into the reasons that he believed
it should pass. Normally, when he mentions the issue at all, he
gives it fairly short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't reduce any U.S. tariffs; it only reduces Chinese
tariffs,'' he said at the Associated Press meeting, which was held
in St. Bartholomew's Church in Midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we turned it down,'' he continued, referring to the World
Trade Organization, ``it wouldn't keep China from coming into the
WTO; China would come into the WTO anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Failing to approve the trade agreement, he said, would not hurt
China but would put the United States at a ``severe disadvantage''
with its own trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gore will appear in the East Room at the White House
with Clinton, former Presidents Ford and Jimmy Carter, and two
former secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and James Baker. It
could not be immediately determined whether former President George
Bush had been invited to the event. His son, Gov. George W. Bush,
supports the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's commitment to the matter has been in some doubt since he
won the AFL-CIO endorsement last fall. He said then that he
supported it, leading two of the organization's most powerful
members, the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, to withhold
their endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has tried to win over James P. Hoffa, president of the
Teamsters union, lunching with him last month in Michigan. Hoffa,
who is up for re-election and faces his own internal politics, has
recently expressed more interest in the third-party candidacy of
Pat Buchanan, who also opposes the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said he has called some members of Congress to push
them to support the treaty, but he has not said how many. Aides say
he has made calls from his campaign plane and from his office and
that if he did not want to appear in the East Room, he would not do
so, suggesting that he sees some political benefit in standing with
Clinton on an issue that the administration has advanced as
important to the economy.

 &HT;    JEFF SHAARA PICKS UP FATHER'S PEN (a) 
 &HT;    (Duplication warning: MOVING IN ``E'' and ``L'' categories) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, no matter where you hide, destiny finds you.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Jeff Shaara, who was a rare-coin dealer when his father
died in 1988. Though his dad had written a Pulitzer Prize-winning
book on the Civil War ((beginitalic)The Killer Angels(enditalic)),
Jeff had never shown any interest in writing.
</P>
<P>
   That would soon change.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Michael Shaara's death, the popularity of
historical fiction was surging, fueled by Ken Burns' sweeping
documentary (beginitalic)The Civil War(enditalic)(beginitalic).
(enditalic)In 1993, (beginitalic)The Killer Angels (enditalic)was
made into the Turner film (beginitalic)Gettysburg(enditalic), and
the movie's director suggested that Jeff find someone to write a
sequel and a prequel.
</P>
<P>
   He found someone all right - himself. Two bestsellers later,
Jeff Shaara is still surprised at his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people asked me, how did I get the courage to sit
down and write,'' said Shaara, who will be in Phoenix on May 17 to
promote his new novel, (beginitalic)Gone For Soldiers(enditalic).
``It really didn't take courage, because I had no expectations
{hellip} that any publisher would take this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara knows he'll be known as the son of Michael Shaara, whose
book was recognized as a masterpiece when it was published in 1974
but never enjoyed commercial success. Jeff said his first two
books, (beginitalic)Gods and Generals (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)The Last Full Measure, (enditalic)both of which are
headed to the big screen, were simply the continuation of his
father's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was writing (beginitalic)Gods and Generals (enditalic)I
showed the manuscript to my sister, and she said, `This is being
written by the ghost of Michael Shaara,''' Jeff said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's proud when people compare his style to his father's
but that he never set out to imitate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that works,'' Shaara said. ``Then it becomes all
style and no substance. {hellip} The voice has to come from
somewhere else. I think, certainly, I've been influenced by my
father's style, there's no doubt about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it a great compliment when somebody tells me they
see similarities in my style and my father's.''
</P>
<P>
   To produce the Shaara brand of historical fiction, both Jeff and
his dad put the reader into the minds of historical figures,
re-creating conversations during key meetings and battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hearing their thoughts and hearing their words,''
Shaara said. ``By definition, that's fiction. There was nobody
walking around behind these guys with a pad and paper writing down
everything they said.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some have criticized the re-creation technique, Jeff said
all the work is based on months of research. Shaara pored over
memoirs and eyewitness accounts to re-create history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those meetings are real. {hellip} Any of the commanders in the
book could have said any of the words that I'm putting in their
mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   In what many see as a break with his father, Shaara's new book
is not about the Civil War. Instead, he chose the Mexican-American
War, in which future Civil War commanders like Ulysses S. Grant,
Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson first learned the
art of combat. At that time, the two future Confederate generals
were fighting in the same uniform as Grant under the same Union
flag.
</P>
<P>
   But in many ways, (beginitalic)Gone for Soldiers
(enditalic)(named for a verse in the Pete Seeger song
(beginitalic)Where Have All the Flowers Gone?(enditalic)) is the
story of two opposing generals, War of 1812 hero Winfield Scott of
the United States and Mexico's Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana.
</P>
<P>
   To get inside their heads, Shaara found Scott's unpublished
memoirs at West Point and consulted Santa Ana's memoirs, which were
recently translated into English.
</P>
<P>
   Shaara said the Mexican-American War (1846-48) often is
overlooked. Though it allowed the United States to acquire most of
what is now Arizona, New Mexico and California, its short duration
and proximity to the Civil War make it a footnote in most history
books.
</P>
<P>
   There are also strong parallels with Vietnam, Shaara notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was seen as a bully's war, (that) basically we were going
down there to grab land,'' Shaara said. ``The themes are similar.
You have this big muscular country going down and beating on these
little guys. You had a lot of that in Vietnam. There was also the
sense that the soldiers were unappreciated back home.''

 &HT;    Hanson leaves boy-band days in the dust
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't call them a boy band.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Hanson has in common with the Backstreet Boys, 'N
Sync and their ilk is frequent appearances in Tiger Beat magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hanson didn't ask to be idolized by teenage girls,
and the trio's major-label debut album, ``Middle of Nowhere,''
sounded nothing like the music of contemporary boy bands, either.
This follow-up finds them moving even further from boy-band
territory.
</P>
<P>
   The young Oklahoma-born siblings took three years to follow up
the success of ``Middle of Nowhere'' and its hit single,
``MMMBop.'' A lot happens in a teenager's life in three years.
Isaac, Taylor and Zac Hanson and their fans have changed since
1997, and you have to wonder whether they've grown together or
apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Time Around'' makes it clear that Hanson has grown in the
direction of 1970s FM-radio rock.
</P>
<P>
   Album opener ``You Never Know'' and first single ``This Time
Around'' wouldn't have sounded out of place between Stories'
``Brother Louie'' and Billy Preston's ``Will It Go 'Round in
Circles'' on the radio in 1973. Make no mistake, though, they would
have been just as massive as those two were. Hooks are timeless,
and Hanson fills these songs with more than you'll find in your
average bait shop.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the catchy tunes, Hanson's most obvious claim to
greatness is in the throat of Taylor Hanson. He has a classic rock
'n' roll voice. He growls, sneers and croons with the confidence of
someone far beyond his 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   A distinctive vocalist, no choreography, instruments played by
the people pictured on the cover, and no one trying to prove their
street cred. Doesn't sound much like a boy band, does it?
</P>
<P>
   ``This Time Around''
</P>
<P>
   Hanson. Island. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+

 &HT;    'Gladiator' vs. 'Braveheart' vs. 'Ben-Hur'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moviegoers haven't savored a sword orgy like Russell Crowe's new
flick since Charlton Heston rocked
</P>
<P>
   the Circus Maximus 41 years ago _ unless you want to count Mel
Gibson's Oscar-winning Highlands hellcat. Here, we compare the
newcomer with two of the better-known of the genre.
</P>
<P>
   'Gladiator'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Circa: 2000 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Muscle: Russell Crowe, as unjustly booted Roman general
Maximus turned gladiator, out for revenge against a sniveling
emperor. Crowe just ... won't ... stop.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Villain: A pouty Joaquin Phoenix as the aptly named Emperor
Commodus. He has icky feelings for his sister.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brutality: The Colosseum, WWF-style. Bloody beheadings, garish
dismemberments, full-body torchings, crashing chariots, repeated
arrow stickings, suffocation, sword throwing, horse stompings,
crucifixions, tiger gutting, gooey wound pus.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best scene: The movie's punishing opening: a long, orderly and
brutal assault by Romans against a horde of dirt-caked Germans. At
times it approaches the devastating beginning of ``Saving Private
Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Domestic box office: $32.7 million _ in one weekend.
</P>
<P>
   'Braveheart'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Circa: 1995 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Muscle: Mel Gibson, as kilted 13th-century Scotsman William
Wallace, out for revenge against the bloody Brits. Gibson sometimes
just ... looks ... crazy.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Villain: An ice-cold Patrick McGoohan as big fat liar King
Edward I. He's conniving, vindictive and unfeeling. And he coughs a
lot, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brutality: Double doses of neck slicing, broadsword
beheadings, multiple losses of legs, lance skewerings, sword
throwing, rain of arrows (one in upper cheek, one in lower cheek),
attempted rape, hot oil dousings, full-body torchings, mallet
mauling, hero slow torture.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best scene: If you're a girl: an older Mel gives his love the
pressed flower she handed him as a child. If you're a guy: an even
older Mel breaks into a room on horseback and, with ball and chain,
gives a Scottish traitor a punitive whack in the head.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Domestic box office: $75.6 million. (Worldwide: $204 million.)
</P>
<P>
   'Ben-Hur'
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Circa: 1959 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Muscle: Charlton Heston, as the determined Egyptian leader
turned Hebrew slave ... oops, sorry ... the determined Jewish
prince Judah Ben-Hur turned ship slave turned gladiator turned
miracle witness out for revenge against a scheming old Roman pal.
Heston's overacting just ... won't ... stop.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Villain: Stephen Boyd, with the pretty-boy strut, as the
merciless Messala. He puts Judah's mom and sis into a deep, dark
prison, and they become lepers.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Brutality: Galley slaves chained to a sinking ship, whippings,
horse tramplings, chariot crashes, sword stabbings, lance
shish-kebabbing, facial fire. And the crucifixion.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Best scene: The chariot race. Nobody's ever done it better.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Domestic box office: $70 million.

 &HT;    Sneak peek at Disney's `Dinosaur'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dinosaurs were supposed to have disappeared millions of years
ago, but the big guys keep coming back. Sparked by ``Jurassic
Park'' in 1993, interest in the leaping lizards is soaring again. A
recent Discovery Channel program, ``Walking With Dinosaurs,''
attracted nearly 11 million viewers _ a record for a cable
documentary. And now Disney is following in the giant footsteps of
T. rex with ``Dinosaur,'' a $200 million, digitally produced
animated movie, which is scheduled to open in theaters May 19.
Newsweek ($3.50) gives readers a sneak peek at the first film from
Disney's new digital animation studio and traces the evolution of
computerized special effects. Thanks to improved computer graphics,
the magazine reports, these prehistoric creatures will be the most
realistic yet.
</P>
<P>
   An accompanying article updates the latest scientific findings,
including information about the recent discovery in South America
of the world's largest meat-eating dinosaurs. A replica of one of
those huge carnivores will be exhibited this summer at the Fernbank
Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ups and downs: In its third annual issue of ``Most Overrated
and Underrated,'' American Heritage ($4.95) decides that Franklin
D. Roosevelt, Barbra Streisand, Amelia Earhart and Sitting Bull
have been overpraised. So have ``Gone With the Wind,''
``Moby-Dick'' and the vodka martini. As for the underrated, the
magazine's experts list aviatrix Harriet Quimby, who flew solo
across the English Channel in 1912, Ronald Reagan, Bing Crosby and
the Sazerac cocktail, a cognac concoction with bitters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bugged: Time ($3.50) devotes its cover story to the fallout
from last week's ``Love Bug'' virus, which wreaked havoc with
e-mail, affected tens of millions of computers and caused as much
as $10 billion in lost work hours. ``Without architectural
improvements, we will see this again,'' says Jeff Carpenter of
CERT, a federally funded group that investigates Internet security
crises.
</P>
<P>
   Who are these guys who spread computer viruses and hack into
highly sensitive systems? Jon Katz, author of the book ``Geeks!,''
says they're ``gifted, alienated kids _ powerless in their real
adolescent lives _ who couldn't resist the temptation to make
themselves, even briefly, more powerful than they ever imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the magazine, a must-read is Garrison Keillor's
essay on ``The Mysteries of Prom Night.'' Parents shouldn't worry
about their kids staying out late and breeding, Keillor writes;
this generation intends to enjoy themselves and not marry until
they're 35. ``They know the grief that children can cause, having
so recently caused it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Mysteries of the Taliban: In a fascinating article in The New
Yorker ($3), William T. Vollman visits Afghanistan to report on the
effect the military triumph of the Taliban has had on the country.
The streets are safer, Vollman writes, but at a high price. Many
are willing to tolerate a certain amount of fundamentalism _
including the beating of women and the banning of certain music _
for stability. Just to talk to an Afghan woman, Vollman had to get
permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick calories: Fast food is convenient, but it's often not
healthy. Men's Fitness ($3.99) offers a handy guide through the
calorie-laden minefield of burgers and shakes. Best bets include
the grilled chicken burrito at Taco Bell (390 calories), the
grilled chicken sandwich at Wendy's (310 calories) and the Veggie
Delite sandwich at Subway (232 calories). Dieters are urged to
avoid McDonald's Big Xtra with cheese (810 calories). You want
fries with that?

 &HT;    Living donors transforming transplant surgery
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The medical status of ``expired'' once was the major
requirement for an organ donation.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   As waiting lists for organs tripled in the past decade, and
transplant science took quantum technological leaps, healthy and
helpful relatives, friends and even strangers began volunteering in
record numbers to give away an organ.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so many individuals are willingly undergoing risky
operations to give up vital parts while alive, they could soon
outnumber the people who donate their organs in death. In 1999,
there were 5,812 cadaveric donors and 4,627 living donors,
according to the United Network of Organ Sharing, which allocates
organs through a national registry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living transplants that happen are usually family-related,
such as sibling to sibling, but there does seem to be somewhat of a
trend toward unrelated donors coming forward,'' said UNOS spokesman
Bob Spieldenner.
</P>
<P>
   Living donor transplants more than doubled in the past decade to
4,627, outpacing cadaveric transplants, which rose only 55 percent
to 17,363, according to UNOS.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, numbers tripled on two lists: those who died
waiting for an organ and those who joined the waiting registry.
Currently, 69,227 people _ including 913 Georgians _ need one or
more organs to stay alive. More than 6,000 will die by year's end
before an organ becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   Neil and Jaclyn Damato, a father and daughter from Suwanee, Ga.,
bear a swath of staples and scars of the latest living donor
transplant wonder _ splitting a healthy donor liver in half and
inserting it into a patient with a faltering liver. The liver is
the only organ in the body with the ability to grow back.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, under the practiced scalpel of pediatric transplant
surgeon Thomas Heffron, the Damatos underwent back-to-back
next-door operations at Emory University Hospital and Children's
Health Care of Atlanta at Egleston.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery began at 8 a.m. to remove 40 percent of Neil's liver and
ended 16 hours later when doctors took out Jaclyn's diseased organ
and sewed in her father's liver. Both their livers are expected to
regenerate to full size within six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Jaclyn is doing well and shows no sign of rejecting the organ,
and her father is anxiously awaiting her arrival home to share
convalescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mall of Georgia is calling wondering where she is,'' he
quipped while visiting her over the weekend at Egleston. ``Sales
are way down.''
</P>
<P>
   Neil, a 44-year-old senior vice president of sales with Keebler
Food Murray Biscuit Co., said he jumped at the chance to be his
daughter's liver donor. He and his wife, Mary Ann, agreed it held
the best hope for the oldest of their three children, who would
have had to get sicker and sicker to move up the priority list for
a cadaver liver. Jaclyn suffered from hepatitis, which led to
jaundice, anemia and extreme fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I saw it was that Mary Ann gave Jackie her first birth
15 years ago, and I wanted to give her a second birth now,'' Neil
said Sunday, sitting in a rocking chair in his daughter's
balloon-brightened hospital room. ``The only thing I got nervous
about was all the medical tests before the surgery. I kept
thinking, `If I flunk this one, it's over. Then what will happen
with Jackie?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jaclyn, a ninth-grader, said she can already see and feel the
difference of her new liver. Her eyes are no longer tinged yellow,
and she has more energy. ``It's really exciting. I knew in my heart
everything would be OK,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Success rates tend to be better using living donors than
cadaveric ones, doctors say, because living donor transplants can
be scheduled before the patient becomes extremely ill, which is the
basic criteria of being moved to the top of any transplant list.
Also, a living donor organ has not gone through the trauma of
death. It has only been out of a body for minutes, instead of the
hours that usually lapse between a fatal accident or shooting and a
hastily scheduled transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Since living donors must be healthy, and they undergo rigorous
testing for tissue compatibility, this also lessens the chances of
rejection by the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics complied by the UNOS show a four-year survival rate
of 85 percent among kidney transplant patients who underwent
cadaveric transplants, and a 94 percent survival rate for
living-related donor transplants. Four-year rates comparing
cadaveric and live liver transplants are unavailable because the
technique is relatively new, but evidence is accumulating that
living donor transplants are more successful.
</P>
<P>
   Living transplants are also cheaper than cadaveric surgery
because the recipient requires less recovery time and the operation
is elective rather than an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Kidneys are considered the least risky organ to give up while
alive as people are born with two kidneys but need only one to
function, and laparoscopic surgery has made the operation safer and
less painful.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, a public education campaign about living donor
options is about to be aimed at African-Americans, who comprise the
majority of the nearly 700 Georgians on the UNOS kidney transplant
waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to get the information. The greatest fear is the
fear of the unknown,'' said Willia Jordan, a volunteer with
LifeLink of Georgia, who also sits on the board of directors for
the National Kidney Foundation of Georgia. Jordan, 49, gave a
kidney to her mother, who was in end-stage renal failure six years
ago. ``My mom is doing just great. She teaches preschool at a
Christian day care center, and she keeps up with the 2-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   But living donor transplants remain controversial within the
medical community because of the risk to the donor. Any major
surgery involves risk of death from possible hemorrhaging,
infection or complications from anesthesia. At least one and
possibly two donors have died during liver transplant surgery in
the past decade, according to the American Liver Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Another downside to living donor transplants is it produces a
much more limited ``harvest'' of parts, as opposed to the many
organs, skin, tissue and corneas that can be retrieved from one
cadaver. As many as 60 people can benefit from one deceased organ
donor.
</P>
<P>
   While doctors and ethicists continue to argue many facets of
living vs. cadaveric transplants, they agree on one point _ more
people need to give their organs away the old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see living donors as solving the problem of people
waiting on the transplant list,'' said Mark Rothstein of the
University of Houston Health, Law and Policy Institute. ``Getting
more people to be organ donors (in death) is the answer.''

TEXAS DEMOCRATS, FACING HARD TIMES, SEE NO REASON TO OPPOSE BUSH
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The once-mighty Texas Democratic Party, whose
fabled leaders Lyndon B. Johnson and Sam Rayburn once dominated not
just the state but the nation, has fallen on very hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Of today's 29 officials elected statewide in Texas, none are
Democrats. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, faces only
token Democratic opposition in her re-election campaign this year,
which is more opposition than the party is providing in most
statewide races. And much to the chagrin of the Democratic state
chairwoman, Molly Beth Malcolm, several Democratic legislators have
been out campaigning with none other than George W. Bush, the
second-term Republican governor and soon-to-be GOP presidential
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed they would do that,'' said Malcolm, who
returned from a vacation in Italy to discover that her party
members were consorting with the enemy. ``They are not representing
the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than the most partisan Republicans, few people in Texas
would argue that Democrats are powerless or obsolete, particularly
since the party still controls the congressional delegation and the
Texas House of Representatives. But as Bush campaigns for the White
House, Democrats are consumed by a parochial, less glamorous
agenda, such as legislative races and preparing for the 2002
gubernatorial race. And few elected Democrats are willing to make
trouble for their popular governor.
</P>
<P>
   The state's most famous Democrat, former Gov. Ann Richards,
spends much of her time lobbying in Washington and has refrained
from attacking the man who beat her in 1994. The state's most
powerful Democrat, House Speaker Pete Laney, so far has stayed out
of the presidential race. Other conservative Democrats in the
Legislature either like Bush personally or are wary of antagonizing
him as their districts become increasingly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no percentage in giving Bush a hard time,'' said
Harvey Kronberg, publisher of The Quorum Report, a widely read
online newsletter covering Texas politics.
</P>
<P>
   That detente is a timely gift for Bush as he fashions himself as
a coalition builder who would foster bipartisanship in Washington.
By contrast, Arkansas Republicans tried to crush Bill Clinton in
1992. They maligned his record and his character and left little
doubt about their strategy. ``Defeating the enemy at all costs,''
recalled Richard Bearden, then the executive director of the
Arkansas Republican Party, ``and Bill Clinton was the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Arkansas, where frustrated Republicans felt little
incentive to play nice with Clinton, Texas has a tradition of
bipartisanship and chauvinism that for some Democrats outweighs any
national party loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most Texans, it's a no-brainer,'' said George Christian, a
Democrat and former press secretary to President Johnson. ``It's an
acceptable, bipartisan Texan running for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University, said
testimonials from unexpected home state allies can provide
credibility for presidential candidates introducing themselves to a
national audience. Coming out of Georgia in 1976, Jimmy Carter
enlisted civil rights leader Andrew Young to help prove he was a
different sort of Southern Democrat than the race baiting governor
of Alabama, George Wallace. In the same vein, Black said, Bush is
enlisting Texas Democrats to help reassure voters that he is
different from the combative congressional Republicans of the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is trying to show that he's not Newt Gingrich, he's not
Tom DeLay, he's not Dick Armey,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of the Texas Democrats has roots in the 1960s, but
the unequivocal slap-in-the-face from Texas voters came in 1998,
when the party lost every statewide race, from governor to
lieutenantgovernor to land commissioner. Bush won re-election with
nearly 70 percent of the vote, the first time in 24 years that a
governor from either party had won a consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   So when Democratic party officials announced last year that they
would not field candidates for six of the eight statewide races
this November, Republicans happily began writing obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Democratic officials were further embarrassed when a
perennial losing candidate best known for his famous name, Gene
Kelly, sought and won the party's nomination to challenge
Hutchison, an overwhelming favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats point out that the party still dominates local
politics in much of the state. The mayors of Dallas, Austin,
Houston and San Antonio are Democrats, and the party still controls
a large majority of county governments, particularly in South
Texas. But Robert Black, spokesman for the Texas Republican Party,
said that while Republicans control local government in only 57 of
the state's 254 counties, those 57 counties accounted for 56
percent of the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have grown so incredibly fast in such a short period of
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy of recent Democratic misfortunes would point to money
and demographics as the chief problems. Texas' huge size requires
statewide candidates to raise millions and millions of dollars in
order to compete in every media market. With corporate interests
favoring Republicans, Kronberg said Democrats often depend on
contributions from trial lawyers. But Republicans, led by Bush,
have demonized the trial bar as greedy lawyers pushing unnecessary
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats going statewide have to prove they're not pawns to
trial lawyers,'' Kronberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan McClung, a Democratic political consultant in Houston, said
heavy numbers of out-of-state, Republican-leaning, white voters
have moved into the suburbs of Dallas, Austin and Houston. McClung
said these new voters were critical in the narrow 1998 defeats of
two well-known Democrats, John Sharp, who ran for lieutenant
governor, and Paul Hobby, who ran for state comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've virtually been shoved aside,'' said McClung, who worked
for Hobby.
</P>
<P>
   The result, many Democrats agree, is that a high-profile effort
to attack and embarrass Bush makes little sense as the party is
struggling to regain primacy. ``Right now, our fight is not
statewide,'' McClung said. ``George W. Bush is popular. He's
extremely well financed. And most Texans would prefer to have a
president from Texas than fight about party politics.''

   A living donor may give a single kidney, a lobe of a lung or
part of a liver or pancreas. A heart can be donated from a living
donor when that donor is receiving a heart-lung transplant;
sometimes surgeons decide it's best to transplant a heart and lungs
together if a patient needs a new set of lungs, and the heart-lung
patient's heart may be healthy enough to pass on to a patient
needing a new heart.

 &HT;    HOW TO BECOME A DONOR
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first step to becoming an organ donor in death is to sign an
organ donor card or change your driver's license to indicate your
wish to donate organs.
</P>
<P>
   The second step is as important: Notify your family of your
wishes. Your next-of-kin must consent to the donation if you die or
are brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a good idea to tell your family physician, your
religious leader and your attorney.
</P>
<P>
   To request a donor card or more information on living or
cadaveric organ donation, contact LifeLink of Georgia, 3715
Northside Parkway, 100 Northcreek Suite 300, Atlanta, GA 30327 or
call 404-266-8884 or 1-800-544-6667 or
www.lifelinkfound.org/georgia/ga.html. The designation can be
changed on your driver's license when you renew it.
</P>
<P>
   People also can donate their whole body to medical research. But
in that case, organs can't be removed for transplantation. Contact
Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, 1-706-721-3731; Emory
University School of Medicine, 404-727-6242 (Morehouse School of
Medicine is affiliated with the Emory donor program.); Mercer
University School of Medicine, 1-912-301-2529 or Life College
School of Chiropractic, 770-426-2718.

 AUSTIN, Texas: party politics.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has always been a divide between conservative, often
rural, Democrats and their more liberal urban brethren. But the
recent coziness between the conservatives and Bush does frustrate
some grass-roots party organizers. Frumencio Reyes, a Gore delegate
to the state party convention, said local voters often ask him what
is happening to the party. ``We find it difficult to answer,''
Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, who switched from Republican to Democrat in 1992, said
the party is in ``a rebuilding period.'' She said the decision not
to contest most statewide races this year was a strategic one.
Instead, Democrats hope to keep control of the House and win back
the state Senate, where Republicans hold a one-vote edge, 16-15.
Whichever party controls the Legislature will also control
congressional and legislative redistricting, and Democrats dearly
want to hold their 17-13 majority in the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the immediate future of Texas politics
depends on Bush's future. If he wins in November, his job will fall
to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican whose replacement would be
chosen by the state Senate. As the presiding officer of the Senate,
the lieutenant governor is considered the state's most powerful
office as far as influencing legislation, and a handful of
candidates in both parties are already jockeying for position.
</P>
<P>
   But neither party dominates the Senate, and no one expects a
party line vote. Instead, the ultimate winner will need to attract
votes from both sides, and the hopefuls are making certain to avoid
any partisan warfare. One of them, state Sen. Ken Armbrister, was
one of the four Democrats who campaigned with Bush in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome in November, Democrats say, they are
pointing to 2002 and beyond. The powerful statewide offices of
governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller are
on the ballot in 2002. Bush will either be in Washington or leaving
office in Austin. Democratic officials already envision a statewide
ticket that would include Sharp, Hobby and perhaps the mayors of
Dallas, Ron Kirk, and Austin, Kirk Watson.
</P>
<P>
   Most tantalizing of all, in the eyes of many Democrats, is the
possible return of former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros of San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has been marred by scandal involving his payments to a
former mistress, party insiders believe Cisneros' star power and
fund-raising potential remains strong in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McClung and other Democrats also believe the state's changing
demographics may turn in their favor in this decade. Hispanics are
expected to soon become the state's most populous ethnic group and
they have usually supported Democrats. Bush has aggressively
courted Hispanics, but Democrats believe their appeal is stronger.
Also, younger, college-age voters are showing renewed interest in
the party. This is the gospel Democrats are repeating to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the old lions is roaring again. Ben Barnes, a
former speaker of the House and lieutenant governor from the
Democratic glory days, gave a recent speech at the LBJ School of
Government at the University of Texas in which he warned that Texas
today ``is drifting toward mediocrity just when it should be
striving for greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off a litany of woes from crumbling infrastructure to
underpaid teachers to substandard health care for the poor. Noting
that the state could soon have a $3 billion surplus, he warned
against more tax cuts, calling for massive reinvestment in schools
and institutions, medical research and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a call to arms, or maybe it was just a speech.

UNMANAGEABLE A TROIS: RUDY AND HILLARY AND DONNA
</HEADLINE>
  
 
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  biographer  &UR; Gail Sheehy  &LR; deconstructs the New
York senatorial sweepstakes in the June issue of Vanity Fair.
Sheehy finds that the two candidates are eerily alike, with Clinton
casting herself as ``the good Mother Goose'' and  &UR; Rudy &LR; 
 &UR; Giuliani &LR;  playing the role of the ``old-fashioned Italian father.''
Neither candidate would be interviewed for the story, but Sheehy
observes:
</P>
<P>
   They both wear ``a mask of arrogance over their insecurities'';
they ``see the world in terms of black and white, good and evil.''
They were raised by strict fathers; they were fiercely determined
students who became aggressive lawyers; they expect blind loyalty;
she is a Republican turned Democrat, he is a Democrat turned
Republican. ``There is probably not more than six degrees of
separation between the politics of the two candidates,'' writes
Sheehy. And they both have had certain marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani admitted last week _ probably because he feared,
erroneously, that he'd be outed in Sheehy's story _ that he has
been involved with ``good friend''  &UR; Judith Nathan &LR; , a New York
woman with a 15-year-old daughter, for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, May 6, Giuliani's sort-of-wife,  &UR; Donna &LR; 
 &UR; Hanover &LR; , gave a news conference at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where
crowds were gathered to pay their last respects to  &UR; Cardinal &LR; 
 &UR; O'Connor &LR; , to say how ``this marriage and this man have been very
precious to me.'' Sheehy sees Hanover's conference as a calculated
move to embarrass her estranged husband in response to his
announcement of his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing now is a war of the Giulianis,'' says
Sheehy. ``She'd just like to hurt him. In Machiavelli, if you
strike at a ruler, you must kill him. She's trying to kill his
chances.''
</P>

   P.S. California Lawyer reports that lawyers have donated more to

 &HT;    Outreach plan seeks to boost black churches
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Atlanta's Cascade United Methodist Church is used to
visitors on Sunday. Visitors who have become members have built the
church's flock to about 5,000 souls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, the church has also hosted visitors
between Sundays: lay leaders, ministers and ministers' spouses from
other black United Methodist Churches, who are hoping to pick up
pointers to use at home.
</P>
<P>
   Cascade is one of 25 black churches chosen by the United
Methodists to be ``congregational resource centers'' for other
churches. And Monday, its pastor, the Rev. Walter Kimbrough, asked
the 1,000 delegates to the denomination's quadrennial General
Conference in Cleveland to continue the program, called
``Strengthening the Black Church for the 21st Century,'' for four
more years.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrough has the distinction of also having pastored another of
the 25 model churches, Atlanta's Ben Hill United Methodist Church,
Georgia's largest United Methodist congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Conference delegates will vote later this week on whether to
fund the $2.3 million proposal to continue the initiative through
the 2004 conference.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kimbrough and the Rev. McCallister Hollins, pastor of the
9,500-member Ben Hill church, said funds spent on helping black
churches succeed will be an investment, bringing more members into
the denomination and more money to do ministry. Cascade and Ben
Hill together pay $600,000 per year to denominational ministries,
besides ministries sponsored by the congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for a handout,'' said Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   Having black churches learn from other black churches is
important, he said, because ``we have to continue to wrestle with
cultural things _ how do we maintain our cultural distinctiveness
and still be United Methodists. We do that very well at Ben Hill,
but it has to be a conscious decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is one of several signs at this conference that
the predominantly white United Methodist Church is becoming
increasingly diverse. Of the 9.6 million members internationally,
382,243 are African-American, 40,652 are Hispanic, 18,766 are
Native American, 56,143 are Asian American and 8,245 are Pacific
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A task force on Korean-American ministries asked for $3.2
million to provide a leadership program for clergy and lay members
in bilingual and cross-cultural ministry, establish new
congregations, strengthen existing congregations, recruit new
clergy and publish resource material. The denomination is also
developing a Korean-English hymnal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A report on Hispanic ministries Monday evening included a
request to continue funding a 1992 plan, extended in 1996, that
provided $1 million in grants to implement ministries to Hispanics
in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic congregations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Native American delegates are asking the conference to address
a variety of concerns, including a request not to hold future
conferences in cities that have professional sports teams with
mascots they consider demeaning. Although prompted by the Cleveland
Indians' Chief Wahoo, the measure, if adopted, could also affect
Atlanta, because of the Braves.

 &HT;    Insurers slow to see benefits of the pill
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it gets down to paying the bill, many insurers still prefer
babies to birth control.
</P>
<P>
   The birth control pill turns 40 today, but insurance companies
nationwide still balk at covering its cost. That's despite the fact
that they're willing to shell out the money for unplanned
pregnancies, sterilizations and, of course, that other little pill
_ a blue newcomer called Viagra, used to treat impotence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pill is clearly the most preferred form of contraception
among young women,'' said Dr. Michael Randell, who practices at
Northside Hospital. ``But I see only about half of the insurance
policies covering it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally the numbers are even lower, with only 34 percent of
women in a recent survey reporting that their insurance covered the
cost of contraceptives. Of those, only half said the pill was
covered, according to a survey released last week by the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
</P>
<P>
   That's despite the fact that 80 percent of all American women
born since 1945 have used the pill at some time, according to the
Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Even when insurance covers the cost, companies attach a laundry
list of conditions. Although 93 percent of health maintenance
organizations provide some coverage, most require patients to pay
the lion's share of the cost or pick their prescriptions from an
approved drug list.
</P>
<P>
   It's frustrating for women such as Pam Rosenthal, 33, an
Alpharetta mother of two who decided to go back on the pill. Her
prescription was rejected for reimbursement by Cigna HealthCare of
Georgia Inc., so she and the pharmacist called to find out what
pills were covered. Another prescription was written, and it was
rejected too.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rosenthal went to Cigna's Web site to get a list of
approved pills. Then she had to sit down with her doctor and pick
from the handful of choices, so she would pay $10 instead of $25.
</P>
<P>
   Many Georgia women, however, are more fortunate than most. A
state law that took effect last July requires insurance plans to
cover the cost of contraceptives if they cover other prescriptions.
That means that, if they will pay for antibiotics or Viagra, they
must also pay for the pill. But, like other insurance legislation,
the law doesn't apply to self-insured companies _ mostly large
corporations _ which are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, the second state in the nation to enact such
legislation, is now one of 11 to mandate that insurers provide some
sort of contraceptive coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a victory,'' said Julie Edelson, director of public
policy for Planned Parenthood of Georgia. ``It was a solid
recognition by the state that a critical part of health benefits is
to allow women to have better access to birth control.''
</P>
<P>
   Several national studies indicate that almost half of
pregnancies are unintended, with half of those resulting in
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Some insurers got the message long before they were forced to
comply with the state mandate. Blue Cross &AMP; Blue Shield of Georgia,
for example, has provided reimbursement for the pill for more than
two decades, according to spokesman Charles Harman.
</P>
<P>
   And the data are convincing enough that even Medicaid, the
government health plan, is reconsidering its contraceptive
policies. Medicaid in Georgia now covers new mothers' contraceptive
needs for 60 days after the birth of a child. But the state has
submitted a waiver to the federal government to lengthen that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the state would prefer to offer contraceptives,
including the pill, for two years, with the goal, of course, of
preventing more unplanned pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family planning coverage, from every perspective, is a good
idea,'' said Joyce Goldberg of the Georgia Department of Community
Health. ``It lowers the risk of a complicated (second) pregnancy
and improves the health of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in a weird way, women should also thank the makers of
Viagra. At $10 a pop, Viagra forced insurers to re-evaluate what is
fair in reproductive health. Insurers have traditionally viewed
birth control or fertility drugs as a luxury, not a necessity. But
once they covered Viagra, it became more difficult to turn their
back on women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We allow our insurance companies to be biased against women,''
Dr. Mitchell Creinin, director of family planning at the University
of Pittsburgh, said in a recent interview. ``If men were the ones
who got pregnant, you know it would be different.''

UNMANAGEABLE A TROIS: RUDY AND HILLARY AND DONNA
</HEADLINE>
  
 
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  biographer  &UR; Gail Sheehy  &LR; deconstructs the New
York senatorial sweepstakes in the June issue of Vanity Fair.
Sheehy finds that the two candidates are eerily alike, with Clinton
casting herself as ``the good Mother Goose'' and  &UR; Rudy &LR; 
 &UR; Giuliani &LR;  playing the role of the ``old-fashioned Italian father.''
Neither candidate would be interviewed for the story, but Sheehy
observes:
</P>
<P>
   They both wear ``a mask of arrogance over their insecurities'';
they ``see the world in terms of black and white, good and evil.''
They were raised by strict fathers; they were fiercely determined
students who became aggressive lawyers; they expect blind loyalty;
she is a Republican turned Democrat, he is a Democrat turned
Republican. ``There is probably not more than six degrees of
separation between the politics of the two candidates,'' writes
Sheehy. And they both have had certain marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani admitted last week _ probably because he feared,
erroneously, that he'd be outed in Sheehy's story _ that he has
been involved with ``good friend''  &UR; Judith Nathan &LR; , a New York
woman with a 15-year-old daughter, for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   And on Saturday, May 6, Giuliani's sort-of-wife,  &UR; Donna &LR; 
 &UR; Hanover &LR; , gave a news conference at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where
crowds were gathered to pay their last respects to  &UR; Cardinal &LR; 
 &UR; O'Connor &LR; , to say how ``this marriage and this man have been very
precious to me.'' Sheehy sees Hanover's conference as a calculated
move to embarrass her estranged husband in response to his
announcement of his friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing now is a war of the Giulianis,'' says
Sheehy. ``She'd just like to hurt him. In Machiavelli, if you
strike at a ruler, you must kill him. She's trying to kill his
chances.''

 &HT;    Outreach plan seeks to boost black churches
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Atlanta's Cascade United Methodist Church is used to
visitors on Sunday. Visitors who have become members have built the
church's flock to about 5,000 souls.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four years, the church has also hosted visitors
between Sundays: lay leaders, ministers and ministers' spouses from
other black United Methodist Churches, who are hoping to pick up
pointers to use at home.
</P>
<P>
   Cascade is one of 25 black churches chosen by the United
Methodists to be ``congregational resource centers'' for other
churches. And Monday, its pastor, the Rev. Walter Kimbrough, asked
the 1,000 delegates to the denomination's quadrennial General
Conference in Cleveland to continue the program, called
``Strengthening the Black Church for the 21st Century,'' for four
more years.
</P>
<P>
   Kimbrough has the distinction of also having pastored another of
the 25 model churches, Atlanta's Ben Hill United Methodist Church,
Georgia's largest United Methodist congregation.
</P>
<P>
   Conference delegates will vote later this week on whether to
fund the $2.3 million proposal to continue the initiative through
the 2004 conference.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kimbrough and the Rev. McCallister Hollins, pastor of the
9,500-member Ben Hill church, said funds spent on helping black
churches succeed will be an investment, bringing more members into
the denomination and more money to do ministry. Cascade and Ben
Hill together pay $600,000 per year to denominational ministries,
besides ministries sponsored by the congregations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not asking for a handout,'' said Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   Having black churches learn from other black churches is
important, he said, because ``we have to continue to wrestle with
cultural things _ how do we maintain our cultural distinctiveness
and still be United Methodists. We do that very well at Ben Hill,
but it has to be a conscious decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is one of several signs at this conference that
the predominantly white United Methodist Church is becoming
increasingly diverse. Of the 9.6 million members internationally,
382,243 are African-American, 40,652 are Hispanic, 18,766 are
Native American, 56,143 are Asian American and 8,245 are Pacific
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A task force on Korean-American ministries asked for $3.2
million to provide a leadership program for clergy and lay members
in bilingual and cross-cultural ministry, establish new
congregations, strengthen existing congregations, recruit new
clergy and publish resource material. The denomination is also
developing a Korean-English hymnal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A report on Hispanic ministries Monday evening included a
request to continue funding a 1992 plan, extended in 1996, that
provided $1 million in grants to implement ministries to Hispanics
in both Hispanic and non-Hispanic congregations.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Native American delegates are asking the conference to address
a variety of concerns, including a request not to hold future
conferences in cities that have professional sports teams with
mascots they consider demeaning. Although prompted by the Cleveland
Indians' Chief Wahoo, the measure, if adopted, could also affect
Atlanta, because of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   While increasing their efforts directed to members of various
ethnic backgrounds, United Methodists still appear deeply
conflicted about how far to go in including gay and lesbian
members.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the conference committee dealing with the main church

and union ceremonies for same-sex couples.

``incompatible with Christian teaching.''

require pastors to sign a statement promising not to practice or

AUTOMAKERS STRIVE TO SPEED UP ONLINE BUYING 
</HEADLINE>
 (ART ADV: Graphics are being sent to NYT graphics clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Order a personal computer online or over the phone,
choosing every specification, and it will be assembled and shipped
to your door in five or six days. But try to order a car from the
factory that way, and watch out.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers who place such orders face stupefyingly complex forms
asking them about sometimes obscure features like axle ratios for
towing. The few brave enough to fill out the paperwork _ most
automakers have yet to computerize the process _ then face a wait
long enough to try anyone's patience: three weeks to three months
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers have long been aware of the problem. But now they are
striving to speed things up, partly because the Internet makes it
possible and partly because their control over the sales process is
threatened by online buying services, which allow customers in
search of just the right car to check dozens or even hundreds of
dealers quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that an increasing percentage of consumers will want
to order online directly from the factory, get exactly what they
want and get it on the desired date,'' said Ronald Zarrella,
General Motors' president of North American operations. ``If we
can't do that at the factory, we can't add value compared to the
pure dot-coms.''
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford will announce particularly ambitious ventures to
accelerate production and delivery in the coming weeks, executives
familiar with their plans said. Both companies will start with one
or two models, then convert the rest of their models and factories
to faster, more flexible production and distribution. GM plans to
revamp all its factories in the United States by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   They and other automakers want to be able, within a few years,
to supply exactly the car the customer wants in as little as two
weeks. They say the changes could slow increases in car prices, by
allowing dealers to slash costs by keeping fewer cars on hand.
``Dealers should be able to reduce their inventory costs,'' said
James G. O'Connor, Ford Motor's vice president for Ford brand cars
and trucks. ``Hopefully, we should be able to pass that on to
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   But building cars to order is easier said than done. Automakers
hope they can fill most orders not by assembling specific vehicles
for specific customers, but by finding vehicles that they have
already built but that now sit on a train or at another dealer.
</P>
<P>
   To improve the odds of finding the right vehicle, manufacturers
plan at first to limit customer choice, not expand it. They intend
to offer models with just three to five packages of options and in
several colors. Dealers will offer accessories like bike racks and
fancy hubcaps.
</P>
<P>
   The planned new production and distribution systems will do
little to alleviate overall shortages of instant hits like the
Chrysler PT Cruiser that are hard to find in any color; assembly
plants can produce only so many vehicles each week. Even with the
new system, it will remain difficult to order obscure options on
popular models.
</P>
<P>
   James Clark, a 57-year-old management systems consultant in
Washougal, Wash., said that he tried from November through March to
order a GMC Sierra 2500 with an extended cab and a short pickup
bed, an unusual combination, but that neither he nor his dealer had
received even an estimate from GM of when the vehicle might be
built. ``I was never able to get a straight answer,'' Clark
complained, adding that he ended up buying a 1-year-old Chevrolet
Silverado pickup instead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to GM and Ford, the Japanese and Europeans are also
experimenting, although France's Renault, which owns Japan's Nissan
Motor, is the only non-American automaker committed so far to
changing production at all its factories by next year. ``It is a
high investment,'' said Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's president. ``There
is a high return, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is allowing dealers to alter orders for Solara coupes
just five days before they are produced at its factory in
Cambridge, Ontario, instead of a month. But it may still take a
week or two to deliver the finished car.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Internet to help coordinate thousands of parts
suppliers, automakers hope to make assembly lines more flexible.
When a dealer notices that a certain color or option is in short
supply, the manufacturers want to be able to restock the showroom
within weeks, not months, so that more customers can avoid having
to place special orders.
</P>
<P>
   Speeding up car production is far more difficult than building
computers quickly. Cars require many more components: While Dell
relies on 25 main suppliers to assemble desktop computers,
DaimlerChrysler has 900 _ even after weeding out the smaller ones
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Auto parts tend to be large and expensive, so it is costly to
store inventories near assembly plants just in case they are
needed. Suppliers are often hundreds of miles away, so a factory in
Asheville, N.C., for example, ships anti-lock-brake systems all
over the Midwest, making it hard to place last-minute orders.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, distribution has actually been slowing lately.
Railroads are short of rail cars that can carry sport utility
vehicles, pickups and minivans, which can only be stacked two high,
while cars can be three high. With automobiles of virtually all
sizes selling well, the transportation problem has become so acute
that thousands of larger vehicles have stacked up in parking lots
outside factories. Sending them by truck instead is prohibitively
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   While overnight parcel services can track a packaged shipment
anywhere in the country, automakers often have little idea where
their cars are, making it hard to reroute them. ``They know the
vehicle has left the plant and they know what dealership it's going
to, but they don't know where it is during the 30 days or so in
between,'' said Daron Gifford, global automotive director at
Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the accounting and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   All automakers have been studying the problem for years. Now
they are doing something.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ford is paying particular attention to vehicle distribution and
has joined forces with the United Parcel Service to begin tracking
every car from factory to dealer to customer. It also has a
contract with the WhereNet Corp. to buy miniature radio
transmitters. These will be temporarily attached to each vehicle as
it comes off the assembly line and will continuously broadcast an
identity code, helping workers find specific cars in vast shipping
lots. ``That's where they tend to lose track of them,'' said Dan
Doles, WhereNet's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   One way GM hopes to speed production is by using the Internet to
communicate with suppliers. GM recently joined Ford and
DaimlerChrysler in setting up a business exchange for the buying
and selling of auto parts and other products. It plans to post
constant updates of its production schedules on a secure part of
the site available not only to its primary suppliers but to its
suppliers' suppliers, and on down the line, said Harold R. Kutner,
group vice president for global purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Computers at GM's factories are already linked with, for
example, dashboard makers. But if there is a sudden increase in
demand for CD players, the new system will allow GM to notify the
dashboard manufacturer and the vendor for CD players
simultaneously. ``Suppliers are going to start to get a sense of
what's happening in the marketplace,'' Kutner said.
</P>
<P>
   Like GM, Ford is planning to offer a few packages of options,
instead of allowing customers to check off dozens or even hundreds
of items. This should allow Ford to vary the proportion of these
packages at the factory, and fill many orders with cars that have
just been built, said James J. Padilla, Ford's group vice president
for global manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to have 200,000 combinations out there when the
consumer can only grapple with maybe 50,'' he said. ``We have been
prone to design and release every possible combination, into the
hundreds of thousands of combinations, which is a lot of
engineering, a lot of tooling and a lot of inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese automakers already require customers to choose among
packages of options. Toyota, Honda and Nissan managers say that
while they are also looking to shorten production and delivery
times, they believe that automakers know better than consumers what
combination of options make sense for daily use and retain their
value.
</P>
<P>
   If consumers are given too many choices, ``they'll buy a car
without an air conditioner, and they'll be sorry,'' both on warm
days and when they try to resell it, said James Press, Toyota's
executive vice president for North American sales.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler has been more cautious than GM or Ford about
accelerating production and delivery. If dealers can be assisted in
spotting local shifts in demand more quickly, it contends, they can
order the right cars in advance and have them ready when the
customer comes in the door. ``That's the way you get fast order to
delivery, and not by committing unnatural acts to get it out of the
factory quicker,'' said Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice
president for North American marketing operations.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, DaimlerChrysler and other automakers are trying to
improve relations with dealers. Dealers do not report a lot of
basic information back to manufacturers, like the color of vehicles
sold or the prices paid. If, for example, a model in one color is
so unpopular that dealers must offer deep discounts, it can take
months for the factory to find out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dealers have never wanted to share pricing information
with the manufacturer, and rightly so, because the manufacturers
use it against them'' in negotiations over the sharing of various
costs, said J. David Power III, founder of the consulting and
consumer rating company that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers, of course, try to order cars in colors that have proved
popular, and they try to order models they can sell with a minimum
of discounting. But since dealers can go months between ordering
cars, information filters back slowly to the factories.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan and Europe, where there is less land for huge
dealerships, customers have long ordered cars directly from the
factory. Japanese automakers are already able to deliver cars
within two weeks in their home market _ but customers, parts
suppliers and manufacturers all tend to be very close together.
</P>
<P>
   The European industry is more fragmented, although not quite as
much as the American industry. Renault of France manufactures half
its cars to order and delivers them in six to eight weeks, but
plans to start making three-quarters of its cars to order and
deliver them in just 15 days, at least in European cities close to
assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, said Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chief
executive, ``Inventories should be kept only for demonstration
purposes: to show the car in showrooms and to drive it.''

 PAC BELL HIT BY E-MAIL GLITCHES  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Pacific Bell's Internet service, which has been
plagued by glitches in its e-mail system, had problems again this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Web page warned users that e-mail was ``down'' or
``impaired'' all day Saturday, preventing some users from receiving
their messages. Pac Bell reported it fixed the problem by yesterday
morning, but it's at least the third time the company has had
problems with its e-mail system in as many months. The company has
more than 331,000 users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' fumed one San Francisco businessman, who
had already scheduled two technicians to test his company's e-mail
system over the weekend. He complained in an e-mail to the
Chronicle that they couldn't complete the job because the Pac Bell
mail system was down. ``I'm out hundreds of dollars in wages, and
thousands more in lost opportunity costs.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pac Bell reported that users could have trouble
posting messages to some portions of an Internet message board
system known as Usenet. Pac Bell's Web site labeled the system as
``impaired'' both Saturday and yesterday.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
Steve Francis made up some ground on the one player chosen ahead of
him in last summer's NBA draft, but he could not quite pass Elton
Brand in their race to be called the league's top rookie.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francis, the Rockets' high-speed, high-flying point guard, and
Brand, the Chicago Bulls' powerful and consistent inside force,
finished in a dead heat in the voting for the NBA Rookie of the
Year award to be announced Thursday, sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Francis and Brand will become the third pair of rookies to share
the award. Jason Kidd and Grant Hill were co-Rookies of the Year in
1994-95, and Dave Cowens and Geoff Petrie finished in a tie for the
1970-71 award.
</P>
<P>
   During workouts together before the draft, Francis and Brand
each often told the other he would be the first player chosen in
the lottery. Brand was right, and Francis was picked second by the
Vancouver Grizzlies before being dealt to the Rockets in an
11-player, three-team deal that was the largest in league history.
</P>
<P>
   Each produced one of the greatest seasons ever for NBA rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Francis became just the seventh rookie ever to average at least
15 points, five assists and five rebounds, joining Oscar Robertson,
Alvan Adams, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Penny Hardaway and
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Francis was fifth in scoring among point guards, led all guards
in offensive rebounds and was third among guards in rebounding
overall.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first rookie and fourth player ever to lead the
Rockets in scoring (18 points per game), assists (6.6) and steals
(1.53). He also led the Rockets in minutes played, field goals made
and attempted, 3-pointers made and attempted, free throws made and
attempted, and offensive rebounds. He was the first Rockets player
ever to compile 400 rebounds and 500 assists in the same season.
</P>
<P>
   However, Francis' best and most telling statistical achievement
could perhaps be found in his performances against this season's
All-Defensive Team point guards. Francis averaged 26.8 points (on
56.5 percent shooting), 6.5 rebounds, 7.5 assists and 1.83 steals
against first-team defender Gary Payton of Seattle and
second-teamer Kidd of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   And Francis was the only player to be ranked among the leaders
in all nine rookie statistical categories kept by the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich often said during the season he
thought Francis could become one of the best point guards ever, a
point he made to Francis after training camp. Tomjanovich was
unavailable for comment Monday, but he has repeatedly explained why
he believes Francis has such rare potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you look at the overall impact he has on the
game, you'd see,'' Tomjanovich said. ``After a slow start reading
defenses, which is very normal, even for a guy coming into the NBA
who has played point guard, he's really been a guy who has climbed
up the ladder in the assist category. And he rebounds, he steals
the ball, and I think he's a solid defensive player for a young kid
and still has a way to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just so much that he does to impact a game. You look
at some games, and he's right up there as our leading rebounder.
And that's from the point-guard position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just beginning the process (of becoming a point guard),''
Tomjanovich said. ``I think he's just starting to get comfortable
being that guy who has the ball most of the time and just learning
some things about the fast break, the pick-and-roll, double teams
and things like that, and he's made great strides in all those
areas already. And I think that it's just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand became the 19th rookie to average at least 20 points and
10 rebounds and just the second Bulls player ever to reach those
averages in the same season (Artis Gilmore did it twice).
</P>
<P>
   Brand led NBA rookies in minutes, scoring, rebounding and
blocked shots, and he led the NBA in offensive rebounds with 4.3
per game.
</P>
<P>
   Brand's average of 20.1 points per game was second in Bulls
history for a rookie, trailing only Jordan's average of 28.2 points
in 1984-85. Brand set a Bulls record when he made 14 consecutive
field goals April 13 against the Wizards, and he led the Bulls in
scoring 51 times, including 18 of the season's final 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   So even were Brand and Francis since the days they were drafted,
both were named Rookie of the Month twice. They tied for the award
in April, the season's last month.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, unavailable for comment Monday, said during the season
he had long since gotten over the disappointment of draft night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I was upset,'' he said. ``But Elton Brand was a
good pick. I respect him. They made a good pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be No. 1,'' Francis admitted, ``to brag to
everyone I was the No. 1 pick. But it's definitely the best thing
that ever happened to me how it worked out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   DoubleTwist Inc., a small biotechnology company in California,
said Monday that it had identified as many as 105,000 human genes
by performing the first comprehensive computer analysis of the
publicly available data from the Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   By relying on the public data, DoubleTwist, which will sell
subscriptions to its database, appears to have done an end run
around competitors, including Celera Corp. and Incyte
Pharmaceuticals, which have spent heavily to do their own
sequencing in an effort to sell gene data to drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   Celera in particular has spent several hundred million dollars
to develop its own complete human genome sequence. That investment
in sequencing could be called into question, however, if companies
like DoubleTwist can generate their own databases using the public
data, without doing their own sequencing.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Celera, Incyte and other competitors played down
DoubleTwist's announcement, saying that the company had not
published any data allowing the quality of its work to be judged.
J. Craig Venter, president of Celera, said his company's data would
be superior to anything derived from the Human Genome Project
because it is incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way it could be comprehensive,'' he said of
DoubleTwist's database. ``I don't think I'm going to lose my dinner
over this.''
</P>
<P>
   But DoubleTwist's announcement was hailed by some scientists
associated with the publicly financed genome project as a
demonstration of the value of their raw sequence, which is now
about 85 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly why the public genome project has been
producing the sequence,'' said Eric Lander, director of the
Whitehead Center for Genome Research in Cambridge, Mass. He said
companies were being encouraged to build upon the raw sequence.
</P>
<P>
   The genome consists of 3 billion base pairs. Much of the
sequence has no known function but a small percent represent genes,
which encode the instructions for making the proteins that carry
out bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   The raw sequence, a mind-numbing string of the letters A, T, C
and G, does not provide much valuable information. It must first be
annotated, meaning that the genes and their locations, and if
possible their functions, are identified. It is this annotation
that DoubleTwist said it had performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real key is knowing where the human genes lie on this
immense string of base pairs,'' said John Couch, the president of
DoubleTwist, a privately held company based in Oakland, Calif. That
annotated information in turn could be useful to scientists in
diagnosing diseases and developing treatments.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist used powerful supercomputers provided by Sun
Microsystems to search the raw genome sequence looking for telltale
patterns representing the genes and comparing unknown sequences
with those of known genes. Nick Tsinoremas, director of research at
DoubleTwist, said the company was confident in its identification
of 65,000 genes but less certain about the 40,000 others. The
company's findings, he said, are consistent with the general wisdom
that the human genome contains about 100,000 genes. Estimates have
ranged from about 40,000 to 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Roy A. Whitfield, chief executive of Incyte, said his company,
while not sequencing the entire genome, had sequenced individual
genes, so that it could offer its customers accurate sequences as
well as physical copies of the genes. ``That's real content that
you can't get anywhere else,'' he said. ``What theirs is all about
is content that anyone else has.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Harmon, president and chief executive of Neomorphic Inc.,
a Berkeley, Calif., company that helped annotate the recently
published fruit fly genome, criticized DoubleTwist for ``science by
press release'' because it did not publish anything about its
methods. He said that computer algorithms alone were not always
accurate in identifying genes and needed to combined with
laboratory analysis.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist, which was once known as Pangea Systems, is a
bio-informatics company, meaning it provides computer tools for
researchers to use in searching genetic databases.

 TWO NEW INTEL NETWORKING DEVICES FOR B2B MARKET  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intel Corp., which last year redefined its
mission as ``creating the building blocks of the Internet
economy,'' on Monday will roll out two new ones, a pair of devices
designed to speed up secure e-commerce transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The products, both part of the company's growing
``NetStructure'' line of ``intelligent networking'' devices, are
designed specifically to accelerate processing of XML, or
eXtensible Markup Language, the emerging standard for
business-to-business commerce over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Both products, the 7210 XML Accelerator and the 7280 XML
Director, will work by decoding and examining incoming XML-format
traffic before it goes to an online business' back-end servers.
They will classify each transaction by the ``dialect'' of XML it is
written in, then dispatch it to the corresponding server.
</P>
<P>
   XML creates a standard framework for e-business, but it is also
designed to be customized for the needs of specific companies and
industries. Already, several companies, including Microsoft, Ariba
and CommerceOne, have created their own dialects.
</P>
<P>
   The XML Director will feature several additional capabilities
not supported in the Accelerator. The former, for example, will be
able to prioritize orders based on information coded within the
transaction _ for example, the customer it comes from, the size of
the order or how quickly it has to be filled. E-business
administrators will be able to change priorities on the fly,
without interrupting service, according to Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The higher-end model will also check the syntax of XML traffic
and reject malformed messages so they won't tie up busy servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These products are part of a significant trend toward more
intelligent networking,'' said Meta Group analyst Peter Firstbrook.
``They move decisions that used to be done in software on the
server out to the network, before the request even reaches the
server.''
</P>
<P>
   No one else has yet announced products directly comparable to
Intel's XML devices, Firstbrook said. He added, though, that
technology Cisco Systems picked up last week with its $6 billion
acquisition of ArrowPoint Communications could enable Cisco to
enter the same category eventually.
</P>
<P>
   The new Intel offerings are scheduled to ship in July. Prices
have not been determined. Two current members of the NetStructure
family, the Commerce Accelerator and Commerce Director, are priced
at $12,995 and $39,995, respectively, and because the new XML
devices are more sophisticated, they're likely to carry somewhat
higher prices, according to Brett Helm, general manager of Intel's
network equipment division.
</P>
<P>
   Helm was CEO of iPivot, a Poway (San Diego County) company Intel
purchased in October for $500 million in cash. The new products are
based primarily on technology developed by iPivot.
</P>
<P>
   The XML devices combine Intel Pentium III microprocessors with
specialized chips and software. They'll run a customized version of
the Unix operating system, Helm said.

NTT COMMUNICATIONS TO BUY VERIO FOR MAJOR MOVE INTO U.S. MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a major expansion into the United States Internet
market, NTT Communications of Japan said Monday it had agreed to
acquire Verio Inc., a Web site manager based in Englewood, Colo.,
for $5.5 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The move is part of an aggressive new strategy by NTT
Communications, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, to
expand globally, particularly across Asia, America and Europe. NTT
Communications holds a 10 percent stake in Verio.
</P>
<P>
   The deal to buy the rest, worth $60 a share, represents a 67
percent premium over Verio's share price at the close of stock
trading Friday. In extremely heavy trading on the Nasdaq market
Monday, when most technology shares in the United States fell
sharply, Verio surged $22.51, or 63 percent, to $68.50. Earlier in
Tokyo, Nippon Telegraph rose 2.8 percent, to 1.46 million yen, or
about $13,518.
</P>
<P>
   NTT Communications' deal for Verio would be one of the largest
cash purchases of an Internet services company. Such acquisitions
in the Internet industry are usually settled with stock. It is also
one of the biggest Japanese purchases of an American company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts applauded the deal, saying that by acquiring Verio, NTT
Communications, a domestic and international telephone carrier,
would gain an important beachhead in the highly competitive,
fast-expanding Internet market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very positive move because Verio will gain a well
established local presence in the United States that will allow NTT
to offer higher value-added services and expand its customer
base,'' said Hironobu Sawake, a senior analyst for ING Barings
Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that NTT Communications' willingness to pay such a
high premium for Verio was an indication that the company was
serious about becoming a major player in the world
telecommunications market, though it came late to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Verio, founded in 1996, is one of the largest operators of Web
sites for businesses with an emphasis on serving small and midsize
customers. The company offers 400,000 sites in 127 countries,
including 14,000 sites for electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Satoshi Fujita, a senior vice president of NTT Communications,
said the combined Internet-telephone company would give ``U.S
dot-com companies a bridge to the Asia Pacific region and Asia
dot-com companies a reliable vertical access to the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   NTT Communications has been expanding its global network
primarily in Asia since it was created last year with the breakup
of Nippon Telegraph, which for decades was the only telephone
company in Japan and remains one of the world's largest
telecommunications businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The spin-off company has invested about $1 billion in the Asia
Pacific region on a variety of interests, including stakes in
StarHub, one of Singapore's largest Internet carriers; Philippines
Long Distance Telephone; Davnet Telecommunications, an Australian
Internet service provider; and HK Net, a Hong Kong Internet
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Fujita, asked about NTT Communications' plans for further
acquisitions, said: ``It would be correct to say that we are not
finished. Certainly we need to have more capability in the global
arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive said that although NTT might have been slow in its
international expansion, the communications industry is changing so
rapidly that ``the incumbent may not necessarily be the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement to acquire Verio, a United States subsidiary
of NTT Communications will make a tender offer no later than May 17
to merge Verio with the Japanese carrier. The company said it hopes
to complete the transaction by the third quarter of this year and
that it plans no layoffs at Verio, which has 2,000 employees.

 WEBBY AWARDS' EFFECT ON BOTTOM LINE DIFFICULT TO MEASURE  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For some Internet company executives, winning a
Webby is like winning an Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   It means giving an acceptance speech before a large crowd and
wallowing in compliments from their peers at the party afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But the parallel between being voted pre-eminent on the Internet
and best in film stops there, especially where it counts the most
in business: money. Unlike movies, Internet sites that win industry
acknowledgment usually get only a modest reward, such as a
temporary increase in visitors and a few more advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Webbys are still a coveted prize, to be
awarded Thursday at the Masonic Auditorium on Nob Hill in San
Francisco. While happy to be recognized for their work in
categories such as commerce, games and art, some Internet
executives say that the tangible benefits of winning a Webby are
difficult to measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly an honor and one that we value, especially for
the people who designed the site,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman
for online retailer Amazon.com, which won two Webbys last year.
``But whether sales go up, down, left or right because of it is
hard to say.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Media Metrix, Web sites that win a Webby are not
assured of a permanent surge in traffic. Visits to nearly half of
last year's winning sites declined the month after they were chosen
best in their category.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does a Webby victory translate into a quick boost in stock
prices. For example, the stock of Amazon.com, declined to $67.53
from $69.21 the day after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Wrixon, president and chief executive of SeniorNet, a San
Francisco senior citizen site that won in the community category
last year, said that winning a Webby did not suddenly make her site
more popular. But it did cause other Internet executives to call
seeking advice about their own Web sites and prompt some companies
to advertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Webby gave us the credibility that we were able to develop
a really high-quality community, despite the fact that we had huge
competitors,'' Wrixon said. ``Before, potential partners would look
at us and say SeniorNet is nonprofit, it's probably not worth
looking at. But they don't say that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrixon did not initially know what to think of the Webby and
listed the prize on SeniorNet's awards page along with all the
other accolades the company had won. But after all the
congratulations, Wrixon reconsidered. She placed the Webby award
emblem on her site's home page next to one showing that her site
was selected as one of Yahoo's ``100 Best Sites for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Webbys, organized by the International Academy of Digital
Media Arts and Sciences in San Francisco, is hardly alone in
honoring Internet sites for excellence. One Web site,
awardsites.com, lists 2,011 different Internet award programs,
though the site's founder, David Bancroft, says even that total is
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   How much attention Internet users pay to awards like the Webbys
is unclear. Asien Shieu, a student at the University of California
at Berkeley and frequent Web surfer, said that the sheer number of
awards and the dubious provenance of some make her skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the awards look really fake,'' she said. ``I don't
usually pay attention when I see them on a site, or I wonder
whether they just made the award themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the Webbys interested mainly Internet insiders,
according to Jim Rose, co-founder of Mobshop, a San Francisco
retail site that has been nominated in this year's commerce
category. But he believes that is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Webbys are growing a bit mainstream,'' Rose said.
``A few years ago, it was a very Net-savvy audience. Now it's a
little broader.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Shlain, the Webbys' executive producer, said that her
awards program provides the public and Internet industry ``an
objective voice in distinguishing the best'' on the Web. She said
that the Webbys have a huge following, measured by the 134,000
people who cast votes this year for their favorite sites.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to generate public interest and add a veneer of
prestige, the Webbys are increasingly imitating Hollywood award
ceremonies. Celebrities scheduled to be onstage include Alan
Cummings, a Tony award-winning actor who has appeared in such films
as ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' and actress and comedian Sandra Bernhard.
</P>
<P>
   Judges include actor Robin Williams, who voted in the games
category. Rock musician David Bowie helped select the best music
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Of all Web sites that win a Webby, it is probably the smaller
ones that get the biggest boost. For example, Richard Johnson,
founder of SportsPages.com, which won in the sports category last
year, said that traffic on his site increased from about 17,000
hits a day before being nominated to about 20,000 a day, but then
declined soon after the ceremony was over.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in interest translated into a few hundred extra
dollars in subscription fees, said Johnson, who is from New York
City. But perhaps more importantly, the victory allowed him to
promote his site through the media, including television news,
which had never taken any interest in his site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I had ever won an award before in my life, so it
was nice to bask in the glory,'' said Johnson, who had never heard
of the Webbys before being nominated and was at first suspicious
that he would have to pay the award's organizers to win.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he won against other more well-funded nominees,
like Quokka Sports, gave him the confidence to go out and seek
outside investors. That effort, however, has been only moderately
successful, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Webby hasn't made a big direct difference to the
business,'' said Johnson, who now always mentions the Webby victory
when making a presentation to potential investors. ``But I don't
blame the Webbys, I blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Benjamin, who won last year in the ``Weird'' category for
his site, superbad.com, got even less out of his victory. A few
thousand more people visited his site after it was nominated for
the award.
</P>
<P>
   But because Benjamin sells nothing on superbad.com, a site
featuring animated graphics, the surge in traffic did not translate
into more money. His one-man graphic design business did get more
clients, but it had nothing to do with the award, he said.
</P>
<P>
   What it did bring him was unwanted e-mail. He said that the
International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences put his name on
a junk mail list, and he now frequently receives unwanted letters
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Benjamin said that it was an honor to win a Webby
and especially satisfying to meet some of the other winners. He
said it was more exciting, however, to have his Web site included
in this year's Whitney Biennial, one of the most prestigious
contemporary art exhibitions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the Webbys say they are so important, people take
it at face value,'' Benjamin said. ``Winning means that five people
liked my site better than others. It's so arbitrary.''

 BIOSCOPE: COMPANY USES BEADS TO FISH OUT `GOOD,' `BAD' GENES  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With Monday's announcement that Oakland,
Calif.'s DoubleTwist.com has produced the first rough list of human
genes, the next question is: How do they all work together?
</P>
<P>
   Enter Lynx Therapeutics, an 8-year-old Hayward, Calif., firm
whose technology may help figure out how genes interact to promote
health or cause disease.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the challenge. Each cell contains a complete set of
genes. But only some genes are switched on _ scientists say
``expressed'' _ in any given cell. The difference between a heart
cell and a skin cell boils down to which genes are expressed in
that part of your body.
</P>
<P>
   Gene expression also has medical applications. Errors in gene
expression cause some illnesses. For example, the difference
between healthy mammaries and breast cancer could be the
overexpression of a harmful gene or the underexpression of a
beneficial one.
</P>
<P>
   Lynx has a novel technology that reaches into the DNA from a
specific cell, notes which genes are expressed, and measures their
concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philosophically, it's quite simple,'' said Chief Executive
Officer Norrie Russell. ``Technically, it's a bitch to get it
working.''
</P>
<P>
   The process begins with polymer beads so tiny it would take 40
of them to equal the width of a human hair. To each microscopic
bead _ and the process requires many thousands _ Lynx attaches
short DNA tags. Think of these DNA tags as smart Velcro. Ordinary
Velcro is indiscriminate. Any two pieces will bind. But Lynx's
Velcro is particular. Each DNA tag will only bind to a specific
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Once Lynx has tagged the beads, it's only half done. It must
also append tags to the whole stew of genes being studied. There
may be thousands, or tens of thousands, of expressed genes in the
study sample. Lynx gives each gene a unique tag _ which corresponds
to a tag on one of the beads.
</P>
<P>
   So when the beads are thrown into the study sample, each gene
mates with a unique, matching bead. ``They Velcro together,''
Russell said, smacking his palms together.
</P>
<P>
   The beads provide Lynx with a way to fish genes out of the
sample. Other equipment sorts the beads and measures the prevalence
of the various genes in the sample. In a comparison of healthy and
sick breast cells, for instance, the side-by-side measurements
might reveal whether too much of one gene or too little of another
is a possible culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what gives the drug companies the hints as to where to
focus their studies,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Piece of cake, right? Well, not exactly. In the official
warnings it's required to send potential investors, Lynx says its
technology is ``new and unproven'' and ``in too early a stage to
determine whether it can be successfully implemented'' to discover
potential drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But that's legal boilerplate. If investors heeded such warnings,
Wall Street would still be a fish market. Indeed, Lynx is already
selling its DNA analysis services out of its Hayward headquarters.
It has three clients so far, pharmaceutical firms willing to pay
millions of dollars a year to see whether Lynx's beads can help
sort a variety of genetic puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   Lynx production manager Keith Moon showed me through the
74,000-square-foot office and lab space where the firm's 100-person
staff juggles billions of microscopic beads. For the grand finale,
I sat at a microscope where the tiny beads are magnified 3,000
times, watching one magical step in the sorting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the money shot,'' Moon joked, the image that wows
potential clients or investors.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity more investors haven't had a chance to look through
that lens, otherwise Lynx stock might be in better shape. The
company's shares, which have been lolling around the mid to upper
20s, closed at $29.25 on Friday. Back in the heady days of spring,
when biotech ruled, Lynx nearly hit $100 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Lynx sought to capitalize on its soaring stock with a secondary
offering, but by the time it was ready, the Nasdaq had tanked. Lynx
withdrew its filing at the end of March. ``At these prices, it
wasn't worth it,'' said Chief Financial Officer Ed Albini.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is nursing some $30 million in cash, which at
its present expense rate would carry it through 2001. Russell will
presumably be out in the meantime, trying to sign up new drug
clients, while Albini keeps a lid on expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Other than proving the technology works _ Lynx must be dying to
make some stunning, money-making discovery that couldn't be done
any other way _ the only other problem is competition.
</P>
<P>
   Differential gene expression was such an obvious next step in
the discovery process that there are at least two dozen firms that
have come up with technologies to address this need. Most of them
use special computer chips that react in the presence of genes.
</P>
<P>
   These gene-chip systems have been in the field for years. Lynx
will have to prove that its beads can measure more genes than the
gene chips. But the technical pros and cons of the two technologies
are as subtle as the old debates about how many angels can sit on
the head of a pin. Mere mortals will be hard pressed to follow that
debate.
</P>
<P>
   But gene chip vendors, like Affymetrix Inc. of Santa Clara,
Calif., have one obvious advantage. They sell equipment that drug
research firms can use on their own premises for gene comparison
work _ as opposed to Lynx, which requires customers to bring the
work to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe researchers, being the very particular folks they
are, are going to want to do the experiments themselves,'' said
Affymetrix spokeswoman Anne Bowdidge.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, the Lynx chief executive officer, argued that his
technology is so powerful that potential customers won't mind
mailing their tissue samples to Hayward. That argument will be more
powerful when and if he has more than three paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who quit a plum research post at AstraZeneca
Pharmaceuticals to become Lynx's top salesman, said he has no doubt
that Lynx will win over clients, humble skeptics and make
stockholders rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology unshackled me from my golden handcuffs at the
third-largest drug company in the world,'' he said. ``This had to
be good.''

SPANISH BANK WINS AUCTION FOR MEXICAN BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FINEREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Spanish bank, Banco Santander Central Hispano,
has won a government auction for Mexico's oldest and third-largest
bank, Grupo Financiero Serfin, trumping a rival bid from the
British-based HSBC Holdings PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Santander will pay $1.56 billion to the government for all of
Serfin's stock, equivalent to 1.59 times the bank's book value, the
government bank bailout agency announced on Monday. The new bank
will have a 16 percent share of the Mexican banking market.
</P>
<P>
   With the auction, Mexico joins the quickening pace of
consolidation among banks in the hemisphere, as foreign banks
jockey for position with national banks. Last week the nation's
largest financial group, Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival, made a
surprise bid to buy the second-largest bank, Grupo Financiero
Bancomer, challenging a merger between Bancomer and another Spanish
bank, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Serfin increases the foreign participation in
the Mexican banking sector to nearly 50 percent, finance officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts saw the Serfin sale as a watershed for Mexico's
banks, which have had a slow recovery from the peso devaluation and
economic shock of 1995. The sale, along with new banking laws which
expedite bankruptcies and ease loan collection, ``effectively means
the banking crisis is over,'' said Brent B. Erensel at Deutsche
Bank Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Serfin employs 18,000 people in 569 branches serving 2.5 million
customers across Mexico. The Bank Savings Protection Institute took
control of Serfin in July 1999 after the bank ran into debt
problems stemming from the 1995 crisis, when spiraling interest
rates and a wave of defaults crippled the Mexican banking sector.
</P>
<P>
   In its 10 months of oversight, the agency poured $13 billion
into the bank to make it financially sound and attractive to
buyers. Serfin now has one of the lowest levels of past-due loans
of all the country's banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following the restructuring efforts, Serfin is one of the most
solid and healthy enterprises of the Mexican banking system,''
Santander directors said in a press release from Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Santander will pay for 25 percent of the stock within 20 days
and 75 percent during the following 30 days. The loser in the
Serfin bid, HSBC, will sell the 20 percent stake it already has in
Serfin to Santander for $137 million, a figure that was set by the
government agency when it took over Serfin. HSBC will receive that
payment within 10 days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the exact price offered by HSBC was not disclosed, the
bid they submitted was lower than Santander's. Still, analysts said
that HSBC had not lost interest in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Boni at Credit Lyonnais Securities said the big question
is whether Banamex and Bancomer, Mexico's two largest banks, will
complete the merger that Banamex proposed last week. The
combination could create the largest financial group in Latin
America. If that deal goes through, Boni said, Santander and other
foreign banks will likely look at other acquisitions in Mexico to
increase their market share.

 TECH 21: WELCOME TO MY WIRELESS WORLD  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not counting the answering machine, the VCR and
the burglar alarm, there have been three technological revolutions
in my household over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The first, of course, was getting a computer at home. The second
was instant access to the Internet _ originally with ISDN, now with
DSL. (The latter is much faster, of course, but it was the former
that brought about the qualitative change: letting us on the Web in
a blink, just by opening a browser, without having to wait for
conventional modems to perform their mating rituals.)
</P>
<P>
   Those changes involved amply publicized technologies. That's not
the case with the third epochal change, which has occurred just in
the past six months: Our laptops can now talk to each other and the
Internet from anywhere in the house, or even our modest yard,
without dragging around cables.
</P>
<P>
   They do so through a wireless local-area network. It's linked to
the wired network that connects my desktop machines and thus to the
DSL line. The net effect: We no longer have to sit at a desk to get
fast, easy access to the Internet. My wife, using her Apple iBook,
can do her e-mail from her papasan chair. Sitting on the living
room couch, with my 3-pound Compaq notebook in my lap, I can watch
the tube with one eye and surf the Web with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we both sit at the kitchen table and do our online
chores simultaneously. And since the weather has warmed up, I've
begun setting up shop on the patio.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, wireless networking isn't brand new; for several
years, a variety of other technologies have promised similar
benefits. But each in its own way entailed serious compromises in
scope, speed and reliability.
</P>
<P>
   What we have now is a no-compromise solution. For an online
junkie like me, it's bliss. Even my wife, who's anything but a
techie, says she loves it.
</P>
<P>
   What made it all possible is a new standard carrying the catchy
name of IEEE 802.11b. It defines a way to move data wirelessly at
up to 11 megabits per second _ faster, in theory, than a standard
office Ethernet. In practice, it's a bit slower than a wired
network, but the difference is hardly noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   Apple was first to market with this technology, which, with
characteristic cleverness, it calls AirPort. Every Mac model,
desktop and notebook now has a special slot for the AirPort add-on
card, which is priced at $99. The flying-saucer-style AirPort Base
Station, a stand-alone device that lets up to 10 card-carrying Macs
(or, as I discovered, PCs) get online without wires, is $299.
</P>
<P>
   (Anyone who thinks Apple's revival is all about colors, curves
and cutesy ads should take note _ this is real innovation. Apple
didn't invent the technology _ it gets its AirPort cards straight
from Lucent. But Steve Jobs et al deserve a lot of credit for
seeing the potential in the technology, integrating it into their
hardware and software, and bringing it to market at prices that
have competitors gasping.)
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a new Mac to enjoy the benefits of 802.11b,
though. Lucent offers a similar card for the PCMCIA slots found in
most PC notebooks as well as pre-AirPort Apple PowerBooks. It used
to be called the WaveLAN Turbo, and the Web site is still
 &LR; www.wavelan.com &LR; , but Lucent recently gave its whole wireless
family a jauntier moniker, Orinoco.
</P>
<P>
   There are two versions, called Silver and Gold, depending on the
level of encryption you want; I tried the Silver version, which
lists for $179. To add wireless capability to a desktop PC, you'll
need the PCMCIA card plus an adapter that goes in a PCI or ISA slot
($69 each).
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, two other companies that offer 802.11b products
are 3Com and Aironet, which was recently acquired by Cisco. 3Com's
AirConnect PC Card is $219; there's no desktop adapter yet.
Aironet's PC Card, which has strong encryption, lists for $249, and
its desktop cards for $349.
</P>
<P>
   The best deal I know of for PC users comes from Dell, which
sells a version of the Aironet cards with less robust encryption as
the Dell 4800LT line. I recently tried out a pair of them _ a $139
PC Card in an Inspiron 3800 notebook and a $179 PCI version in my
desktop PC _ and they worked fine.
</P>
<P>
   There are just two catches for PC users who want to get on the
wireless bandwagon:
</P>
<P>
   One is that these products are surprisingly hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   You can, however, find pointers to some dealers, online and off,
at  &LR; www.wavelan.com/contact/ &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   As for Dell, for some reason it doesn't list its 4800LT products
separately on its Web site, but I'm told they're offered as an
option if you order a new Inspiron notebook. Or you can do what I
did: Just call Dell at (800) 999-3355 and order the cards that way.
Some of the documentation makes it sound as if you need a
Dell-branded PC or notebook, but you don't _ I have the PCI card in
a non-Dell desktop, and I've used the PC Card in Windows laptops
from three vendors in addition to Dell.
</P>
<P>
   The other catch is that no one besides Apple now offers a base
station, or network access point, for less than $1,000. Unless you
want to spend that kind of money, you have to use a PC with a modem
or broadband Internet connection and an 802.11b adapter in a PCI or
ISA slot as your access point. That's a cheap solution, and it
worked as advertised in my tests; the only real downside is that it
doesn't work unless you leave your PC running.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't suit you, your best bet is probably to wait a
few weeks, when Lucent's Orinoco RG-1000, a ``residential gateway''
with a list price of $349, should hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible to use Apple's $299 base station with Windows
PCs, as I've been doing, but there are several complexities,
especially if you want your wireless traffic encrypted. The details
are too geeky to go into here, but if you really need to know,
e-mail me and I'll tell you what's worked for me and what hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: For a few hundred extra dollars, anyone with a
notebook computer can now get Internet access anywhere around the
house. It's fast (as fast as your wired Internet connection,
anyway), it's reliable and it's hugely liberating.
</P>
<P>
   Standards Soup
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about standards, tech-industry wags often joke,
is that there are so many to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is that more true than in the wireless
data-communications arena.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile-phone industry, of course, is the worst offender _ it
has more wide-area communications standards than I have fingers,
and lots of new ones are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But local-area wireless developers seem to be doing their best
to catch up: Not even counting the original, slower 802.11 (no
``b'') wireless Ethernet spec, there are already two major
alternatives to 802.11b: HomeRF, which is just getting off the
ground in the consumer market, and Bluetooth, an even newer
technology that will begin appearing in cell phones, notebooks and
Palm products, among others, over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   All three of these technologies operate in the 2.4-gigahertz
portion of the spectrum. Unfortunately, that means that, at least
in their current form, they're not fully compatible. At a minimum,
experts tell me, the performance of each will suffer if one of the
others is in use nearby.
</P>
<P>
   What's really mind-boggling is that all three of these standards
have been under development for years. In some cases (notably, but
not exclusively, Intel) different groups within the very same
company have been working on each technology. Yet only recently has
the industry really started to take the compatibility problem
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the microwave-oven issue: The devices, already
installed in nearly every household likely to be interested in
wireless networking (except mine), also give off 2.4-gigahertz
signals.
</P>
<P>
   At least the industry is working on that one: The latest version
of Lucent's Orinoco configuration software includes a checkbox for
``Microwave Oven Robustness.''

MARKET PLACE: INTEREST RATE INCREASES HINT AT EVENTUAL SLOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cost of financing is on the rise for consumers
and companies.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark rate on 30-year home mortgages, at 8.65 percent,
is the highest since early 1995, and the yields on junk bonds, at
an average of 12.79 percent, are well above their levels back then.
Corporate bond yields, at 8.89 percent, are also approaching their
early 1995 marks.
</P>
<P>
   These are all signs that the Federal Reserve's interest rate
increases, five moves of a quarter point since last June, are
beginning to have an impact on the financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the higher rates have not yet led to a significant drag on
the overall economy, in part because market rates have risen to
their 5-year highs very recently and in part because the stock
market has been so resilient that consumers have been unbowed.
Although growth has slowed somewhat since the fourth quarter, the
economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter. And
in the most significant data since then, 340,000 new jobs were
created last month as the unemployment rate fell to a 30-year low
of 3.9 percent, the government reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This lack of bite in monetary policy, even more than the recent
signs of inflationary pressures in wages, has led many analysts to
predict that the Fed will push up its target for short-term
interest rates much further then its current 6 percent before the
economy will slow to an acceptable noninflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   With Fed policy makers scheduled to meet next Tuesday, the
debate has shifted to whether they will raise their target by half
a percentage point instead of just a quarter point.
</P>
<P>
   The recent rise in the yield on the futures contract of federal
funds shows that many investors expect the central bank's target
rate to be 7 percent by November.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has moved cautiously until now partly because it saw few
signs of inflationary pressures other than the spurt in crude oil
and gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, acknowledged in a speech last
month that ``the current episode is the smallest and most gradual
tightening'' since the late 1960s. ``So the modest effects on
aggregate demand to date perhaps only confirm the relatively modest
and extremely gradual nature of the current tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the increases in the Fed's target rate, the Federal
funds rate, seem to have had less impact than in the past. ``Some
developments,'' Meyer said, ``suggest that the recent policy moves
may have had a more limited effect on aggregate demand than would
have been expected.''
</P>
<P>
   To measure the impact of monetary policy, one has to look at
what effect a rise in the federal funds rate, which is the rate on
overnight loans between banks, has on broader financial conditions,
including interest rates, stock prices and the dollar's exchange
rate. Meyer said one gauge of the impact, the Goldman Sachs
financial conditions index, ``is not only at the very low end of
historical experience, but is nearly unchanged'' since June.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a second conclusion about the current experience,'' Meyer
said, ``is that the increase in the funds rate, to date, has had a
smaller effect than usual _ nearly zero _ on overall financial
conditions and hence on aggregate demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons to the Fed's last episode of tightening help make
the point. From February 1994 to March 1995, policy makers raised
the Federal funds rate target to 6 percent from 3 percent. By
December 1994, new mortgage applications had fallen 20.3 percent
from their year-earlier level, according to John Lonski, senior
economist at Moody's Investors Service.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than slowing, the rate has actually grown recently. New
applications rose 9.2 percent in the 12 months ended in April,
despite the rise in the interest rate on a 30-year, Fannie Mae
mortgage to 8.65 percent from 6.90 percent in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Even though mortgage and corporate rates are rising, they have
not yet reached their peaks of the 1994-95 Fed tightening. The
Fannie Mae 30-year rate topped out at 9.29 percent in December
1994. The rate on long-term industrial bonds rated by Moody's as
Baa, its lowest investment grade rating, reached 9.37 in November
1994. (But the yields on the poorest quality corporate credits
known as junk bonds are more than three-quarters of a percentage
point higher than the 11.98 percent peak in January 1995, according
to Chase Manhattan's high-yield index.)
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most important reason the Fed's interest rate
increases have had little effect is that stocks have failed to
crumble, another factor noted by Meyer. ``Equity prices have been
unusually resilient in this episode, rising by an amount near the
maximum during the first nine months of significant tightenings
over the period studied,'' he said. While the Dow is down 3.3
percent since the end of June, the Nasdaq is up 36.6 percent, and
the Wilshire 5000, which includes all domestic stocks, is up 5.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   William Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, said
Monday the Fed would have to raise its Fed funds target to 7.5
percent next year, which means another 1.5 percentage points, to
slow the economy. Like several economists, he raised his projection
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley said the Fed's moves had had so little impact so far
because ``the bond and stock markets are so trusting'' of Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Investors, he said,
believe the Fed will keep inflation in check, but not push interest
rates so high as to cause a recession. ``So they are not worried
about inflation and they are not worried about a hard landing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Neil M. Soss, chief U.S. economist at Credit Suisse First
Boston, said, ``we haven't seen much effect in the real economy
yet'' because consumers, who have powered much of this record
economic expansion, have not gotten a signal from financial markets
to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   But the surge in mortgage rates in the last two weeks, from 8.09
percent to 8.65 percent, may show that the Fed's message is finally
coming through, he said.

 GAME TESTERS SCORE BY CATCHING BUGS  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Gabrielle Brown punched a few buttons on the
handset of her Dreamcast, sending the skateboarder in the video
game up a ramp and into a gnarly, 360-degree spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is pretty clean,'' she said, as the skater attempted
another jump, then fell and injured himself. ``But sometimes his
blood comes out a little chunky.''
</P>
<P>
   Programmers at San Francisco's Sega of America probably won't
improve the fluidity of the skater's blood in Tony Hawk Pro Skater,
part of a demo that ships with the console.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't stopping Brown from looking for all sorts of
anomalies, from see-through walls and misspelled words to ``Grade
A'' bugs _ the kind that crash the game and keep programmers up
until 3 a.m. combing through thousands of lines of software code.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, and thousands more video-game testers like her, are the
last line of defense against bugs in the $7.4 billion-a-year and
growing video-game industry.
</P>
<P>
   Like word processing or spreadsheet software, games must undergo
rigorous testing before hitting retail shelves. And with game
companies now finishing up their holiday titles _ many of which
will be showcased at this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo in
Los Angeles _ it's officially testing season.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Sega and Redwood City, Calif.'s Electronic
Arts, the No. 1 video-game publisher in the United States, have
large in-house testing departments. Smaller firms often farm out
the work or rely on large publishers like EA to market, distribute
and handle the bulk of testing for a title.
</P>
<P>
   Managers at EA hired 40 game testers during one week in
mid-April. Late this summer, the EA test department will peak at
about 250.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Brown _ a rare example of a female tester _ most in the
industry are late teen and twentysomething guys with highly
developed eye-hand coordination, who decorate their desks with
``Star Wars'' action figures and play volleyball during lunch.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, they get paid to play video games.
</P>
<P>
   But if it sounds like the dream job for every 16-year-old
slacker you know, remember this: The money isn't great, and the
responsibilities are real.
</P>
<P>
   From initial conceptual drawings to final marketing blitz, a
typical game costs about $1 million and takes eight to 24 months to
develop. If it doesn't flow well or ships chock-full of glitches,
the company risks negative buzz. Although sometimes not. Grand
Turismo II, a driving game for Sony's PlayStation, doesn't allow
users to play the very last portion of the game. But that fact
hasn't kept it from becoming one of the top-selling games in the
genre.
</P>
<P>
   Testers _ whose work accounts for about $50,000 to $100,000 of
the overall cost of a game, according to EA officials _ help solve
both technical and ``gameplay'' problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In your good restaurants you have an executive chef who tastes
what everyone is doing,'' said Murray Allen, vice president of
postproduction, testing and technical support at EA. Testers ``are
the taste testers of the game. They make sure it's right, because
if a game ships and customers start taking it back to the store,
the stores don't like dealing with the company making that game
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   At most large publishers, the testing process works like this:
once a rough version of a game, or ``alpha,'' is playable, it moves
from the developers to the test department. There, testers play
through each level over and over. And over and over.
</P>
<P>
   When they find a problem (and it's always ``when,'' not ``if'')
they type up a short report that goes into the ``bug'' database.
The report details how the tester found the malfunction, how often
it popped up, and how detrimental it is to the game. Grade A bugs
are the worst: They freeze up the computer or console.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Arts has five grading levels; other companies have
fewer. At EA, an ``E'' level bug is considered fairly low priority.
Often, it's a tester's opinion on an object _ like Brown's feedback
on the blood _ or design. For example, a tester may comment that
it's too difficult to find a key that lets the player move to the
next level.
</P>
<P>
   Programmers consult the database and correct the glitches. The
fixed version goes back to the tester, who then checks that the bug
is gone and that no more have cropped up. This process continues
right up through the launch _ and sometimes afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Problematic bugs found after the launch can be fixed with a
downloadable ``patch,'' a chunk of code inserted into the program.
</P>
<P>
   If playing through a single game or battle sequence seems like a
really repetitive way to spend eight hours or more, well, it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might have to run the character along the way for an
entire level to make sure it stays the same,'' said Joe Funk,
editorial director of Electronic Gaming Monthly. ``Video-game
testing sounds cool on the surface, but when you're working on the
same game and character for 120 days in a row, it gets tiresome.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, many testers swear off the games they've
tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alpha Centauri, that's a game I'll never play again,''
grumbled Dave McCormick, a 24-year-old tester at Electronic Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Right now McCormick is working on the company's Shogun Total War
title.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, players maneuver battalions of archers and
musketeers through 16th century Japan in an effort to conquer the
enemy. So far, McCormick and the other testers working on the game
have found about 1,100 bugs, ranging from raindrops that look like
black blobs to musketeers who won't fire when it's snowing.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a bug is ``like a little victory,'' said 27-year-old
Daryl Humdy, who, with 44 bugs has one of the highest ``bug
counts'' on his Shogun team. ``If something goes out you can say,
`That's my bug.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to high tolerance for endless hours in front of a
computer or TV screen, bug-hunting requires a certain amount of
creativity, according to the testers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think of the silliest things in the world to see
if it breaks the game, like driving a race car the whole time in
reverse to see what it does,'' said Chris Lovenguth, product
analyst at San Francisco's Eidos, creator of the popular Tomb
Raider game series.
</P>
<P>
   However, even the most enthusiastic game testers admit there are
drawbacks to the profession. At the end of a typical four-month
testing period, it's common for testers _ or quality assurance
analysts as they're sometimes called _ to work 70- or 80-hour
weeks. The overtime is nice, but it makes for strange sleeping
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exhausting for them,'' Allen admits. ``That's why they
have futons around so that they can crash for a while. Sometimes
they just crawl under their desks for a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   The long hours can also make for some tense working conditions,
especially when testers are crammed wall to wall during crunch
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the final two weeks (of testing) and you find
another bug, you know it's going to put the project back a couple
of days, and the production department doesn't like you, marketing
doesn't like you,'' Lovenguth said. ``You're doing your job, but no
one likes you.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the industry's bugaboo: piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Computer and video-game publishers say they lost $3 billion last
year worldwide to illegal copies of yet-to-be-released games. And
testers are perceived as a weak link in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Testers come under a lot of fire because we have the game all
the time and people think that if an early version of the game gets
out, it was us,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that, only testing supervisors can sign in or out
so-called ``key disks'' which let testers play the games.
</P>
<P>
   Funk estimates most testers make $20,000 to $25,000 a year; in
the Bay Area, where the cost of living is notoriously high, Funk
said it could be slightly more.
</P>
<P>
   Testers can earn more, but it takes time and persistence.
</P>
<P>
   Most start out as temporary workers. After about a year at a
fairly large company, they can move into a full-time position _ and
receive a decent bump in pay.
</P>
<P>
   After another year, it's not uncommon to be promoted into
supervisory testing positions or other departments such as
production, information technology or marketing, according to
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Abney was one of the first testers in Electronic Arts'
centralized quality assurance department in the mid-1990s. (Before
that, the company's testers were tied to development teams
scattered all over the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   Abney expressed an interest in hardware and helped set up EA's
compatibility lab, where the company makes sure each game works on
an array of computers and video cards.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Abney, 27, is manager of technology development, where he
coordinates hardware purchases for EA's developers and programmers
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   EA officials estimate one tester moves up every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video-game testing isn't as glamorous as it may appear on
first sight,'' Funk said. ``At the same time, glamour is in the eye
of the beholder. You can take advantage of kids' enthusiasm _ `Wow,
I'm getting a paycheck from Nintendo.' And if they're smart, they
can parlay that into something else.''

BAY STATE PRESSURED TO PRODUCE `BIG DIG' FINANCE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a two-pronged salvo with multibillion-dollar
implications, US highway officials and a powerful congressman
Monday moved independently to halt federal funding for the ``Big
Dig'' if Massachusetts fails to rapidly produce an adequate plan to
resolve the project's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Highway Administration set May 19 as the last day
the state will receive federal aid for the highway renovation
project in the absence of an acceptable plan to finish the $13.1
billion venture. The project is plagued by an overrun as large as
$2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise initiative, Representative Frank R. Wolf, a
Virginia Republican who chairs the House panel that controls
highway spending, proposed cutting all federal dollars for the Big
Dig in the next fiscal year, starting Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves increased the urgency for the state Legislature and
Governor Paul Celluci to swiftly generate a bailout plan for the
financially strapped venture. A conference committee has been
working for several weeks to try to resolve differences between
competing state House and Senate plans. Cellucci must sign the
final product.
</P>
<P>
   Either spending freeze could substantially slow the pace of
construction, if not force managers to significantly scale back the
design of the Big Dig, the largest public works project in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig officials, though clearly stunned by Wolf's plan,
expressed optimism that they can avert a potentially devastating
interruption of federal support for the project. Congress has
approved $8.55 billion for the Big Dig, of which about $3.5 billion
remains to be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take very seriously the concerns of Congress and federal
highway officials about the credibility of the project and the
project managers,'' said Joe Landolfi, spokesman for Big Dig chief
Andrew Natsios. ``We hope that the passage of an acceptable finance
plan, which we expect in the next week or so, will help to address
most of their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said last week in Washington that he expected the state
House and Senate to produce a bill by May 19. And Alison Franklin,
a spokeswoman for Senate President Thomas Birmingham, said Monday
that the conference committee is poised to complete the bailout
plan ``in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Massachusetts leaders fail to reach agremeent on an
acceptable plan, the Big Dig could cushion the blow of a federal
freeze after May 19 by relying temporarily on state funds. Under
the freeze proposed by the Federal Highway Administration, in a
letter Monday to Natsios, the Big Dig could spend federal dollars
that have been earmarked for current contracts but could not tap
federal aid for additional work.
</P>
<P>
   The highway agency's vow to freeze Big Dig funding was contained
in a letter formally rejecting a bailout plan that Cellucci had
proposed in March. Reiterating steps the state must take to resolve
numerous inadequacies in Cellucci's plan, the letter states,
``Documentation that these actions have been completed must be
provided to the Federal Highway Administration by May 19, 2000, or
we will freeze'' spending.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's plan could be more drastic. By halting federal funding
for the project in fiscal 2001, Congress would take away about $325
million that it previously had authorized for the project. The
money would still flow to the state as part of the annual federal
transportation subsidy, but it could be used only for road and
highway projects other than the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the state is expected to receive about $500 million in
federal highway money in fiscal 2001, of which about $175 million
normally would be set aside for non-Big Dig work. But if Wolf's
initiative succeeds, all $500 million would be used for roadwork
other than the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, one of the Big Dig's harshest congressional critics,
portrayed his move as a way to protect ``the taxpayer from waste,
fraud and abuse.'' Citing a federal task force report last month
that accused former Big Dig managers of intentionally concealing
the massive overrun and US highway officials of failing to detect
the concealment, Wolf said his plan to halt federal funds ``puts
the Congress on record to make sure that we deal effectively with
the problem of cost overruns.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Morra, said of his plan: ``This is
not meant to be punitive. It's meant to keep the project's
manager's feet to the fire, and if they were to come up with a new
financial plan that covers the cost increases and ensures a solid
statewide highway program, then the funds can flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative John W. Olver of Massachusetts, the second most
senior Democrat on Wolf's committee, voted for the proposal to cut
off federal funding for the Big Dig in fiscal 2001. The vote came
during a hearing on a $15 billion transportation spending package
for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is essentially saying, `Hey, this is
serious,' '' Olver said of the Big Dig's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the federal highway agency's ultimatum, which gives the
state less than two weeks to construct an acceptable plan, Olver
said, Wolf's provision offers a five-month window for action. ``If
five months from now, they have done nothing, and if this measure
were to survive the rest of the legislative process, then they
wouldn't be able to expend any federal money on the Big Dig,''
Olver said. ``But everybody hopes we will have a finance plan in
place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation were
less receptive of Wolf's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Withholding committed federal funds is not in the interest of
any taxpayer,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy. ``I am confident
that we will be successful in removing this harmful provision from
the final bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry vowed to use stalling tactics, if
necessary, to kill Wolf's measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With construction over 60 percent complete and 98.6 percent of
the design already complete, any effort to freeze federal funding
at this point is short-sighted and fiscally irresponsible,'' Kerry
said.

ONLINE INVESTING: INTERNET ENGINES TRACK PERFORMANCE OF
SELECTED  STOCKS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HARRY DOMASH 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Among the many tools the Internet offers
investors, one of the most powerful is screening, the ability to
search through the entire market for stocks that meet your personal
investment needs. But how do you know what to search for?
</P>
<P>
   I ran tests to see how investors would have fared if they had
used screening criteria available at no charge on CNBC's Advanced
Search program to select stocks on May 1, 1999, and then sold them
at their closing price on April 17, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   I used ProSearch, a feature of Telescan Investor's Platform, to
run the tests. (For more information on Telescan, go to
 &LR; www.telescan.com &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   For example, let's say I wanted to find out what kind of return
I would have received by selecting stocks with the highest
price/earnings ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Using ProSearch, I would set up these parameters for this
search. I would set the program at the 255-stock maximum and then
select high price/ earnings ratio as the screening criterion.
</P>
<P>
   The program would then show me a list of 255 stocks with the
highest P/E as of May 1, 1999. It would also show each stock's
performance from then until April 17, 2000, as well as the average
return of the 255-stock portfolio over the period.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by Telescan, CNBC's Advanced Search employs a subset of
more than 60 of ProSearch's screening variables. To get to the
screening program from CNBC's homepage ( &LR; www.cnbc.com &LR; ), select
``Stocks,'' then ``Stock Screener'' and finally ``Advanced
Search.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the variables I found to be the most significant. The
name of each is shown in parentheses as it appears on CNBC's
screening page.
</P>
<P>
   -- One-Year Historical Earnings Growth (EPS Growth 1 Yr)
</P>
<P>
   The 255 companies with the highest one-year historical earnings
growth (179 percent plus), as of May 1, 1999, soared 87.8 percent
during the test period, compared to a loss of 4.3 percent for
companies with one-year earnings growth below 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- 5-Year Historical Annual Earnings Growth (EPS Growth 5 Yr)
</P>
<P>
   Companies with the highest five-year historical annual earnings
growth (68.9 percent plus) returned 30.7 percent, compared to a
loss of 4.3 percent suffered by companies with low five-year
earnings growth (0.1 to 5.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
   -- Current Ratio (Current Ratio)
</P>
<P>
   Current Ratio compares a company's assets, such as cash,
inventories and accounts receivable, to its short-term debts.
Ratios above 1.0 mean the company assets exceed its debts (which is
good), and values below 1.0 indicate the company owes more than it
has (which is bad). The 255 stocks with the highest current ratios
(7.0 and higher) soared 58.4 percent during the test period, while
companies with the lowest ratios (0.1 to 0.2) rose only 7.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Long-Term Debt (Debt/Equity Ratio)
</P>
<P>
   Long-term debt as measured by the debt/equity ratio mattered,
but less so. Companies with no long-term debt (debt/equity of 0)
rose 23.6 percent, compared to a 12.1 percent gain for high-debt
(ratios of 39.0 to 50.0) companies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Gross Profit Margin (Gross Profit Margin)

   Gross Profit Margin measures the profit earned from making or
selling products before deducting for operating expenses such as
marketing, research, administration and the like. The 255 companies
with the highest GPMs (80 percent plus) returned 47.1 percent
during the year, compared to 3.6 percent for companies with low
margins (below 12.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
   -- Return on Equity (Return on Equity)
</P>
<P>
   Return on Equity is an oft-used performance measure calculated
by dividing corporate earnings by shareholders' equity. The problem
with ROE is, all things being equal, higher-debt companies have
higher ROE than companies with no debt. That shows up in the
results. The 255 companies with the highest ROEs (35 plus) returned
only 11 percent, compared to low ROE (0.1 to 2.6) companies' 19.4
percent return during the test period.
</P>
<P>
   -- Return on Assets (Return on Assets)
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say Return on Assets is a better gauge than ROE,
because it measures how effectively management is using assets, a
calculation not influenced by debt levels. The results confirm that
conclusion. High ROA (18.1 plus) companies returned 32.9 percent,
compared to a loss of 4.9 percent for low ROE (0.1 to 2.6) firms.
</P>
<P>
   -- Price Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)
</P>
<P>
   High-priced aggressive growth stocks have outperformed
value-priced stocks in recent years. Our tests bear that out.
Companies with high price/earnings ratios (86 plus) returned 57.3
percent during the test period, compared to 2.9 percent for
companies with low P/Es (below 7.6).
</P>
<P>
   -- Price-to-Sales Ratio (Price/Sales Ratio)
</P>
<P>
   Price-to-sales ratios have become a popular valuation measure,
since many new companies do not have earnings, making it impossible
to compute P/E. Companies with high P/S (17.6 plus) returned 50.5
percent, compared to a loss of 15.6 percent for value-priced
companies with the lowest P/S (0.1 to 0.2).
</P>
<P>
   -- Relative Stock Price Performance (Rel Performance 1 Yr)
</P>
<P>
   Many successful selection strategies involve picking stocks that
have already gone up the most during the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC's Relative Performance measures a stock's price
appreciation, but the definition is a little tricky. A relative
performance of 100 means the stock price didn't change from the
beginning to the end of the year ending May 1, 1999 (in our case),
while 200 means the stock price doubled, and 50 means the price
dropped in half.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth figuring it out.
</P>
<P>
   The 255 stocks with the highest one-year relative performance
(RP values of 209 plus) rocketed 97.6 percent during the test
period, compared to a 6.3 percent return for stocks with middling
(100 to 125) relative performance, and 20.2 percent gain for the
stocks with the worst (0.3 to 34.7) relative performance over the
12 months prior to May 1, 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A city police horse has seen just about everything,
right?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not a life-size fiberglass cow, painted in fanciful
colors.
</P>
<P>
   So, in preparation for an art exhibition of 500 such cows
scattered throughout the five boroughs, bemused mounted officers
and their equally bemused horses have some new stablemates these
days.
</P>
<P>
   At a similar exhibition in Chicago last summer, the strange
sight spooked some of the carriage horses carrying tourists along
Michigan Avenue. To avoid such problems here, sample fiberglass
cows were sent to New York's mounted police units so the horses
could get used to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``These horses are used to seeing all kinds of construction,
cement trucks, crowds,'' said Deputy Inspector Peter J. Abbot, the
mounted unit commander, at the unit's headquarters on West 42nd
Street last week. ``An inanimate cow is not really going to rock
their world.''
</P>
<P>
   Right on cue, a chestnut horse nibbled on the horns of a white,
unpainted cow, apparently under the impression it was a large salt
lick.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown at the Troop A stables, next to the First Precinct
Headquarters on Varick Street, the steeds were equally blase. At
both places, people remarked that the sculptures looked more like
bulls than cows, at least in front.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thing has big horns,'' said Arlene Greaves, a hostler at
Troop A. ``A female has thin, small horns, little short horns.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it has a very masculine face,'' she added firmly.
</P>
<P>
   But Jenny Steinman, an artist who was painting two cows last
week in a work space in a former bank building behind Grand Central
Terminal, said she had been assured by Mark Varner, a bovine expert
at the University of Maryland, that the sculptures were
anatomically correct, horn-wise.
</P>
<P>
   Artists submitted 1,200 possible cow designs. They are paid
$2,000 a cow by the corporations, civic groups, cultural
institutions and other organizations that are, one might say,
ponying up to pay for the exhibition, which opens June 15. Sponsors
choose their own designs, so purple cows are not beyond the pale.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, more than 10 million people saw the exhibition,
called CowParade, generating more than $500 million in tourist
revenue. Of course, Chicago, of stockyards fame, has a long
connection with cattle. New York's relationship with cows is more
tenuous, particularly since the recent shrinkage of the bull
market.

 NEW PLAYER IN RACE TO TRACK GENOME  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A dark horse has leaped into the race to make
human genome data widely available to private and academic
researchers, which should hasten the discovery of new cures for
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, Calif.'s DoubleTwist.com will announce Monday that it
has produced a rough draft of 105,000 human genes, by doing a
computer analysis of the 85 percent of raw genome data already in
the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the genome race has been portrayed as a head-to-head
contest between the Human Genome Project _ a network of
government-funded labs that put raw genetic data on the Internet _
and Celera Genomics _ a private firm in Maryland that is
deciphering human DNA but has not yet shared its findings with the
public or the general research community.
</P>
<P>
   Celera is expected to announce any day that it has completely
deciphered the 3 billion-letter genome from end to end. At the same
time, the public genome project is expected to say that it is
nearing completion on its own rough draft of 90 percent of the
human genetic code.
</P>
<P>
   The various players are jockeying for position in advance of an
influential conference of genome scientists that will begin
Thursday at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island, N.Y. At
stake is the ability to claim credit for a landmark scientific
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The genome is 3 billion chemical letters _ A, T, G and C _
arranged in a complex code. Understanding that code is a three-step
process of reading the raw letters, putting them in order and
picking out the genes.
</P>
<P>
   Finding genes in the genome's alphabet soup is complicated by
the fact that only 3 to 5 percent of those 3 billion letters are
thought to encode genes. The rest of the letters are called junk
DNA.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist Secretly Enters
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist secretly entered the race in August, and accelerated
its effort this spring by getting Sun Microsystems to help it build
a supercomputer network. In essence, the Oakland company has
leapfrogged steps one and two, and taken a first pass at separating
the genes from the junk in the 85 percent of the raw genome data
that is already public.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Lander, a senior official of the public genome project,
praised DoubleTwist's accomplishment. ``This is fantastic,'' Lander
said. ``The reason the public project produced all this data was to
enable private companies and academics to produce the gene lists
that will fuel biomedical research.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this vindicates what the public genome project was
about,'' said Fred Cohen, a professor at the University of
California at San Francisco and a member of DoubleTwist's board.
``It was about putting data into the public domain where a variety
of people could put it to a variety of uses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the hope and promise is that gene-hunting efforts
will lead to new ways to repair faulty genes that cause or
contribute to maladies such as cancer or heart disease. Although
new gene-based drugs will take years to develop and test, the
presumption is that the more researchers who focus on the task, the
faster some of the hype will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Celera President Unaware
</P>
<P>
   Celera President Craig Venter was unaware of DoubleTwist's
effort. But Venter, who is on the verge of announcing his own
milestone, complete assembly of the genome, questioned the
reliability of any gene map produced using public data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing a very quantitative analysis, and the public
database is missing about 25 percent of the genome that's in our
sequences,'' Venter said. ``Any list of genes produced from it
would be incomplete at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, DoubleTwist's chief computer scientist, Nick Tsinoremas
was reluctant to issue any gene count, knowing that subsequent
computer analyses will change the number, purpose and location of
many genes.
</P>
<P>
   Tsinoremas said 65,000 of the genes in DoubleTwist's rough draft
passed through three sets of software programs designed to identify
genes. He assigned these genes a 90 percent probability of
accuracy. The other 40,000 genes only passed one or two sets of
tests, giving them accuracy rates of 50 percent or 75 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleTwist timed its announcement to precede the Cold Spring
Harbor conference. The company will explain its methodology then
but has not yet undergone the peer review process that would verify
its approach.
</P>
<P>
   But David B. Lipman, director of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information in Maryland, and the government's chief
genome database scientist, said DoubleTwist was only one of several
private and public centers designing computer programs to find the
genes in the raw public data. DoubleTwist is the first, however, to
say it has a rough draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they have some good people there and they've probably
done a good job of it, but I can't say more until I've seen the
data,'' Lipman said.
</P>
<P>
   Believing's Not Cheap
</P>
<P>
   If seeing is believing, then believing won't come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Although DoubleTwist does post some free information on its
site, the company charges $10,000 for a yearly subscription to the
database that contains its gene list. DoubleTwist Chief Executive
Officer John Couch said that while this might seem expensive to the
lay person, the price puts its data within the reach of scientists
at smaller firms who can't make the sort of multimillion dollar
deals Celera has done with a few drug firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an executive I could go two ways with this information,''
Couch said, ``Hog it all, find the genes, patent them and go into
research mode, or put all this information out there in the hands
of scientists and let it explode.''
</P>
<P>
   Couch said the more scientists who can see gene data, the faster
this knowledge can be used to design new drugs or therapies. He
said DoubleTwist will sell ``heavily discounted'' subscriptions to
academic scientists but declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, a computer industry veteran from the early days of Apple
Computer, used his Silicon Valley connections to pull off this
large computing exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Although DoubleTwist started assembling its gene-hunting
software in August, it was not until January that it had ironed out
the bugs. Between January and April, the company spent some $9
million to buy more than 300 advance workstations from Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, we knew we could do it (the gene analysis) in
three months,'' Couch said.
</P>
<P>
   But given how fast Celera was moving, Couch knew that wasn't
soon enough. So he phoned Ken Okin, a former Apple associate and
now head of Sun's server business, and asked for help.
</P>
<P>
   New Supercomputers
</P>
<P>
   It turned out Sun was bringing three new supercomputers online
at a factory in Oregon. It's standard procedure to run test
programs to ``burn in'' new computers. ``Our software burned in
their supercomputers,'' said Couch, who used the extra computer
power to finish a three-month job in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, the UCSF professor and DoubleTwist board member, said Sun
seemed particularly interested in helping after being told that
Celera relied on Dell and Compaq computers. ``It was the web of
West Coast companies working together to do more than any one of
them could have accomplished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At DoubleTwist headquarters, exhausted executives were running
on adrenaline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to the finish line first,'' said Chief Operating
Officer Robert Williamson.

 CISCO'S $6 BILLION DEAL IS COMPANY'S SECOND-LARGEST  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems yesterday announced its
second-largest acquisition, snagging a fast-growing Massachusetts
company that makes switches and software to help speed access to
Web sites like Lycos and Delta Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The $6 billion stock deal for ArrowPoint Communications, which
went public five weeks ago, trails only Cisco's $6.9 billion bid
last fall for Cerent, a Petaluma, Calif., optical-networking
company. ArrowPoint helps major Web sites cope with sudden floods
of request for information, hackers and other common problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, the world's largest data networking company, agreed to
pay about $145 per share for ArrowPoint, which was trading at just
$106 per share on Wednesday. ArrowPoint shares had soared 27
percent to $134.81 on Thursday, raising suspicion that word of the
deal may have leaked out early. Shares rose another $5.38, to
$140.38, after the deal was officially announced Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, Calif.'s Cisco passed up the chance to buy ArrowPoint
about a year ago for a fraction of the price. Executives at both
companies confirmed the companies held talks in the past. Analysts
say they probably disagreed sharply on what ArrowPoint was worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that we have known about for a long time,''
said Ammar Hanafi, Cisco's vice president for business development.
Hanafi said it decided to approach ArrowPoint again a couple months
ago because customer interest (in the company's products) has
heated up markedly'' in the past 60 to 90 days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, ArrowPoint's value has skyrocketed.
ArrowPoint doubled its workforce to 337 employees in the past four
months, lined up deals with major Web sites and launched one of the
hottest initial public offerings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint shares tripled in its first day as a public trading
company on March 31, giving the company a market value of $4
billion. Cisco reinitiated negotiations less than a week later,
said ArrowPoint President Lou Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO ``caused a lot of people to take notice,'' Volpi said.
Hanafi insists that Cisco actually approached ArrowPoint just
before the IPO but ArrowPoint executives waved Cisco off until the
stock offering was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the price, Wall Street liked the deal. Cisco
shares climbed $4.13 Friday to $67.75, giving it a market value of
$470 billion, the highest of any technology firm.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, analysts said the deal should help bolster Cisco's
position in a hot market for software that helps major Web sites
manage their traffic. It also helps Cisco offer one-stop-shopping
in the overall data networking market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisco is doing what Cisco always does,'' said First Albany
analyst Matthew Barzowskas. ``Waiting for the market to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deal could also be a sign that Cisco's own products,
with names like Local Director and Distributed Director, haven't
done as well as Cisco hoped, said AG Edwards analyst Peter Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Hanafi acknowledged the products appear similar ``at a high
level,'' but insisted they have significant technical differences
and are more complementary. Hanafi added that Cisco also bought
SightPath in March and Tasmania Network Systems in October as part
of plans to broaden its product portfolio in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were expecting ArrowPoint to generate $62 million in
sales this year, though those estimates could be topped with the
help of Cisco's sales force. Cisco said the total market for Web
site management products is about $500 million this year, and
growing fast.
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint competes with firms like F5 Networks and Alteon
Websystems, whose stocks slid on the news of the its deal with
Cisco.

3COM TO SPIN OFF ITS SHARES IN PALM

<TEXT>
<P>
   3Com Corp., whose shares have been trading as if the entire
company were worth less than the shares it owns in Palm Inc., said
Monday that it will distribute its Palm shares to its own
shareholders in late July.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which came after 3Com received a favorable tax
ruling from the IRS certifying that the spinoff would be tax-free,
sets the stage for the closing of the stock price gap that has
existed ever since Palm went public in early March. Since then,
Palm has traded at prices that appeared to be unreasonably high
relative to the price of 3Com shares.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for 3Com, Brian Johnson, said the exact number of
Palm shares to be distributed per 3Com share would not be
determined until July, because that would be affected by the number
of 3Com shares outstanding, which can vary as the company issues or
repurchases shares. But he said the company expected the ratio to
be about 1.5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Palm Monday closed at $32.25, up $1.0625, in Nasdaq
trading, and 3Com closed at $43.6875, up 56.25 cents. The
announcement of the planned spinoff came after the close of Nasdaq
trading.
</P>
<P>
   If 3Com shareholders do receive 1.5 shares of Palm for each 3Com
share, that would provide them with shares worth $48.375 at
Monday's price, $4.6875 more than the price of a 3Com share.
</P>
<P>
   While 3Com expects to report losses for the remainder of this
year as it reorganizes, it has virtually no debt and substantial
cash and is clearly worth something. The persistence of the
apparently negative value has puzzled market analysts, but while it
narrowed sharply in April it never disappeared and began to expand
again last week.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the 3Com spokesman, said the company's board had
authorized the company to spend up to $1 billion repurchasing its
shares. He said he expects most, if not all, of the share
repurchases to be made after the distribution, which will be made
July 27 to shareholders of record on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Palm, the dominant company in the handheld organizer business,
has seen its revenue and profits grow rapidly. Judy Bruner, the
company's chief financial officer, said in an interview Monday the
company expects revenue to continue rising quickly, but that it was
possible profits would fall for a few quarters, perhaps to the
point of reporting losses, as the company spends money for improved
marketing and to expand the uses of its products.
</P>
<P>
   Palm went public on March 2, at the height of investor
enthusiasm for many technology stocks, with 3Com selling a small
part of its stake to the public. The offering price, of $38 a
share, was more than twice as high as the company had planned to
seek when it first filed to sell shares. But it was soon eclipsed
as the shares traded as high as $165, closing that day at $95.0625.
The price of 3Com ended that day at $81.8125.
</P>
<P>
   In subsequent weeks, the prices of both stocks fell, and by
April 12 the Palm price had declined below the offering price. But
3Com's price always remained lower than the value of the Palm
shares it owned.
</P>
<P>
   Several reasons were offered for the persistence of the
valuation gap. One was that it was possible that the distribution
would not be completed, although most analysts thought the IRS
ruling was fairly routine. Another was that many investors did not
understand the expected distribution, or were seeking a quick
trade, in which they would sell Palm before the 3Com distribution
was made.
</P>
<P>
   To take advantage of the gap, an investor theoretically could
borrow Palm shares and sell them short while purchasing 3Com
shares. Many appear to have done that, and by early last month _
the last date for which figures are available _ more than half the
shares in public hands had been sold short. But the shares are
difficult to borrow, and anyone doing so ran the risk that they
might have to return the shares before the distribution was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a date certain for the distribution, the gap may
finally be erased.

 CISCO'S $6 BILLION DEAL IS COMPANY'S SECOND-LARGEST  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems yesterday announced its
second-largest acquisition, snagging a fast-growing Massachusetts
company that makes switches and software to help speed access to
Web sites like Lycos and Delta Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The $6 billion stock deal for ArrowPoint Communications, which
went public five weeks ago, trails only Cisco's $6.9 billion bid
last fall for Cerent, a Petaluma, Calif., optical-networking
company. ArrowPoint helps major Web sites cope with sudden floods
of request for information, hackers and other common problems.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco, the world's largest data networking company, agreed to
pay about $145 per share for ArrowPoint, which was trading at just
$106 per share on Wednesday. ArrowPoint shares had soared 27
percent to $134.81 on Thursday, raising suspicion that word of the
deal may have leaked out early. Shares rose another $5.38, to
$140.38, after the deal was officially announced Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, Calif.'s Cisco passed up the chance to buy ArrowPoint
about a year ago for a fraction of the price. Executives at both
companies confirmed the companies held talks in the past. Analysts
say they probably disagreed sharply on what ArrowPoint was worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that we have known about for a long time,''
said Ammar Hanafi, Cisco's vice president for business development.
Hanafi said it decided to approach ArrowPoint again a couple months
ago because customer interest (in the company's products) has
heated up markedly'' in the past 60 to 90 days.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, ArrowPoint's value has skyrocketed.
ArrowPoint doubled its workforce to 337 employees in the past four
months, lined up deals with major Web sites and launched one of the
hottest initial public offerings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint shares tripled in its first day as a public trading
company on March 31, giving the company a market value of $4
billion. Cisco reinitiated negotiations less than a week later,
said ArrowPoint President Lou Volpe.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO ``caused a lot of people to take notice,'' Volpi said.
Hanafi insists that Cisco actually approached ArrowPoint just
before the IPO but ArrowPoint executives waved Cisco off until the
stock offering was completed.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the price, Wall Street liked the deal. Cisco
shares climbed $4.13 Friday to $67.75, giving it a market value of
$470 billion, the highest of any technology firm.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, analysts said the deal should help bolster Cisco's
position in a hot market for software that helps major Web sites
manage their traffic. It also helps Cisco offer one-stop-shopping
in the overall data networking market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisco is doing what Cisco always does,'' said First Albany
analyst Matthew Barzowskas. ``Waiting for the market to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   But the deal could also be a sign that Cisco's own products,
with names like Local Director and Distributed Director, haven't
done as well as Cisco hoped, said AG Edwards analyst Peter Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   Hanafi acknowledged the products appear similar ``at a high
level,'' but insisted they have significant technical differences
and are more complementary. Hanafi added that Cisco also bought
SightPath in March and Tasmania Network Systems in October as part
of plans to broaden its product portfolio in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were expecting ArrowPoint to generate $62 million in
sales this year, though those estimates could be topped with the
help of Cisco's sales force. Cisco said the total market for Web
site management products is about $500 million this year, and
growing fast.
</P>
<P>
   ArrowPoint competes with firms like F5 Networks and Alteon
Websystems, whose stocks slid on the news of the its deal with
Cisco.

 VENTURE-CAPITAL INVESTING POT OVERFLOWS  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Venture-capital investing went ballistic in the
first quarter, according to two new industry surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The National Venture Capital Association reports that
venture-capital firms invested a record $22.7 billion in 1,557 U.S.
companies in the first quarter _ more than triple the $6.2 billion
invested in 851 U.S. companies in the first three months of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   As dot-com companies remained Wall Street darlings through
March, VC investors directed 75 percent of their funds to
Internet-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California companies received a stunning $7.9 billion,
more than a third of the total invested in all U.S. companies and
more than four times as much as was invested in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The figures from VentureOne Corp. are only slightly less
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco VC research organization reports that 342
local companies raised $6.3 billion from venture-capital investors
in the past quarter, 85 percent of which went to Internet-related
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Bay Area startups attracted more capital than any
other region of the country. Three local companies creating
Internet technology or Web-based services each raised $100 million
or more in private financing in the past quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's Business section, The Chronicle will run a full
report with charts on the continuing venture capital investment
boom.

   In Kentucky, a Show Of Chinese Equine Art
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition focusing on the role of the horse in 3,000 years
of Chinese history and culture is on display through Aug. 31 at the
Kentucky Horse Park, in the Bluegrass region. The exhibition,
``Imperial China: The Art of the Horse in Chinese History,''
features more than 300 artifacts from museums in Shaanxi Province,
including Xi'an, the ancient Chinese capital.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit explores the significance of the horse in the
unification of China, the exchange of equestrian culture with the
West through the Silk Road, significant Chinese advances in horse
accouterments and training, and the use of the horse in leisure
activities. Each dynastic period from the Western Zhou (1027-771
B.C.) through the Qing (1644-1911) will be covered.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the artifacts are gold, porcelain and jade figures, bronze
vessels, tricolored Tang dynasty ceramic statues, and a gold- and
silver-inlaid bronze Western Han Dynasty chariot, which was
restored for the exhibit. Also included are 13 life-size figures
from the famous terra-cotta army discovered about 25 years ago in
the tomb of Qin Shi Huangdi, China's first emperor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for ``Imperial China'' are $16, $11 for ages 7 to 12;
they will be issued for specific times and can be booked in
advance. A taped audio tour is included in the price, as is
admission to the 1,030-acre Kentucky Horse Park, a working farm and
educational theme park that features more than 40 breeds of horses
and two museums.
</P>
<P>
   The park is off I-75, four miles north of Lexington.

   It's a Satchmo Summer At a New Orleans Hotel
</P>
<P>
   Any birthday party for Louis Armstrong promises to be lively,
and a hotel in the city of his birth, New Orleans, plans a series
of parties this summer.
</P>
<P>
   From July 4, the 100th anniversary of Armstrong's birth (he was
actually born on Aug. 4, 1901, but apparently he and his manager
liked the other date more), through Labor Day, the International
House, a 119-room hotel at 221 Camp Street, two blocks from the
French Quarter, will offer a two-night package with cocktails, a
performance at the Storyville District jazz club and a sampling of
Louisiana hors d'oeuvres and drinks.
</P>
<P>
   The price for this Friday-Saturday night package is $318 for a
double room. On the first Thursday of each month through August
2001, in honor of Armstrong's actual birthday, jazz musicians will
play in the lobby; an extra night's stay costs $119. Call
800-633-5770 or visit www.ihhotel.com.

<P>
   Czech VAT Refunds Available, With Catch-22
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in an effort to push the Czech Republic closer to
the European Union, the Czech government authorized the Value Added
Tax refund. But just as on Europe's map, the Czech Republic falls
somewhere between West and East in its approach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In most European Union countries, shop owners provide non-E.U.
residents a VAT refund form and help them fill it out. After a
customs officer stamps the form at your departure point, you either
take it to a cash refund office in America or elsewhere or mail it
to the address on the form. A company that deals with VAT refunds
sends you a check or credits your account. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the Czech Republic. First, you need to find the refund
form, available in both Czech and English; most retailers don't
have it yet (except, perhaps, large international chains and luxury
boutiques like Moser, the crystal maker). It can be picked up at a
customs office at the airport, at 22 Sokolovska Street or the
Prague 1 Financial Bureau on 28 Stepanska. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the 22 percent VAT refund, you must spend at
least 1,000 crowns ($27) in one store on the same day, keep the
bill and have the seller stamp the form. Upon your departure _ but
no later than 30 days after the purchase _ a customs officer will
check the bought item and take a copy of the form and put it in his
files. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you must pick up the money yourself, within three
months of the purchase. So unless you return soon, you must find
someone in the Czech Republic to send the form to and to ask the
shop owner for the refund. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit awkward, I agree,'' concedes Libor Vacek, the
spokesman for the Czech Ministry of Finance. ``But we hope some
firms will soon realize it's a good business and will start
providing this service.''
</P>
<P>
   More information on VAT refunds is available from Global Refund,
a major refund provider, at 800-566-9828.

   In Paris, the Meurice Is Primped for a New Age
</P>
<P>
   The elegant Hotel Meurice, across from the Tuileries gardens in
Paris, is scheduled to reopen its mahogany doors in June after two
years of renovation that gutted the interior, pared 180 rooms to
160, and pushed the infrastructure toward the 21st century. The
renovation, aimed at restoring the building to its
turn-of-the-20th-century opulence, uncovered a forgotten Art
Nouveau glass dome with delicate fish-scale panels now adorning the
hotel's gilded Winter Garden tea salon. The main restaurant, Le
Meurice, is a Rococo jewel box with crystal chandeliers, antique
beveled mirrors and one Michelin star.
</P>
<P>
   A new, 2,206-square-foot rooftop suite, dubbed the Belle Etoile,
revolutionizes the idea of a room with a view. A zinc-roofed Belle
Epoque folly encased in reflective glass, this $7,000-a-night,
two-bedroom suite offers panoramic views from many points,
including a round whirlpool encased in marble.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms for business travelers, clustered on the second and third
floors, are decorated in a simpler, more streamlined style than
others and have work areas, safes big enough for laptop computers
and separate lines for computers and fax machines. A new spa
includes saunas, exercise machines and a beauty center.
</P>
<P>
   Since Augustin Meurice relocated his Paris establishment to the
chic Rue de Rivoli in 1835, the Meurice has attracted a celebrity
guest roster: the Shah of Iran was staying there when he was
overthrown, King George VI was a regular, and Salvador Dali once
filled his suite with sheep and staged a mock ovine execution.
Rates start at $425 night, at 7.1 francs to the dollar. Hotel
Meurice, 228, rue de Rivoli, 75001; 33-1-44.58.10.10, fax

 TEENS PROVIDE TECH SUPPORT TO SENIORS
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARRIE KIRBY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 200 The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sanel Becirovic, an 18-year-old junior at
Galileo High School in San Francisco, helps elderly people after
school.
</P>
<P>
   He plays dominoes with some and takes out the trash for others.
But more and more, the residents of the retirement homes he visits
request that he troubleshoot their Internet connections or show
them how to use Microsoft Word.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, he was figuring out why Adam Geldman's
computer wouldn't connect to CompuServe. Geldman, 78, who escaped
the Holocaust as a teenager by walking from Poland to Russia, lives
in a subsidized home for the elderly in the South of Market area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think other people are happy to play'' dominoes and other
games with the after-school volunteers, said Geldman, a slender,
serious man with glasses and a thick shock of white hair. Technical
help is the only aid he needs, he said while waiting for Becirovic
and Kelly Cheng, 16, to finish working on his computer so he could
connect to the BBC's Web site and read the news in Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Becirovic and Cheng are part of a community service program
called YouthCares, a group that fosters relationships between
teenagers and senior citizens. Because YouthCares is part of the
International Institute of San Francisco, a nonprofit group that
helps immigrants and refugees, most of the teenagers and the
seniors in the program are originally from outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Technology was not a focus of YouthCares when the program
started two years ago, said Jason Felch, program director. But over
time, Felch realized that using the Internet could help seniors
reduce their isolation when YouthCares kids couldn't be there.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14.4 percent of Americans over age 55 use the Internet,
according to the government's 1998 count. People whose first
language is not English are even less likely to be online. In 1998,
a Georgia Institute of Technology survey showed that 92.2 percent
of Internet users listed English as their primary language.
</P>
<P>
   The kids involved are not necessarily computer experts. Although
Becirovic, a Bosnian refugee, is enrolled in Cisco University's
networking class and plans a technical career, most participants
have learned all they know about computers in regular high school
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we're providing is companionship,'' Felch said.
``The biggest enemy of a lot of the seniors is isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   Loneliness is even more common for immigrant seniors, some of
whom don't speak English.
</P>
<P>
   Online, seniors can keep up on news from their home countries,
get involved with discussion groups with senior citizens, and _
most popular of all _ e-mail friends and family. As the program
progresses, Felch hopes YouthCares can introduce more seniors to
more online services, such as ordering groceries.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail is the main reason neighborhood seniors show up at the
Technology and Information Empowerment Center in Chinatown, a small
computer lab downstairs from a souvenir shop. The center's
computers were donated by Microsoft, and YouthCares members provide
help.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday afternoon, Lam Shuk Kwan, 67, sat at a terminal at
the TIE Center, painstakingly entering Chinese characters in a
Hotmail e-mail message she would send to her youngest son. Next to
her mouse pad lay a printout of a photograph her son had e-mailed
her while on a business trip to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan started visiting the TIE Center more than a year ago,
because although her home had several computers _ belonging to her
children and grandchildren _ she didn't know how to turn one on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to open my eyes and send e-mail to my friends in
Vancouver, and to my sons and daughters,'' Kwan said. Now she has
her own computer at home, but she still drops into the TIE Center
to learn more and to help others learn.
</P>
<P>
   At retirement homes, the senior citizens YouthCares works with
come from a variety of countries, but because of the TIE Center's
Chinatown location, the language of instruction is usually
Cantonese, which is spoken in Southern China. As many as seven
YouthCares volunteers show up at the TIE Center each Tuesday, but
only a few speak Cantonese.
</P>
<P>
   That means students from Southern China and Hong Kong, like
Cheng, end up shuttling between computers, helping translate for
other YouthCares members. It also means that experienced seniors
like Kwan take the knowledge they've learned to help others out.
</P>
<P>
   The TIE Center also offers basic computing and Internet classes
taught in Cantonese, for about $90 a course. These are administered
by Self Help for the Elderly, the 34-year-old Chinatown nonprofit
group that runs the center.
</P>
<P>
   A class on online investing, including a speaker from discount
brokerage Charles Schwab, is being considered for this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But not all seniors can get to the center, and only a handful
that YouthCares visits in their apartments have their own
computers. To introduce the benefits of computing to more seniors,
YouthCares hopes to set up labs like the TIE Center, with donated
computers, in the common areas of the residences and community
centers it visits.
</P>
<P>
   So far, YouthCares has set up three used computers _ donated by
the International Institute _ at O'Farrell Towers, one of the
retirement homes the program visits.
</P>
<P>
   Playing games, grocery shopping and computer instruction _ all
YouthCares activities are useful in themselves, but the main goal
is to get the seniors and teens together so they can build
relationships, Felch said. The seniors in the program often find
themselves on the teaching end, telling the kids their life stories
and passing on skills they've accrued over the years.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a chance for computer-savvy high school students to
share their know-how with senior citizens, who are less likely to
be connected than any other demographic group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are something the younger people can teach the older
people,'' Felch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the seniors are kind of in the beginning,'' Becirovic
said. ``They need to know how to open programs, save and send
e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria C.S. Diaz, a small, vivacious woman who immigrated from
Mexico when she was in her 20s, just wanted to learn how to type on
a computer. She has written dozens of poems and autobiographical
essays over the years, and she wants to preserve them for posterity
and for her descendants _ on floppy disks.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, Farahna Davis, a Lincoln High School sophomore
from South Africa, has been visiting Diaz in her two-room apartment
in a SOMA home for seniors. She has patiently helped Diaz learn to
type, save and print her work using Microsoft Word. Now, Davis is
coaching Diaz through the spell-checking process.
</P>
<P>
   Each has gained something in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Davis moved to the United States 21/2 years ago and has since
lived in three different cities with her parents. She never knew
her grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's (Diaz) made a difference in my life,'' said Davis, 16.
``She's more like my grandma now. The way she talks, I realize that
there's so much more to life. She's just opened me more.''

 GAP MEETS IN RURAL TENNESSEE, AVOIDS USUAL PROTESTERS  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT

<TEXT>
<P>
   GALLATIN, Tenn. _ For the first time in years, Gap Inc.'s annual
shareholder's meeting wasn't disrupted by rabble-rousing
demonstrators protesting the company's alleged use of sweatshop
labor or the logging of redwood forests by its founding family, the
Fishers.
</P>

   Not coincidentally, the meeting was held in rural Tennessee, 23
miles outside of Nashville, in a newly built Gap distribution
center. Only a handful of shareholders showed up, and not a single
protester.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were (in San Francisco), we would certainly be there,
both inside and outside, since we do own shares,'' said Medea
Benjamin, founding director of Global Exchange, a San Francisco
anti-sweatshop group that has picketed the meeting in years past.
She said the trip to Tennessee wasn't worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   A Gap spokeswoman acknowledged that avoiding protesters was part
of the company's rationale for moving the meeting out of the Bay
Area for the first time. It also gave Gap President and Chief
Executive Officer Mickey Drexler and other high-level officials a
chance to tour the new distribution center, a highly automated
prototype for future facilities, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Gap may hold shareholder meetings in other
cities, said Frank Smith, vice president of Gap brand distribution.
``We have investors all over the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's meeting, Drexler uttered nary a word about the
company's recent problems, such as a first-quarter shortfall in
both sales and earnings, unexpected weakness at its Old Navy chain,
the loss of several key executives, above-plan inventory levels and
declining comparable-store sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see lots of growth opportunity'' both in the United States
and abroad, he said, noting that the company's Gap, Old Navy and
Banana Republic chains already pocket 5 cents out of every U.S.
dollar spent on apparel.
</P>
<P>
   While many companies' shareholder meetings tend to be
rubber-stamping exercises, Gap's was an extreme example. A
preselected company representative responded to all of the motions.
Not a hand was raised during a scheduled question-and-answer
period. (Reporters were not allowed to ask questions.) The entire
presentation, which included a slide show of happy Gap shoppers
around the world, took no more than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Two shareholders in attendance, Nashville residents Margaret and
Jim Massey, said they were impressed with the meeting. Jim Massey,
who runs an online music shop, said he is aware of Gap's recent
troubles, but he thinks the stock is a smart investment in the long
term because of its quality merchandise and the strength of its
brands.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Massey said she expects Gap to be one of a few strong
brands to survive a looming shakeout among Internet retailers.
(Drexler noted during the meeting that the Old Navy site went live
on Thursday, the last of the Gap chains to start selling
merchandise online.)
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is less optimistic. Gap stock, which closed at
$34.44 yesterday, has declined 6.4 percent since the company
announced on Wednesday that its first-quarter earnings may be lower
than analysts' expectations. The stock is 36 percent below its
52-week high of $53.75.
</P>
<P>
   Retail analyst Stacy Pak cut her first- and second-quarter
earnings estimates by 1 cent each, but she is maintaining her
``strong buy'' recommendation on the stock, which she upgraded from
``accumulate'' last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think investors want to own stock in companies they believe
can take market share, and Gap is clearly that company in this
(sector),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gap posted sales of $11.6 billion in fiscal 1999, a 29 percent
increase for the year, in while sales per square foot rose to $548
from 1998's $532. The company added 570 stores, bringing its total
to more than 3,000 in six countries. Gap's 1999 earnings,
meanwhile, jumped to $1.1 billion, a doubling in just two years.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Chief Financial Officer Heidi Kunz said in an interview
after the meeting that it is too early to know if first-quarter
2000 weakness resulted from a fundamental shift in consumer
preferences or stemmed more from onetime factors like the late
Easter and bad weather in the Northeast and Midwest. ``This is a
confusing time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gap will continue to tweak its businesses but is not taking any
unusual steps to address the recent sluggishness in sales, Kunz
said. ``In any month or quarter, there are lesson learned. This is
no different than any other quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gap marketers are studying ways to reduce marketing expenses as
a percentage of sales by doing more cross-promotions between
online, stores and catalog, she said. (Banana Republic is currently
the only Gap chain with a catalog.) As a result, marketing expenses
in 2000 may come in slightly below last year's level of 4 percent
of sales, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gap intends to open between 600 and 660 new locations in 2000,
including the first big rollout of GapBody stores and its first Old
Navy outlets, which open next month.
</P>
<P>
   To support that growth, the company plans to spend a record
amount _ $1.6 billion _ this year on buildings and other
infrastructure, including three new distribution centers like the
Gallatin prototype. Last year's capital spending totaled $1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The 720,000-square-foot Gallatin facility, which sorts clothing
that arrives from factories and then trucks orders to stores,
services 200 Gap locations and will process about 1 billion units
of clothing annually.
</P>
<P>
   The automated systems cut down on labor and increase the speed
and accuracy of filling stores' orders, thus minimizing
out-of-stock items, said Smith. He declined to quantify the
improvements, but said 95 percent of all the clothing that flows
through the facility is tracked solely by machine and does not
involve any hand-sorting.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution center's 1,300 employees are paid a starting
salary of $9 an hour and receive benefits, including stock options,
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Signs in the cafeteria provide a peek at how Gap instills
employees with its corporate philosophy. ``Do It Better Every
Day,'' exhorted one large banner hanging on the wall. ``Take the
Smart Risk,'' said another sign.

BAY STATE PRESSURED TO PRODUCE `BIG DIG' FINANCE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a two-pronged salvo with multibillion-dollar
implications, US highway officials and a powerful congressman
Monday moved independently to halt federal funding for the ``Big
Dig'' if Massachusetts fails to rapidly produce an adequate plan to
resolve the project's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Highway Administration set May 19 as the last day
the state will receive federal aid for the highway renovation
project in the absence of an acceptable plan to finish the $13.1
billion venture. The project is plagued by an overrun as large as
$2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprise initiative, Representative Frank R. Wolf, a
Virginia Republican who chairs the House panel that controls
highway spending, proposed cutting all federal dollars for the Big
Dig in the next fiscal year, starting Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves increased the urgency for the state Legislature and
Governor Paul Celluci to swiftly generate a bailout plan for the
financially strapped venture. A conference committee has been
working for several weeks to try to resolve differences between
competing state House and Senate plans. Cellucci must sign the
final product.
</P>
<P>
   Either spending freeze could substantially slow the pace of
construction, if not force managers to significantly scale back the
design of the Big Dig, the largest public works project in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Big Dig officials, though clearly stunned by Wolf's plan,
expressed optimism that they can avert a potentially devastating
interruption of federal support for the project. Congress has
approved $8.55 billion for the Big Dig, of which about $3.5 billion
remains to be spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take very seriously the concerns of Congress and federal
highway officials about the credibility of the project and the
project managers,'' said Joe Landolfi, spokesman for Big Dig chief
Andrew Natsios. ``We hope that the passage of an acceptable finance
plan, which we expect in the next week or so, will help to address
most of their concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Natsios said last week in Washington that he expected the state
House and Senate to produce a bill by May 19. And Alison Franklin,
a spokeswoman for Senate President Thomas Birmingham, said Monday
that the conference committee is poised to complete the bailout
plan ``in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Massachusetts leaders fail to reach agremeent on an
acceptable plan, the Big Dig could cushion the blow of a federal
freeze after May 19 by relying temporarily on state funds. Under
the freeze proposed by the Federal Highway Administration, in a
letter Monday to Natsios, the Big Dig could spend federal dollars
that have been earmarked for current contracts but could not tap
federal aid for additional work.
</P>
<P>
   The highway agency's vow to freeze Big Dig funding was contained
in a letter formally rejecting a bailout plan that Cellucci had
proposed in March. Reiterating steps the state must take to resolve
numerous inadequacies in Cellucci's plan, the letter states,
``Documentation that these actions have been completed must be
provided to the Federal Highway Administration by May 19, 2000, or
we will freeze'' spending.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's plan could be more drastic. By halting federal funding
for the project in fiscal 2001, Congress would take away about $325
million that it previously had authorized for the project. The
money would still flow to the state as part of the annual federal
transportation subsidy, but it could be used only for road and
highway projects other than the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the state is expected to receive about $500 million in
federal highway money in fiscal 2001, of which about $175 million
normally would be set aside for non-Big Dig work. But if Wolf's
initiative succeeds, all $500 million would be used for roadwork
other than the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, one of the Big Dig's harshest congressional critics,
portrayed his move as a way to protect ``the taxpayer from waste,
fraud and abuse.'' Citing a federal task force report last month
that accused former Big Dig managers of intentionally concealing
the massive overrun and US highway officials of failing to detect
the concealment, Wolf said his plan to halt federal funds ``puts
the Congress on record to make sure that we deal effectively with
the problem of cost overruns.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Morra, said of his plan: ``This is
not meant to be punitive. It's meant to keep the project's
manager's feet to the fire, and if they were to come up with a new
financial plan that covers the cost increases and ensures a solid
statewide highway program, then the funds can flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative John W. Olver of Massachusetts, the second most
senior Democrat on Wolf's committee, voted for the proposal to cut
off federal funding for the Big Dig in fiscal 2001. The vote came
during a hearing on a $15 billion transportation spending package
for the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing is essentially saying, `Hey, this is
serious,' '' Olver said of the Big Dig's financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the federal highway agency's ultimatum, which gives the
state less than two weeks to construct an acceptable plan, Olver
said, Wolf's provision offers a five-month window for action. ``If
five months from now, they have done nothing, and if this measure
were to survive the rest of the legislative process, then they
wouldn't be able to expend any federal money on the Big Dig,''
Olver said. ``But everybody hopes we will have a finance plan in
place by then.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation were
less receptive of Wolf's initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Withholding committed federal funds is not in the interest of
any taxpayer,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy. ``I am confident
that we will be successful in removing this harmful provision from
the final bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry vowed to use stalling tactics, if
necessary, to kill Wolf's measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``With construction over 60 percent complete and 98.6 percent of
the design already complete, any effort to freeze federal funding
at this point is short-sighted and fiscally irresponsible,'' Kerry
said.

 `LOVE BUG' SUSPECT SOUGHT _ DAMAGE NEARS $3 BILLION  &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The day after a seductive e-mail disguised as a
love letter devastated computer systems worldwide, authorities were
closing in on a suspected perpetrator, a 23-year-old man in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a half-dozen copycat viruses emerged as damage
estimates from the ``love-bug'' spree climbed to $2.81 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Using the nickname ``Spyder,'' the suspect used two e-mail
addresses hosted by a Manila Internet services provider, Supernet,
to send the self-replicating ``worm'' software to millions of
computer users, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The worm, an attachment carried by e-mail titled ``I LOVE YOU,''
was able to mail itself to everyone listed in a recipient's
Microsoft Outlook address book. A huge proportion of e-mail users
received the message on Wednesday and Thursday, and many of them
clicked the attachment _ spawning enough e-mail to clog servers at
corporations and government agencies in Europe, Asia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Supernet lets its users prepay for service using plastic cards
that work like phone cards, so there's no easy way to track them.
However, the suspect may have left traces in chat rooms and within
the message's computer code. CNN reported that the FBI is seeking a
search warrant from judges in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   A Supernet official said the company thinks the culprit is a
23-year-old man who lives in the Pandacan neighborhood of Manila,
according to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the FBI, the Philippine National Bureau of
Investigation, Interpol and the National Infrastructure Protection
Center were all working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Toby Ayre, a spokesman for Manila ISP Sky Internet, told CNN
that one aspect of the malicious code, which would search a
recipient's hard drive for saved passwords and e-mail them to an
account in the Philippines, was discovered and eradicated early in
the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just happy the second part didn't reach the world,'' Ayre
said. ``It would have been extremely pathetic with 40 million
people trying to change their passwords.''
</P>
<P>
   The actual computer code of the love bug and its mutations was
relatively simple and could have been written by a bright high
school student, experts said. The virus authors' real talents lie
in the ``social engineering'' aspect _ crafting messages that
appeal to the recipients' emotions and get them to click on the
malevolent attachment.
</P>
<P>
   New variants of the love bug ricocheted around the Internet on
Friday. The slyest was an e-mail with the heading ``Mother's Day
Order Confirmation,'' whose attachment appears to be an invoice for
a $326.92 purchase of diamonds. If opened, the attachment erases
Windows systems files, making a computer difficult or impossible to
start up. That's even worse than the original love bug, which
replaces graphics and music files, as well as e-mailing itself.
</P>
<P>
   That particular ruse, coming a week before Mother's Day, played
on consumer fears about e-commerce, said Risto Siilasmaa, chief
executive of Finnish antivirus firm F-Secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recipient would know they hadn't bought anything, but
would want to check to make sure their credit card hadn't been
used,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other variants cloaked themselves as antivirus measures. One was
an e-mail titled ``Danger Virus Warning'' that claimed the
attachment would give virus-fighting tips. Another, labeled ``Virus
ALERT!!!,'' appeared to come from antivirus firm Symantec Corp.
Other versions were labeled ``Susitikim'' (Lithuanian for ``let's
meet''), ``Luck,'' ``Brainstorm'' and ``fwd: Joke.''
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the new worms were less effective because computer
professionals had mobilized antivirus defenses on Thursday and most
users were cautious about opening attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a high-end kitchen equipment company got infected
yesterday by a message labeled ``Antivirus Help'' and unwittingly
mailed it out to all the chefs in the country, said Jo Lynne
Lockley, owner of the Chefs' Professional Agency, a San Francisco
search firm for chefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one's vicious _ it's out to fool people,'' said Lockley,
who had received one copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime there's a successful virus, we see a slew of
copycats,'' said Sal Viveros, director of McAfee, the antivirus
division of Santa Clara, Calif.'s Network Associates. ``People take
the existing one and change it slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Viveros had this advice for users: ``Be very wary of e-mail
attachments for the next few weeks. If you're not expecting a
document, be smart and delete that message. Don't double-click on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The original love letter has already cost $2.61 billion, largely
in lost work time, and the toll could reach $10 billion by next
week, said Samir Bhavnani, a research analyst at Computer Economics
in Carlsbad, Calif. He based the $2.61 billion figure on an
assumption that 45 million people received the e-mail and about
half of them experienced severe business delays. ``I call this
economic terrorism,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Siilasmaa suggested that users could prevent variations of the
love bug by turning off Windows scripting, the technology that
makes it possible to create simple scripts that manipulate Windows
applications. The company offers ``directions for dummies'' on how
to do this at its Web site, www.f-secure.com, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group said that
Microsoft should consider removing the feature itself.
</P>
<P>
   And in chat rooms and e-mails, a chorus of users claimed that
Microsoft should have accountability for the spread of the virus,
because it only attacked computers running Microsoft software.

   Affordable San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our group of seven women will travel to San Francisco next
month. Can you recommend any moderately priced hotels? _ Rachel
Witmer, Lake Oswego, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a number of moderately priced hotels in the city,
but remember that the 14 percent tax must be added to the rates
below.
</P>
<P>
   The Sam Wong Hotel, 615 Broadway, (415) 362-2999, fax (415)
362-1808, has 81 rooms, not far from Coit Tower, at the
Chinatown-North Beach border. After a recent renovation, the rooms
have florentine wall coverings and cherrywood furniture in a Ming
style. All have private bath and voice mail. Doubles from $119. On
the Web: www.swhotelsf.com.
</P>
<P>
   For a nicely furnished older hotel (the building dates from
1926) near Union Square, there is the Pickwick, 85 Fifth St; (415)
421-7500, fax (415) 243-8066. The 189 rooms are done in French
Provincial style and all have private bath. Standard doubles are
$99 to $189, depending on demand; discounts are often available
when booking in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Away from downtown, facing Golden Gate Park, you can try the
Stanyan Park Hotel, 750 Stanyan St., (415) 751-1000, fax (415)
668-5454. This 36-room hotel on the edge of Haight-Ashbury is in a
registered landmark building dating from 1905. The rooms have
period furniture, and some have pencil-post beds. All have private
bath. Doubles from $110; www.stanyanpark.com.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't mind accommodations with shared bath, you may want
to consider a bed-and-breakfast inn. The Casa Arguello, 225
Arguello Boulevard; telephone and fax (415) 752-9482, is in a large
1920s building where the Pacific Heights, Laurel Heights and
Richmond districts come together. It has four double rooms, two
with shared bath ($66) and two with private bath ($90 to $110), as
well as a large suite accommodating up to five ($135 for two
persons, $155 for three, $175 for four, $195 for five). Decor is a
mix of pastels, brass and some antiques;
www.sftravel.com/casarg.html.
</P>
<P>
   Small Ship, Big State
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am interested in small-ship cruises to Alaska. Can you give
me the names of companies offering such voyages? _ Janet Hitschler,
Commack, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have a number of choices. Cruise West, for example, has a
fleet of seven ships, ranging in passenger capacity from 52 to 102.
Its selection of sailings ranges from three-night trips through the
Alaskan fjords to a 15-night excursion that includes three nights
in the Denali Park Lodge. The trips have naturalists on board and
offer a good range of shore excursions. A three-night cruise on
Prince William Sound starts at $875 a person, double occupancy,
including all taxes, fees and port charges. The 15-night
cruise-land tour starts at $5,245. Call (800) 888-9378 for
brochures or visit www.cruisewest.com.
</P>
<P>
   Glacier Bay Tours and Cruises, with a fleet of four ships
carrying from 34 to 88 passengers, conducts typical port-to-port
cruises on the Inside Passage as well as cruises for the more
adventuresome, featuring sea kayaking and Zodiac excursions in
wilderness areas. The company also operates Glacier Bay Lodge, the
only hotel in Glacier Bay National Park. Prices start at $1,530 a
person, double occupancy, for a five-night cruise to $3,580 for
seven nights. Contact (800) 451-5952 or on the Web visit
www.glacierbaytours.com.
</P>
<P>
   American Safari Cruises uses vessels that carry 12 or 21
passengers, small enough to explore narrow inlets and bays. Because
of this more-intimate size, the rates are higher. An eight-night
cruise through the Inside Passage, from Juneau to Prince Rupert, or
the reverse, for $5,195 to $7,395 a person, double occupancy,
depending on cabin and date. These rates include all meals, shore
excursions, wines and drinks, taxes and port charges. In September,
a 10-night Inside Passage cruise will cost from $4,895 to $6,595.
Contact www. &QC; amsafari.com; (888) 862-8881.
</P>
<P>
   French Car Museums
</P>
<P>
   Q. We will be going to the French Grand Prix auto race at the
Magny-Cours track, near Nevers, in July and then plan to meander
through Burgundy, ending up in Nice. We will visit the Ligier
Museum of racing cars at the track and have already visited the car
museum near Mougins. Do you know of any other auto museums along
our route? _ Susan Sawyer, Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. There are a few along the way, as well as one that you may
want to make a detour for.
</P>
<P>
   Close to Vezelay in Burgundy is the Musee de Voitures des Chefs
d'Etat, in the Chateau de Montjalin in Sauvigny-le-Bois; (33-3)
86.34.46.42, fax (33-3) 86.31.66.83. This is a collection of 30
cars used by various heads of state from 1940 to 1965. Among them
are a 1939 Renault Vivistella (Marshal Petain), a Lincoln
Continental (President Kennedy), a 1959 Simca Presidence (Charles
de Gaulle) and a Pope-mobile used by Paul VI. Open daily May 1 to
Nov. 11; Admission: $4.25 at 7.1 francs to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   About three miles north of Beaune is another museum in a castle,
the Musee du Chateau de Savigny, in Savigny-les-Beaune. The
14th-century castle contains 200 motorcycles from 1903 to 1960 and
14 Abarth racing cars. Open daily; (33-3) 80.21.55.03. Admission:
$5.65.
</P>
<P>
   As you head farther south toward Nice, just north of Lyon is the
Musee Henri-Malartre, (33-4) 78.22.18.80, at the entrance to
Rochetaillee-sur-Saone. Old cars must have an affinity for castles,
because this collection of 140 cars and 40 motorcycles is in a
restored 15th-century chateau. There are 50 cars from before 1914,
and 18 were built in Lyon, an early car-manufacturing center.
There's another car here used by de Gaulle, and a Renault Espace
used by another frequent traveler, Pope John Paul II. It is open
daily. Admission: $5.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mulhouse is a considerable detour off your route, if
you can get there, you will find the Musee National de l'Automobile
_ Collection Schlumpf, the premier car collection in France and one
of the world's largest, with over 500 cars. Not all are on display
at one time, but the ones that are trace the history of motoring,
starting with an 1878 steam-driven Jacquot. The highlights are the
120 Bugattis, built in Molsheim. There are 120 racing, luxury and

 LEVI STRAUSS REVEALS SOME INNER SECRETS  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a rare filing with government regulators,
Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. put a financial face on some of the problems
that have dogged the blue-jean titan in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Profit at privately held Levi, which has eliminated 18,500 jobs
and closed 29 plants over the past several years, plummeted to $5.4
million in 1999 from $102.5 million in 1998. Revenue dipped to $5.1
billion from $6 billion during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's overarching problems described in the
documents _ including declining sales and increased competition
from the likes of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein _ aren't new. The
Chronicle reported in February that 1999 sales at the company,
which invented blue jeans during the Gold Rush, had dropped for the
third year in a row and that it didn't expect sales to rebound
until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's filing offered an uncommon look at the
147-year-old company's financial performance. Owned by the Haas
family of San Francisco, Levi is not required to disclose financial
figures to the public, although it has traditionally released
annual sales figures. This is the first time the company has
submitted a financial report to the agency since 1986, the SEC
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new details were required for the company to register $800
million in bonds the company sold privately to investors several
years ago. The move will permit the investors to sell the notes to
the public after the SEC clears the registration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us the opportunity to raise more money in the
investment bond market later on,'' Levi chief executive Philip
Marineau said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Marineau said Levi will begin filing quarterly reports including
sales and income figures, though he said the company has no plans
to offer its shares to the public.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter of 2000, the company reported income of
$65.2 million on sales of $1.1 billion, compared with the year-ago
quarter that showed a loss of $237 million on sales of $1.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The filing also described Levi's decision not to go through with
$344 million in employee bonuses after its forecasts showed that it
won't meet required financial goals for the awards to be made.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus program was initially projected to pay out as much as
$758 million, when it was formulated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1999, the company lowered its estimate of financial
performance through the year 2001 and determined that payment'' of
the bonus ``in 2002 is highly unlikely,'' Levi Strauss said in the
SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Strauss disclosed that cash flow declined to $295 million
in fiscal 1999, from $479 million in 1998 and as much as $861
million in 1996. Cash flow, which is defined as earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain other
items, is an important indicator of the company's ability to
service its debt.
</P>
<P>
   The company's long-term debt totaled $2.4 billion on Nov. 28,
1999, according to the SEC filing. Interest expense rose to $183
million in fiscal 1999 from $178 million in fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Levi's has been losing market share for many years due to lack
of innovation in its product cycle and over-distribution of the
product,'' said Todd Slater, an analyst at Lazard Freres &AMP; Co. LLC.
``I don't think they will ever be able to regain their leadership
position in the premium categories'' of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall picture painted by the documents portrays a
concern in trouble, Marineau emphasized that the layoffs and plant
closings are over and the company is making progress in rebuilding
relationships with retailers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect to turn sales around for some time, but we
have a strong fall sales line ... and our business performance is
improving.''

ADVERTISING: STUDY SAYS MARKETERS ARE BECOMING DEVOTEES OF
CYBERSPACE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Please note that the word AT within parentheses has been
used in the 2nd graf instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to many newspaper systems.) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study to be released Tuesday morning by the leading trade
organization for national advertisers indicates that its members _
typifying the traditional marketers considered laggards in moving
onto the Internet _ are increasingly becoming devotees of
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth edition of the study, called ``Web Site Management
and Internet Advertising Trends,'' will be presented at the annual
(AT)d:tech Conference in San Francisco. Previous studies concluded
that the members of the organization, the Association of National
Advertisers, had been uncertain about the potential benefits of the
Web as a medium for advertising and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But those qualms seem to be fading about as fast as the ``I Love
You'' virus spread last week, according to the study, which was
divided into separate surveys about online advertising and Web site
management.
</P>
<P>
   The top managers of bricks-and-mortar companies ``would have to
be nuts not to notice this is a high-potential area,'' said Robin
Webster, executive vice president at the association, which is
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I'm talking to these people on a daily basis, I can
really feel this moving along,'' she added. ``The trends change so
quickly, I'd field this study every six months if I had the
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster, who is to outline the results of the study at the
conference, spoke about the findings in a telephone interview last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason advertisers are turning to this medium is because
it's different from the others,'' Webster said, citing ``the
involvement consumers have with the Internet'' and ``the ability to
have two-way communications.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of association members advertising online in 1999
rose to 64 percent, the study reported, from 61 percent in the
study covering the year 1998. At the same time, spending levels
increased much more significantly, almost tripling to $1.94
million, as the number of sites built per company rose 41.9
percent, to an average of 6.1 from an average of 4.3.
</P>
<P>
   One finding that Webster said she found surprising, labeling it
an ``aha,'' was a shift in the rankings of responses on corporate
objectives for building Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Though the primary reasons for companies to spend on Web sites
remained providing product and service information (No. 1) and
increasing brand and corporate awareness (No. 2), those reasons
declined in importance by large percentages. Two other reasons
climbed up that chart, also by large percentages: using the
Internet to develop and improve brand loyalty and providing
customer service.
</P>
<P>
   ``That shows an increased appreciation in the value of a
long-term customer,'' Webster said, adding that customers can be
wooed through means like sponsored e-mail, co-marketing alliances
and other communications methods.
</P>
<P>
   There was another finding in the study that Webster called ``an
`aha,' but not a particularly good `aha''': Though most respondents
said they expected to spend more on Internet marketing in 2000,
they were troubled by several new problems related to online
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   One such difficulty, according to the study, was a belief that
the formats of online ads like banners do not provide enough
impact. Another qualm centered on what the respondents considered
to be the low ``click-through'' rates for most online ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is troubling,'' Webster said. ``It's something agencies
need to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was mailed to association members in January and
February with final responses _ 208 surveys from 114 companies _
returned in March.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the respondents to the study ``are more
traditional advertisers rather than dot-coms'' should not
significantly change the findings, Webster said, in that it is
predominantly dot-coms that have been suffering in the wake of
financial and stock market gyrations since March.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bottom lines'' of the bricks-and-mortar marketers ``are
still healthy, which they are,'' she added, ``I see no reasons why
the spending trends should slow.''

exceptions. I did hold  &UR; Paul McCartney &LR;  in high esteem because of
the way that he conducted his relationship. I have those kind of
old-fashioned family values. And that has infuriated, to the point

that once you've thrown a TV through a hotel-room window, that's
you for life.''

elderly businessmen in suits; they're young dot-commers with bank

 &HT;    Twenty years since Skyway bridge collapse
 &HT;    By Howie Paul Hartnett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every May 9, Wesley MacIntire would rouse his wife out of bed
and take her to the fishing pier overlooking the Sunshine Skyway
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   There, a safe distance from the span linking St. Petersburg and
Manatee County, the retired trucker would silently follow the
headlights of commuters or warily watch a barge approach the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Then, somewhere around 7:30 it would happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-to-Miami Greyhound bus would rumble by, taking
MacIntire back to that day in 1980 when the green and black metal
grating atop the bridge gave way, sending him to the bottom of
Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago today, in a blinding rain storm, the phosphate
freighter Summit Venture plowed into a main pillar of the Skyway's
southbound span, causing more than 1,400 feet of the bridge to
cascade 150 feet into the water below.
</P>
<P>
   Seven vehicles and a Greyhound bus fell off the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five people died.
</P>
<P>
   And one survived.
</P>
<P>
   Every year after, until his death from prostate cancer in 1989,
MacIntire and his wife, Betty, made the pilgrimage from their home
just miles away to the foot of the bridge to wait for the
Greyhound.
</P>
<P>
   Bay area residents remember the crash. MacIntire remembered the
victims _ including Tuskegee University students Sharon Elaine
Dixon, Yvonne Johnson and Dwayne P. Adderly heading home to Miami
on the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Or John and Doris Carlson of Pinellas Park.
</P>
<P>
   Or Horace V. Lemmons of Kings Mountain, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   They were colleagues to MacIntire.
</P>
<P>
   But the names came and quickly went in the media _ lost amid the
stories of concern about the landmark's future.
</P>
<P>
   Birth of a landmark
</P>
<P>
   The first Skyway bridge opened in 1954 as an alternative to the
Bee Line Ferry and the more lengthy route through Tampa, U.S. 41.
The 4-mile span named by the winner of a local Jaycees contest cut
the distance between St. Petersburg and the next largest city along
the coast, Bradenton, almost in half.
</P>
<P>
   The two-lane concrete bridge, with its steel truss system at the
center, quickly became a popular symbol of the area and the
preferred path for commuters and truckers.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, state Department of Transportation officials
agreed another two-lane span was needed to handle the traffic flow.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1971, the new bridge mirrored its predecessor, but
repairs were common.
</P>
<P>
   Treacherous currents in the bay led ships to hit each other and
the bridge over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Until May 9, however, no one had died on the bridge from a ship
collision.
</P>
<P>
   'The Skyway bridge is down'
</P>
<P>
   Not a day goes by that former harbor pilot John E. Lerro doesn't
think about the 35 lives that ended because he guessed wrong.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran pilot with hundreds of successful navigations under
his belt, Lerro was at the helm of the empty freighter when it
encountered an unexpected squall just south of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   With the radar out and visibility near zero, Lerro said in court
hearings, he thought he saw a course buoy. Believing he was on
track, he pushed the 609-foot-long freighter forward.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he felt the collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayday, Mayday, Mayday, Coast Guard, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday,''
Lerro said into the radio. ``This is an ... emergency. All
emergency equipment onto the Skyway bridge. A vessel just hit the
Skyway Bridge. The Skyway Bridge is down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lerro's voice remained relatively calm even until vehicles
started tumbling from the sky. Then he started screaming: ``Stop
the traffic on that Skyway bridge!''
</P>
<P>
   'It was a nightmare'
</P>
<P>
   Working in the kitchen after getting her husband off to work,
Betty MacIntire was half listening to her stereo when the first
radio bulletin came over.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the southbound span and I said, 'Oh, God,''' she
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   Retired from trucking after 35 years, Wesley, a World War II
POW, had taken a job inspecting vehicles at the Tropicana plant in
Bradenton _ about 20 miles south of the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up immediately and called work,'' Betty said. ``He
hadn't gotten there.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the wind and the rain, Wesley MacIntire, 56 at the time,
didn't know the bridge was out until he crested the top of the
bridge and saw the words Summit Venture.
</P>
<P>
   He thought, ``Huh, now I'm gone,'' he later told his wife.
</P>
<P>
   He slammed on the brakes, but his light blue Ford Courier pickup
skidded off the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley vainly pumped the brakes for 15 stories until his truck
hit the side of the freighter and sank.
</P>
<P>
   Knocked out by the collision with the ship, Wesley awoke to find
his headlights still on and bubbles ebbing upward.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his window and started kicking up, taking two gulps of
saltwater before reaching the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The shock and saltwater were about to sink Wesley again when he
spotted a piece of the bridge floating nearby. He clung to it until
Summit Venture crewmen picked him up.
</P>
<P>
   Wesley suffered a deep cut on his head, a sprained neck, some
bumps and bruises and a sore right foot from the brakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went crazy waiting and waiting and waiting,'' Betty
said. ``This happened at 7:30 in the morning. I didn't hear until
12:10 p.m. that they had a survivor. It was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   When Betty met him in the hospital, Wesley said, ``I made it
again because I hit my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a lot of accidents with the (tractor trailer),'' Betty
explained. ``We always kidded that if he hit his head, he
survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Other nightmares
</P>
<P>
   Investigators determined the accident was a combination of
unexpected severe weather, failure of the National Weather Service
to issue a severe weather warning and failure of the pilot to
abandon the trip after the radar and visibility dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Lerro spent nearly a year trying to clear his name and restore
his pilot's license. But just as he got it back, Lerro gave up his
license again. He had multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   Lerro bounced around after his diagnosis, teaching at a New York
maritime college for a while before returning to the Tampa area.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a master's degree in counseling at the University of
South Florida. When he last spoke to reporters during the Skyway's
10th anniversary, Lerro said he had begun to forgive himself.
</P>
<P>
   He could not be contacted for comment for this anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath
</P>
<P>
   Like most residents around the bay, the DOT tried to move on
from the tragedy with the construction of a new bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by then-Gov. Bob Graham, the new span is a
steel-cable suspension bridge with two travel lanes and two
emergency lanes in each direction.
</P>
<P>
   The top of the bridge is about 50 feet taller than the
originals, but the lower grade gives drivers a more gradual ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the improved security around the bridge pillars are 36
anchored bumpers. These ``dolphins'' can withstand the impact of an
87,000-ton vessel traveling at 10 knots. The Summit Venture was
34,500 tons traveling at 8 knots.
</P>
<P>
   The travel lane beneath the bridge also was widened from 800
feet to 1,200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   And electronic message boards alert drivers to adverse
conditions at the start of the bridge and before their ascent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have decided to do is install additional cameras on
the Skyway that are wired to the Highway Patrol,'' DOT spokeswoman
Marian Pscion said. ``And within a few months, we're going to have
Highway Patrol on the Skyway 24 hours a day, seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Total cost of the concrete and canary-yellow cabled bridge was
more than $244 million. It opened April 30, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   One day prior, Wesley MacIntire and his wife got a special tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first ones to go over the new bridge,'' Betty
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the MacIntires were given one more honor. They were the
last to drive over the old bridge. After they started up the old
span, workers blocked the way to prepare for its demolition.
</P>
<P>
   At the top, Wesley stopped the car and took one last look at the
bay.
</P>
<P>
   Then he reached into his car, pulled out 35 white carnations and
dropped them in the water.

ON LONGER STAYS, ALL-SUITE HOTELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)   (For release Sun., May 14)  
 By ROGER COLLIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Many hotels claim to be a home away from home. But however warm
the welcome, hotel life can pall pretty quickly. It's great to be
pampered and waited on, with that fine concierge and a host of
bustling bellboys. But sometimes more privacy and independence is
preferable, as is being able to stock your own refrigerator. When
you're tired of room service and restaurants, wouldn't it be nice
to fix a chicken salad just the way you like it?
</P>
<P>
   A studio or one-bedroom apartment in a custom-built property may
have twice the space for as little as half the cost of a standard
double room in a hotel of the same quality. Apartments in the
United States and abroad range from converted town houses to modern
``aparthotels.'' There are often charming properties available in
the center of such cities as London and Paris. They typically have
grand ground- and first-floor apartments with high corniced
ceilings, with smaller, cozier accommodations above. These tend to
be smaller properties with eight to 10 apartments, compared with 40
to 100 in a newer building.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most attractive properties are hard to find because
they typically don't advertise. Travel agents are becoming better
versed as demand for these accommodations grows, but are often not
familiar with the available apartments. Leisure travelers usually
stay two weeks or less while business travelers mostly account for
longer stays.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the best way to get information, with pictures,
maps and descriptions of facilities. Bookings can be made or
requested online. A good site is that of Worldwide Apartments, at
www.nothotels.com, (44-20) 7704 5040, which allows you to view and
book 300,000 apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apartments are a fast-growing sector of the lodging
industry,'' says Charles McCrow, managing director of the Apartment
Service, in London, which has one of the best guides, the Worldwide
Guide to Serviced Apartments; (44-20) 8944 1444,
www.apartmentservice.com. ``We call them serviced apartments,
apart-hotels or apartment suites; in the United States, where the
concept began, they're called all-suite hotels or extended-stay
hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   Travelers should be wary, he said, of hotels with apartments
attached. Those quite often charge the same prices as they do for
regular suites, so guests pay for hotel services even if they
aren't using them.
</P>
<P>
   Extra space begins to matter when you're constantly on the road
or in one place for more than a few days. Apartments are an option
that makes sense for two couples traveling together, or a family.
Such accommodations range from studios to one-to-three-bedroom
apartments with a lounge and en suite bathrooms. Most have
direct-line phone and fax, cable or satellite TV. The kitchen is
usually equipped with a toaster oven and microwave, refrigerator
and freezer, perhaps a dishwasher, and pots, pans and dishes. Maid
service is usually once a week; you pay extra for daily cleaning.
Towels are changed at least once a week. Most apartments have a
24-hour reception desk. And you may get a free grocery shopping
service.
</P>
<P>
   When booking, guests should ask about advance payment, deposits
and cancellation penalties: there is normally no charge if you give
four weeks' notice on a long-term rental. It is also wise to check
on telephone and fax charges. They may not be cheaper than
exorbitant hotel rates. But free access to phone card calls should
be offered.
</P>
<P>
   Extended-stay hotels are enjoying a boom in the United States,
with around 20 companies offering a range of apartments _ from
hotel suites to long-stay residential properties. Extended Stay
America, www.extstay.com, with more than 200 properties, is a
lower-priced, fewer-frills alternative to Residence Inn by
Marriott, www.residenceinn.com, which pioneered the idea in the
early 1990s. Homestead Village, www.stayhsd.com, plans to build
between 40 and 50 properties a year for the next three years. And
Villager Lodge, www.villager.com, (800) 328-7829, a budget brand
with weekly rates from $175 to $250, has about 125 properties now,
and has just launched a new line called Premier, with rates of $250
to $375 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn, which opened its first
extended-stay hotel in Alpharetta, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, in
December 1998, now has 15 properties with another 25 under
construction _ 23 in the U.S., and one each in Toronto and in Sao
Paulo. By 2001, the company expects to have 60 to 70 properties.
</P>
<P>
   Staybridge Suites, at www.staybridge.com, (800) 238-8000, is a
kind of hybrid between a hotel and an apartment. There are two
public areas, one with two computers for the use of guests (free);
a fitness area; full front-desk service; a convenience store; and
free laundry facilities. Prices depend on length of stay, season
and location. Studios range from $89 to $109 for one to four nights
to $59 to $89 a night for a stay of 15 to 30 days; two-bedroom
two-bath suites range from $149 to $169 a night for one to four
nights to $119 to $139 for 15 to 30 nights.
</P>
<P>
   The major apartment chain in Europe is a French company,
Citadines Apart'hotels, www.citadines.com, (33-1) 41.05.79.05,
recently acquired by Houston-based Westmont Hospitality, with 49
three- and four-star properties in cities including Paris,
Marseille, Montpellier, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Lyons, Nice, London,
Brussels and Barcelona. Some, but not all, are new or recently
renovated. (The older ones tend to have more charm.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very flexible _ you can stay for one night or one
month,'' says Jan Dijksstra, development manager for Westmont in
London. ``People who stay with us tend to be younger business
travelers who know the city fairly well, and like to organize
themselves.'' Guests have their own phone line, sometimes with
voice mail; business services such as fax, e-mail and often
conference rooms are available. A studio for two at Paris Maine
Montparnasse is $105 a night ($95 a night for seven nights).
</P>
<P>
   Central Apartments, at www.central-apartments.com, (44-20) 7608
9111, is a new chain with four luxury properties in central London.
``Designer'' studios and two-bedroom apartments ($150 to $275 a
night) have pine floors and furniture and stainless-steel kitchen
equipment. Circus Apartments, (44-20) 7719 7000, in Canary Wharf,
which is set to open July 1, is a luxury property with 49
apartments $75 to $115 a night cheaper than neighboring five-star
hotels such as the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   If you're chained to the desk in London waiting for Tokyo or
Hong Kong to open or you're planning a crucial tete a tete dinner,
Room Service Deliveries, (44-20) 7431 5555,
(www.roomservice.co.uk), will deliver meals from more than 150
restaurants for a $6 delivery charge. Their mobile bars offer
reasonably priced wines _ cheaper than at a restaurant but more
expensive than at a supermarket. Food is delivered piping hot in
green ``butler bags'' by a fleet of bow-tied drivers.

YOUNG &AMP; RUBICAM POPULARIZED THE MADISON AVENUE IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Sidebar with AD-AGENCY-MERGER) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The agreement by Young &AMP; Rubicam in New York to be
acquired by the WPP Group in London ends the independent life of
one of the most influential, best-known mainstream Madison Avenue
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Y&AMP;R is one of the few agencies actually on Madison
Avenue, at 285, between 40th and 41st Streets. That building has
been home to the agency since 1928.
</P>
<P>
   It was Y&AMP;R along with rivals like J. Walter Thompson; Batten,
Barton, Durstine &AMP; Osborn; Lord &AMP; Thomas; and McCann-Erickson that
helped create an image of Madison Avenue in the minds of Americans
as the home of slick specialists in a newfangled industry who tried
everything from slick slogans to earnest demonstrations to catchy
jingles to sell products with emotional as well as rational
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R was the agency that convinced consumers to sing as they
spelled out the letters ``J-E-L-L-O''; tickled funny bones with a
unconventional campaign for Piels beer featuring animated pitchmen
named Bert and Harry; convinced donors on behalf of the United
Negro College Fund that ``a mind is a terrible thing to waste'';
presented headaches by the numbers _ the tax audit, No. 1040, natch
_ for Excedrin pain reliever; rocked the New York City of the late
1960s by urging citizens to ``give a damn'' and help the Urban
Coalition; exhorted the thirsty to ``be a Pepper'' for Dr Pepper
soda; and inspired fliers to think, however briefly, of Eastern
Airlines as ``the wings of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam was a pioneer in the media of radio and
television in the days when agencies created programs for their
clients and then produced them for the networks. The comedian Jack
Benny became identified with Jell-O when Y&AMP;R brought him together
with General Foods; not long after its debut in October 1934, ``The
Jack Benny Program'' became a top-rated radio show _ and Jell-O the
best-selling gelatin dessert, a standing it has maintained to this
day.
</P>
<P>
   Other performers who came into American homes with Young &AMP;
Rubicam clients as sponsors included Arthur Godfrey, Kate Smith,
George Burns and Gracie Allen, Ronald Reagan (for ``GE Theater'')
and Fanny Brice. Series developed under the aegis of Y&AMP;R included
ratings winners like ``The Aldrich Family,'' ``The Goldbergs,''
``Schlitz Playhouse of Stars,'' ``American Bandstand'' and ``Alfred
Hitchcock Presents.''
</P>
<P>
   General Foods, now part of the Kraft Foods unit of Philip
Morris, was one of the first important clients for Y&AMP;R, which was
founded in Philadelphia in 1923 by two former employees of the NW
Ayer agency there, Raymond Rubicam and John Orr Young.
</P>
<P>
   Rubicam and Young, both copywriters, began their agency with a
$5,000 investment and one client, according to the trade
publication Advertising Age, a company that published leaflets with
instructions for making shoelaces at home. The Postum Co., a
General Foods predecessor, hired the fledgling shop in its first
year of business; in 1926, Y&AMP;R relocated to New York when Postum
agreed to award the agency the Jell-O dessert account on condition
that it move.
</P>
<P>
   As Y&AMP;R flourished with the explosive growth of radio, then
television, top management plowed profits into expansion. It formed
the first ad agency research department, opened offices in Chicago,
Hollywood, Montreal and Toronto and expanded into Europe as early
as 1943 with an office in London.
</P>
<P>
   Other firsts achieved by Y&AMP;R, according to Advertising Age,
included the first color television commercial in 1951, for Jell-O
pudding and pie filling; and the first demonstration commercial in
1954, showing a Remington razor shaving a peach. &QL;

   What's it like to use sexual energy to achieve higher
consciousness? ``We're the ultimate Tantric couple,'' says
 &UR; Oceana &LR; , in an interview with the Australian magazine Good Weekend.
``We're very passionate with each other: Our sexual chemistry is
mesmerizing.  &UR; Icarus &LR;  is very romantic. ... He's very supportive.
I'm a bit on the health-nut side. Just recently, I did a 10-day
juice fast. And he would never choose to do that, but he did it
with me. And he hates washing the juicer.''
</P>
<P>
   _ What's it like to be  &UR; Pete Townshend &LR; ? ``I always wanted there
to be a kind of  &UR; Paul Newman &LR;  and  &UR; Joanne Woodward &LR;  story,'' he
told Rolling Stone magazine, ``but they're one of the great
exceptions. I did hold  &UR; Paul McCartney &LR;  in high esteem because of
the way that he conducted his relationship. I have those kind of
old-fashioned family values. And that has infuriated, to the point
of hysteria, certain American rock critics and musicians, who think
that once you've thrown a TV through a hotel-room window, that's
you for life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ What's it like to live with  &UR; Kim Basinger &LR; ? ``Her emotions are
endlessly volatile,'' says a Vanity Fair profile forwarded by
 &UR; Mark Sloan &LR; . Sometimes  &UR; Alec Baldwin &LR; , her husband, will awake to
find her ``sitting with a fist in her mouth and a look of horror on
her face, tears streaming down her cheeks as she watches the
television news: `Alec, we've just got to do something about the
Albanian refugees!'''
</P>
<P>
   _ What's it like to visit the Hoosiers?  &UR; Roberto Gonzalez &LR; , just
back from Indiana, saw side-by-side billboards in Muncie: (Left)
``I will wait for sex!'' (Right) ``Enjoy Indiana.com.''
</P>
<P>
   _ What's it like to date a millionaire? This month's Elle
magazine follows in the footsteps of last month's Harper's Bazaar,
with a story that could be right out of  &UR; Peter Arno &LR; 's '30s
cartoons on gold-digging chorus girls. In 2000, the marks aren't
elderly businessmen in suits; they're young dot-commers with bank
accounts.  &UR; Deanna Kizis &LR; , who dated five new millionaires,
concluded that they are all geeky, techno-spouting and
self-absorbed. Is this different from stereotyping women as bimbos?

<P>
   NEW YORK _ To watch Juan A. Figueroa sit in his Manhattan office
and describe his favorite family vacation spot, where, for years,
he brought his wife, Helen, and their daughter, Taina, is to see
the sparkle of paradisaical sun on surf in his eyes:
</P>
<P>
   ``It offers Puerto Rico without the pollution, development and
the McDonald's,'' he says rhapsodically. ``It is so serene and
beautiful, tropical and green. There are scarcely 100 hotel rooms
on the whole island. And the bioluminescent bay!
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about the Seven Wonders of the World, man! You go at
night, tap your hand on the side of the boat, and the fish streak
by, lighting up the plankton. People can jump in and go swimming,
wrapped around an aura of light.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, every once in a while, you'd hear thud!''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the island of Vieques, Puerto Rico: lovely refuge for
tourists, ideal practice range for Navy bombers.
</P>
<P>
   As president and general counsel of the Puerto Rican Legal
Defense and Education Fund in New York, Figueroa has been a leader
in organizing much of the mainland Latino response to the Navy's
use of Vieques to train its pilots about the finer points of aerial
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   He has been a frequent commentator on the subject, and the point
man on letters to President Clinton that have also been signed by
the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Latino leaders and politicians. And he
was the connective tissue for a Times Square rally last Friday, the
day after federal agents removed 200 demonstrators from the
military range.
</P>
<P>
   Next up: an environmental lawsuit against the Navy, now under
discussion by several groups, over the damage they say has been
wrought by more than 50 years of bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa heats his rhetoric appropriately, but is careful to
keep within the boundaries of indignant discourse. His bite is
tempered with irony and affability. He is, essentially, a polite
person, a sweetheart, actually, raised not on the tough streets of
San Juan or New York but in the tobacco fields of Ciales, a
jewel-like Puerto Rican mountain town.
</P>
<P>
   The man even dreams of going to chef school.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa, 47, who has been a community organizer, an assistant
attorney general and a Connecticut state legislator, is also less a
rabble-rouser than a diplomatic, if forceful, negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   He finds his role as a legal rock-thrower _ for workers fired
for speaking Spanish, Puerto Rican political prisoners and New York
City's immigrant college students _ amusing. For Figueroa was
raised with conservative values and a pro-Washington outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up to believe that America was best,'' Figueroa
says, although he has just treat his visitor to his stump speech
about Vieques, featuring the United States as despotic colonizer.
``My grandfather would say, `The Spanish were bastards. Thank God
for the Americans!'''
</P>
<P>
   To earn money, Figueroa's father brought the family to the
mainland. Wary of city evils, he settled in Rockland County, in New
York, working as a baker. They eventually went home to Ciales, but
in the meantime, his son became bilingual, bicultural.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dream of every Puerto Rican at that time was to own his
own plot of land and a house of cement,'' recalls Figueroa, whose
family, for generations, had been tenant farmers. ``My parents
assumed I'd go to school here, but return to Puerto Rico.''
Twenty-five years later, he adds, abashed, ``we're still talking
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa attended Macalester College in St. Paul, Minn., which
had recruited minority students. ``They gave me a full
scholarship,'' he says, ``plus a plane ticket and a parka.''
</P>
<P>
   As a history major, his view of America lost its glow. He stayed
on in St. Paul to study organizing at a center dedicated to Saul
Alinsky, the sociologist. After marrying Helen, his college
sweetheart, who lobbies for comprehensive day care, Figueroa spent
two years in Nashua and Manchester, N.H., going door to door,
forming Latino groups around employment and educational issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the mills, there were pockets of Uruguayans and
Puerto Ricans,'' he recalls, ``and they could not be more
different.''
</P>
<P>
   After attending law school at Santa Clara University in
California, he moved to Hartford. Energetic, restless and
personable, Figueroa, who had pursued day care center abuse cases
for the attorney general's Office, started going door-to-door
again, in Hartford's gritty Third District, winning election to the
state assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He found his three terms, working within the system,
surprisingly rewarding. Figueroa helped defeat English Only
legislation and prevented deep cuts in the welfare budget. He did
little to endear himself to suburbia in pushing through bills to
help moderate-income families leave Hartford's poorer
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Since he joined the defense fund in 1993, his colleagues say,
Figueroa has significantly refocused the 28-year-old civil rights
organization. A telegenic master of the stinging sound bite, he has
raised the group's profile, expanding its work to include policy
research, a campaign urging Latinos to complete census forms, and
political advocacy, including for the clemency President Clinton
granted 16 imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists last year.
</P>
<P>
   As an issue, he is rather fond of Vieques. ``Who wants bombing
in their backyard?'' Figueroa says. ``It's not a complicated
question. And we can use it as a way of mainstreaming the message
of who we are. Last year it was Ricky Martin. Now it's Vieques that
has captured the public's attention. And it's not just someone
dancing around!''

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Thousands of protesters, including
rival militias, marched Monday on the compound of Foday Sankoh, the
rebel leader, some throwing rocks, and his partisans responded by
firing into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters were shot execution-style as they lay on
the ground, according to witnesses. Dozens of U.N. peacekeepers
assigned to the house watched helplessly, shouting, ``Cease fire!''
</P>
<P>
   At least four people died.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Freetown, rebels fired at a U.N. helicopter that had
flown with Sankoh's permission to the town of Makeni to get two
wounded U.N. soldiers. After taking off, the pilot was forced to
land and abandon the helicopter, said Lt. Col. Jaswinder Sandhu, a
U.N. spokesman. The United Nations has already been humiliated by
the taking of more than 500 of its personnel _ soldiers and
civilians _ as hostages around the country in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   The violence inside the capital underlined how badly the steps
toward peace have been wiped out since the arrival of the U.N.
force late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The day began as thousands gathered at a park to march against
Sankoh, whom many hold responsible for blocking the peace process
and some consider a war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people marched across the Freetown peninsula,
joined by some former soldiers and Kamajors, who are traditional
hunters, toward the house of Sankoh in western Freetown. Sankoh
lives in a two-story house inside a compound guarded by U.N.
peacekeepers and his own men.
</P>
<P>
   Around noon, the peacekeepers appeared overwhelmed by the crowd,
which pushed toward the compound and began hurling rocks and bricks
at the house. The peacekeepers, pinned against a fence, are
believed to have fired in the air. It was not clear what happened
next. But witnesses said Sankoh's own men began shooting at the
crowd and that, in turn, former government soldiers who were among
the protesters began firing at Sankoh's men.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who at the time remained inside his house and was not
injured, told the Associated Press after the clash: ``They're
provoking us. Democracy is not about assaulting people's homes.''
</P>
<P>
   The whereabouts of Sankoh was not clear on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I speak to you, the exact whereabouts of Corporal Foday
Sankoh has not yet been determined,'' President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah
said on national radio Monday night, using the rank that Sankoh had
reached in the Sierra Leone army before he was cashiered years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear on Monday night how many people were killed and
wounded outside Mr. Sankoh's home.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, at Connaught Hospital and an adjoining morgue,
officials had recorded four deaths and 40 wounded, mostly from
bullet wounds. At the hospital's operating room, Dr. Sabine
Roquefort, of Doctors Without Borders, was the only surgeon
working.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Sierra Leoneans filed through the morgue, searching
for friends and relatives who had yet to be found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sankoh was well protected, but the crowd was unprotected,''
said Mohammed Kallon, a member of Parliament who had helped
organize the march.
</P>
<P>
   The violence appeared to increase some Sierra Leoneans' anger at
the U.N. force, which has suffered a series of embarrassing
setbacks. Sierra Leoneans pelted some U.N. Nations trucks with
rocks on Monday after the incident outside Sankoh's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. forces have not responded as well as we had
expected,'' said Herbert Chuku, 30, who was taking part in the
march toward Sankoh's house. ``That's why we are expecting
countries like America, France and Great Britain to put an
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters criss-crossed the skies above the Freetown peninsula
all day, as foreigners, including almost all U.N. civilian
employees, continued to leave Sierra Leone. After its setbacks, the
U.N. force seemed focused on Monday night on defending western
Freetown, the headquarters of its operations.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 miles away in Port Loko, two camps where rebels
voluntarily put down their weapons were abandoned, said a Western
diplomat who flew over the area. It has become clear that many
rebels have taken up arms again, presumably with weapons stolen
from the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's troops are ``better stocked now,'' said the diplomat.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ By all accounts, this year's presidential race is
the fairest and most open Mexico has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the fate of a clean-vote television campaign aimed
at persuading voters to resist coercive polling tactics, like those
that have helped the governing party win every presidential
election since the 1920s. Government officials sat passively for
weeks as pro-government media executives blocked the commercials
from the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the only incident that raised concerns. Foreign
election observers, who will be traveling to Mexico to monitor the
voting, are facing delays in receiving visas. And lawmakers
monitoring campaign finance have been stymied.
</P>
<P>
   And since this is Mexico's first presidential election in which
an opposition candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada, has a credible chance
at victory, opposition leaders fear that the long-governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party may be quietly sabotaging
Mexico's costly, decade-long effort to level its electoral playing
field.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans are optimistic about the openness of the vote because
for the first time an autonomous agency, the Federal Elections
Institute, is in charge of the vote, and is lavishing $918 million
on the electoral process to prevent fraud and encourage equitable
competition.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jose Woldenberg, a former university professor who is president
of the electoral institute, makes a concise estimate of the
possibility of fraud in this year's ballot counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woldenberg is especially proud of new voting booths his agency
designed for the country's 112,500 polling stations. They are the
first Mexican booths to have a curtain so that onlookers cannot
watch a voter mark a ballot, he said in an interview. More
important, they are the first booths made to fit only one person.
</P>
<P>
   The new booths are part of sweeping electoral changes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996, federal elections were controlled by the Interior
Ministry, a political arm of the president. Reforms that year put
the elections institute, which was controlled by the Interior
Ministry, under the control of a nine-member council representing a
range of political groups. For this election, the institute has
selected 700,000 Mexicans, picked solely because they were born in
April, to serve as poll officials. It has also prepared a fast,
computerized system for reporting the balloting results, to be
broadcast on live television and posted on the Internet as returns
are reported on the night of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 reforms also set limits on private donations and
earmarked hundreds of millions of public money to pay for
campaigns. The governing party, whose candidate is Francisco
Labastida Ochoa, and two opposition coalitions, one backing Fox and
another supporting Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist former
Mexico City mayor, will each receive about $100 million this year
for their campaigns. The opposition parties, which were nearly shut
out of the broadcast media in the last presidential run in 1994,
have money to buy a blizzard of ads on television and radio,
enabling them to reach backlands voters for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   However, the agency is working to level the electoral playing
field in a nation where the governing party, known as the PRI, has
held a unique grip on the levers of power for much of a century. It
remains the only political group with an organized presence
virtually everywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, old habits die hard. The broadcast media, whose
news decisions until the early 1990s were often dictated by the
government, has devoted 37 percent of campaign news coverage to the
PRI while Fox's party has received only 27 percent, according to a
survey by the electoral institute.
</P>
<P>
   Only 32 percent of Fox's coverage has been positive, in contrast
to 44 percent for Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the election laws still have loopholes. For
instance, dozens of auditors scrutinizing the parties' books for
violations of campaign finance rules will not report their findings
until weeks after the election.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The laws are also vague in regulating efforts by political
parties to pressure voters. In Yucatan, the PRI mobilized brigades
to go house to house in contested districts making lists of voters'
names, according to Patricia McCarthy, a member of the elections
council in that state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't prove legally that it's coercion,'' McCarthy said.
``But in practice it is coercion in a state full of very poor
people. They say, `Look out, now the PRI has my name!' ''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo has by and large stayed above the
campaign. But problems like the block on the clean-vote TV campaign
and the visa delays experienced by the foreign election monitors
have raised suspicions among opposition leaders that his government
is working to restrain independent election monitoring in order to
help the PRI and Labastida, who was formerly interior minister,
Zedillo's chief political operator.

MAYBE WE ALL SHOULD BUY RABBIT EARS, JUST IN CASE

<P>
   I've puzzled over the celebrated hissing match between Time
Warner and Disney for the better part of a week now, but I still
don't think I'm getting the Big Picture.
</P>
<P>
   The fuss, in case you were off reading a book or communing with
nature last week, is over how much Disney charges Time Warner to
carry Disney's ABC stations. In a technicolor snit, Time Warner
yanked ABC off the air in seven cities. Disney retaliated by
offering to reimburse Time Warner customers if they switch to
satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the dispute is media conglomerate Disney's opposition
to media conglomerate Time Warner's merger with media conglomerate
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   I know we're all supposed to work up a good froth over the fact
that this big-money spat caused folks to miss ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' but _ frankly _ I'm having a hard time keeping my
eyes open.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, I'm boycotting Reeg until he walks over to the
set of ``Wheel of Fortune'' and buys a question mark from Vanna.
Criminy, if we're going to hand out a million bucks to brainy
people, let's straighten our ties, shine our shoes and punctuate
the name of our show properly, shall we?
</P>
<P>
   My ambivalence about this cable tug-of-war is also influenced by
the cable tug-of-war in my own home. My wife and I have a
good-natured, long-running disagreement over how much TV a person
ought to have in order to get along in life.
</P>
<P>
   I think that, for optimum viewing pleasure, the screen should be
at least twice as big as my stinky feet stretched out on the sofa.
She disagrees and vetoes all my plans to knock over a liquor store
or take out a second mortgage to buy a TV set of respectable, i.e.,
wall-engulfing, size.
</P>
<P>
   This standoff resulted in our movers openly mocking my manhood
when we moved into our new home a couple of years ago.
(ITAL)``That's(END ITAL) your TV?'' one of them asked, smirking at
his co-worker as they paused to squint at the tiny screen. ``Yeesh,
you must not watch much TV, fella.'' They laughed heartily, then
resumed their delicate work of dropping boxes and nicking
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. I don't watch much TV, which brings me to the main
point of contention between my wife and me. In order to improve the
odds of finding something interesting to watch, I believe we ought
to subscribe to the widest array of channels available _ the Silver
Gold Platinum Uranium Package, or whatever it's called _ even if it
requires a periodic liquor-store heist or second mortgage to pay
for it.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, however, believes I should read a book or commune with
nature instead of watching TV. Besides, she says, the money for
upgrading the TV would be better spent on, say, our little girl's
college-education fund. At this point in the discussion, I always
relent.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, I brought this problem on myself. I
unwittingly short-circuited my own efforts when the smirking movers
left and I took on my first home improvement project _ signing up
for cable.
</P>
<P>
   When I called our local provider, I was startled to learn that
the basic service offered far fewer channels at nearly double the
cost of what I was accustomed to paying. In a technicolor snit, I
went off and bought a satellite dish, had it installed, turned on
the tube and _ voila! _ discovered I couldn't get network channels
with my low-budget Wet, Flimsy Cardboard Package.
</P>
<P>
   So I went out and bought rabbit ears. If I position my stinky
feet just right, I can get two identifiable stations, plus another
one that seems to offer a lot of snowstorm coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to upgrade our satellite dish to the Uranium Package
and get the networks and all other channels I'd like to receive,
we'd have to pay even more than the cable bill. And I can't
convince my wife the dish would make a nice planter.
</P>
<P>
   So I watch a lot of documentaries on the channels we do get, I
read a little, and occasionally I go outside to stand next to my
satellite dish and commune with nature.
</P>
<P>
   In time, perhaps, all of this will make me smart enough to go on
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' and win big, heaping dishes of
money.
</P>
<P>
   Then we can upgrade. Provided, of course, that Time Warner and
Disney don't merge with more media conglomerates and decide to,
ahem, provide even better service at even better prices.
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 28, a California man who uses the handle ``golfpoorly''
put a half dozen items up for sale on eBay, the online auction
company. Along with an unopened roll of twine, a never inflated
basketball, a Mexican voodoo mask, a Netgear network card and a
pewter frame, he offered a ``great big wild abstract painting''
that he said was bought years ago at garage sale in Berkeley and
has a small hole inflicted by a son wielding a plastic tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   The opening bid for each of the items was a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday evening, after 93 offers, bidding for the painting _
which on a computer screen looks vaguely like a landscape swathed
in red, orange and a pinkish accent _ had soared to $135,605. The
run up was fueled by speculation that it may be a 1952 work by
Richard Diebenkorn, the late California painter known for his
sublime use of color in abstract and representational works.
</P>
<P>
   If the sale, which was set to end around 10 p.m. Eastern time,
goes through, it would be one of the highest prices paid online for
art. And, it would be powerful testimony to the ability of the
Internet to ignite a sales frenzy, even for expensive items that
may or may not be what people think they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still astonished that anyone would pay that much for
something they hadn't seen,'' said John Elderfield, the chief
curator at the Museum of Modern Art and an expert on Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   A real painting by Diebenkorn, who died in 1993, could be worth
millions. The record price at auction was set in November 1998,
when his 1959 painting ``Horizon: Ocean Park'' sold at Sotheby's
for $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay does not vouch for the authenticity of anything people
sell on its site. It considers the deals to be private
transactions. And for now at least no one knows for sure whether
``golfpoorly's'' painting is by Diebenkorn or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The palette is right, and the signature is right on,'' said
Will Ameringer, a New York dealer who has sold work by Diebenkorn.
``It's either a good fake or the real thing.'' Other experts
agreed, but they and Ameringer said they could not give definitive
opinions about its authenticity without seeing the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Which is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kaiser, a private art dealer in Medford, Ore., bid the
painting up to $128,600 on Sunday but then changed his mind. He
withdrew his offer after the seller, who, according to Kaiser, is a
lawyer who lives in the Sacramento area, refused to let him see the
painting. ``It made me suspicious when he would not let me see it
when I'm making the effort to drive five hours down there,'' said
Kaiser, who added that he ``buys a lot of art online.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfpoorly,'' responding to an e-mail message, declined to
comment, citing the advice of his lawyer, the possibility of theft
and tax consequences. He signed the message, ``Ken.'' The name
associated with the e-mail address is K.A. Walton, and a phone
message left at the home of Kenneth Walton in Sacramento was not
returned. That left open questions like why he did not withdraw the
painting once people began attributing it to Diebenkorn in favor of
selling it through the established art market, where it could
presumably attract a much higher price.
</P>
<P>
   But ``golfpoorly'' told his story of the painting online when he
put it up for sale. He bought it, he said, before he got married.
``My wife has never let me keep it in the house,'' he explained _
though he ``always kind of liked it'' _ so he decided to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfpoorly'' said the painting was 2 feet 11 inches by 3 feet
11 inches, and noted that the hole was about an inch and a quarter
long and ``would be easy to fix with duct tape.''
</P>
<P>
   He never said it was a Diebenkorn, but along with a picture of
the entire painting _ incorrectly oriented vertically, which he
noted in his posting _ he posted a close-up of the hole. The
signature, ``R.D. '52,'' was easily discernible in the close-up,
and it stirred up the interest and skepticism as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '50s, Diebenkorn made a series of abstract works in
successive locations for which the cycles are named _ Albuquerque,
N.M., Urbana, Ill., and Berkeley, Calif. The Berkeley series began
around 1953, so an unknown 1952 work would not be unreasonable. The
colors in ``golfpoorly's'' painting match those he used in his
Berkeley series.
</P>
<P>
   A Berkeley painting from 1955 sold for $1.8 million at Sotheby's
in May 1998, and other have sold privately for about $1 million,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfpoorly'' said he was surprised by all the fuss. On Sunday,
he added information to the eBay posting that apologized for not
answering all the inquiries he had and said, ``we're freaked out by
all of this, and because of the high price this painting is going
for (WOW!!!!) I contacted an attorney.'' On the lawyer's advice, he
said, he continued, ``This painting is sold in the same manner as
the other items I am selling on eBay, and requires full payment
within 7 days of the auction, in advance of delivery to the buyer,
and is sold as described in the auction description, without
representation as to authorship or authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfpoorly'' has sold items on eBay before, and those who have
bought from him rate him well. On his eBay ID card, 13 people rated
him highly. ``Charged me less for shipping than he quoted,'' wrote
one whose handle is ``cheesesix.'' ``A really nice guy.'' Another,
a self-employed, self-described computer geek in Los Angeles, who
claims to buy online all the time, said the espresso machine he
bought from ``golfpoorly'' for about $280 was ``very good and
honestly described.''
</P>
<P>
   Such testimonials undoubtedly enhance his credibility, but they
are hardly relevant to whether this painting is an authentic
Diebenkorn or not.
</P>
<P>
   As online auctions have gathered force in the past few years,
numerous sites have begun to offer art. Those related to the art
world usually have some standards. Artnet.com, for example, says
that ``All lots have been vetted by reputable dealers and compared
with existing auction results,'' while Sotheby's guarantees the
authenticity of works it sells on both sothebys.com and
sothebys.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   According to Art and Auction magazine, the highest price on an
art site transaction was $168,000 for a 1959 watercolor by Lucio
Fontana, which sold on artnet.com in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay does not keep track of transactions _ there were more than
53 million listings in the last quarter alone, a spokesman said _
but it believes that a Picasso sold for just under $2 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   And sites like eBay are truly ``buyer beware'' locations, a fact
acknowledged by the man who bid $135,605 for ``golfpoorly's''
offering. Declining to speak at length from the Netherlands, where
he lives, he wrote via e-mail, ``I myself would like to concentrate
on the auction right now, the final moment of the auction is in the
middle of the night for me and I need time to explain to my wife
why I am bidding so much money on a painting that I have not seen
in the flesh.''

   PARIS _ Bankers are wringing their hands; tour operators are
applauding.
</P>
<P>
   European countries are enjoying a decade-long boom in American
tourism, and the continued weakness of the new European currency,
the euro, is expected to attract even more Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as though the moment there's a strong dollar people
start packing their suitcases,'' said Giuliano Corsi, general
manager of the elegant Hotel Danieli in Venice. ``But the strong
dollar will certainly tempt people to come to Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   At the luxurious Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich, capacity is
already 80 percent to 85 percent, some of which is due to American
visitors, and Gerhard Bosse, the front office manager, said,
``People are shopping and buying more, whether its simple souvenirs
or expensive items, even china.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is so bullish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure whether a tourist from Burbank is going to come
here just because the dollar is a little stronger,'' said an
official at Euro Disney, which runs Disneyland Paris. Yet Disney
reported that park revenue had risen considerably in the first
three months of this year, though it did not say how much of that
was from Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months ago, when the euro was introduced, the European
travel industry feared the new currency might be so strong it would
frighten visitors away. The opposite has happened.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, 11 countries _ Germany, France, Italy, Spain,
the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland, Finland and
Portugal _ adopted the euro. Since then, any transaction not
involving cash may be done in euros. Thus, banks offer euro
accounts and credit cards, and travel agencies like Thomas Cook and
American Express euro-denominated traveler's checks; European
stores, like the Galeries Lafayette in Paris, advertise prominently
that they will accept them.
</P>
<P>
   But even if you pay for your Italian fashions or French meals in
francs or lire, you are still using euros, since the national
currencies, like French francs and Italian lire, are now mere
denominations of the euro. At the end of next year, national bills
and coins will disappear entirely. Government mints and private
contractors across Europe are busy printing 13 billion euro
banknotes and minting 56 billion coins.
</P>
<P>
   Since its introduction, the euro has lost value continuously
against other currencies. In fact, the euro has plummeted so far
that while an American buying euros a year ago got 0.85 of a euro
for every dollar, by May 5, he was getting 1.12. In local
currencies, that meant 7.3 French francs, instead of 5.5; 2.19
German marks instead of 1.65, and 2,172 Italian lire rather than
1,645.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Leu, director of the Brussels, Belgium-based European
Travel Commission, says his organization expects 12 million
American tourists this year, compared with 11.6 million last year,
continuing a string of annual increases that began in 1993. The
increases are due partly, he says, not only to the ``astonishing
fact that a cup of coffee costs 50 percent less than only a few
years ago,'' but also to America's booming economy. In the last
decade, he said, the pool of American travelers that European
tourism relies on most _ those with average annual earnings
exceeding $75,000 a year _ has doubled, to 30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Shackleford, regional director for Europe at the World
Tourism Organization in Madrid, recalls how before the euro was
introduced, European tour operators and hotel owners feared that a
powerful euro would deflect tourists to cheaper destinations, like
Turkey and Morocco. The present mix of weak euro, low European
inflation and a strong American economy, he said, `'is a tour
operator's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, airlines and cruise ship operators are cashing in. The
number of nonstop flights from American cities to Europe is
growing. In March, Air France began flying from Philadelphia to
Paris; this month, Northwest Airlines added flights from Detroit to
Rome and Milan.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Crystal Cruises of Los Angeles added several more
destinations, bringing its European cruises to 17, and lengthened
the season to mid-November, from late September; Holland America
increased its ships to three, from one. Cruise Lines International
Association, an industry group, says 1.2 million people will cruise
in Europe this year, double the number five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gavin Tollman, president and chief executive of Trafalgar Tours
in New York, said the powerful American economy and strong dollar
painted ``a jewel picture.'' Trafalgar travelers to Europe will
rise 30 percent this year over 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, not everyone in Europe is exulting. In Britain,
which decided against adopting the euro, the pound has gained in
value, making Britain more expensive for travelers from the
Continent. This month, the British Tourist Authority revised
tourism growth estimates down, from 5 percent to 3 percent. Britain
risks losing visitors to France and Italy, it warned, where prices,
measured in dollars, are as much as 20 percent lower than a year
ago.

BUCHANAN TURNS IN SIGNATURES IN BID FOR PLACE ON TEXAS BALLOT 
 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Presidential contender Patrick Buchanan turned
in an estimated 129,000 signatures to state election officials
Monday in a bid to secure his place as an independent candidate on
Texas' November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say what this guarantees is that the American people
are going to have an authentic choice this fall,'' Buchanan said.
``Not just a choice between basically one candidate of a party
establishment and another of an establishment which by and large
agree.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who listed as his Texas running mate Houston term
limits activist Clymer Wright, said he is still seeking the Reform
Party's presidential nomination, but sought ballot status as an
independent as an ``insurance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Wright, an old friend, agreed to be listed as a
running mate on the petitions as a ``stand-in.'' Buchanan gave no
indication whom he ultimately might pick as a vice presidential
contender. Wright was unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Reform Party, which has been critical of Buchanan's
lone wolf efforts, also is petitioning for ballot access on behalf
of numerous office-seekers in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Those petitions are due to the Texas secretary of state at the
end of the month. Buchanan, as an independent candidate, was
required to submit his petitions on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Verney, founding national chairman of the Reform Party,
said Buchanan's efforts have disappointed Reform activists who have
spent years building the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money he spent on independent candidate ballot access
could have been spent on party ballot access,'' Verney said. ``Now,
without a big-name presidential candidate and a lot of money, it's
not going to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   It is likely Reform Party volunteers will be unable to secure
the 37,380 signatures required to run a full slate of candidates on
the November ballot, Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   In order to qualify as an independent, Buchanan needs about
58,000 signatures from registered voters who did not participate in
either the Democratic or Republican primaries. Election officials
must verify the signatures' authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a debate back and forth whether to try to get on as
a Reform Party or get on as an individual candidate,'' Buchanan
said. ``My understanding is that there are complexities and
problems getting a party on the ballot, and it can be disqualified
much easier than a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   With more to do securing a foothold in the 29 states where the
Reform Party is not on the ballot, Buchanan said his work in Texas
is over for now, although he plans to return to campaign in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do if he failed to get his party's
nomination, Buchanan asked, ``Who is going to beat me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Ross Perot is going to get in,'' Buchanan said
of the party's founder. To date, Perot has remained silent on
Buchanan's candidacy. The party will nominate its presidential
candidate in August.
</P>
<P>
   A former talk-show host and speechwriter for President Nixon,
Buchanan made unsuccessful presidential bids in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he bolted from the Republican Party to join the
Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is good conservative country and I have always been well
-received here,'' said Buchanan, wearing a Texas-themed tie he said
was a gift from state Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Attended by about 30 supporters who greeted him with chants of,
``Go, Pat, go,'' Buchanan used the occasion to speak out against
normalizing relations with China and also against illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also took a few swipes at Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP
presidential front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bush is a centrist, Bush RepjqjV,X7, and he comes out of
that wing of the party,'' Buchanan said. ``On the issue of right to
life, for example, the governor refuses to say he will chose
pro-life justices for the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Buchanan, a Roman Catholic, defended Bush's
handling of the Bob Jones University flap earlier this year, when
Bush came under fire for campaigning at the school whose namesake
founder is noted for anti-Catholic and racist statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the charge that Governor Bush or any member of his
family was in any way anti-Catholic is false, the charges are
without basis in fact,'' Buchanan said. ``I don't think the
governor had anything to apologize for.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his presumptive inclusion on the November ballot,
experts give Buchanan slim hope of doing much more than stealing a
few votes from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Monday when the verification process for
Buchanan's petitions would be complete.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In High Point, N.C., there has not been a drug- or gang-related
murder in the past 18 months, after a stunning upsurge in homicides
in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   In Natchez, Miss., the number of murders dropped to one in 1999,
after reaching 12 a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And in Oceanside, Calif., where there were 25 homicides in 1995,
there were seven last year.
</P>
<P>
   These drops in murder are seen as an important indication that
the decline in the nation's murder rate since 1991, long driven by
decreases in homicide in the big cities, is starting to take hold
in small cities, suburbs and rural areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
   This trend was underscored by the release Sunday of the FBI's
preliminary crime report for 1999, which showed that while homicide
dropped 2 percent in cities with a population of half a million or
more, it declined 10 percent in cities of 100,000 to 250,000, 12
percent in cities of 50,000 to 100,000 people and 14 percent in
communities of 10,000 to 25,000 people. Overall, in suburban
counties, the number of murders fell 12 percent and 14 percent in
rural counties.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the smaller the community, the bigger the decrease in
murders, according to the FBI study, known as the Uniform Crime
Report, which is based on figures supplied to the FBI by police
departments around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in big cities, officials in these smaller communities
attribute the decline to a mix of factors, including their
innovative programs, an improved economy and longer prison
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In High Point, a city of 76,000, federal, state and local law
enforcement agencies, drawing on a program pioneered in Boston,
worked together to target drug dealers who had moved in from as far
away as Los Angeles and Mexico. In Natchez, an antebellum tourist
town of 19,000, officials say a new strategy of community policing
and four new officers financed by a Clinton administration program
helped cut crime.
</P>
<P>
   In Oceanside, a community of 160,000 just north of San Diego,
the waning of the crack cocaine epidemic, a healthy economy that
reduced unemployment and California's tough
``three-strikes-and-you're-out'' sentencing laws have kept
criminals in prison longer and all contributed to a reduction in
crime, local officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The reason the declines in homicide began in the nation's big
cities and are spreading to smaller communities, said professor
Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, is
related to the reason the murder rate first increased in the
mid-1980s. It was the major cities that were initially hit by crack
cocaine, and then by the infestation of semiautomatic handguns and
gangs that accompanied the crack epidemic, he said. The smaller
cities and rural areas were slower to become involved in the crack
problem, and just as they lagged behind in the growth of crime,
``they are slower to come down,'' Blumstein said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some smaller cities and rural areas have been victims
of the success of larger cities in suppressing crime, which led
drug dealers and gangs to move to the small communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw in North Carolina, as law enforcement picked up
the pressure in the big cities in the mid-1990s, was that the gangs
purposely moved out to smaller places,'' said Walter Holton, the
U.S. attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, in
Greensboro. ``We saw Mexican organized gangs literally pick up and
move from Greensboro to Randolph County,'' a rural area 30 miles to
the south, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would buy or rent property, a house or trailer, and start
selling drugs again,'' Holton said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican gangs arrived at the same time as a large influx of
Hispanic families moving to North Carolina to work in the state's
rapidly expanding industries, textile mills, furniture factories
and the construction business, disguising their illicit activities,
Holton said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some gang members traveled back and forth from Los
Angeles to High Point, bringing a supply of drugs to sell. ``They
infiltrated the local market, becoming the major suppliers, and in
the process used violence for intimidation to take over the city,''
Holton added.
</P>
<P>
   But while the sharp decline in homicide in smaller communities
now is seen as a positive sign, several experts said they were
concerned that the slowing of the decrease in murder in big cities
could mean the country is nearing the end of the remarkable fall in
murder after eight consecutive years. ``The big cities are
signaling the end of the downturn is near,'' said James Allen Fox,
a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Blumstein said, ``The decline obviously can't
continue indefinitely.'' He has calculated that with the huge
reduction in murder in the past few years, ``If the trend
continued, we would have a negative homicide rate, and that would
occur in 2007.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally worrisome, the experts said, several big cities actually
had increases in murder in 1999 for the first time since 1991,
including San Diego, up 35.7 percent; St. Louis, up 15 percent;
Phoenix, up 14.6 percent; Milwaukee, up 11.7 percent, and New York,
up 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been getting at the easy problems, so now that we've
gotten the easy gains, there should be a flattening out'' in the
overall decline, Blumstein said. Among these gains, he said, were a
shrinkage in the crack market and successful police tactics aimed
at getting young people not to carry guns.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor behind the success of smaller communities in
reducing crime has been the growing sophistication of the police in
smaller cities and towns in using many of the same tactics and
technology developed by the police in big cities like New York and
Boston. In Montclair, N.J., for example, Thomas Russo, the police
chief, said his officers now use crime mapping of past patterns of
offenses to predict where crimes will occur. They also have an
eight-member task force that targets high crime areas as well as a
juvenile unit in the city's high schools. Montclair has not had a
murder since 1997, when there were four.
</P>
<P>
   Still another factor is that smaller communities have introduced
programs, like those in big cities, to intervene early in reports
of domestic violence, trying to stop these incidents from
escalating to murder.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington County, Va., with a population of 185,000, had only
four murders in 1999, a 50 percent reduction from eight in 1998,
though Arlington is just across the Potomac River from Washington,
a city with a high murder rate. ``I wish I could say it was my
programs,'' said Edward A. Flynn, Arlington's police chief.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he points out that the county's few homicides are of
the traditional American kind, largely domestic killings or drunken
quarrels that turn into murder. So Flynn has stressed stopping
domestic violence early, ``to break the cycle of violence.''

JUDGE SAYS NAPSTER MAY HAVE FAILED TO POST TIMELY COPYRIGHT
WARNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a double blow to Napster, a federal judge has
decided not to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the recording industry
against Napster, and suggested in her ruling that Napster might
face an uphill battle as the case proceeded to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, Chief Judge Marilyn Patel, of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California, denied a
request by Napster, which offers a service that allows consumers to
share and trade music over the Internet, to dismiss the lawsuit on
summary judgment. Napster is arguing its activities are protected
under several provisions of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright
Act.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more damaging for Napster was Patel's suggestion
that it might have failed to satisfy a technicality that made it
eligible for protection under the act.
</P>
<P>
   Patel wrote that Napster might have failed to post in a timely
fashion a written policy about how it would deal with people who
used its service in a way that infringed copyright.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the implications were serious for Napster,
possibly making it ineligible to obtain protection under the act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have blown all of its safe-harbor requirements,'' under
the act, said Mark Radcliffe, a copyright lawyer with Gray Cary
Ware &AMP; Freidenrich in Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   To use the Napster service, which is free, users download
software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog
their music on their own computers. Napster posts those catalogs _
hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of them _ then enables
users of the service to visit one anothers computers over the
Internet and share and download one anothers music.
</P>
<P>
   Napster argues that it should not be held accountable if its
users trade copyrighted music over the Internet because it does not
itself store the music on its computers or engage itself in trading
copyrighted music.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patel ruled against Napsters claim that it was
ineligible for one of the four key safe harbor provisions of the
act because it did not ``transmit, route, or provide connections''
for users of the service.
</P>
<P>
   The judge left open the possibility that Napster is eligible
under other provisions of the law. However, she wrote that to be
eligible, Napster was obliged to have posted in a timely fashion a
policy warning how it would deal with infringers found to use the
service. There are ``geniune issues of material fact about
Napster's compliance with the requirement,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Pulgram, Napster's lawyer, acknowledged that Napster
did not necessarily have a written policy until after the lawsuit
was filed. However, he said that Napster did actively purge known
infringers, thus satisfying the conditions of the requirement.

 &HT;    High rollers, rookies lining up
 &HT;    By Dan Chapman

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Texan walked into the convenience store in Morrow,
handed over $7,000 in hundred-dollar bills and sat patiently
reading a magazine while the machine printed out lottery ticket
after lottery ticket for today's Big Game jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   It's not likely any other customer will throw down a wad of
money like the big-spending Texan did Friday, not at the Citgo
Value Mart on South Main Street, at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to beat him'' part-owner Balgit Singh Randhawa
said Monday. ``He said if nobody hits, he'll come back again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Texan already has plenty _ plenty _ of competition as
the biggest American lottery payoff ever grows to more than $325
million. Stores across Georgia are reporting double, triple, even
quadruple the typical daily ticket sales. Lines back up to beer
coolers. Extra cashiers and security guards are on duty.
</P>
<P>
   The virtue of patience is much in demand, especially with
unknown thousands of lottery neophytes drawn to the ticket-spitting
machines. Mary Radcliff helps first-timers mark their cards at the
Amoco she manages in Canton. Most aren't familiar with quick picks,
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bustle and the potentially overwhelming drive to
turn a buck, customer service isn't lost at some stores. Bob
Langley, manager of a Speedway store in Fayetteville, Ga., turned
away possibly his biggest customer Friday afternoon when the man
said he wanted to purchase 4,000 Big Game tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Cranking out that many chits would've tied up the machine for
hours, alienating other ticket-hungry customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I could only give him 1,000,'' Langley recalled Monday.
``You've only got so much time.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is time now that is getting short for those dreaming of
riches unfathomable. Between now and 10:45 p.m., store owners,
managers and clerks expect another flurry of last-minute buying.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 18th drawing since March 7 without a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, folks were buying tickets at the rate of $350 per
second between 6 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. And, typically, 60 percent of
Big Game tickets are sold the day of the drawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold 2,600 tickets last Friday,'' said Tommy Stansel of
Tommy's Market outside Waleska. ``That's three times what I usually
sell.'' Stansel said the Big Game hasn't cut into other lottery
sales.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the Big Game that's creating the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible,'' said Kimberly Walker, a cashier at the
Texaco station at Ga. 138 and Iris Drive in Conyers. ``We had two
people on the registers and it was still bad. It never stopped.
There was always a line. We weren't prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales normally run about 600 tickets a day. Now, though, they
jump to $2,200, virtually all of which are for the Big Game. A
third clerk will be added today, but Walker's not sure it'll help.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ``going to be terrible, too,'' Walker said. ``I just
hope someone wins.''

   Paige, who will receive a 26 percent raise on July 1, said
Monday he was caught off-guard when school trustees voted 7-0 late
last week to substantially increase his salary, now $219,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't seek this,'' said Paige, ``but I'm appreciative for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige's new salary, which tops the $260,000 paid to Dallas
Superintendent Waldemar ``Bill'' Rojas, reflects how superintendent
salaries have escalated nationwide in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod Paige, in our judgment, has been grossly underpaid,'' said
board President Larry Marshall. ``How do you justify the
superintendent of Dallas, Texas, making more money than the
superintendent of the Houston Independent School District when we
have more students? What we sought to do was to correct the
inequity.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Federation of Teachers President Gayle Fallon said she
hopes that teachers will now get an equitable pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly just raised our expectation level,'' she said.
``I expect to see the teachers the highest paid in the nation.
Hell, there are times I'd settle for the highest paid in Harris
County, which I don't think is unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige confirmed that he had been contacted by officials in
cities that are looking for new school chiefs, including Los
Angeles and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not paid a lot of attention to that because it's almost
getting to be routine right now, where people ask me if I have an
interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paige, whose contract expires in 2004, said he is ``committed to
Houston'' and will stay ``as long as we are accomplishing things,
as long as the board has an interest, as long as we are moving
forward and improving school performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said consistency in leadership is one of the reasons
HISD has gained a national reputation for academic improvement.
</P>
<P>
   While the average tenure of superintendents in big-city
districts is 2 1/3 years, Paige has been at the helm for more than
six years.
</P>
<P>
   National groups that monitor superintendent salaries say that a
shortage of qualified superintendents has driven salaries up.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the really quality leaders, the competition is really
fierce. And if you've got a good track record and have definitely
shown you've done a tremendous job at the helm, it sort of pushes
higher salaries,'' said Henry Duvall, spokesman for the Council of
the Great City Schools.
</P>
<P>
   According to surveys of superintendent salaries, Rojas and
Thomas Tocco, earning $249,000 in Fort Worth, Texas, are believed
to be the highest-paid superintendents in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Crew, who quit earlier this year as chancellor of New York
City schools, earned $245,000.
</P>
<P>
   New York, in particular, has had 12 superintendents in 20 years,
including seven who were fired or resigned under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Seltz, spokeswoman for the American Association of School
Administrators, said it is not surprising to see dramatically
rising salaries, particularly in urban districts that are working
hard to hire and keep good leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a shortage of qualified superintendents who are
willing to take on the challenges of these large urban districts,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even smaller Houston area districts such as Cypress-Fairbanks
and Spring Branch are now paying their superintendents $200,000 or
more.

ADMINISTRATION TO PROPOSE A BAN ON NEW ROADS IN MANY NATIONAL
FORESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A draft proposal from the Clinton administration to
safeguard national forests from development would bar building
roads across nearly one-quarter of those lands but would not
immediately rule out future logging or off-road vehicle activity.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which was outlined Monday by Forest Service
officials, is intended to flesh out a pledge that President Clinton
has portrayed as a central part of his legacy. But some
environmentalists said it fell short of their hopes and warned that
it would leave some forests open to exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was described by Forest Service officials in advance of
a scheduled announcement on Tuesday. It will be reviewed within the
administration after a comment period that is to include some 300
public meetings in the next two months, and activists on both sides
of the issue said they held out hope that it would be revised.
</P>
<P>
   Among the voices that will be heard in those sessions are those
of the timber industry, which has long opposed any effort to put
broad tracts of forest off limits to roads and logging. But a top
official said in an interview Monday that the industry now
considered some form of broad protection as inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not resigned to it getting through without a fight, but
I think the odds are that it will get through,'' said the official,
W. Henson Moore, president of the American Forest &AMP; Paper
Association and a former congressman from Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who oversees the Forest
Service, called the draft plan an important step toward preserving
``among the last and best pristine lands in America.'' Glickman
said the draft was ``a balanced proposal,'' but he added, ``It's
clear to us that any good proposal can be improved upon.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of putting so much forest land off limits to roads has
been strongly opposed by powerful lawmakers from some Western
states, who contend that it would deal a heavy blow to the timber
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration's plan would bypass those critics by
using administrative rule changes that do not require congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first outlined the initiative in a speech last fall in a
national forest in Reddish Knob, Va., and it remains the subject of
intense debate on Capitol Hill, where Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho,
dismissed it Monday as an unfair ``end run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service proposal, in the form of a draft
environmental impact statement, provides the first details on the
administration's plan. A plan that the agency named among several
alternatives as its favored approach would immediately bar road
building in virtually all of the large, unprotected roadless areas
that remain in the forest system, spanning a total of 43 million
acres in 39 states.
</P>
<P>
   The 155 national forests and grasslands that would be affected
include Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana, Tahoe National
Forest in California, Olympic National Forest in Washington and
White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   But, in what might be a bow to political reality, the one forest
explicitly exempted from the proposal is the giant Tongass National
Forest in Alaska, the nation's largest, where conservation efforts
have been opposed by members of Alaska's congressional delegation
who see it as a vital economic resource.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Forest Service proposal, no decision about whether to
set aside roadless areas in the Tongass would be made until at
least 2004, when a plan for the future of the forest would next
come under review.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, even across the millions of acres where road
construction would be barred under the plan, any further decisions
about prohibiting logging and off-road activity would be deferred
until plans for the forests are next reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   In laying out the administration's approach last October in
Virginia, Clinton vowed ``to protect all this before it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews Monday, a number of environmentalists
criticized the administration's approach as inadequate. Ken Rait,
director of the Heritage Forests Campaign, an organization based in
Portland, Ore., that campaigns to protect forests, said he had
hoped the administration would draft a tougher policy that
``completely safeguards these forests.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hopeful that the final policy will measure up to the
vision that President Clinton laid out last October,'' Rait said.
</P>
<P>
   About 34 million acres, or 18 percent, of the country's national
forest land has been set aside by Congress as wilderness areas,
which are off-limits to development and on which roads, logging and
off-road vehicles are banned. About 50 percent of national forest
land is open to logging or was long ago crisscrossed with the roads
that make development possible.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's plan would cover most of the rest, which is
listed by the Forest Service as roadless areas but where road
construction has never been totally ruled out. Congressional
approval would have been required to formally designate any of the
land as wilderness, and the opposition from the Western lawmakers
has prompted the administration's effort to act on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials who outlined the draft proposal
spoke only on condition of anonymity, saying they did not want to
upstage announcements scheduled for Tuesday in Washington and
Phoenix by Glickman and Mike Dombeck, the Forest Service chief.
</P>
<P>
   In drafting the plan, the Forest Service weighed several
alternatives to protect the roadless areas, administration
officials said. They said at least one of those plans would have
gone further than the one the agency ultimately chose, by
explicitly ruling out logging as well as further road construction.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended ban on road building alone was based on the
belief that ``road construction represents the single greatest
threat to the social and ecological values of roadless areas,'' a
Forest Service official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the road ban would have a broad effect because
the prohibition would in most cases make logging and other
activities extremely difficult. One official estimated that the
approach would reduce future logging by 70 percent in what are now
roadless areas.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists said that unless logging and off-road
vehicle traffic was explicitly prohibited in the final plan, the
way would be left open for helicopter logging and other activities
that could spoil areas that deserved total protection.
</P>
<P>
   Federal procedures require the proposal to be open to comment
until July 17. The Forest Service has scheduled more than 300 open
meetings, beginning next week, to solicit public reaction.

YOUNG &AMP; RUBICAM AGREES TO TAKEOVER IN BIGGEST AD DEAL EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AD-AGENCY-YOUNG) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN with STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Young &AMP; Rubicam, a Madison Avenue icon that gave the
world the Jell-O jingle and the numbered Excedrin headaches, ended
77 years of independence Monday night by agreeing to a $5.7 billion
takeover by the WPP Group, a rival based in London. It is the
largest deal in the history of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   While the boards of the two companies have yet to formally vote
on the agreement, executives close to the negotiations said they
were expected to announce an accord as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal ends four months of on-again, off-again talks that
included dramatic trans-Atlantic conference calls and hand-scrawled
faxes with proposals and counterproposals, a second possible suitor
and an 11th-hour breakdown in negotiations that rivaled the
theatrics of some of the most creative commercials the companies
produce.
</P>
<P>
   The takeover would make WPP the largest advertising company in
the world measured in billings and revenue, leap-frogging the
Omnicom Group and the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would create advertising campaigns for
household brands like Ford, IBM, American Express, AT&AMP;T, Kraft
Foods and Sony. The agreement brings under one roof famous ad
agencies like Young &AMP; Rubicam, J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather, while making siblings of well-known public relations
agencies like Burson-Marsteller, Hill &AMP; Knowlton and Cohn &AMP; Wolfe.
Each will retain its distinctive identity within WPP.
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam had been one of the last big independent agency
companies in an industry that had been consolidating relentlessly
since the mid-1980s, as Madison Avenue sought to keep pace with the
growth and international expansion of its clients seeking global
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big are getting bigger,'' said Karen R. Ficker, managing
director for advertising, publishing and new media at ING Barings.
``If you looked around out there, Y&AMP;R was probably one of the best
left for WPP.''
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam is losing its independence only 24 months after
the agency, privately held since it was founded by copywriters
Raymond Rubicam and John Orr Young in 1923, decided to sell stock
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The shares had climbed until recently and then declined, which
made Young &AMP; Rubicam vulnerable to a takeover by larger advertising
conglomerates like WPP.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to the talks, WPP has agreed to
pay 0.835 of its own American depository receipt shares for each
share of Young &AMP; Rubicam. That equates to WPP paying about $63 for
each share of Y&AMP;R based on Friday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R's shares fell $4 5/16 or nearly 8 percent to $49 13/16 in
Nasdaq trading Monday. Shares of WPP dropped 65 pence, or 6.7
percent, to 910 after dropping as low as 890 in London on Monday;
its American depository receipt shares dropped 9 percent to $66
7/8.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition will give WPP control of three of the world's 11
largest autonomous ad agency operations ranked by revenue: Thompson
(4), Ogilvy (10) and Y&AMP;R (11). That is the same number controlled
by WPP's principal rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom also has three: BBDO (3), DDB (7) and TBWA (15). So too
does Interpublic: McCann-Erickson (2), Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners (13)
and Draft (24).
</P>
<P>
   The goal of these new behemoth-sized agency companies is to own
or control as many of the large, multinational ad agency operations
as possible in an effort to offer the most potential services to
large, multinational clients. With each agency set up as an an
autonomous unit, the intent is to minimize conflicts that would
keep advertisers from hiring the agency company.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, agencies owned by Omnicom work for auto companies
that compete against one another, but with the agencies operating
separately, the automakers are ostensibly assured that no agency
shares proprietary data with its siblings. So BBDO and Merkley
Newman Harty work for DaimlerChrysler; DDB works for Volkswagen;
TBWA works for Nissan; and Goodby, Silverstein &AMP; Partners works for
Isuzu.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients, however, disapprove of those arrangements and will
not agree to use an agency with a sibling that works for a rival.
That was a major issue in the talks between Young &AMP; Rubicam and its
second suitor, Publicis of France. Publicis said Monday that for
now, it was no longer interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to say no when you have such an opportunity,''
Maurice Levy, chairman and chief executive at Publicis in Paris,
said in a telephone interview. ``But there were some obstacles
regarding the nature of the deal, organizational problems and
client conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary stumbling block was Ford, which is a major Young &AMP;
Rubicam client and would probably have disapproved if Y&AMP;R were
purchased by a company that also had subsidiaries working for
rivals like BMW (Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis), General Motors
(Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney in San Francisco) and Renault (Publicis).
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the WPP deal collapses,'' Levy said, ``we would be
ready to look at Y&AMP;R once again. The phone number is in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the largest in the history of ad business, more than
twice the past record, set only in February when Havas Advertising
agreed to acquire Snyder Communications for about $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement struck between WPP and Young &AMP; Rubicam came only
after fits and starts of negotiations as each side jockeyed for
better position and leverage over the other. The main sticking
points, finally resolved over the weekend, were over price, Young &AMP;
Rubicam's ability to operate autonomously within WPP during the
integration of the company over the first year, as well as
contractual and compensation provisions for the acquired company's
senior executives. On price, Martin Sorrell, WPP's ambitious chief
executive, increased his exchange offer from 0.83 shares of WPP's
ADR to 0.835. The two companies also compromised on Young &AMP;
Rubicam's autonomy, creating a four-person board consisting of two
executives from WPP _ Sorrell and Paul Richardson, chief financial
officer _ and two executives from Young &AMP; Rubicam _ Thomas D. Bell
Jr., current chief executive, and Michael Dolan, chief financial
officer.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also came to terms over provisions to retain Young
&AMP; Rubicam's top talent, with a non-compete clause that prevents its
employees from working for competing clients at rival agencies for
a year after leaving Y&AMP;R.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan is expected to become chief executive of Young &AMP; Rubicam
under WPP. Bell has been offered the position of chairman of WPP,
but it remains unclear whether he will accept. Sorrell was taking a
Concorde flight from London to New York Tuesday morning to meet
with Bell.

U.S. AND BRITAIN AGREE TO AID U.N. PEACEKEEPING FORCE IN SIERRA
LEONE
</HEADLINE>
   (See also SIERRA-LEONE, SIERRA-LEONE-RESCUE) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN and CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States and Britain agreed on Monday to provide
limited help to a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone that
appears to be dazed and overwhelmed, with rebels killing civilians
in the capital Freetown and continuing to hold more than 500 U.N.
soldiers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   But despite appeals from the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan,
for a rapid reaction force to save the peacekeeping effort, the
Clinton administration agreed only to provide transport planes, and
Britain sent a 700-man force there primarily to assist with the
evacuation of its nationals.
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, violence and confusion continued to reign. In
Freetown, the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, who is widely regarded in
the West as a war criminal, slipped out of sight amid a mass
demonstration that turned into a deadly shootout near his compound.
Soldiers loyal to Sankoh fired into a crowd of rock-throwing
protesters, killing at least four.
</P>
<P>
   While emphasizing that it will not send ground troops, the
Clinton administration agreed on Monday to transport 700
Bangladeshi soldiers to the West African country. But the airlift
had no timetable and officials have said it was not clear when the
troops would be ready to leave. The United States also sent a
military team to nearby Nigeria to help organize the movement of up
to two Nigerian army battalions to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, Annan has been asking Washington for help in
airlifting peacekeepers from three battalions committed by Jordan,
India and Bangladesh ahead of their scheduled deployment in Sierra
Leone next month. The U.N. peacekeeping force is now about 2,300
short of its Security Council mandated strength of 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was waiting for the outcome of a
summit of West African nations in Nigeria Tuesday to determine
whether the peacekeeping force in Sierra Leone should be beefed up
or essentially abandoned as a lost cause, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was possible that the situation had deteriorated to such an
extent and that rebel forces had gained so much control that there
was no peace to keep, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Nigerians wanted to send in new battalions of soldiers,
operating as a West African force as they had in the past, and not
under the U.N. flag, the administration would favor such a move,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain said that it was sending at least 700 soldiers to secure
the airport near Freetown so that foreigners there could safely
leave. Unlike the United States, Britain did not rule out using its
troops in ground fighting in its former colony,
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the British soldiers were not
going as ``combat troops,'' but left open the possibility that they
could assist the U.N. peacekeepers. An advance force of 250 British
paratroopers crossed into the country on Monday from Senegal and
200 were flying in from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing Parliament, where the opposition Conservative Party
expressed reservations about British troops becoming involved in
the fighting, Cook said, ``We must not allow a few thousand rebels
to prevent the end to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The British takeover of the airport would make it much easier to
fly reinforcements into the country, and would enable the Americans
to send their transports without additional ground support.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Annan scrambled on several fronts on
Monday to stave off collapse of the peacekeeping mission. He met
with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who expressed
enthusiastic, if vague, support for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at ways we can be supportive,'' Albright told
reporters after their meeting. Asked whether that would include
contributing to a rapid reaction force, the secretary of state
said, ``We are looking at how to provide logistical support.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who was in New York for the funeral of Cardinal John
O'Connor, declined to go into details of her private discussions
with Annan beyond saying that Sierra Leone was at the top of their
list of topics.
</P>
<P>
   Annan earlier had said that ``in addition to U.N. efforts, a
rapid reaction force may be needed in Sierra Leone as soon as
possible to assist in restoring conditions conducive to the
resumption of the peace process.'' Annan also appealed to Sierra
Leone's neighbors, particularly Liberia and Guinea, to prevent
rebels based on their soil from crossing back into Sierra Leone,
according to his spokesman, Fred Eckhard. He said there were
reports that some fighters were crossing the border, apparently to
join the main guerrilla force.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, has long supported the
Revolutionary United Front, as insurgents loyal to Sankoh call
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As a precaution, the secretary general ordered the evacuation of
266 non-essential U.N. personnel from Sierra Leone, leaving 55 U.N.
civilian employees in the country. Some embassies and aid agencies
have already flown some of their employees and dependents out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Eckhard acknowledged on Monday that the United Nations'
performance had been hampered by a breakdown in its outdated
communications equipment, which made it difficult for the
operations center in Freetown to stay in contact with units in the
field. He also confirmed that the lightly armed peacekeepers
arrived without tanks or artillery, the kind of heavy weapons that
might have cowed the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, the rebels have seized and are holding more
than 500 U.N. peacekeepers, at least 400 of whom are Zambian, and
taken their weapons, ammunition and at least 13 armored personnel
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, the United Nations reduced the number of its
soldiers reported killed from four to one Kenyan, with another
Kenyan missing-in-action.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The secretary general has also dispatched Bernard Miyet, the
head of the United Nations' peacekeeping department, to Freetown to
encourage the mission there.
</P>
<P>
   With his military options limited, Annan has been telephoning a
series of African leaders since last week, asking for their
intervention in fashioning a regional political solution that would
put Sierra Leone's peace agreement back on track and convince
Sankoh to call his fighters off.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of Sierra Leone and three other West African
countries _ Guinea, Liberia and Mali _ met in Conakry on Monday
with Oluyemi Adeniji, a Nigerian who is the United Nations' special
representative to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has
planned another meeting of nine African countries, including Sierra
Leone and Liberia, in Nigeria's capital, Abuja.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian troops battled the rebels as part of a West African
force before the U.N. peacemakers arrived. Their departure, which
concluded last week, apparently helped embolden Mr. Sankoh's
fighters to turn on the U.N. peacekeepers, who were attempted to
secure territory in rebel-held parts of Sierra Leone where diamonds
are mined. The rebels have supported their war and enriched their
leaders by smuggling diamonds into the international market through
Liberia.

<P>
   MIAMI _ It was time Monday for the Knicks to take their medicine
for losing Game 1 to the Heat, several doses of an over-the-airways
prescription known as the classic second-guess. Much of it was
administered by reporters. Some of it was self-applied. All of it
indicated that the Knicks' playoff honeymoon concluded 10 days ago
not far from Niagara Falls, and they have come back to their
customary state of crankiness and doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Such lousy front-runners these Knicks are, which probably means
they'll be ready and raring to go in Game 2 of the Eastern
Conference semifinals Tuesday night at American Airlines Arena,
where the only missing component Monday was a pack of protesters
shouting, ``Free Marcus Camby.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the arena on a balmy afternoon, Jeff Van Gundy was
chafing at having to explain why he sat his high-octane octopus in
the final three minutes and 35 seconds of Sunday's 87-83 defeat,
after Camby had grabbed 13 rebounds in just 27 minutes. Did Van
Gundy go too long with Larry Johnson or Patrick Ewing? Should he
have pulled his point guard, and gone with Allan Houston and
Latrell Sprewell in the back court?
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's answer, delivered from the pulpit of rhetorical high
ground, was that he went with the same lineup that was 3 for 3 down
the stretch in the Toronto series, and how come no one questioned
his deployment then?
</P>
<P>
   ``When it doesn't work out, you made the wrong decisions,'' said
the coach, his lip in half smirk, before he went on to do a little
second-guessing himself, of his players' passivity in defending the
basket.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that it was much easier for the pro Camby reform
movement to fire up with the benefit of 20-20 hindsight that Larry
Johnson missed the open 3-ball this time and Patrick Ewing was
dominated by Alonzo Mourning and the Knicks could have used a
double shot of adrenaline and athleticism, of sugar-coated Camby.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, Camby pretended, relaxing his long limbs as he sat
on a table along the sideline. ``It has nothing to do with age and
size,'' he said. ``This is how we played most of our games at the
end, with old guys, short guys, whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   The old guy, Patrick Ewing, was moving by game's end with the
grace of a glacier. The short guy, Johnson, was not about to
produce the game-altering energy or put-back basket the Knicks
clearly needed as they were misfiring on their last eight shots.
Throw in Latrell Sprewell being outweighed by 50 pounds by Jamal
Mashburn and what you have is a Knicks' starting and finishing
frontline that had better start spiking its spinach.
</P>
<P>
   The second-guessing was a bit overstated, given that the Knicks
several times were one shot away from winning Game 1. On the other
hand, they have now lost four of five against the Heat this season,
and if they lose again Tuesday night, expect three days in New York
of full-court panic. Van Gundy, for his part, should already have
forgotten what worked against Toronto, whose front court players
were as rooted to the floor as New York's. If the Knicks and Heat
go down the stretch again Tuesday night, he's got to start
remembering his team's most significant hour last spring, Game 5 of
the six-game takeout of the Pacers in Indianapolis in the
conference final.
</P>
<P>
   It was Camby who appeared from nowhere, changed shot patterns,
controlled the air space above the rim, spread his wingspan and
jetted the Knicks into the finals. He is the one Knick who has the
potential on any night to soar above the common Knicks-Heat playoff
scrum, but the coach apparently still has issues with commitment to
a whimsical player who has little conventional offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Larry played well,'' Van Gundy said. ``I don't know
who else you take out.''
</P>
<P>
   This is no democracy, and Sprewell said he has no idea what Van
Gundy's planning, but he had no qualms about casting his vote for
the point guard to sit in certain situations. This way, Sprewell
reasoned, Camby could get more minutes, and the Knicks could make
the injured Tim Hardaway guard himself or Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like smelling blood,'' Sprewell said. ``He's out there,
hobbling around, and I would definitely do something to make him
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Though last season is already part of a century past, the
friendship of Sprewell and Camby was, in part, a product of the way
they, as newcomers, were used by Van Gundy. They still often serve
as a window into one another's feelings, and Sprewell left no doubt
Monday that Camby was discouraged by not getting the chance to
impact Sunday's end game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I know he is,'' Sprewell said. ``I thought he should be
in the game. We talked about it but that's a coach's decision and
Marcus isn't the type at this point to pout.''
</P>
<P>
   Who has time? After three playoff games in 17 days, it is a
pleasure to have Game 2 come up before we have barely digested Game
1. With regard to a continuum and competition and context, this
finally feels like the playoffs. &QL;

FINALLY, A CHANCE TO LET REGGIE REST IN PEACE

<P>
   BOSTON _ Could this be the end? Could this be the final chapter
of the worst Boston sports story of them all? Let's hope so.
</P>
<P>
   There's never been a good day in the Reggie Lewis story. No
closure. No healing. No catharsis. There's not been one good moment
since the night Lewis collapsed running his lane on the parquet
floor against the Charlotte Hornets. That was back in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone lost. A woman lost her husband. Children lost their
dad. A mother lost her son. The community lost a good guy. The
Celtics lost a star guard. Reggie's bosses lost faith in their own
good judgment. Fans lost a favorite player. Insurance companies
surrendered $12 million. A law firm went bankrupt after spending
three years on the first trial. A doctor lost his good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   And now Donna Harris-Lewis has lost her latest negligence
lawsuit against Dr. Gilbert Mudge, and some will lose faith in the
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has an opinion about Harris-Lewis and her lawsuit:
She's greedy . . . The doctor thought he was smarter than everyone
else . . . Reggie damaged his heart by abusing drugs . . . There
would be no rumors about Reggie and drugs if he'd been a white
athlete . . . Donna's a publicity hound . . . Dr. Mudge lied to
cover his own butt . . . Donna is delusional and ridden with guilt
. . . She's a victim of a racist media that can't tolerate a
strong, black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly everyone sympathizes with a young mother of two
children who buried her 27-year-old husband. But this isn't about
race or gender, and it isn't about medical negligence, either. Dr.
Gilbert Mudge was guilty of arrogance and certainly fell in love
with the TV cameras, but neither of two juries found him guilty of
medical negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Harris-Lewis is the one who didn't like the opinion of 12
capable cardiologists who concluded that Lewis's NBA career was
over and asked about drug abuse. She's the one who had him
transferred (without medical supervision) under the cover of
darkness from New England Baptist to Brigham and Women's Hospital.
She's the one who decided not to put a headstone on Reggie's grave
at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   She's the one who collected $12 million the Celtics owed on
Reggie's contract, then made this heinous statement to Boston
Magazine: ``I think about those firefighters in Worcester. Lots of
money is being raised for those families and I need to be taken
care of, too. Everybody has to say I'm greedy, but I do want my
money back this time around. Why should I lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Ours is a litigious society. We look to blame someone else when
something bad happens. A woman spills hot coffee on herself driving
through a fast-food window and wins a multimillion-dollar reward.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mudge made a mistake, but he didn't kill Reggie Lewis.
Sometimes we have to look at plaintiff accountability in addition
to defendant liability. Everyone feels bad that Reggie is gone, but
he is gone because he and his wife didn't listen to the opinion of
the Dream Team of physicians. They searched until they found a
doctor who would tell them what they wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Reggie died, Harris-Lewis told WBZ-TV, ``I
personally can't blame anyone. I think everyone that was involved
with Reggie's care, they did the best that they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Harris-Lewis said she sued Dr. Mudge to clear Reggie's
name of drug rumors, but the first trial served only to bring more
unsubstantiated drug rumors to the surface. In the end, the drug
stuff was tossed aside, settlement discussions went nowhere, and
Harris-Lewis lost a case that was inspired by either greed, a need
for attention, or _ and this is the best case we can make _ guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Not having experienced her loss, it's easy for any of us to say
that Donna Harris-Lewis should get on with her life. It has, after
all, been seven years. She has two beautiful children, a worthy
foundation, and the legacy of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   There have been too many bad days and too many people hurt.
Donna Harris-Lewis failed to win two trials. It's time to stop
looking back, move forward, and let Reggie rest in peace.

THOUGH ONLY 19, BADDELEY HAS SIGHTS SET ON PRO CAREER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Ron Baddeley, a former crew chief for legendary
driver Mario Andretti on the professional racing circuit, learned a
thing or two about world-class athletes while tuning and repairing
Indy cars in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He was struck by their single-minded focus. Years later, after
returning to his native Australia, he noticed the same trait in his
son, Aaron. Shortly after swinging his first golf club, the
teen-ager dropped off his local cricket and Australian rules
football teams, despite showing promise in both sports.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Aaron Baddeley was a 23-handicapper, smitten by a
game he could not master. Ron Baddeley, a non-golfer, questioned
the move, but put his 13-year-old son in touch with Dale Lynch, a
renowned swing teacher from Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Aaron consistently posted rounds in the 70s. By
14, he won the club championship at Croydon Golf Club. Now 19,
Baddeley's resume includes a championship at the 1999 Australian
Open, a Masters appearance and a berth in the opening round of the
GTE Byron Nelson Classic on Thursday at the Four Seasons Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad credentials for a teen-age amateur. Aaron Baddeley is
using an extended stay in the United States and Canada during the
2000 season, where he is competing primarily on sponsor's
exemptions, to determine his readiness for life as a professional
golfer.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Baddeley said he has been planning this junket for five
years. The idea surfaced after Aaron won the club championship at
Croydon and crystallized after his parents realized the most
effective way to discipline their son was to take away his golf
clubs. Even a one-day ban, Ron Baddeley said, triggered
conciliatory gestures and requests for immediate reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   It was after one such reunion of player and clubs that the
14-year-old prodigy uttered the words that struck a chord with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron told us, `I don't know what I'll do in life, but it'll
have something to do with golf,' '' Ron Baddeley said. ``I thought,
`Maybe he's got something here.' So we started that day, projecting
where he wanted to go with his golf career.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Aaron Baddeley's path has intersected with many of the
giants of the game, including the icon of Australian golf: Greg
Norman. In Baddeley, Norman envisions his successor as the poster
boy for Aussie golf in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' said Norman, who joined Colin Montgomerie on the
list of also-rans Baddeley dusted in November while claiming a
two-stroke victory at the 1999 Australian Open. ``Aaron has the
ability to do that mentally. Whether he wants the baton or not is
another thing. But I'd like to see that for Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a Tiger Woods, a Jack Nicklaus, a Seve Ballesteros ...
somebody with that type of charisma coming from Australia to keep
the game going and growing. It's important for us to do that. Aaron
has got the mindset to be that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has the desire. Asked about long-range goals during his
first lesson with Lynch in 1995, Baddeley responded that he wanted
to be on the PGA Tour by his 21st birthday. Five years later, he
has upped the stakes. The new target is Woods' status as the top
player on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger's the benchmark. I want to be better than the
benchmark,'' said Baddeley, who has played multiple practice rounds
with Woods at tour events this season. The youngster's performance
surprised the world's top-ranked golfer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hits the ball better than I did at the same age, no doubt
about it,'' Woods said. ``He controls his ball flight better.
There's no denying Aaron has great talent. It's just a matter of
what he does with that talent, how dedicated he'll be as he
matures.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on his track record, dedication to golf appears to be
Baddeley's long suit. Before his Masters debut, where he missed the
cut, Baddeley played nine practice rounds at Augusta National Golf
Club _ more than double the typical amount of preparation. Peers
describe him as a fixture on the practice tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I do, I want to be the best and I work hard at it,''
Baddeley said. ``My game is pretty solid, but there's room for
improvement. I'm a solid ball striker, and my \Rdriving\S accuracy
is improving as my swing gets better. I'm a pretty decent putter
from inside seven feet. If I have them outside that range, I pretty
much miss a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get to be like Tiger, where there are no
weaknesses. My goal is to get to the point where, if the ball
striking's not quite there, your short game picks it up and you
still shoot a good number. I'm not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's making strides in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   And those strides will not include time spent playing college
golf in the United States. Although he has received offers from
more than 25 schools, Baddeley nixed that idea after comparing
college curriculums to the academic load he's handling at the
Victoria Institute of Sport, where Lynch is headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do any school work there, which is perfect,''
Baddeley said. ``All we do is just golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley did that well enough in the final round of the 1999
Australian Open to post a closing 69 while paired with Montgomerie,
the No. 3 player in the world rankings. Monty, who finished third,
answered with a 71. Baddeley said he kept himself calm during
crunch time by singing between shots with caddie Dion Kippling, a
longtime friend. Most of the tunes they crooned were by Taxi Ride,
a popular Australian rock band.
</P>
<P>
   Fans who follow Baddeley at the Nelson should expect a similar
earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we've got a couple of new songs,'' Baddeley said. ``But
I think my parents will vouch that I have an extremely bad voice.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll also vouch that Aaron is in the final stages of his
``real-world education,'' as Ron Baddeley described it.
</P>
<P>
   Since his son emerged as a world-class amateur golfer in 1998,
Baddeley's parents have taken out loans and borrowed money against
credit cards totaling $72,500 for travel expenses to tournaments in
the United States. Included is a $28,000 bankroll for the 2000
season, which began with Baddeley finishing 57th at the Honda
Classic in his tour debut (March 9-12). After the Nelson, his next
scheduled appearance is at the Memorial Tournament (May 25-28), the
only event on the PGA Tour that offers an automatic berth to the
Australian Open champ.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Baddeley said his son will remain in North America until
September, playing events on the PGA and Canadian tours, before
deciding if he is ready to turn professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no difference in spending that money playing golf than
sending him to college,'' Ron Baddeley said. ``It's about a
career.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is Aaron's final year as an amateur, that's fine. If
not, that's fine, too. No one in the family, least of all the
prodigy, has an iron-clad timetable. Baddeley said plans to huddle
with his father and coach ``in September or October'' to review his
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't feel my game is up to scratch, I won't turn
professional,'' Baddeley said. ``If I feel my game is ready and my
coach feels the same way, there's no reason why I don't turn
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   What they want to avoid, Ron Baddeley said, is putting Aaron in
a situation similar to Justin Rose, the British teen-ager who
turned professional after finishing fourth in the 1998 British
Open. Rose, now 19, missed 21 consecutive cuts after turning
professional and competes today as a non-exempt member of the
European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley said he seeks a smoother transition to life as a
touring pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've dreamed of doing ever since I started
playing,'' Baddeley said. ``I wanted to play at Augusta, to play on
the PGA Tour. I've dreamed about it so vividly, it's not much out
of reality that I'm here. But it's probably come along a little
quicker than what I expected. I want to make sure I'm ready before
I take the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Baddeley's ``real-world education'' continues
this week at the Byron Nelson Classic. / nn

SUSPECTS IN COMPUTER VIRUS CASE DETAINED IN PHILIPPINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite and expand by 250 words.)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ More than a dozen law enforcement agents
staged a raid Monday on a Manila apartment from which they said a
malicious computer program was unleashed last week, disrupting
computer systems around the world. They took one resident into
custody and ordered his roommate, a woman, to turn herself in.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, including two representing the FBI, apparently
expected to find the computer from which the attack was launched. A
local official, Gil Alnas, said that no computer was found, but
that a box containing 17 items including telephones, wires,
computer disks and computer magazines was seized.
</P>
<P>
   The officials would not say what had led them to the apartment
and did not characterize the moves as arrests. And they said the
suspects _ reportedly bank employees, both in their 20s _ were not
necessarily the creators of the program, which they said could have
been the work of anyone using the computer. They said there might
be more suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was only the computer used to launch the virus that was
traced but anybody could use that computer,'' said an official of
the National Bureau of Investigation. ``The user here is invisible;
it could be anybody. The difference is that the person we have
identified is the registered owner of that computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, after three days of rumors, agents moved in on an
apartment in a three-story house in the lower-middle-class Manila
neighborhood of Pandacan. When the man, whom they named as Reomel
Ramones, 27, arrived after work, they escorted him, in handcuffs,
to their headquarters for questioning .
</P>
<P>
   A warrant was issued in the name of his roommate, Irene de
Guzman. If she is responsible, it would make this a rare case in
which a woman was implicated in a case of computer vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that they had reached her by telephone and that
she had promised to surrender in the company of a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that relatives of Ramones said the
authorities might actually be looking for a third person living in
the apartment _ de Guzman's unemployed sister, who recently
graduated from a Philippine computer school cited in e-mail that
was linked to the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, federal law enforcement officials said they
believed that the two suspects in the Philippines were responsible
for the virus, possibly along with one or more people yet to be
identified. The officials said American authorities were willing to
allow Filipinos arrested in the case to be prosecuted in the
Philippines, even though the virus created havoc, and financial
losses, in a number of countries.
</P>
<P>
   The destructive program, which apparently originated through two
e-mail addresses in the Philippines, has attributes of both a
computer virus, which spreads parasitically by attaching itself to
other programs, and a computer worm, which propels itself through
computer networks. It is one of the fastest-spreading and most
destructive acts of computer vandalism on record.
</P>
<P>
   The program was sent as an attachment to an e-mail with the
subject line ``I Love You.'' Once activated, it propagates itself
to e-mail addresses found on the victim's computer. By one
estimate, it infected some 45 million users in at least 20
countries, and some companies and government agencies had to shut
down their e-mail systems.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the program was designed to detect and steal
passwords from victims' computers and relay them to a Philippine
e-mail address. But that mechanism was disabled shortly after the
attack was detected last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several variations have followed in recent days, two of them
masking themselves as an e-mail joke and one as a receipt for a
Mother's Day gift. Operating as a sort of poisoned chain letter,
the messages, when opened, spread destruction through graphics and
other saved files.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts quickly identified the Philippines as the
apparent source of the attack and traced it to the Pandacan
neighborhood. Reports emerged several days ago that the suspect was
a 23-year-old man living in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators here first said they could not find a judge to
issue a warrant over the weekend, then said they could not find a
law under which to make out the warrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no law on this, so we are looking for a law,''
Federico Opinion, chief of the National Bureau of Investigation,
said before the raid Monday. The warrant was ultimately issued
under the Access Device Act, which governs the use of codes,
account numbers and passwords. It provides for a maximum punishment
of 20 years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have 36 hours to bring charges against detainees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, investigators said, charges could be brought in the
United States because the program also caused damage there. The FBI
has been assisting Philippine investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts said the delay in detaining the suspects and
seizing computer materials could have allowed them to destroy
evidence and make prosecution more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether the culprits were connected to the
AMA Computer College here, whose name is included in computer
messages related to the program. Michelle Navarro, the school's
dean of students, said it had more than 10,000 computer programming
students nationwide, including 3,000 at its main campus in Quezon
City in metropolitan Manila.
</P>
<P>
   According to a local radio report, at least one of the suspects
was a student at the school, perhaps in addition to his or her
professional work.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was complicated by the fact that the
programmer apparently used one of the prepaid Internet accounts
that are common here in which temporary user names and passwords
are issued that are difficult to trace.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation included evidence from Access Net, one of
several Philippine Internet service providers believed to have been
used by the programmer. The chief operating officer of the
provider, Jose Carlotta, said he had given extensive e-mail logs to
government officials.

   BOSTON _ Could this be the end? Could this be the final chapter
of the worst Boston sports story of them all? Let's hope so.
</P>
<P>
   There's never been a good day in the Reggie Lewis story. No
closure. No healing. No catharsis. There's not been one good moment
since the night Lewis collapsed running his lane on the parquet
floor against the Charlotte Hornets. That was back in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone lost. A woman lost her husband. Children lost their
dad. A mother lost her son. The community lost a good guy. The
Celtics lost a star guard. Reggie's bosses lost faith in their own
good judgment. Fans lost a favorite player. Insurance companies
surrendered $12 million. A law firm went bankrupt after spending
three years on the first trial. A doctor lost his good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   And now Donna Harris-Lewis has lost her latest negligence
lawsuit against Dr. Gilbert Mudge, and some will lose faith in the
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has an opinion about Harris-Lewis and her lawsuit:
She's greedy . . . The doctor thought he was smarter than everyone
else . . . Reggie damaged his heart by abusing drugs . . . There
would be no rumors about Reggie and drugs if he'd been a white
athlete . . . Donna's a publicity hound . . . Dr. Mudge lied to
cover his own butt . . . Donna is delusional and ridden with guilt
. . . She's a victim of a racist media that can't tolerate a
strong, black woman.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly everyone sympathizes with a young mother of two
children who buried her 27-year-old husband. But this isn't about
race or gender, and it isn't about medical negligence, either. Dr.
Gilbert Mudge was guilty of arrogance and certainly fell in love
with the TV cameras, but neither of two juries found him guilty of
medical negligence.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Harris-Lewis is the one who didn't like the opinion of 12
capable cardiologists who concluded that Lewis's NBA career was
over and asked about drug abuse. She's the one who had him
transferred (without medical supervision) under the cover of
darkness from New England Baptist to Brigham and Women's Hospital.
She's the one who decided not to put a headstone on Reggie's grave
at Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain.
</P>
<P>
   She's the one who collected $12 million the Celtics owed on
Reggie's contract, then made this heinous statement to Boston
Magazine: ``I think about those firefighters in Worcester. Lots of
money is being raised for those families and I need to be taken
care of, too. Everybody has to say I'm greedy, but I do want my
money back this time around. Why should I lose?''
</P>
<P>
   Ours is a litigious society. We look to blame someone else when
something bad happens. A woman spills hot coffee on herself driving
through a fast-food window and wins a multimillion-dollar reward.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mudge made a mistake, but he didn't kill Reggie Lewis.
Sometimes we have to look at plaintiff accountability in addition
to defendant liability. Everyone feels bad that Reggie is gone, but
he is gone because he and his wife didn't listen to the opinion of
the Dream Team of physicians. They searched until they found a
doctor who would tell them what they wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after Reggie died, Harris-Lewis told WBZ-TV, ``I
personally can't blame anyone. I think everyone that was involved
with Reggie's care, they did the best that they could.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Harris-Lewis said she sued Dr. Mudge to clear Reggie's
name of drug rumors, but the first trial served only to bring more
unsubstantiated drug rumors to the surface. In the end, the drug
stuff was tossed aside, settlement discussions went nowhere, and
Harris-Lewis lost a case that was inspired by either greed, a need
for attention, or _ and this is the best case we can make _ guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Not having experienced her loss, it's easy for any of us to say
that Donna Harris-Lewis should get on with her life. It has, after
all, been seven years. She has two beautiful children, a worthy
foundation, and the legacy of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   There have been too many bad days and too many people hurt.
Donna Harris-Lewis failed to win two trials. It's time to stop
looking back, move forward, and let Reggie rest in peace.

SAN FRANCISCO OUTLAWS SIZE DISCRIMINATION
</HEADLINE>
  By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was a big day for people tired of living in a
small world.
</P>
<P>
   The large and tall, the pudgy and the plump _ in short, anyone
who has ever had to endure the stigma of being overweight in a
society where thin is in _ have won a battle for the bulge, at
least here in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that says a lot about this city's legendary
sensitivity, the Board of Supervisors passed an ordinance on Monday
that makes it illegal to discriminate against a person based on the
nebulous category of ``size.''
</P>
<P>
   Known throughout the city as the ``fat ordinance,'' the measure
actually applies to skinny people, too. It adds height and weight
to the same antidiscrimination codes that provide protections for
people based on race, religion, color, ancestry, age, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, disability and place of birth.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance, inspired by a fitness company advertisement that
was plastered on a billboard last year (``When the aliens come,
they will eat the fat ones first'') adds San Francisco to a short
list of places in the nation _ Santa Cruz, Calif., Washington,
D.C., and the state of Michigan _ with similar statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinance has generated a number of jokes: one local
columnist said it inspired him to form the ``California Association
of the Not So Bad, Average and Mediocre.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for fat acceptance say the ordinance is a
necessary remedy for all those who have ever been insulted, denied
a seat at a restaurant or rejected for a job because of their
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're convinced that this is a serious problem,'' said Larry
Brinkin of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Marilyn Wann, a local leader of the National Association to
Advance Fat Acceptance, and the author of ``Fat! So?'' (Ten Speed
Press, 1998), called the legislation historic and necessary,
especially when about half of all Americans are overweight and one
in four is medically obese, according to government statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need a diet,'' said Wann, who said her 270 pounds on
a 5-foot-4 frame was her natural size. ``We need an end to
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of fat-acceptance groups is evident on the Internet.
Dozens of groups have Web sites, notably the Fat Activist Task
Force (www.naafa.org/fatf), formed in 1989 to pressure Hallmark
Cards to remove products poking fun at fat people from their
merchandise list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fat people are people,'' said John Cahill, a San Francisco
writer who carries his 250 pounds on a 6-foot frame. ``From the
remarks I get on the Muni trains, you'd think I was a deaf cow.''
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people of various sizes, most large, attended Monday's
board meeting to support the ordinance, which passed unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've counseled too many women and men in body-image support
groups who have had horrible experiences,'' said Melinda McBride, a
graduate student who attended the meeting to support the ordinance.
``People have gone in for medical treatment for very specific
things and they've been told to lose weight. It's important that
this law passed because it can have far-reaching implications
outside of San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ammiano, the president of the board and a former stand-up
comedian who wrote the ordinance, said he was prompted to act in
part because overweight people often become ``targets and even
scapegoats of many negative moral traits, such as laziness, low
intelligence, gluttony, bad health, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Cruz, a 1992 ordinance banning discrimination based on
height, weight, physical characteristics and sexual orientation was
invoked only once, by two women who believed they were denied
housing because they were a lesbian couple. The matter was resolved
through arbitration. That ordinance clears the way for victims of
discrimination to file a lawsuit seeking monetary redress, but none
have yet been filed.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan and Washington, D.C., where measures banning
discrimination based on height and weight or personal appearance
have been in force law since the 1970s, numerous suits have been
filed. Debbie Moss of Washington's Human Rights Commission, said
the ordinance was used by ``people being overweight, people having
their hair a certain way _ there are all kinds of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rob Morse, the San Francisco Examiner columnist who
advocated acceptance of mediocrity, said the new ordinance would
probably not change life here all that much. ``In the past, the
supes have voted to protect tropical hardwoods, the Burmese people
and San Francisco's two daily newspapers,'' he said, ``and look at
all the good that's done.''

BREAKTHROUGH ON CHROMOSOME 21, LINKED TO DOWN SYNDROME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) In the latest advance in the Human Genome Project,
scientists have unlocked the genetic code of chromosome 21, the
chromosome associated with Down syndrome and other serious
disorders.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough, which involved predicting the identity and
location of the chromosome's genes, is expected to eventually lead
to treatment for Down syndrome, in which affected children are born
with three copies of the chromosome instead of the usual two.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us the necessary information from which to sort out
what's going on in biological diseases involving chromosome 21,''
said Katheleen Gardiner, a researcher at the Eleanor Roosevelt
Institute in Denver. ``Once we know what the genes do in their
normal function, we should be able to develop drugs to ameliorate
problems in people with Down's or other disorders.''
</P>
<P>
   Chromosome 21 is the second fully deciphered chromosome _ 22 was
mapped last fall _ in the government-sponsored, international
effort to decode all 46 human genomes, which constitute the
blueprint of human life. The effort is expected to one day lead to
cures for inherited diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the international consortium behind the project,
which includes Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said Monday
they're 85 percent finished and on schedule to complete a rough
draft in June. They said the last remaining DNA will flow into
public databases in the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner, one of two Americans who joined with German and
Japanese scientists on the Chromosome 21 sequencing assignment,
said if researchers get lucky in understanding how the genes
operate, treatment for Down syndrome could be developed within
years; if not, it is more likely to be at least a decade. She said
Down syndrome currently is too complex a disorder to think in terms
of a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Down syndrome, diseases linked to chromosome 21 include
Alzheimer's, epilepsy, Lou Gehrig's disease (amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis), manic depression and a certain kind of leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   Chromosome 21 is the smallest of the 23 pairs of human
chromosomes. In a paper that will appear in Thursday's edition of
the journal Nature, the team researchers estimated that it has 225
genes, far less than the 545 on chromosome 22 and that up to a
third of it contains no genes.
</P>
<P>
   But the 225 genes are located in a complex tangle that will make
unraveling their functions challenging, Gardiner said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the key will be how quickly researchers find and learn
the function of the most important genes. It is unclear, for
example, whether a handful of genes underlies the disorders or
whether the general imbalance from the genes in the extra
chromosome causes the problem. But the decoding of chromosome 21 at
least establishes a catalog of the relevant genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a toolbox where we have what we need to explore
gene function,'' said Gardiner. ``Once we have that knowledge, we
should be able to modulate gene activity, to adjust it to the
correct level.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardiner also said that the chromosome mapping may shed light on
why people with Down syndrome have a very low rate of breast, lung
and gastrointestinal cancers. She said scientists suspect that an
extra copy of chromosome 21 has tumor-suppressing qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Down syndrome, the most common form of genetically caused mental
retardation, occurs in about one in 700 live births. It can also
cause congenital heart disease and Alzheimer's by age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Because scientists had originally expected chromosomes 21 and 22
to have more genes, the small number they found has led them to
lower the estimated total number of human genes to 40,000 from the
70,000 to 100,000 figure that has historically been believed.
Scientists said that may mean humans are not that different from
the fruit fly, which was fully deciphered in March. It was
estimated to have 13,600 genes.
</P>
<P>
   But a California bioinformatics company called DoubleTwist said
Monday it has downloaded the Human Genome Project's existing data
and, with its own software, already identified about 105,000
probable human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Team researchers said the map of chromosome 21 is 99.7 percent
complete. Technical limitations prevented a complete mapping.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium is in a race with a private rival, Celera Corp.
of Rockville, Md., which is rumored to be about to announce that
it's decoded all the chromosomes. The directors of the consortium's
leading centers said Monday they've decoded 16 million units of DNA
and are now moving into the final phase _ filling in the remaining
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've finished most of the hard part,'' said Richard Gibbs,
director of Baylor's Human Genome Sequencing Center. ``What we've
done is not perfect, but we're like a steaming juggernaut now.''

AMID PROTESTS, SCHWARZKOPF ACCEPTS TRUMAN GOOD NEIGHBOR AWARD  
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN MARTELLARO Knight Ridder Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The commander of allied forces in the Persian
Gulf War on Monday praised Harry S. Truman's leadership and
criticized current American military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, who directed the 1991
assault on Iraq, spoke after receiving the 28th annual Harry S.
Truman Good Neighbor Award in ceremonies at the Muehlebach Tower of
the Kansas City Marriott Downtown.
</P>
<P>
   At the luncheon, Schwarzkopf was heckled by about a half-dozen
protesters scattered amid the 600 guests. As the general stepped to
the podium, the protesters rose, one by one, and shouted criticisms
of U.S. economic sanctions against Iraq and continued bombing of
that country.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said those actions hurt innocent Iraqi children,
not dictator Saddam Hussein. Several luncheon guests responded with
boos and catcalls. The protesters were escorted from the hotel by
police, who did not make any arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Good Neighbor Award, presented since 1973 by the Harry S.
Truman Good Neighbor Award Foundation, came on the 116th
anniversary of the birth of the president, who lived in nearby
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Festivities were to continue Monday evening with the
presentation of the annual Harry S. Truman Award for Public
Service. This year the award went to the Truman Library and the
Truman Library Institute, the library's support organization. The
presentation was to be followed by groundbreaking for the two-year,
$17 million renovation of the library.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks to about 600 guests, Schwarzkopf said Truman
possessed the two key traits of effective leadership: confidence
and character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of no one who is more the epitome of leadership
than Harry S. Truman,'' Schwarzkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited two difficult decisions that Truman faced: whether to
desegregate the U.S. Armed Forces in 1948; and whether to use
nuclear weapons against Japan at the close of World War II. His
mention of Truman's desegregation order drew extended applause.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarzkopf also praised Truman for keeping the American
military strong, and he urged today's political leaders to
``maintain the kind of military we can all be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to take a hard look at what's happening with our
military. The situation is not as happy as we might want,''
Schwarzkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not elaborate during his prepared remarks. After the
luncheon, he said he was referring to recent reports of widespread
dissatisfaction among junior officers and reports that the military
was not meeting its re-enlistment goals.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized substandard housing for soldiers and their
families, and he said that military families subsisting on food
stamps was ``a national disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Fixing those situations, Schwarzkopf said, ``needs to be made a
national priority.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the protesters, Schwarzkopf said that ``nobody likes
what's happening in Iraq,'' but that lifting the sanctions would
allow Hussein to rebuild his military forces and threaten his
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saddam Hussein could stop it tomorrow if he would comply with
U.N. resolutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the hotel, about 15 to 20 persons lined up across the
street and protested the sanctions against Iraq.

COUPLES, ELS WITHDRAW FROM NELSON TOURNAMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Two former tournament champions, Ernie Els and
Fred Couples, withdrew Monday from the GTE Byron Nelson Classic,
both citing back injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Els, who ranks seventh on the PGA Tour money list, won the 1995
Nelson. Couples won the event in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Els told tournament officials that his injury surfaced Sunday
during the final round at the Compaq Classic of New Orleans, where
Els closed with a 73 and finished in a tie for 50th. Els, who has
earned $1,292,715 at PGA Tour events this season, said he was
unsure how long he would be sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   Couples' withdrawal came three days after he joined the field in
the waning moments before Friday's commitment deadline. Couples
missed the cut in New Orleans after shooting a 76 in Friday's
second round.
</P>
<P>
   The two vacancies in the 156-player field were filled by
alternates Bobby Cochran and Emlyn Aubrey.
</P>
<P>
   With the withdrawals, the Nelson field now features seven of the
top 10 players on the money list _ as well as 39 of the top 50 _
heading into the opening round Thursday at the Four Seasons Resort.
Neither Els nor Couples had committed to compete at the MasterCard
Colonial, May 18-21 in Fort Worth. COLONIAL MOVERS, SHAKERS
</P>
<P>
   By cashing sizable checks in New Orleans, four players took
themselves off the bubble for MasterCard Colonial invitations by
climbing into the top 80 on the season money list. Deadline for
reaching the top 80, and thereby landing Colonial invitations, was
the final round of the New Orleans event.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wave of Colonial qualifiers included Flower Mound
resident Paul Stankowski (No. 80), Irving resident Joel Edwards
(No. 62), Jimmy Green (No. 74) and Stephen Ames (No. 46).
</P>
<P>
   Stankowski made the biggest move, jumping from 91st to 80th with
a $57,800 payday in New Orleans. Edwards, Green and Ames _ ranked a
respective 71st, 72nd and 79th heading into the New Orleans event _
protected their Colonial spots by collecting Sunday paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial officials said Monday they have not added the latest
eligible players to their commitment list because they were still
trying to contact players and gauge their plans for tournament week
(May 18-21). In addition, Colonial officials met Monday to discuss
awarding their final two sponsor's exemptions. PAST CHAMPS IN
CHALLENGE
</P>
<P>
   Barring last-minute changes, the field for Tuesday's Celebrity
Skins Challenge will include three past Nelson champions: Nick
Price (1991), Loren Roberts (1999) and John Cook (1998). Others
expected to participate in the seven-hole competition, which begins
at 2:30 p.m., are Flower Mound resident Paul Stankowski, former
Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach and Cowboys running back Emmitt
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Two foursomes, with team members randomly selected, will compete
in the seven-hole competition, which will begin at hole No. 1 on
the TPC course. Admission is free. YOUTH CLINIC SET
</P>
<P>
   Byron Nelson will join four PGA Tour competitors, as well as
trick-shot specialist Dennis Walters, on the TPC practice range at
5 p.m. Tuesday for a youth clinic. Assisting Nelson will be Dallas
residents Justin Leonard, Harrison Frazar and Hank Kuehne, along
with Plano resident D.A. Weibring.
</P>
<P>
   Walters was a collegiate golfer in the 1970s at North Texas
State before a golf cart accident left him paralyzed from the waist
down. He will showcase his golf skills along with his dog, Benji
Hogan. Admission is free. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ Tuesday's opening ceremonies for the tournament will be held
at noon at the Byron Nelson statue adjacent to the first hole of
the TPC course. Among the early arriving professionals who spent
time Monday on the driving range or putting green were David Duval,
Lee Janzen, Nick Faldo and Fulton Allem.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Golf Channel will air a 90-minute documentary on Nelson's
life, titled ``Byron Nelson: A Texas Gentleman'', at 8 p.m.
tonight. James Garner will serve as narrator.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tim Finchem, PGA Tour commissioner, is expected to visit the
TPC course Tuesday for a series of scheduled meetings. nn

STATE DEPT. REPORT FAULTS U.S. ATTEMPTS TO GIVE EMERGENCY AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Note Bush and Gore comments in optional material) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the Clinton administration has made
``humanitarian intervention'' a centerpiece of its foreign policy,
it has done a poor job of delivering emergency aid to the people
who need it, an internal State Department report says.
</P>
<P>
   The ``humanitarian factor has become central to senior policy
makers' deliberations over U.S. foreign policy priorities,'' the
report states. But the officials who are responsible for easing
human suffering in foreign crises have little influence over
high-level decision making, and in some cases are deliberately shut
out, the study says.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by a top adviser to Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, chronicles the billions of dollars in
emergency assistance that have been sent to Afghanistan, Kosovo and
Sudan to help people whose lives have been disrupted by war and to
Honduras in the aftermath of a big hurricane in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Serbian forces began expelling ethnic Albanians
from Kosovo several days after the start of the NATO bombing
campaign, senior administration officials publicly insisted that
they were prepared for Serbian actions. Despite that, there was
little food and shelter on hand as hundreds of thousands of
refugees flooded into Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The report describes the administration's main funnel for
assistance to the expelled Kosovars, the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, as suffering from ``weak leadership'' in
the region and adds that the administration was unable to change
this.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan, where the United States has spent more than $1 billion
in the last 10 years trying to ease suffering in longest-running
civil war in Africa, the report says the assistance has become so
routine that it now appears to act as a substitute for peacemaking
efforts to resolve the conflict.

   The report, initiated by Morton H. Halperin, director of policy
planning at the State Department, and based on interviews with
senior administration officials, is an unclassified document. But
it was not made public until now.
</P>
<P>
   It was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the
National Security Archive, a group that specializes in collecting
government documents through requests and suits. The report was
completed in January and has been submitted to Albright's office.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining options for improving response, the report suggests
that the relief programs run by the Agency for International
Development could be folded into the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   This is one step short of what Senator Jesse Helms, the North
Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, has been recommending since he took charge of the panel
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, who favors abolishing the agency as an independent entity
and putting it into the State Department, said he believed
``bringing AID into the State Department will mean more effective
use of the aid,'' his spokesman, Marc Thiessen said.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, the two presumptive presidential
candidates have differing views of the ``humanitarian
intervention'' policy. George W. Bush Jr. has said he would be much
more selective in deciding where and when the United States would
intervene. Vice President Al Gore supported the interventionist
policy in a recent major speech. Gore was instrumental in
preventing the agency from being melded into the State Department
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In its account of how unprepared the administration was to meet
the needs of the Kosovo refugees, the report points to shortcomings
by American intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of anticipating an outpouring of refugees, the
administration was expecting the opposite, that nearly a million
people would be displaced in Kosovo during the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prevailing worst-case scenario was that one million
Kosovars would be displaced internally, prohibited from exiting,
and remain largely inaccessible, in the context of an ongoing air
war and a NATO determination not to launch a ground invasion,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Sudan, the report says, many in the administration
believe that too little effort has been made by top officials to
resolve the conflict. This has been partly caused by deep divisions
within the administration on how to deal with Sudan, with some
favoring total isolation of the government and even more assistance
to rebels in the south.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition, officials responsible for the large assistance
expenditures have been excluded from crucial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, officials from the Agency for International
Development and the State Department who managed the assistance
program were not consulted when the administration decided to shut
the American embassy in Khartoum in the mid-1990s because of
security concerns. The embassy closing undermined Washington's
ability to talk to Khartoum about helping civilian victims of the
war, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Monday, Halperin said that as foreign policy
becomes more entwined with relief assistance, government agencies
responsible for such assistance may not be organized in the right
way. ``The feeling was perhaps that the institutions created during
the Cold War might not be the best ones to deal with the new
realities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One conclusion of Halperin's report appears to be that if the
United States sees itself as an increasingly important source of
assistance in foreign emergencies, including those generated by
war, then the officials responsible for delivering the assistance
ought to have a greater voice.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, this voice is so muted that it is often kept out
of top deliberations, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   During the Kosovo war, for example, when the National Security
Council took control of the daily decision-making, officials
dealing with relief issues were asked ``to excuse themselves'' from
top-level meetings once they had finished talking about their
specific areas.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The time had come again for St. Patrick's Cathedral
to lay one of its own to rest. Deep in the cathedral's recesses, a
crypt awaited the body of Cardinal John O'Connor. But first the
rituals of a church and a city needed to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor had requested to be remembered as a simple priest, but
he was still a prince of the church. President Clinton, Vatican
emissaries and other dignitaries would need to pay their last
respects. But so would those with no bodyguards or colorful
vestments, from the schoolboy with the protruding shirttail to the
frail woman with a kerchief settled on her hair like a black mist.
</P>
<P>
   In juggling these many needs Monday, the 120-year-old cathedral
became a majestic setting for the glorious and the sad, the
frustrating and the comical. It provided a fitting last tribute to
the cardinal who had worshiped from its altar, railed against
injustices from its pulpit and enjoyed a good laugh within its
walls.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the muggy air invaded the cathedral's coolness
shortly after dawn, it was clear that good intentions would clash
with realities _ that the echoes of prayers at the front would
compete with the crackle of security radios at the back.
</P>
<P>
   As the regular Masses at 7 and 7:30 a.m. proceeded, so too did
the steady stream of people: a man in jogging clothes, another
wearing a red ironworkers T-shirt, a woman with a forehead
glistening with holy water. They lighted the votive candles in the
rows of amber-colored cups, collected their memorial cards bearing
O'Connor's portrait and sat on wooden pews.
</P>
<P>
   When the service ended, they filed past his body, then stopped
to sign one of the guest books on their way out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she had signed her name, Beatrice Carlino, of
Flushing, Queens, shrugged and said, ``Just to leave a little bit
of myself here.''
</P>
<P>
   Security concerns _ as well as fears that the procession of
hundreds of priests, bishops and cardinals might not begin on time
_ soon persuaded church officials to cancel the rest of the
morning's Masses and to close the cathedral's doors. Shortly after
8, Chief Allan Hoehl of the Manhattan South command tucked a
memorial card into his breast pocket and told a subordinate:
``That's it. No more Masses. No more people coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   When the word spread from the police officers at the barricades
to the people waiting outside the cathedral's door _ not far from a
church banner proclaiming, ``Open Wide the Doors to Christ'' _ some
dropped to their knees and began to pray. Others complained about
the commandeering of their church by the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable _ there are very important people who want
to come _ but I don't think it's fair,'' said Madeline Zampella,
who had traveled two hours from Brooklyn only to get lost and then
blocked from her destination. She had but one conclusion, ``Money
talks.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inside the nearly empty cathedral, a church official
ordered several ushers to place all the collection baskets in the
confessionals and to make sure ``there's no one sleeping'' in the
pews. Someone at the altar spoke into the microphone _ ``Testing,
testing, one, two'' _ as representatives of an Irish-American
organization posed for photographs alongside the cardinal's body.
</P>
<P>
   Then a head usher led pallbearers down the aisle to rehearse the
climactic moment of the funeral. At the last pew, the usher clicked
his heels, turned to his right and instructed his followers to
pivot sharply around the corner. After a few paces, he clicked his
heels again and turned toward the cathedral's crypt. The men who
followed seemed daunted by the task before them.
</P>
<P>
   Dignitaries and guests began to arrive about noon, as crowds of
the uninvited pressed against the metal and wooden barricades set
up near the cathedral, which faces Fifth Avenue between East 50th
and 51st Streets. Some took the sweltering scene in stride; Pamela
Montana, of Providence, R.I., distinctive in a red dress and pink
feather boa, said she had stopped on her way to the airport to pay
her respects. And when the anticipated arrival of President Clinton
forced the police to block pedestrian traffic on Madison Avenue,
those among the delayed whipped out cell phones to call waiting
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see you,'' a woman in white linen said, gazing up at an
office building across the street.
</P>
<P>
   Others were less gracious. At various entrances to the
cathedral, dozens of people explained with increasing anxiety that
there must have been some mistake _ they were indeed among the
invited. But the security officers _ from the Secret Service, the
police department or the archdiocese, identifiable by the color of
the pins on their lapels _ adhered to the lists in their hands. Two
nuns who glided past the barricades were soon escorted back to the
street, with deference.
</P>
<P>
   And when a security officer followed the letter of his
instructions too closely, an official from the archdiocese rushed
over to say that she recognized Bishop John R. McGann, the recently
retired leader of the Diocese of Rockville Centre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' the officer mumbled, as the prelate smiled and walked
through.
</P>
<P>
   Across Madison Avenue from the cathedral's rear entrance, the
New York Palace Hotel was awash with clerics from around the world.
There were monks in the men's room, priests in the dining room,
bishops in the lobby. They greeted one another with great
affection, made various plans to meet after the funeral, then
followed instructions to proceed across the street.
</P>
<P>
   At 1:20, the solemn procession began to move slowly past the
huge bronze doors and up the cathedral's center aisle: cardinals,
archbishops, bishops, priests, deacons, seminarians _ so many that
those bronze doors did not close until nearly 1:55. By now the
cardinal's mahogany coffin at the foot of the altar was closed and
draped in a cloth of white to symbolize resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   The rituals of city and church continued. Outside the cathedral,
police officers sweating in blue uniforms stood watch over the
people and visitors of New York, so accustomed to paying tribute by
standing behind barricades. Inside, a ceremony resounded with the
Christian belief in rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   At the precise moment that a television reporter in the back
began to speak into her cell phone, the choir in the loft above
sang a full-throated series of amens, as if in remonstration; the
woman covered her ear and scurried for quieter ground. Then came
the traditional exchanges of peace, which included Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani's shaking hands with his opponent in this fall's Senate
race, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When the Mass ended, it was time to take the coffin to the crypt
below. Once again, the head usher led the gray-gloved pallbearers
down the center aisle, only this time their burden was real. At the
last pew, he clicked his heels, and the procession pivoted to its
right.
</P>
<P>
   A few seconds later he clicked his heels again. The sound
echoed. The coffin soon disappeared from view, and members of a
city and a church gave their cardinal one last round of applause.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WARNS LOS ANGELES POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adding new drama to a growing police corruption
scandal here, the nation's top civil rights enforcement officer
warned Los Angeles police and city officials Monday that they would
have to make long-sought changes in police training and procedures
or face a lawsuit that could give the federal government final say
over major policies of the department.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lann Lee, the acting assistant attorney general for civil
rights, briefed local officials on the results of the Justice
Department's four-year investigation into allegations of abusive
behavior and racial discrimination by Los Angeles officers. Lee
said the inquiry concluded that the department had enough evidence
of civil rights violations to file a so-called pattern and practice
discrimination suit contending systemic failings.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour meeting, Lee issued a statement saying the
Justice Department was ``willing to defer filing suit to allow the
city the opportunity to work toward a voluntary settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the city had accepted an offer to begin discussing a
resolution of the matter and had agreed to schedule a meeting next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Such a lawsuit would be a huge political and legal black eye for
the nation's second largest city, whose police department is
already reeling from charges of brutality, corruption and evidence
fabrication that have led to the dismissal or suspension of some 30
officers and the overturning of more than 80 convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The case became public after a former police officer confessed
to handcuffing and shooting an unarmed gang member, then framing
him by planting a gun near his paralyzed body.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and local officials, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Lee had arrived in Los Angeles armed with a letter outlining
the department's findings. One possible outcome, the officials
said, would be for Los Angeles to promise a series of changes, in
the form of a consent decree similar to those the Justice
Department has already reached with police departments in
Pittsburgh and Steubenville, Ohio, and with the New Jersey State
Police, where the aim was to bar racial profiling in traffic stops
by troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles would be the biggest city to come under such direct
federal scrutiny, though the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn has
amassed what officials call evidence of systemwide problems in the
New York Police Department's handling of brutality complaints, and
is pressing New York for changes with the threat of a similar suit.
</P>
<P>
   The action here comes as the Los Angeles police plan security
for the Democratic National Convention in August, in what has been
planned as a celebration of Southern California's rebound from the
earthquake, fires and riots of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials said that Lee had informed them of the meeting
only on Friday, and that it had been arranged with such apparent
haste that Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican who has staked
the success of his administration on expanding the police force and
cutting crime, was not even in town; he was in Washington on city
and convention-related business. The city attorney, the chief of
police, the president of the civilian police commission and
representatives of Riordan attended the meeting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Justice Department has conducted its inquiry since 1996,
centering on questions of excessive use of force by officers, under
a 1994 federal law that authorized federal prosecutors to go to
court to seek changes in the operations of local departments. It
was inspired by a tumultuous period here that saw the beating of a
black motorist, Rodney King, the subsequent acquittal of police
officers charged in the case and the resulting riots that tore the
city apart in 1992. In the wake of the King case, a blue-ribbon
commission recommended a host of changes in department policy,
including a new system for tracking ``problem'' officers who
amassed large numbers of misconduct complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department allocated money to help finance the
system, but in recent months it has become clear that efforts to
establish it fell victim to bureaucratic errors, infuriating
Justice officials.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the police and local district attorney made public
their own sweeping investigations into contentions of
evidence-tampering, false testimony and brutality among officers in
the gritty Rampart division on the western edge of downtown, in the
city's worst corruption case in half a century. As that inquiry has
grown, it has led to bitter infighting between Police Chief Bernard
Parks and District Attorney Gil Garcetti, with Riordan at one point
reduced to accusing them of behaving like children. The Justice
Department's investigation had failed to uncover the Rampart case,
which local officials here said left the federal government feeling
pressure to step up its inquiry. In March, Lee told local officials
that the department was stepping up its civil rights investigation.
But according to one city official present at that meeting, Lee
said that the federal government had ``no interest in running the
department,'' though the Justice Department had a ``role to play''
in helping introduce reforms that had worked in other police
departments around the country.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1997, the special litigation section of the
department's civil rights division obtained two consent decrees
intended to remedy misconduct in the Pittsburgh and Steubenville
police departments. The decrees required those departments to adopt
new programs for training, supervising and disciplining officers
and instituting systems to receive, investigate and respond to
civilian complaints of misconduct.

McCAIN ADVISERS SAY SENATOR WILL FORMALLY ENDORSE BUSH TUESDAY 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Sen. John McCain, the reform-minded Republican
whose support could help rally independents to the GOP ticket, will
endorse George Bush Tuesday after a meeting with the Texas
governor, McCain advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   The aides had cautioned last week that McCain, who was Bush's
most serious challenger in the battle for the Republican
presidential nomination, was likely to withhold a formal
endorsement until later in the campaign. But they said Monday night
that the Arizona senator, after a brief telephone conversation
Sunday with Bush, wanted to take the formal step despite continued
differences with the governor, especially on the need for campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   One aide said McCain had decided to ``get the issue (of an
endorsement) behind him.'' That could change, one aide said, if
Bush irked McCain during their meeting, but neither side expected
that to occur. When aides to the two men were unable to agree on a
written statement to be issued after the meeting, Bush initiated
the phone call to McCain to again express his personal admiration
for the senator.
</P>
<P>
   John Weaver, the Texas-based political consultant who was senior
adviser to McCain's campaign, called Joe Albaugh, Bush's campaign
manager, in Austin Monday night to inform him of the senator's
decision, a Republican source said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said repeatedly in recent weeks that he supports
Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee. When asked during a press
conference Monday afternoon if he might go ahead and immediately
endorse Bush if their one-on-one meeting went well, McCain said,
``Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   When an aide told Bush about the prospect of an early
endorsement from McCain, the governor smiled and said ``that's
good,'' according to Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said the Bush camp had not been planning on an
immediate endorsement from McCain but it would be ``a pleasant
surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving in Pittsburgh on Monday afternoon, Bush was cautious
about getting formal backing from McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be up to John,'' Bush said. ``Of course I'd
like his help. He has said out loud on more than one occasion he
was looking forward to campaigning for me for president. I take him
for his word. I'm confident we're going to have a good visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said Bush's call to McCain on Sunday lasted about two
minutes and ``was cordial. The governor was reaching out before the
meeting to send a signal that `I'm looking forward to meeting with
you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two men are to meet alone for about an hour over coffee and
Danish Tuesday in a Pittsburgh hotel and then hold a news
conference about 10 a.m. EDT that some cable news channels may
carry live.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting had been imperiled as recently as 10 days ago when
Bush aides were quoted as saying there was a lot of downside and
not enough upside in the session for their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's continued strength as a force in the presidential
campaign can be measured in part by his strong showing in recent
polls. Despite the senator's repeated denials of interest in an
independent run for the White House, some national surveys show he
could get as much as a quarter of the vote as an opponent of Bush
and Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the primaries in February and March, the surveys
show McCain draws especially strongly among voters not
traditionally aligned with either party. Some analysts believe
McCain's appeal is a personal one based on his history as a
prisoner of war in the Vietnam conflict and his penchant for
tweaking Republican orthodoxy, including his assault on the current
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain clashed repeatedly during the primary season on
the senator's call for an end to ``soft money,'' the unlimited,
largely unregulated donations flowing to the two major political
parties primarily from business and union interests.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no formal agenda for the session, McCain said
he expected to discuss a wide range of issues, including political
reform, military reform, education and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   McCain repeated his disinterest in being Bush's vice
presidential running mate but refused to rule out accepting a
Cabinet job, such as defense secretary, in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush flew to Pittsburgh from New York, where he joined President
Clinton, Gore and a host of other political figures at the funeral
of Cardinal John O'Connor.

 &HT;    Big Game jackpot fever is getting `really wild'
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh the hunger, the churning greed, the swelling fantasies
driving the human stampede to gas stations, convenience stores _
any place selling a Big Game ticket for America's largest-ever
lottery jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   People even traveled across state lines carrying cash from
friends and family, chasing dreams of instant wealth in a game
where the chances of winning are one in more than 76 million.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 18th Big Game drawing since March 7 without a grand
prize winner, pushing the projected jackpot to more than $325
million.
</P>
<P>
   And pushing buyers and sellers into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   More than $12 million in tickets have been sold since Saturday
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The sales pace was enough to turn a typically sedate country
store into the hottest place in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets really wild in here,'' said David Davis. The owner of
Davis Country Store in Fayette County figures he has added $600 in
profits in the past week, with people buying more gas, soda and
other things along with tickets.
</P>
<P>
   When no one won Friday night's big prize of $220 million,
lottery officials from the seven states pumped up the purse again.
</P>
<P>
   The result: A crush of customers, a bonanza of ticket sales, the
need for separate lottery lines, additional clerks and more
security.
</P>
<P>
   Some outlets are working hard for the nickel they get out of
each $1 ticket they sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' said Donnie Crownover, manager of the Pleasant
Hill BP station in Duluth, Ga, whose ticket sales have tripled to
$6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some regular shoppers have gotten angry about the congestion and
stalked out of crowded stores. ``But we're getting so many extra
customers that it's not hurting us,'' said David Gaspard, a manager
at the Circle K at Sigman Road in Rockdale County.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 percent of lottery sales revenue is channeled into
state education through pre-kindergarten programs, computer
technology and HOPE Scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Lottery Corp. president Rebecca Paul said a strong sales
year can increase bonuses for lottery workers, including herself.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers actually net about 7 percent over the course of a year
on lottery sales, because of the different games, but some store
owners say it's too much work.
</P>
<P>
   Hiring an extra hand isn't worth it, said Danny Hyde, owner of
Hickory Road Market outside Canton, who has given up selling
tickets. ``You would have to sell a hundred tickets an hour to pay
your help.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchandise sales are down at some stores. ``People don't want
products, all they want are tickets,'' said Betty Boleman, manager
of the Circle K.

FOR RANGERS, THERE'S JUST NOT ANY RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ He came careening around the corner, his
helmet buckled down tight, a hockey stick twirling lightly in his
fingers and a mad glint in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   Passers by in the hallway scattered to make room for John
Wetteland, the Rangers' closer, as he performed his Mike Modano
impression on in-line skates within the narrow confines of the
Rangers' clubhouse and adjacent hallways.
</P>
<P>
   It is comforting to know that some things about the Rangers'
bullpen haven't changed: Wetteland is still slightly insane.
</P>
<P>
   Almost six weeks into this tumultuous season, however, that is
about the only similarity between this year's Rangers relief corps
and last season's.
</P>
<P>
   It keeps coming back to the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, injuries have decimated the team. Yes, the defense stinks.
The Rangers' youngsters _ and some of the veterans, too _ have
exasperated manager Johnny Oates by continually missing signs and
making mental errors. Juan Gonzalez's steady RBI bat _ the RBI bat
he had when he was here anyway _ has been missed.
</P>
<P>
   But you can throw all those alibis into the nearest dumpster.
The season's biggest disappointment, and the single greatest reason
for the Rangers' staggering 13-17 start , is the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were pitching like we did last year,'' setup man Tim
Crabtree admitted, ``we'd have at least _ ``at least'' _ five more
victories.''
</P>
<P>
   Five more victories, instead of losses, would mean an 18-12
record, the Rangers and Mariners would have been battling for first
place in the A.L. West when their three-game series opened last
night and you and I wouldn't be having this conversation.
</P>
<P>
   That's the difference a bad bullpen can make. How bad has this
one been? There are better numbers on toe tags at the morgue.
</P>
<P>
   At The Ballpark in Arlington, the marketing department is
thinking of changing the name to ``cowpen.'' They'll paint the
fences in black and white spots.
</P>
<P>
   When Oates goes to the mound to change pitchers, cell phones all
over the stadium speed-dial 911, so the fire department can be
standing by.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it's a veritable ``rimshot'' paradise out there.
</P>
<P>
   When the bullpen gave up just one run in Sunday's 7-6 loss to
the A's, it actually lowered the group's season ERA to 6.10, third
worst by a relief corps in the American League. As the
Rangers-Mariners series began last night, the Rangers' bullpen had
allowed at least one run in each of the team's past five games and
had given up multiple runs in 13 of the team's 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not get bogged down in mere numbers. Numbers don't
begin to encompass the sordid sorriness of the Rangers' 'pen.
Nothing disheartens a team more than to work hard for a lead, only
to see the bullpen blow it in the seventh or later.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Rangers' relievers, with the exception of Francisco
Cordero, have pitched as well as expected this season, but the real
heart of the problem lies with Crabtree and Jeff Zimmerman. They
are Oates' two right-handed setup men, which means, more often than
not, that he's entrusting them to get a lead to Wetteland in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   When the league is hitting .359 against one and .302 against the
other, that just hasn't been happening as often as anyone would
like.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree, who has consistently hit 95 on the scoreboard radar
gun _ about the only thing he's done consistently _ is as baffled
as anyone after a stellar season a year ago when he was 5-1 with a
3.46 ERA. In his first 14 games this year, the ERA is 9.20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not walking people (three in 14 2/3 innings), my
strikeout-walk ratio is about 5-to-1 and the velocity on my
fastball is good,'' Crabtree said. ``It gets to the point where you
ask yourself, `What am I doing wrong?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm eating the wrong food or living the wrong lifestyle
of something. I know I'm a better pitcher now than I've ever been
in my life. I have better stuff now than I ever have. I just can't
get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a problem when you're a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree and Zimmerman have had the same trouble. They might
make just one bad pitch in an at-bat, but that's the one that's
getting ripped. They're getting away with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree grooves too many fastballs. Hitters are sitting on
Zimmerman's slider. When he makes a good one, they still can't hit
it. But if he makes a mistake with it, hangs it a little, they're
all over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of low points this year,'' said
Zimmerman, who lost a game in Baltimore when he balked in the
winning run, ``like there were a lot of high points last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a prediction: It will turn around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see good health,'' pitching coach Dick Bosman said of his
two struggling right-handers. ``I see a good work ethic and I see
quality stuff. I have to think it's going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   It must, or the Rangers will never make the run for the division
title that Oates and general manager Doug Melvin expected.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, we'll let Wetteland's pregame warmup gear set the
theme for the bullpen. Just call it the ``penalty box.''

ROGERS IS LATEST EX-CLIPPER TO MAKE GOOD ELSEWHERE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Go ahead and laugh at Phoenix's chances of
finishing off the Lakers. Rodney Rogers is inured to your scoffing,
your sneering, your scorn.
</P>
<P>
   After putting in four years with the Clippers, he is immune to
every strain of sarcasm. So feel free to say the Suns won't win a
quarter against the Lakers, much less a game and certainly not
their Western Conference semifinal best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers will shrug it off because your words can't hurt him. Not
like all that losing did in bygone seasons. If you really want to
know the truth, the 205 losses in four years was what was killing
him.
</P>
<P>
   A 28-point loss like the one the Suns suffered Sunday might look
bad to you. But at least it came in the second week of May, in the
second round of a playoff series. Rogers will rub out from his
jersey Shaquille O'Neal's sneaker marks and come back more
determined than ever in Wednesday's Game 2, you can count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rogers is not a loser. He just played for one in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes most people fail to make such a distinction. Truth
to tell, his own perception had become horribly blurred by the time
the Suns stepped in and signed him to a free-agent contract last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Saved him, really.
</P>
<P>
   Same as someone will snatch from the jaws of Donald Sterling
forward Maurice Taylor this summer and Lamar Odom a few summers
from now.
</P>
<P>
   Lamond Murray went from the Clippers to Cleveland and became the
Cavaliers' second-leading scorer this season. Rogers went from
worthless to the league's most valuable sixth man.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things never change there,'' Rogers said, referring to
Clipperville, the closest thing the NBA has to Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   Things will never change there, Rogers insinuated, as long as
Sterling remains the owner. For the exodus of skilled-turned-sullen
players to stop, ``the league is going to have to force Sterling
into selling the team,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Until that happens, you can bet that what the Clippers lack in
wins they'll continue to more than make up for in players who leave
L.A., then write Hollywood endings to their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because to win, ``you have to have your sanity,'' Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   His comeback story began over the summer, when he submitted
himself to a rigorous conditioning regimen.
</P>
<P>
   If he was going to lose the reputation he had acquired with the
Clippers as a malcontent, Rogers realized he needed to shed a few
pounds and firm up his attitude. Mentally, he really let himself go
during last year's lockout-shortened season.
</P>
<P>
   In between pouting, Rogers played an average of 20 minutes a
night, well below his 32.9 of the season before. He averaged 7.4
points, the fewest of his seven-year NBA career.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're losing, a lot of things happen,'' Rogers said.
``You get very frustrated. Sometimes you get a temper, those sorts
of things. When I came [to Phoenix] I had to kind of change my
whole attitude. I had a lot of bad habits coming into this season,
having played with losing teams. I had to change that mentality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in and and tried to show that I'm a hard worker, and I
just wanted to play.''
</P>
<P>
   After rotting not far from Hollywood and Vine, Rogers didn't
need to be a star. He was perfectly content to be part of the Suns'
supporting cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was be a winner and not lose all the
time,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared in all 82 games _ all but seven as a reserve _ and
averaged 13.8 points. He shot 43.9 percent from beyond the 3-point
arc to nicely complement the Spurs' slash-happy backcourt of Jason
Kidd and Penny Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   The one team that gave him trouble was _ you guessed it _ the
Lakers (must be some curse left over from his Clippers days). In
four games, Rogers made only four of 18 3-pointers. He was 0 for 5
from beyond the arc in Sunday's 105-77 defeat on his way to a very
quiet seven points in 29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If the Suns are going to put any heat on the Lakers, Rogers, 28,
needs to cause more commotion than that.
</P>
<P>
   All season long, he has drawn plenty of notice. Wherever the
Suns played, people would come up to Rogers and welcome him back,
as though he had spent the past four years in exile.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he had in a manner of speaking. Whatever, it was nice to
have his peers pat him on the backside and say, ``It's good to see
you get back on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers shudders when he thinks how close he came to walking away
from basketball last year. He gave serious consideration to cutting
his losses, to finding some other line of work that wasn't so
dehumanizing.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers owns a business with seven dump trucks, and after four
years with the Clippers, hauling dirt and gravel was looking like a
mighty attractive alternative to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that way plenty of times,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson, who was eavesdropping on the interview from his
cubicle next to where Rogers was sitting in the visitors' locker
room at Staples Center, looked at his teammate quizzically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give up? Really?'' Robinson said, softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was,'' Rogers said, looking Robinson in the eye.
``Seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   You can go ahead and think Rogers feels great, being back here
in L.A., playing in the Clippers' building, dancing on his former
team's grave.
</P>
<P>
   But you'd be dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible feeling to see that everyone who leaves the
Clippers goes somewhere else and ends up playing better and
accomplishing something,'' Rogers said. ``It's kind of sad.'' &QL;

STONE &AMP; WEBSTER HAS BUYER, WILL SEEK BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Stone &AMP; Webster Inc. plans to sell most of its assets
and seek bankruptcy protection, ending a 111-year run for the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1889 by a pair of young graduates from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the firm grew on orders for
things like installing the first electric lights in the Boston's
Colonial Theatre; later its engineers build nuclear-power plants
and ski jumps for the Calgary Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, it stumbled as it tried to adjust to risky
lump-sum contracts.
</P>
<P>
   To escape a liquidity crisis, it said Monday it has signed a
letter of intent with Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. in which Jacobs
would acquire most of Stone &AMP; Webster's assets in exchange for $150
million in cash, plus a $50 million credit facility and assumption
of liabilities. The deal would make Pasadena, Calif.-based Jacobs a
powerful player in the consolidating heavy-construction industry.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster also said it will file a voluntary petition for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code following a
formal sale agreement later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would provide an exit for Stone &AMP; Webster, whose shares
have fallen 74 percent this month after delays at a power-plant
project in Tiverton, R.I. forced it to take a $27.5 million charge
and begin sales negotiations. Fearing bankruptcy, customers like
the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant had already begun to cancel
the firm's contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreements are humbling for Stone &AMP; Webster, one of New
England's oldest commercial dynasties. Because of the bankruptcy
filing, Stone &AMP; Webster said it is ``not possible to determine at
the present time what value, if any, will ultimately be received by
Stone &AMP; Webster's stockholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster's problems at Tiverton surprised many, since the
gas-fired power plant is among a score of such projects going up
around New England that were supposed to shore up troubled local
construction companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the plant's developers signed up Stone &AMP; Webster under what
is known as a fixed-price or lump-sum contract: The builder agrees
to construct a project for a specific price; if it's more
expensive, the builder loses money.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, such contracts pay higher returns but are regarded as
riskier by investors. Such pacts reflect the strong competition in
the construction industry, from rivals like Morrison Knudsen Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Stone &AMP; Webster avoided such terms. According to
an authorized company history, founders Charles Stone and Edwin
Webster regarded lump-sum contracts as being ``antithetical to a
professional philosophy.'' Better, they felt, to trust engineers to
build a project properly and be paid a percentage of the total
cost.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked throughout the 1900s, when Stone &AMP; Webster
put up everything from Mississippi River dams to breweries. It also
constructed buildings for the Manhatten Project during World War
II, which positioned Stone &AMP; Webster to build nuclear power plants
after the war, including the Yankee Rowe, Maine Yankee, and
Connecticut Yankee reactors.
</P>
<P>
   But the last chief executive with ties to the company's old
guard, Bruce C. Coles, quit in 1995, amid criticism from
shareholders about the company's lagging profits and its stock
price.
</P>
<P>
   A new CEO, Kerner Smith, vowed to adjust to changes in the
industry. Developers say he failed to instill the new philosophy in
enough Stone &AMP; Webster construction managers to control spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worlds of hard-money contracting and cost-plus are
different worlds,'' one customer said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 51 percent of the company's revenue was earned through
lump-sum contracts; it has reduced that percentage since last year,
analysts say, though apparently too late.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to lump-sum contracts alone didn't doom Stone &AMP;
Webster. It also suffered with the Asian currency crisis of 1997,
which halted work on a $2.3 billion ethylene complex in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic construction was supposed to offset overseas woes,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every (engineering and construction) company that's
tried to do lump-sum work has gotten burned on it,'' said Credit
Suisse First Boston analyst Charles Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hasn't been available for interviews since the company
announced its troubles last week. In a press release, Smith said
that the proposed deal, which has approvals from its directors,
``is in the best interest of all the company's constituencies,
including its employees, shareholders, clients, suppliers and
lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   John Prosser Jr., Jacobs' chief financial officer, said the
company expects to hire most of Stone &AMP; Webster's operating
employees but that more specific plans haven't be determined.
Meanwhile, Stone &AMP; Webster said it expects to continue operating
and paying its roughly 7,000 worldwide employees ``in the normal
manner.'' It will complete ongoing projects, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster exit could be a blow to New England, where the
company has about 1,700 employees. Jacobs' Prosser said the company
hasn't determined exactly what shifts it might make in the work
force. Stone &AMP; Webster has about 4,000 workers worldwide and nearly
7,000 when temporary contract workers are included. Employment
peaked at about 15,000 workers worldwide in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster's troubles mirrored those of Raytheon Co.'s
engineering and construction unit, which also built many nuclear
plants, in the 1960s and 1970s. Last month, Raytheon agreed to sell
the division to Morrison Knudsen Corp. of Boise, which also
considered buying Stone &AMP; Webster.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster had hoped to avoid a sale and some thought it
could have stumbled along for several more fiscal quarters. To save
cash, it suspended its dividend last year and has been selling
office buildings. These steps helped Stone &AMP; Webster pay down total
debt to $45 million at the end of 1999, from $131 million at the
end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But as problems on lump-sum projects continued to crop up, Stone
&AMP; Webster found little forbearance from banks and business
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, CanFibre Group Ltd. of Toronto has
ended Stone &AMP; Webster's contract to build a $71.5 million
fiberboard plant in Lackawanna, N.Y. Stone &AMP; Webster was behind in
payments to several of its subcontractors, some of whom quit work
in protest, said CanFibre president Chris Carl.
</P>
<P>
   Stone &AMP; Webster was signed up to work on a lump-sum basis, Carl
said, on a firm deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you finance a private facility, you finance it with the
expection that you'll be able to start earning revenue at a
specific point in time,'' Carl said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outraged parents from New Jersey and Long Island
called it a travesty and declared Mayor Rudolph Giuliani a tyrant.
One Long Island 18-year-old, in tears, called his mother and
complained that court holding cells were hot and overcrowded and
that he could not eat the jail food that guards offered him. And a
19-year-old vegetarian from Teaneck, N.J., said guards refused to
provide her with a meatless sandwich, despite a sign saying they
were available.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's zero tolerance approach to petty crime collided with
a new opponent over the weekend _ marijuana-smoking suburbanites.
Police arrested 312 protesters, many of them young people from
outside the city, at a marijuana legalization rally in Lower
Manhattan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The result was shock and indignation from protest organizers and
dozens of suburban parents, who abruptly learned what some city
dwellers, particularly minorities, have complained about for the
last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Giuliani administration's continuing crackdown
intended to improve quality of life, minor offenses ranging from
smoking marijuana in public to jumping a turnstile typically result
in a night in a sweltering, overcrowded and urine-soaked holding
cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even live in New York, but the way Giuliani's
treating the homeless _ treating a kid as an adult _ I don't
know,'' fumed Bill Walters, an equipment technician from the Jersey
Shore who waited from 9 a.m. Sunday until 1:45 a.m. on Monday for
his 17-year-old son to be released. ``Let's put his kid in jail and
see how he feels. If I lived in New York, I'd vote against him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Millennium Marijuana March New York concluded in
Battery Park on Saturday, some of the participants began smoking
marijuana, and the police rounded up almost a third of the 1,000
people they estimated participated in the march. Most were charged
with smoking marijuana in public, a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   The number of arrests surprised march organizers, participants
and dozens of parents who crowded the Manhattan Criminal Courts
Building on Sunday, waiting for their children to be released. Many
parents were stunned to learn that New York police generally no
longer issue court appearance tickets for minor crimes and that, as
a result, they could not see their children for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested complained of abusive treatment by officers who
they said seemed to arrest people regardless of whether they were
smoking, roughed-up some protesters and left others locked in
sweltering vans for hours.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, who would not give her name, said of the police:
``They treated us like mass murderers. They were rude.'' Two
complained of being given tea without sugar.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, those arrested had no criminal record and so were
not required to post bail and were told that the charges would be
dropped if they are not arrested for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Detective Madelyne Dalindo, a Police Department spokeswoman,
said there was a reason why each person was held overnight. One
might have lacked valid identification, for example, and another
might have had an outstanding warrant, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Antenen, a spokesman for the City Department of Corrections,
said that water, food and telephones were available to prisoners
once they were put in holding cells.
</P>
<P>
   David Kapner, the arraignment supervisor for the Legal Aid
Society who worked on the arrest cases Sunday night, said the
complaints of mistreatment were nothing new. Kapner said the city's
poor have long born the brunt of the quality-of-life crackdown, and
when more affluent people experience it they are usually stunned.

MATURINO RESENDIZ PLEADS INSANITY, ADMITS KILLING 9 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Accused serial killer Angel Maturino Resendiz placed
his life in the hands of jurors during the opening day of his
capital murder trial Monday by pleading insanity and admitting to
murdering nine people in three states.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz is charged in Houston with the December 1998
murder of Dr. Claudia Benton, one of the nine people he admitted
killing _ six in Texas, two in Illinois and one in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defense attorney's acknowledgment of guilt and his
graphic descriptions of each murder, the Harris County jury still
must decide whether Maturino Resendiz was insane when he broke into
Dr. Claudia Benton's West University Place home on Dec. 17, 1998,
stabbed and beat her, then raped her and robbed the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to hide anything from you,'' defense attorney
Allen Tanner told the jurors. ``We're dealing with a very, very
serious situation. ... It is a horrible case what happened to Dr.
Benton. Our hearts go out to her family. ... Evidence will show the
defendant did do that crime. He did it. No doubt he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors could still give Maturino Resendiz, 40, the death penalty
or life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. began his
case Monday by calling Benton's husband, police investigators and
technicians and colleagues of the victim from Baylor College of
Medicine, where she was a fellow in the genetics department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to ask you to convict this man of one of the most
horrible events you will ever have the misfortune of hearing,''
Holmes told the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Resendiz, now wearing long, unruly sideburns and shoulder-length
hair slicked straight back, sat quietly during the eight-hour court
proceedings Monday. His face never showed emotions and he only
rarely spoke to his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said that when his client surrendered at the Texas-Mexico
border last summer, he showed no remorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we met him and talked to him, when doctors have
talked to him, the defendant has no remorse for any of his
crimes,'' Tanner said. ``The defendant in his mind thinks these
people were evil and deserved to die. ... We are pleading insanity.
The defense says he was insane when he committed each and every
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner then read two letters Maturino Resendiz wrote while in
the Harris County Jail in which he said he was an ``angel of God.''
</P>
<P>
   In one he told of a virus that could spread faster than ebola by
spreading through the air and how the virus carriers could transmit
information ``like dolphins.'' He also said he has warned of the
impending destruction of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I have come here, I have told about the floods,
earthquakes, pestilences, famines that will come,'' he wrote.
``People will fear to go out of their houses. They will fear to
come to their houses. They will fear the night, fear the day. Many
will lose faith and kill themselves or others to get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   In another he said he surrendered because he was told he would
be treated humanely, but that authorities broke all their promises
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told at the border I was to get unrestricted visits.
That was a false promise. That I could get kosher. I never received
kosher,'' he wrote. ``The humane treatment I will get will be the
death sentence. I will go. I will not beg for my life. I was to be
sent to a mental hospital, but that will not happen. The USA will
never, never keep a promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said the letters prove how Maturino Resendiz felt his
victims had to be killed because ``something is seriously wrong up
here,'' he said touching his head.
</P>
<P>
   After Benton's colleagues testified how they had reported her
missing, her husband, George, took the stand. He was in Arizona at
the time of the murder visiting family with the couple's then
11-year-old twin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife's co-workers called him, he phoned a friend to
check on the house and learned police were there. Later, he got a
call from police in Arizona, who told him his wife had been
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes produced items found in Benton's home that bore
fingerprints matching those of Maturino Resendiz.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes also said DNA and blood found at the scene would later be
shown to belong to the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   A police video of the crime scene showed how Benton's body was
found in the bedroom, sprawled face down, her head wrapped in a
plastic bag and her body covered with blankets, pillows and sheets.
</P>
<P>
   A knife from the kitchen lay near an arm, which was stretched
out from under the covers, and a bronze statuette that had been
used to bludgeon her was found near the bed. Blood spatters were
found throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said Benton was beaten and stabbed repeatedly as she
fought for her life, but the fatal blows were two stab wounds to
the back, piercing the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trial began Monday, state District Judge Bill Harmon
denied Maturino Resendiz's request for a change of venue because of
excess publicity in Houston. He polled the 13 jurors, each of whom
denied having seen newscasts or read reports that could have
affected their decision in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz was offered an interpreter, but he declined to
use one.

POLITICAL WORLD ZOOMS IN ON BUSH-MCCAIN SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ The eagerly anticipated meeting here on Tuesday
between Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of
Arizona is being closely scrutinized by political observers and
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In their first meeting since Bush trounced McCain in the
primaries on March 7, the governor and senator are getting together
at Bush's invitation for private fence-mending, public
picture-taking and the expectation in the Bush camp that McCain
will eventually make some kind of endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement could come after the meeting, aides to McCain
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may or may not happen,'' John Weaver, McCain's political
director, said. ``No decision formally has been made; that's the
point of the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   So obsessed is the political world with how the two men get
along and so starved is the national press corps for substantive
campaign news that the event has taken on the proportions of a
miniature summit or, a ``monster unity meeting,'' as Sam Donaldson
called it on a Sunday news and talk program.
</P>
<P>
   By a Bush campaign estimate, 120 journalists had asked about
attending the news conference. Analysts have talked like color
commentators about watching McCain's body language.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a test of leadership for Bush,'' said Tom Hannon, who
oversees coverage of politics for CNN. ``In that sense, it's a
purely political story; it has much to do with Bush's facility for
handling it and how he handles the whole nomination process.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also, of course, a reflection of McCain's durable stardom,
of how his moods, inclinations and peeves still carry remarkable
weight. (Just last month, NBC News and a bevy of heavy-duty
political writers were off with him to Vietnam.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics is about ideas and strategy and tactics, but it is
also about personality,'' said Mark Halperin, the political
director of ABC News. ``It's extraordinary for a vanquished primary
candidate to have this much perceived influence.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCain showed up at Waldenbooks in a shopping mall in
suburban Pittsburgh on Monday, the reporters and camera crews were
so thick that it felt as if he were back in Nashua or Concord in
the days before the New Hampshire primary. McCain's performance at
the book signing for his autobiography showed how much he still
enjoyed the attention. At a news conference, the senator dropped
hints that he might yet endorse Bush on Tuesday: when asked if that
was a possibility, McCain said, ``sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Endorse'' is the word Bush dearly wants McCain to utter when
they emerge from their morning meeting at the William Penn Hotel
here.
</P>
<P>
   And as if to keep Bush in suspense, McCain was quoted in The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Monday as ruling out an endorsement for
the time being. He told the paper that he wanted a clearer
understanding of the governor's claim to be ``a reformer with
results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his slogan,'' McCain said. ``I'd like to know what
those are and how I can be helpful in achieving a reform agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of McCain said the senator would almost certainly
endorse Bush, if not Tuesday, sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a confidant of McCain's, said the
two staffs should be able to meet after Tuesday's meeting and
``hone a common reform agenda'' on issues the candidates agree on
like the patient's bill of rights and tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain's signature issue, campaign finance reform, ``that
may be the one where we agree to disagree,'' Graham added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuesday is vitally important for the human interaction,''
Graham said. ``Some time alone, away from spin doctors and
political operatives, some time to sit down and look at each other
and say the things that human beings can say will do more than
anything else to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed to acknowledge the need for catharsis. Speaking to
reporters at La Guardia Airport in New York before attending the
funeral of Cardinal John J. O'Connor, the governor said that he was
looking forward to talking to McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that whether we have an endorsement tomorrow or not is
really not what's important,'' he said. ``What's important is to
sit down and visit. He has said over and over that he will support
me as the nominee of the Republican Party. I take him for his
word.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters also said they would be looking for subtle signals of
how the two men, who early in the primary campaign went out of
their way to praise each other and profess their strong friendship,
comport themselves after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the most important thing will be body language and
tone,'' Halperin said. ``All eyes and camera lenses will be on the
question of, Does McCain act as if George Bush is his leader, or
does he act like the independent maverick, unhappy with the way
things have turned out?''
</P>
<P>
   It is far from customary for a vanquished contender for
president to withhold formal support for this long. This year, for
instance, former Sen. Bill Bradley endorsed Vice President Al Gore
within 48 hours of losing every state on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats say they are getting a kick out of the hoops that
Bush appeared to be going through to win over McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the Bob Jones University Redemption Tour,'' said
Joe Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee,
referring to Bush's efforts to distance himself from the Christian
conservatives he wooed during the primaries. Andrew will hold a
news conference here on Tuesday with senior citizens from across
Pennsylvania, to point up discrepancies in Bush's and McCain's
proposals regarding Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the question of whether an endorsement by a member of
one's own party is meaningful to anyone but the candidate and the
people paid to write and talk about it remains an open one. To Sen.
Arlen Specter, a Republican whose home state is host to the
meeting, the issue may be settled a lot more easily than a lot of
people think: ``It's for Governor Bush to say, `I'd like to have
your support.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After all, Specter said, he hasn't made an endorsement, either.
``When McCain and Bush were in it together, I thought it was the
better part of valor to stay out of it,'' he explained. Since then,
he added, ``Nobody's asked me.''

   THE ISSUES

   CUOMO SEEKS BUSH STAND ON GUN BILL: Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo added his voice Monday to the chorus of Democrats who have
called on Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to clarify his position on
federal legislation that would prohibit lawsuits by local
governments against gun manufacturers. Bush signed such legislation
in Texas, and suggested last week that he would do the same in
Washington. In a telephone news conference Monday, Cuomo, who has
tried to negotiate settlements between gun makers and cities that
have sued them, called Bush's remarks vague. He asserted that the
gun makers, who have broken off talks in recent months, would
return to the table if they knew Bush opposed such legislation.
Bush aides accused Cuomo of politicizing the issue. ``Instead of
spending their time distorting and misrepresenting Governor Bush's
priorities, the Clinton-Gore administration ought to spend more
time enforcing our existing gun laws,'' said Scott McClellan, a
spokesman for Bush.

   ABORTION LOOMS AS PLATFORM ISSUE: Various interests groups,
especially those that support abortion rights, plan to have their
voices heard in Philadelphia this summer when the Republican
national convention assembles a platform for this year's nominee.
Over the weekend, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the recently
selected chairman of the platform committee, offered them some
thoughts. After all the hearings are held and all the testimony is
heard, he said, the presidential candidate will have the last word,
not the committee. ``I'm certainly going to be listening to all
sectors of the party,'' Thompson told The Philadelphia Inquirer.
``But my ultimate client is George Bush, and what he feels best is
what we will do.'' On the matter of abortion, Thompson said he
would abide by Bush's promises to leave the current plank, which
strongly opposes abortion.

   THE LIBERTARIANS
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION COMMISSION SUED: The Libertarian Party sued the Federal
Elections Commission on Monday, contending that rules for
participation in presidential debates are so restrictive that they
unfairly exclude minor-party candidates and independents. The
lawsuit, the culmination of a long series of complaints about
debate regulations, argues that it is nearly impossible for less
well-known and less well-financed candidates to participate because
candidates who do not draw at least 15 percent in voter polls are
automatically excluded. In the suit, filed in federal court in
Manhattan, the Libertarians, joined by several other plaintiffs,
asserted that ``there is a common interest of the Democratic and
Republican Parties, implemented in part through organizations such
as the Commission on Presidential Debates, to lessen the stature
and legitimacy of independent and minor-party candidates.'' The
commission, a nonprofit group, has run the debates since 1987. The
suit also asserts that the debates violate federal law because
money contributed to finance them is meant to enhance voter
participation, not to support any particular party or candidate. A
commission spokesman, John Scardino, said the debate qualification
standards were fair and entirely legal.

   THE STATES
</P>
<P>
   RIFT GROWS AMONG ARIZONA REPUBLICANS: It is no secret among
Arizona Republicans that Gov. Jane Dee Hull's endorsement of a
fellow governor, George W. Bush, over a fellow Arizonan, Sen. John
McCain, for president left bad feelings on both sides. It was bad
enough that last month Hull agreed to give up the governor's
prerogative of leading the state's delegation to the Republican
National Convention _ after all, McCain easily won the primary, and
thus the right to control the state's 30-member delegation. Now
comes word that McCain wants his wife, Cindy, to lead the
delegation instead. That has rankled Hull supporters. The issue is
to be decided at the state party convention on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor, the eighth Roman
Catholic archbishop of New York, whose wit and uncompromising
eloquence made him the Vatican's most visible leader in the United
States, was entombed beneath the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral
Monday in an ethereal ceremony of white-robed clerics and haunting
song.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the stature that O'Connor had achieved during his 16
years running the Archdiocese of New York, political and religious
leaders from around the country and the world joined New Yorkers to
honor a man whose insistence on church teachings had defied the
secular labels of liberal and conservative politics.
</P>
<P>
   Led by acolytes bearing incense and holding high the
archbishopric cross, with its distinctive double crossbeams, a
procession of more than 2,000 deacons, priests, bishops, nuns and
cardinals marched down the central aisle of the cathedral at 1:30
p.m., passing alongside the cardinal's mahogany coffin, which was
draped in a white linen pall. As they passed, they rested their
hands on the coffin briefly, before moving on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made this pulpit unique in the history of the Catholic
Church in the United States,'' said Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston
in a homily that was interrupted by a long standing ovation after
he invoked O'Connor's ``constant reminder that the church must
always be unambiguously pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the audience, now on its feet, Law added, ``I see he
hasn't left the pulpit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God gifted him with a keen and subtle intellect, an uncommon
rhetorical skill, a knack for the dramatic gesture, a sharp wit and
an outrageous sense of humor, all of which he used in the service
of preaching,'' said Law, who was near O'Connor when he died last
Wednesday night at the age of 80, after a protracted battle with
cancer that began late last summer with surgery to remove a brain
tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dignitaries attending the invitation-only funeral were
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who sat beside Vice
President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper Gore. Behind the president
sat Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the first lady's rival for the
United States Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
who was also present. Mrs. Clinton shook hands with Giuliani during
the ``kiss of peace'' that is part of the Mass.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the coffin, alongside O'Connor's two
sisters and brother, sat former President George Bush, who was a
friend of the cardinal's. Elsewhere in the audience sat Bush's son,
George W. Bush, with his wife, Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 cardinals, the highest-ranking clerics in the Roman
Catholic Church after the pope, also turned out to usher O'Connor
to his final resting place, as did an equal number of archbishops
and 300 bishops. One of them, seated prominently in the sanctuary,
was the man expected to succeed O'Connor, Bishop Edward M. Egan of
Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Also attending were all of the others whose names have figured
prominently in speculation about a successor: Archbishops Theodore
E. McCarrick of Newark, Justin F. Rigali of St. Louis and Edwin F.
O'Brien of the military archdiocese, along with Bishops Henry
Mansell of Buffalo, Sean O'Malley of Fall River, Mass., and Donald
Wuerl of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Though few nuns attended, other than mothers superior, two
orders held prominent places. One was Mother Teresa's Missionaries
of Charity. The other was the Sisters of Life, a New York-based
order founded by O'Connor, whose 30 members devote themselves to
protecting the sanctity of life, whether by running shelters for
unwed mothers or by ministering to the sick and elderly.
</P>
<P>
   More than 3,500 mourners filled the cathedral, whose walls
echoed with the hymns and speeches celebrating the eternal life on
whose threshold the faithful believe O'Connor now stands. Much of
the service, which ran nearly three hours from the procession that
opened it to the one that ended it, centered on choices the
cardinal had made as he prepared for his death _ from the selection
of Law to read the homily, to the abundance and choice of music.
</P>
<P>
   The diocesan priests and bishops wore white, in keeping with
their belief that death is not the end of life, but a time of
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the cathedral, thousands stood in wilting temperatures
that reached the 90s, in rows 8 to 10 people deep, to hear the
service, which was broadcast over loudspeakers. Twenty-five Red
Cross workers handed out lemonade and water. Police officers
sweltered in their formal uniforms: long-sleeved shirts, ties and
woolen jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, we do not complain that you have taken him from us,''
said Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's secretary of state, who
led the Mass of Christian Burial. ``Rather we will thank you for
giving him to us.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's stands on political issues sprang from his faith in
the Gospel, making it difficult to brand him conservative or
liberal. From the start of his tenure, he preached strict adherence
to traditional church doctrines about sexuality, abjuring
homosexuality, abortion and contraception. And he assailed Catholic
politicians, like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Geraldine A. Ferraro, who
he felt strayed from those views.
</P>
<P>
   But in later years, the cardinal's image as a conservative
blurred somewhat as he he spoke out for the rights of workers and
the dispossessed, and opposed capital punishment and euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it was the cardinal's untiring efforts to outlaw
abortion that perhaps drew the greatest attention to him, and that
Monday sparked an unscripted show of devotion: a sustained,
standing ovation, which began when one of the Sisters of Life rose
to her feet.
</P>
<P>
   And it was his unabashed use of the news media to assert church
doctrine, whether in the secular or religious arena, that marked
the cardinal. In opening remarks Monday, Bishop Anthony Brucato,
one of O'Connor's two vicar generals, his top lieutenants, made a
special point of welcoming the millions of Catholics watching the
cardinal's funeral on television.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief talk about O'Connor early in the service, Cardinal
William Baum noted that O'Connor's patron saint was St. John
Fisher, who was beheaded for treason in 1535 by King Henry VIII of
England after refusing to renounce the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardinal O'Connor wasn't decapitated,'' Baum said. ``He didn't
die for his faith, but he did proclaim it, and he suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Baum recalled that O'Connor had asked Catholics to pray for his
soul after his death.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:35, after many in the cathedral, including Giuliani, had
lined the aisles to receive holy communion, Sodano sprinkled
O'Connor's coffin with holy water, as incense rose toward the
cathedral's vaulted ceilings. There hung the traditional red hats
of the New York archbishops before Cardinal Francis Spellman, who
was installed in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   In solemn procession, Sodano led the coffin up the center aisle
and down the side, as hymns filled the church. Behind him walked
other cardinals and a few members of O'Connor's family, including
his two sisters, Mary Ward and Dorothy Hamilton, and his brother
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller group, consisting only of Sodano, a few other church
officials and O'Connor's family, actually entered the crypt to see
the burial.
</P>
<P>
   On the stone that sealed his crypt is a simple inscription
bearing his name and age, and the years he served as archbishop of
New York. Also carved in the stone is his coat of arms, emblazoned
with the words he chose to give meaning to his mission: ``There can
be no love without justice.''

ENERGY DEPT. CANCELS NUCLEAR CLEANUP CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Washington)  By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department said on Monday that it had
failed in its attempt to save money on nuclear waste cleanup by
privatizing the task of solidifying highly radioactive liquid
wastes at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that it was canceling its contract with BNFL
Inc., which was supposed to finance and build a waste-processing
factory and run it for almost 20 years, receiving most of its pay
only when it produced a product.
</P>
<P>
   By dismissing the contractor, the department risks missing
court-sanctioned deadlines that it had agreed on with Washington
State and the federal Environmental Protection Agency for the
cleanup of the Hanford plant.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in a statement that
``BNFL's proposal was outrageously expensive and inadequate in many
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The department said the company, whose budget estimates for the
job had more than doubled in less than two years, will be kept on
to do some design work; it will be paid $200 million to $300
million for the design work and for its glass-melting technology.
But the job of finishing the design, building the plant and running
it will be opened up for bidding.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The plant is supposed to produce liquid wastes encased in a
radiation-absorbing glass and wrapped in stainless steel for
long-term storage. The Energy Department chose BNFL, an American
subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels PLC, because the British parent
had done similar work in England.
</P>
<P>
   When the initial contract was signed in August 1998, BNFL said
it could do the job for $6.9 billion. More recently, it said the
cost would be $15.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington attorney general, Christine O. Gregoire, who
negotiated cleanup deadlines, said in an interview that delays had
been predictable because of ``bad business decisions'' by the
Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   The original concept, she pointed out, was for two private
companies to compete, but the department had narrowed the field to
just BNFL, which allowed that company to ``commit highway
robbery,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, BNFL said that ``while disappointed that the
Department of Energy has decided to recompete the entirety of the
contract, we are pleased that they have determined that the design
and technical solution is sound and will be the basis for
proceeding with the cleanup.''
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Glauthier, the deputy secretary of energy, acknowledged in
a telephone interview with reporters that the department had a
history of delays and cost overruns and was still looking for a way
to give contractors an incentive to do their work on time and on
budget. He said the department might try privatizing another task,
but one with fewer uncertainties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty unhappy with the performance this contractor has
had,'' he said. ``We're taking an unusual step, terminating this
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the department's experience in the glass-making
technology, called vitrification, has been poor. A plant built
under a traditional contract at the Savannah River nuclear
reservation, near Aiken, S.C., opened late, and engineers still
have not determined how to stop the wastes from producing benzene,
a gas that can burn or explode at the proper concentration. The
waste at Hanford, in south central Washington State, is stored in
underground tanks, some of which are leaking.

 SENIOR EXECUTIVES FLEEING FROM EXCITEATHOME  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ExciteAtHome, whose stock has fallen 59 percent
this year, is also suffering a brain drain.
</P>
<P>
   At least three senior executives have left the Redwood City,
Calif., Internet company in recent weeks, and at least one more is
rumored to have a foot out the door.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the company said Tom Jermoluk, who stepped down as
chief executive in January, will also hand the chairman's title to
Chief Executive Officer George Bell. Jermoluk, who will remain on
the board of directors, is reportedly negotiating to become a
partner of the Palo Alto, Calif., venture capital firm Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, which has ties to ExciteAtHome. He
already has investments in some other Kleiner companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Adam Grosser, president of subscriber networks,
quit two weeks ago. Senior vice president and general counsel David
Pine is leaving in June to join Handspring, which makes handheld
computers that compete with Palm.
</P>
<P>
   And others could be leaving soon, observers say. ExciteAtHome,
which runs the fifth-most-popular network of Internet sites and is
the largest provider of cable modem service, just completed a
corporate reorganization last week. Shares have slid 78 percent
over the past 12 months, worse than many other Internet
powerhouses. By comparison, Lycos is up 7 percent, Yahoo is up 64
percent and America Online is down 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a bunch of resumes on the street,'' said Sean
Doherty, an AtHome co-founder who now runs Urban Media
Communications, a Palo Alto startup.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty pointed out that all three executives who are leaving
originally worked for AtHome, which provides superfast Internet
service over cable television lines. The company became
ExciteAtHome when it bought Excite, an Internet portal that
competes with Yahoo and Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ExciteAtHome just launched television commercials in
four cities yesterday, including San Francisco, that solely promote
the ``Excite'' brand _ rather than ExciteAtHome. The campaign is
expected to cost $5 million to $10 million, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The company ``is kind of turning into Excite,'` Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   But ExciteAtHome spokeswoman Melissa Walia says the company
simply prefers to use the Excite name for national branding
campaigns to promote all its services.
</P>
<P>
   She said the company only promotes the AtHome name to promote
the cable modem service where it is available. However,
ExciteAtHome is still focused heavily on attracting more cable
modem customers, she added. It hopes to reach 3 million subscribers
by year end, up from 1.5 million at the end of March, and 10
million by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, financial analyst Abhishek Gami said he thinks
several Excite executives could leave the company as well as the
company refocuses its business.
</P>
<P>
   ExciteAtHome already has announced plans to throttle down
efforts to keep up with Yahoo and Lycos. The company recently
overhauled the Internet gateway for its cable modem customers but
isn't sure when it will do the same for its public Internet site.
Gami estimates it could be a year away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to hear about more management defections,'' said
Gami, who works for William Blair. ``Ultimately, George (Bell) is
going to assemble his own team.''

POLITICIANS DISCOMFORTED BY HOMILETIC PRAISE OF `PRO LIFE' STAND
</HEADLINE>
  (With OCONNOR) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the politicians crowded into the pews at the
front of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Monday, from Democrats like
President Clinton to Republicans like Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, it
was a difficult moment. At the pulpit, Cardinal Bernard Law gave a
homily for Cardinal John O'Connor that included a sharp reminder of
one issue with which the cardinal famously sparred with national
and New York government leaders. ``What a great legacy he has left
us in his constant reminder that the church must always be
unambiguously pro life,'' Law said.
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment's pause. Then, rising from the pews, came an
unbroken roar of applause that lasted for one minute and 50
seconds. Most of the political leaders at the front, almost all
supporters of legalized abortion, rustled in obvious discomfort as
television cameras focused in on the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The mourners applauded as Law tried to quiet them with a gesture
of his hands. Then they rose to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   And with the audience rose the politicians, if not quite as
quickly: Gov. George Pataki, Giuliani, Clinton, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Sens. Charles Schumer and Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, both New York Democrats, among them. Giuliani,
after tugging at his jacket, even joined in the applause, though
unenergetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro life'' is shorthand for opposition to abortion, and most
of the politicians in the front pews favor abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But as Law described it, O'Connor meant the ``defense of life''
to include much more: opposing capital punishment, euthanasia and
physician-assisted suicide, and defending the rights of workers and
``a just peace in the Middle East and in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush and his father, the former president,
applauded. They oppose abortion, but they vigorously support the
death penalty and are not friendly to organized labor, as O'Connor
was. Few major American politicians are fully in tune with the
Roman Catholic teachings that brought those in the cathedral to
their feet.
</P>
<P>
   As the applause went on, the president could be seen whispering
to Mrs. Clinton, who has moved to New York and is running for
senator against Giuliani. They stood in what aides later described
as a gesture of respect to the church and the cardinal, though they
did not applaud.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said he applauded out of
respect. ``This was done out of a show of respect for the
cardinal,'' Mindel said. ``As is known, the mayor is pro-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who also favors abortion rights, applauded too, ``out of
respect for the cardinal and the principals of the Catholic
Church,'' said his senior adviser, Zenia Mucha.
</P>
<P>
   Law seemed startled by the display that his remark about
O'Connor's teachings evoked. ``I see he hasn't left the pulpit,''
Law said.

<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ After languishing for months in the shadow of
their better-known, better-financed Democratic rivals, New Jersey's
four Republican candidates for the United States Senate had their
first debate on Monday, with all four brandishing their
conservative credentials while avoiding the harsh attacks they had
leveled at each other in recent campaign mailings.
</P>
<P>
   With only regional political bases and limited name recognition,
the four used the forum to make broad appeals to the 300,000 voters
expected to decide the June 6 primary, describing their views in
favor of tax cuts, free trade and severely limiting the use of
American military troops abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The format did not allow for give-and-take during what was
largely a genial debate, with the candidates mentioning each
other's names only when they agreed on various issues. Their only
critical words were aimed at Democrats, specifically President
Clinton and New Jersey's two Democratic Senate contenders, Jim
Florio and Jon S. Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert D. Franks, a four-term congressman from Union
County, called himself a common-sense conservative and said that he
and fellow Republicans in Congress deserved credit for the robust
economy because they had helped ``to drag Bill Clinton kicking and
screaming down the path to fiscal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, described
himself as an ``unabashed conservative'' and proposed replacing the
income tax code with a flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   William L. Gormley, a state senator from Ocean County, said he
was a fiscal conservative because he had voted for 37 tax cuts
since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman took office in 1994. In an
unusual move for a contestant in a Republican primary, however,
Gormley also said he had become a target for the National Rifle
Association because he was the only Republican state legislator to
vote for New Jersey's assault weapons ban in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The most conservative candidate in the race is Murray Sabrin, a
college finance professor who ran for governor as a Libertarian in
1993. Sabrin called for the abolition of affirmative action, the
Departments of Education, Energy, and Housing and Urban
Development, the capital gains tax and the estate tax. When asked
whether his platform might be too extreme for New Jersey's
historically moderate Republican voters, he beamed. ``That's what
they said about Ronald Wilson Reagan in 1980,'' Sabrin said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, sponsored jointly by The New York Times and The New
Jersey Network, was taped at 1 p.m. and broadcast at 9 p.m. The
Democratic candidates are scheduled to hold their first debate on
Thursday, and both debates will be broadcast back-to-back on Sunday
at 2 p.m. The Democrats have agreed to four debates before the
primary. The Republicans are scheduled to hold two more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The tranquil tone of Monday's debate was a departure from the
increasingly heated campaign. In recent weeks, Gormley's campaign
has called Franks a ``Clinton Republican,'' saying that the
congressman voted to impeach the president but days later urged the
Senate not to remove him from office. Franks has branded Gormley a
``Florio Republican,'' and accused him of cooperating too closely
with Florio during his four years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   As if bracing for such a criticism, Gormley began the debate
with a one-minute opening statement in which he described his votes
against Florio's tax increase. But an attack from Franks never
came. Instead, Franks talked of his own efforts, when he was a
state legislator and Republican state chairman, to block Florio's
1990 income tax increase and deny his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Treffinger predicted that Corzine's programs would bankrupt the
country. Referring to Florio's $2.8-billion tax increase, he said,
``There are at least 2.8 billion reasons not to vote for Jim
Florio.''
</P>
<P>
   However, most of the debate emphasized the similarities between
Treffinger, Gormley and Franks. All three said they favored limited
gun control, campaign finance reform, expanding trade relations
with China and federal tax credits to help working families afford
health care and higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Franks and Gormley described issues in which they broke ranks
with their party leadership. Franks said he defied Republican
leaders in the House of Representatives when he voted to support
campaign finance and the patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley described his vote for Florio's assault weapon ban as an
act of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity as a United States marine to fire an
M-16, and I know what damage they can do,'' Gormley said. ``We need
to send a message to the NRA, and the special interest groups who
don't care about our children and don't care about the future of
our state, to tell them we're not going to stand for it.''  &QL;

 ATHLETES SCORING ON THE INTERNET  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ These days, it's easy for sports fans to get
``up close and personal'' with their favorite athletes on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Steve Young of the San Francisco 49ers, for example,
shared exclusive details and photos on his Web site from his
invitation-only wedding in March in Hawaii. Young said his wedding
reception was ``like a fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tennis teen queen Anna Kournikova used her site to
deny rumors that she was planning to marry Pavel Bure, Sergi
Federov or any other hockey player.
</P>
<P>
   And Oakland Athletics slugger Jason Giambi revealed in a
poignant note on his site that his 1999 season, a stellar one for
him on the field, was painful off the field because of his divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest names in sports, from current superstars like Barry
Bonds and Shaquille O'Neal to retired Hall of Fame legends like Joe
Montana and Reggie Jackson, now compete for eyeballs on the Web
with ``exclusive'' columns and personal tidbits not available
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to give them a reason to go back every day,'' said
Montana in an interview about his game plan for a new online
venture project, SportsHabitat.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be news, there'll be advice,'' Montana said. ``This
area is going to be interactive.''
</P>
<P>
   In pre-Web days, sports celebrities made extra cash off the
field by holding up a can of beer or shaving cream and smiling into
a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   But now, big-name athletes of all sports are joining the rush
for Web e-commerce revenues and stock options. The athletes
themselves have become entertainment content that the sites use to
draw Web users into buying all manner of sports shoes, gloves,
bats, balls, golf clubs, T-shirts and other collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a recent phenomenon, within the last year, where
it's become commonplace for athletes to ask `What's my Web site
strategy?' '' said Ross Schaufelberger,, president and founder of
AthletesDirect.com, which has aggregated more than 275 athlete Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a golden opportunity to create revenue and exposure
under their control in a new medium,'' Schaufelberger said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, sports-related sites have become popular and
potentially lucrative Web attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Online research firm Jupiter Communications Inc. noted in a
recent report that sports was the fifth-most-popular channel on
America Online, behind news, entertainment, shopping and personal
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter said that popularity should translate into about $3
billion in online sales of sporting goods, clothing, shoes and game
tickets by 2003, up from about $600,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   And according to a report last year by Forrester Research Inc.,
the Internet is causing a radical power shift of sports-related
programming away from the traditional radio and television media.
That shift should generate about $2.4 billion in advertising
revenue for sports-related sites by 2004, with e-commerce sales of
sports-related products climbing to about $4.7 billion in that same
time.
</P>
<P>
   So it's natural that professional athletes are lining up to
shoot for the Net as well.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Dunk.net, an Internet e-commerce site co-founded
by Los Angeles Lakers superstar center O'Neal and his agent,
Leonard Armato.
</P>
<P>
   The company has lined up two other notable partners: New York
Mets all-star catcher Mike Piazza and forward Rebecca Lobo of the
New York Liberty _ a Women's National Basketball Association team.
</P>
<P>
   Dunk.net offers customized athletic shoes and clothing, such as
the $84 Chromz basketball shoe, a style Shaq wore during this
year's NBA All-Star Game in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The shoes and other apparel sold on Dunk.net are not available
in retail stores. Because it is made to order, like a computer
system sold on the Web, the shoes can be custom tailored to fit the
customer's choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a really tight Web site,'' O'Neal said during
an interview. ``Dunk is going to give the consumer a chance to feel
important.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep those customers coming back, O'Neal answers e-mailed
questions on ``ShaqTV,'' a streaming video program available only
on Dunk.net.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who said he likes to download free MP3s, said he also
hopes the site helps youth grasp the future power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At first, ``I didn't understand the Internet language,'' O'Neal
said. ``I thought it was geeky. Now I know that it's cool. Now it's
my job to get the kids to say this is cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana, the legendary 49ers quarterback, has a new part-time
job as a business adviser for SportsHabitat.com Inc. of Orange
County, Calif., a new Web site whose co-founder and chief
communications officer is Jackson, the former Oakland Athletics and
New York Yankees slugger.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which will fully launch in June, will offer sports
buffs news, information and sporting equipment. Montana will also
wear the title ``magazine editor-in-chief'' for the site's ``Joe
Montana's in the Red Zone'' section.
</P>
<P>
   Montana said he was encouraged that SportsHabitat.com was also
going to try to appeal to women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to find a way to get people to come to your store,''
Montana said. ``With names like Reggie, Chris Evert and Freddie
Couples, it's tough not to know those names.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, three of the biggest names in sports, Michael Jordan,
Wayne Gretzky and John Elway are partners in a sports apparel and
memorabilia site called MVP.com. Gretzky, meanwhile, is also a
partner in Faceoff.com, a hockey portal that features a column
written by the retired NHL great.
</P>
<P>
   AthletesDirect, now a unit of Broadband Sports Inc. of Santa
Monica, Calif., started in 1996 operating sites on America Online
for Steve Young and Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman.
</P>
<P>
   The company now has the largest collection of Web jock sites,
with more than 275 stars from 15 sports - including Bonds,
Kournikova, Cincinnati Reds outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. and Los
Angeles Lakers forward Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   The Web allows athletes to bypass the filter of traditional
media like newspapers, radio and television to give their fans
direct ``scoops'' they wouldn't get anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Young, for example, went to great lengths to keep all reporters
away from his wedding but posted his own photos and wedding account
on his AthletesDirect site.
</P>
<P>
   And in February, NFL tight end Shannon Sharpe scooped the media
by reporting on his Web site that he has agreed to a four-year deal
with the Baltimore Ravens. Olympic gold medalist Sheryl Swoopes
used her site to announce she would not play for the USA National
women's basketball team to spend more time with her 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the press puts a stamp on certain players,'' wrote
Giants star Bonds on his site. ``Once they've stamped you as a bad
person. That's what they feed on and there's nothing you can do
about it. I know in my heart the type of ballplayer I am and the
type of person I am.''
</P>
<P>
   In another post, Bonds commented on Ken Griffey's trade to the
Reds and hinted about his future with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'd like to play with Kenny. We were teammates on a
(1996) tour of Japan, and we had a good time. I'm signed with the
Giants through next season (2001), but you never know what can
happen in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans can also tap into other minutia as well. Atlanta Falcons
running back Jamal Anderson wrote that earlier this month in San
Francisco he sat on a panel with supermodel Cindy Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly packed the house ... at least Cindy did!''
Anderson wrote. ``I think I was just as entertaining as Cindy ...
and maybe even a little cuter! You know I'm playing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Bryant's site, the young forward has kept his fans abreast of
his team's progress in the current NBA playoffs and answering
e-mails from fans, such as one fan who asked about his pregame
rituals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat a good breakfast, go to shoot-around and I have a light
afternoon meal,'' Bryant wrote. ``I sleep when I'm tired. If not, I
watch a movie or something. I like old movies, like `The Ten
Commandments' or sometimes a Disney movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Orioles slugger Albert Belle, who refuses to talk to
the media, last month responded testily to an e-mail from a fan who
called him unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   ``When have I not been professional on the baseball field? ...
Do I play everyday? Have I ever shown up a pitcher, or umpire? Do I
ever say anything negative or criticize? How about you walk in my
footsteps for a week and you see if can do the job that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle then took a sarcastic shot at fans of his former team, the
Cleveland Indians, whom he once dubbed ``village idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am assuming you are a Cleveland fan, are you? It is nice to
know that you visit my Web site, please come back and bring some
buddies with you.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, basketball star Lobo said she enjoys how the
Web gives her personal interaction with fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``On my Web site, they can vote on what hairstyle they want me
to have. When I got hurt, I was inundated with e-mails from
well-wishers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still unclear whether the athletes have the kind of draw to
make the sites financially successful. AthletesDirect, in fact,
lost $203.8 million in 1999, according to its SEC filing.
</P>
<P>
   And traffic to the sites, so far, is small. According to the
Nielsen/NetRatings Internet audience rating service,
AthletesDirect.com had 444,914 unique visitors for March, the
latest month for which data is available, while MVP.com had 172,178
unique visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Another research company, Media Metrix, tracked 372,000 unique
visitors to MVP.com in March.
</P>
<P>
   But both companies said many of the sites fall below their
radars because they don't generate enough traffic to meet their
services' minimum reporting standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain pretty dubious of athletes' Web sites,'' said Patrick
Keane, senior Internet analyst for Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   According to Keane's report on Internet sports commerce, a
survey of sports-minded Web surfers showed 35 percent looked for
scores and statistics, 27 percent wanted to read about the games
and 25 percent wanted event information. Only 1 percent wanted to
chat with stars and 2 percent liked chatting with other fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the very young fans gravitate toward celebrity or
star-driven sites,'' Keane said. ``Finding out what Ken Griffey Jr.
eats for breakfast is interesting to a very limited subset of
consumers.''

 MONEYBAG: MEASURING VALUE OF INFORMATION  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Our investment club has been using the Value Line Investment
Survey as a research resource. The subscription is up for renewal,
and we wonder whether there is a different survey, weekly
newsletter, or whatever, that you would recommend.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: I would rather not recommend any stock-touting letters. I am not
convinced that any of them will do you much good over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   However, based on the advertisements it places in financial
publications, Value Line's powers of prognostication look pretty
remarkable. It says that the stocks that it gave the highest
rankings over the years appreciated by 18,037 percent between 1965
and 1999. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average grew by only
1,161 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Can Value Line keep it up? You don't necessarily have to worry
about that, because its publication provides a vast amount of
useful, quantitative information about many hundreds of stocks. You
can ignore Value Line's opinions, if you choose, while using its
data to make your own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If you want an objective assessment of some 160 prominent
stock-market newsletters, go to the Hulbert Financial Digest Web
site at  &LR; www.hulbertdigest.com.  &LR; The editor, Mark Hulbert, has been
tracking the stock-picking performances of leading market letters
for nearly two decades and is considered the dean of his field.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Hulbert Web site provides links to the
sites of many of the market letters it surveys.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you want to know how Hulbert rates those market
letters, you will have to take out a paid subscription to the
digest. That normally costs $200 per year, but a $59 introductory
offer is currently available. You can apply electronically on the
Web site, or call toll-free at (888) 485-2378.

Equal Compensation

</P>
<P>
   Q: Do online discount brokers charge the same low commissions no
matter how large the trade? Also, could you tell me the Web
addresses of some reliable brokers?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR;  A: Most online brokers charge a low, fixed commission for
relatively small trades and considerably more for very large
trades.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Brown &AMP; Co. ( &LR; www.brownco.com &LR; ) is renowned for its
trifling $5 commission on market orders and $10 on limit orders of
5,000 shares or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   But if you trade more shares than that, the commission rises
steeply. On a 5,001-share market order you would pay the basic $5
plus a penny per share _ including the first 5,000 shares. Your
commission would jump to $55.01.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the Web addresses of the five online brokers that
received the highest ratings in a recent customer-satisfaction
survey by J.D. Power &AMP; Associates:
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity ( &LR; www.fidelity.com &LR; );
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab ( &LR; www.schwab.com &LR; );
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch ( &LR; www.ml.com &LR; );
</P>
<P>
   Datek Online ( &LR; www.datek.com &LR; );
</P>
<P>
   DLJdirect ( &LR; www.dljdirect.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Getting Fair Share
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was a small shareholder of 3Com Corp. before it spun off
Palm Inc. in the recent initial public offering. Why wasn't I given
a chance to buy some IPO shares? And now that Palm has been carved
out of the 3Com assets, how am I, as a 3Com shareholder, to be
compensated?
</P>
<P>
   &LR; a  &LR;  A: As you seem to infer, the little guy usually doesn't get
to participate in the hottest IPOs. Institutional investors _ and
individuals who are among the most-favored customers of brokerage
firms _ stand the best chance.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you had bought Palm shares at the $38 IPO
price two months ago, you would be sitting on a substantial paper
loss today. Yes, the stock soared way above $100 on March 2, the
first day of trading, but it has since sold in the mid-20s, and it
closed yesterday at $32.25.
</P>
<P>
   You also should bear in mind that 3Com sold only a bit more than
4 percent of Palm's shares to the public, while retaining ownership
of the rest. It plans to distribute the remaining 96 percent to you
and other shareholders sometime in the next several months, in
proportion to your stake in 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   As to how you were compensated for the IPO: 3Com received more
than $800 million in cash for the 23 million shares it sold at $38
apiece. That money was added to the company's cash hoard, of which
you are a part-owner.

 SCHWAB THINK TANK FOCUSES ON MUTUAL FUNDS  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., ``advice'' used to be a
dirty word.
</P>
<P>
   The leading discount broker's original, self-imposed mandate was
to provide bare-bones securities trading at a bargain price _
period.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted someone to hold your hand and tell you how to
invest or if you needed to see the latest high-powered investment
research, you had to take your business to full-service brokers,
such as Merrill Lynch, which charged commissions several times
greater than Schwab's.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the brokerage business crowded to the bursting point
and competitive as a snake pit, the line between full-service and
discount brokers has blurred. In the struggle to attract and keep
customers, every broker is striving to be everything to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   At Schwab, much of this effort is being spearheaded by a small,
low-profile think tank called the Schwab Center for Investment
Research. It is what one Schwab publicist calls the ``brains''
behind the advice that Schwab dispenses to customers these days.
</P>
<P>
   Opening in November 1997, it consists of 13 staffers _ primarily
statistics nerds with doctoral degrees _ who grind out a succession
of original reports and studies designed to help Schwab customers
make the right investment choices.
</P>
<P>
   The center also produces course material for investment seminars
at Schwab branches. And it masterminds some of Schwab's Web-based
analytical tools, such as the Stock Analyzer, which allows
investors to compare a company with the rest of the market and the
rest of its industry.
</P>
<P>
   The center was the brainchild of Schwab co-chief executive David
Pottruck and other top managers. They reasoned that if Schwab was
going to begin offering advice to customers, it needed to back up
that advice with independent, objective, high-quality research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers want to be informed and educated,'' says Chip Roame,
a former Schwab strategist who now runs his own consulting firm in
Tiburon, Calif. ``Customers appreciate that, and as a result, more
of their investment dollars will wind up at Schwab.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the center's reports focus on mutual-fund investing,
reflecting the fact that funds have become the investment of choice
for most rank-and-file customers.
</P>
<P>
   The focus on funds appears to make the Schwab Center unique
among brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Full-service brokers do a boatload of equity research,'' says
John Rekenthaler, research director of Morningstar Inc., ``but to
my knowledge, they do almost nothing in the way of mutual-fund
studies.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's reports bear such titles as:
</P>
<P>
   ``How Many Funds Should You Own?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do New Funds Offer Better Performance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Which Publicly Available Variables Explain Future Mutual Fund
Performance?''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Riepe, 36, the Schwab vice president who manages the
center, says the titles usually end with question marks because the
reports are ``customer driven,'' and Schwab customers ask those
kinds of questions.
</P>
<P>
   The questions, posed mainly by people who visit Schwab's
branches, are passed along to Riepe and his colleagues by service
representatives, executives and marketing people.
</P>
<P>
   If a frequently asked question is intriguing enough, the Schwab
Center will tackle it. The center has generated 15 reports so far,
an average of one every other month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of folklore surrounding investing,'' Riepe
remarks. ``People say things must be a certain way, and that
becomes the commonsense belief. We look deeper _ at the empirical
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Riepe recalls that last summer, when the stock market hit a
severe downdraft, ``a lot of people wanted some fixed-income
exposure. You can do that two ways: go directly into bonds or into
bond mutual funds. Our firm didn't have a policy as to which was
best.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's analysts assumed that it was more cost-efficient to
invest large sums of money directly in bonds. People with small
sums to invest, on the other hand, would do better to put their
money in bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   But how small and how large?
</P>
<P>
   The center's staff examined the facts and crunched the numbers
and concluded that the cutoff was $50,000. You need a bond
portfolio at least that large to justify buying bonds on your own.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy individual bonds, there is the commission and the
spread between the bid price and the offering price,'' Riepe
observes. ``On the other hand, a bond mutual fund charges a
management fee. We built models and strategies for different types
of bond portfolios, and found that if you've got $50,000 and buy
investment-grade, highly liquid bonds and hold them to maturity,
the costs are comparable to those of a low-cost bond fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Riepe says another common question posed by customers is whether
they should periodically weed out the worst-performing mutual funds
in their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   One school of thought maintained that you should do it, because
poor performers tend to continue to perform poorly. But others
insisted that poor performers tend to bounce back.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knew, however, so the Schwab Center delved into
the question.
</P>
<P>
   It found that you can enhance your portfolio by selling off the
worst performers ``within their peer groups'' _ that is, among
funds with the same investment styles, such as small
capitalization/growth or large capitalization/technology.
</P>
<P>
   `'The key is the peer group,'' Riepe says. ``Mutual fund
customers may see a fund with a 180 percent one-year return and
another with a 20 percent return. But your criterion should be:
What are they doing to get that track record?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe the best-performing fund is heavily tilted toward tech
stocks and the other isn't. On the other hand, if you are
evaluating within a peer group and find your fund is consistently
at the bottom, that tells you something _ that the management team
may not be doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   The center turns out multiple versions of each report. The
shortest versions _ summaries running 250 words _ are printed in
``Schwab Investor,'' a newsletter inserted with the monthly
brokerage statements the firm sends to its account holders.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhat longer versions _ 500 to 700 words _ get printed in On
Investing, a magazine sent to customers who trade a lot, or have
large accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Still longer versions _ four printed pages _ are shipped to the
branches and distributed free to visitors who want them. They also
are posted indefinitely on the Schwab Web site at  &LR; www.schwab.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Full-blown, scholarly versions, running to thousands of words,
replete with arcane formulas and charts, are sent to customers of
Schwab's institutional branch _ mainly financial planners and
investment advisers.
</P>
<P>
   To a great extent, those mailings get ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Several investment professionals interviewed by The Chronicle
said they are too busy to give the center's reports careful
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do all our own research,'' says Craig Litman of
Litman/Gregory in Larkspur. ``Most of what comes across our desks
from other sources doesn't provide much added value for us.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the center does have some fans among the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great information,'' says Richard DelMonte, a Danville
retirement planner. ``I get it in the mail, take it home and read
it in bed. They really are good at gathering a lot of statistical
information. They pick really good topics that sometimes surprise
you with the results.''
</P>
<P>
   DelMonte says he was impressed with a study entitled ``How Tax
Efficient Are Tax-Managed Funds?'' The title refers to mutual funds
that try to minimize capital-gains distributions so their
shareholders won't get hit with big tax bills.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that tax-managed funds generally were more
tax-efficient than other types of funds but noted that there were
very few of them. It suggested that investors who are concerned
about their tax burden, but want a broad fund selection, might find
it worthwhile to buy index funds, which tend to be nearly as
tax-efficient as tax-managed funds.

 &HT;    Balk costs Braves 3rd loss in row
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami _ Five games removed from their 15-game winning streak,
the Braves are in danger of beginning to look not all that good,
just streaky. John Rocker balked home the winning run in the bottom
of the ninth inning Monday night as the Braves lost their third in
a row and fourth in their last five games, 3-2 to the Florida
Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   With the winning run at third base, Rocker dropped the ball
while his foot was on the pitching rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Bako singled off Rudy Seanez to start the ninth, his third
hit of the game. Danny Bautista, who pinch ran for him, advanced to
second on an Andres Galarraga error on a pickoff throw and reached
third on a groundout. Rocker relieved Seanez, and his intentional
walk to Mark Smith brought up Cliff Floyd, who didn't have to take
the bat off his shoulder as Bautista scored on the balk. The only
hit the Braves managed with runners in scoring position was an
infield hit by Chipper Jones in the eighth inning. Seven other
opportunities were wasted, including two with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux was making his first start since the modern
franchise-record winning streak ended in Los Angeles, when he gave
up a season-high six runs and took his first loss.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux returned to form against the Marlins, though a Rafael
Furcal error wound up costing him two runs in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux was the logical choice to feel immediate effects from the
Braves' recent injury problems, mainly the loss of catcher Eddie
Perez. Called up from AA Greenville, 22-year-old catcher Fernando
Lunar made his major-league debut in place of Perez, who was at
Piedmont Hospital in Atlanta recovering from season-ending shoulder
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A bad case of the bobbles on the infield hurt Maddux the most.
Rafael Furcal booted a Preston Wilson grounder near second base
trying to start a double play, and the Marlins scored the first of
two unearned runs for a 2-0 lead in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux worked around a Chipper Jones error and a grounder off
Furcal's glove for a hit to send the Braves into the last third of
the game with a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had stranded 21 runners in the last two games of the
Phillies series, and they continued to struggle against Marlins
starter Vladimir Nunez. The Braves managed nothing over the first
four innings against a pitcher who hadn't won yet in six starts
this season, going 0-3 with a 10.48 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   They used a Furcal walk and a Maddux single down the first base
line to cut the lead to 2-1. With a chance to do serious damage in
the sixth, they came away with only the game-tying run.

NET WORTH: RATE INCREASE MEANS I-BONDS OFFER HEALTHY RETURN,
LOW  RISK
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The U.S. government's inflation savings bonds
haven't gotten much attention since they were introduced in
September 1998, but that may change soon.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, the government raised the current rate, guaranteed for
six months, on its so-called I-bonds to 7.49 percent from 6.98
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That beats the yield on all other Treasury securities and
money-market funds and most certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Like all U.S. government securities, I-bonds are free from state
taxes. That gives them an edge over CDs, which are fully taxable.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's increase in the I-bond rate was bigger than expected
and reflects a couple of energy-induced inflationary spikes in
February and March.
</P>
<P>
   Ed White, a money manager in Fredricksburg, Texas, who has
always favored I-bonds, likes them even more now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having a tax-deferred money-market account in your
safe deposit box with an exceptionally high real rate of return,
and it's the safest instrument in the world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I-bonds work like this: Every six months, in May and November,
the government sets a new rate on the bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The rate has two parts: a ``core'' rate that is fixed and
guaranteed for the life of the bond and a floating rate that
changes every six months. The floating rate is based on the
Consumer Price Index for urban consumers for the previous six
months (ending the month before the adjustment date).
</P>
<P>
   The floating rate was raised last week to 3.82 percent from 3.58
percent, reflecting an unusually large 1.91 percent increase in the
CPI-U between October 1999 and March 2000. (That works out to 3.82
percent on an annual basis.)
</P>
<P>
   But what really surprised experts is that the government also
raised the core rate to 3.6 percent from 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Sudderth, a spokesman for the Bureau of the Public Debt,
says the core rate increase was based on market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But ``marketing'' may be more like it.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when the government tries to get
workers at about 40,000 companies to buy bonds through payroll
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Savings bond expert Dan Pederson suspects the nearly 7.5 percent
rate ``was designed to draw attention to the I-bond.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, ``the attention is warranted right now, if you can
lock in a 3.6 percent spread over inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   The spread between an investment's return and the inflation rate
is known as the ``real rate of return.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 50 years, the real rate of return has been 6 to 7
percent for stocks and 1 to 1.5 percent for short- to
intermediate-term Treasuries, according to White.
</P>
<P>
   That makes 7.49 percent pretty attractive, but remember that the
full rate is only in effect for six months. Bonds purchased between
May 1 and October 31 will earn 3.6 percent plus whatever the
floating rate is for every six-month period until the bonds are
sold.
</P>
<P>
   I-bonds should not be confused with the government's
inflation-indexed Treasury bonds, which can be traded through a
brokerage firm in the secondary market, like regular Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   I-bonds, like the government's older cousins EE bonds, can only
be purchased directly from the Bureau of the Public Debt or through
most banks. Unlike EE bonds, which are purchased at half of face
value, I-bonds are bought at face value. The I-bonds are available
in eight denominations ranging from $50 to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate on EE bonds is also changed every six months.
It equals 90 percent of the average yield on five-year Treasuries.
The rate on EE bonds purchased today is 5.73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While I-bonds appear to be far superior, if the Federal Reserve
continues to raise interest rates and that causes inflation to turn
back down, then EE bonds could end up being the better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we run at 2 percent (annual) inflation over the next six
months, it would drop the I-bond rate down to 5.6 percent,'' says
Pederson, author of ``Savings Bonds: When to Hold, When to Fold.''
</P>
<P>
   Although nobody knows what will happen in the future, Pederson
says he went back about 15 years to see which would have been the
better bond _ the I-bond or the EE bond.
</P>
<P>
   His conclusion: ``If the fixed (core) rate is 3.25 percent or
higher, the I-bond is a better deal. With 3.6 percent, it makes the
I-bonds even a better deal.''
</P>
<P>
   A few more facts: I-bonds must be held for at least six months.
They can be held for up to 30 years. However, if you cash in the
bonds before five years, you'll lose three months' worth of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Interest is added to the value of the bond and is paid out,
along with principal, when the bond is redeemed. Taxes are not owed
until the bond is cashed in.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call the Bureau of the Public Debt at
(510) 337 5039 or visit  &LR; www.savingsbonds.gov  &LR; (the government's
site) or  &LR; www.bondhelp.com &LR;  (Pederson's site).

<P>
   NOT HUNGRY FOR WEBVAN: Here's a good piece of advice: Never go
grocery shopping on an empty stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another good piece of advice: Never ask a crowd of
investors if they'd buy an online grocery store right after they've
eaten a big Mediterranean chicken lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Alsop, the noted journalist-turned-venture capitalist,
learned that the hard way Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Alsop was on a luncheon panel at the big Chase H&AMP;Q technology
investment conference at the Westin St. Francis in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   First he explained why he thought business-to-consumer Internet
companies (a.k.a. e-tailers) are not dead.
</P>
<P>
   He proceeded to disclose that he bought 3,000 shares of Webvan,
the online grocery store, at an average price of just under $10.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, he continued, is now trading around $6.25 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Then he asked the audience _ about a thousand institutional
investors and stock analysts _ how many people would buy Webvan at
$6.25 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single hand went up. (Well, Alsop thought he saw one.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first buy sign I've seen on Webvan,'' quipped
fellow panelist David Bonderman, founder of buyout firm Texas
Pacific Group. (Often, the best time to buy a stock is when nobody
else wants to own it.)
</P>
<P>
   The most delicious part of the lunch, however, was seeing Sandy
Robertson on the dais along with Alsop, Bonderman and Dan Case, CEO
of Chase H&AMP;Q.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson and Case were rivals for many years until the former
sold his investment bank, Robertson, Stephens, to Bank of America.
The firm was sold several times after that, and Robertson is no
longer affiliated with his old company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's starting a new firm, Francisco Partners, that will
do leveraged buyouts of tech firms _ including many his old company
took public.

ACHING EWING IS GUIDED BY SPIRIT  

</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ About a half-hour before the team bus pulled away Sunday
morning, Patrick Ewing folded his 7-foot frame into the back of a
taxi and rode off with a rehabilitation specialist by his side.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing was on his way to American Airlines Arena, early en route
to Game 1 against the Miami Heat, to receive yet another treatment
for the back spasms that left him nearly unable to walk when they
first occurred on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to a long list of things Ewing is not afraid of _ like
Chicago and Michael Jordan, heights and tight spaces _ he does not
have a fear of needles, either. He had an acupuncture session two
hours before tip-off.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes to play. If necessary, he will go through the
same process before the Knicks try to even the four-of-seven-game,
second-round series in Game 2 on Tuesday night in Miami. Today,
Ewing sat on the sideline after practice, his body parts packed as
deep as Champagne bottles in ice, and answered the question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Why put himself through all this?
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy playing,'' Ewing said just before he asked a Knicks
trainer to wrap his back with a bigger bandage. ``When I finish
playing, I want to leave with a ring. The most important thing is I
enjoy doing it. I enjoy waking up and practicing. I enjoy playing
against the best players in the world. It feels good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who in this league doesn't play with any pain or nagging
nicks? We all play with it. The question is: Can you go out and
perform at a high level like that? I think that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the state of his scratch-and-dent-sale body, he did
remarkably well in Game 1. He played 40 minutes, scored 17 points,
grabbed 9 rebounds and blocked a shot. But the issue isn't his
statistics; it's his mobility. It's how the Heat drove fearlessly
into the paint for uncontested layups, how languid Ewing was in
transition, how difficult it was for him to prevent Alonzo Mourning
from taking over the game at the end.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, Mourning, who scored 10 of 26 points in
the final eight minutes of the game, was able to get position deep
in the post against Ewing for an easy layup. And he was able to
bolt outside of a late-arriving Ewing for a key jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alonzo had a great game, especially down the stretch,'' Ewing
said. ``He got the ball deep and was able to make plays. I have to
do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ewing was not the root of the Knicks' problems on Sunday.
Even if he is more mobile in Game 2, he won't be the cure-all,
either. There were other issues _ some relating to Ewing and some
not _ that led to the loss on Sunday. Monday, Coach Jeff Van Gundy
outlined the three areas that need most improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we didn't start the game with the intensity we'd talked
about all week,'' Van Gundy said. ``There was a discernible
difference between Toronto in the first quarter and the first
quarter Sunday. They shot 60 percent, and outrebounded us, 16-7.
They were 8 for 8 on layups, and we never fouled them once. Two, we
didn't fight for the ball as much as we need to. And three, we
didn't pass the ball like we had to pass to shoot the percent we
need to shoot to win down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, the Knicks totaled only four assists.
Even though they had the Heat in the penalty with seven minutes
left in the game, the Knicks didn't drive but instead launched
quick jumpers early in the shot clock. And they didn't work the
ball into Ewing. After Ewing made his first two shots in the fourth
quarter, he didn't touch the ball for the last nine minutes of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the Knicks' problem was the way the Heat sealed off
Ewing. Part of it was the sloppy ball-handling by the Knicks. Allan
Houston tried to whip a pass into Ewing, but threw it right into
the hands of P.J. Brown with 28.3 seconds on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take care of the ball,'' Van Gundy said. ``Eight of
their 19 fourth-quarter points came off our five turnovers. And
they didn't turn it over once in the fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   Without the ball in his hands, Ewing could make a difference
only with his defense. But with his body weighed down with
injuries, with Van Gundy choosing to leave him one-on-one in
coverage, Ewing couldn't prevent Mourning's run. He will try again
on Tuesday. Whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing, I'm playing,'' Ewing said. ``I've always had
bangs and bumps. I've always had ice on my knees and other parts of
my body. That's part of basketball. That's part of life. I don't
even concern myself with it. The only thing I'm concerned about is
that tomorrow, at 8 p.m., I feel good. I'll go out and play to the
best of my abilities.''

SUNS' SKILES IS SERIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Scott Skiles was being serious, which is like
saying Shaquille O'Neal is big. O'Neal is big all the time.
</P>
<P>
   So as Skiles stood somewhat uncomfortably against the wall
outside the Suns locker room moments before his Suns would open
their playoff series against the top-seeded Lakers, the NBA's
newest coaching Boy Wonder didn't hesitate in his response.
</P>
<P>
   Didn't Skiles, all of 36 and leading his first postseason team,
feel just a tad more under the microscope coaching in the playoffs
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said flatly. ``That doesn't even cross my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bet he meant it, too. Skiles is what you might call focused.
This is a very serious young man, but then, Skiles can't remember a
time when he wasn't intense.
</P>
<P>
   Intense, serious, focused, competitive, tough, a throwback
</P>
<P>
   those are the terms used to describe Skiles since he first
started garnering national attention from a small Indiana high
school in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a man who smiles a lot, though he has plenty to be
happy about these days. He was supposed to be Danny Ainge's
third-year assistant, and when the season began, he was. Then 20
games into it, Ainge decided he had to spend more time with his
wife and six children, and wanted out of coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock,'' said Suns chairman Jerry Colangelo. `It was
really a surprise when he called to tell us he wanted to meet. It
was after a loss Saturday in San Antonio. On Sunday morning, I got
a call in church that Danny wanted to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the locker room, and just as I sat down he said,
`I've made a decision. I'm going to quit.' It wasn't like he wanted
to talk about options. As soon as he explained why, I didn't even
raise a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he said, `I feel really good about the fact that Scott
Skiles is here. I don't know what your plans are, but I wouldn't
hesitate to give him the job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles was young but felt sure he was ready. He had always
wanted to be a coach, and since he first began his 10-year career
as an NBA point guard, wanted to coach in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   He had spent a year as a head coach for PAOK in Greece when
Ainge first got the Phoenix job, remembered the tenacious Orlando
Magic guard and asked that he be made an Suns assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember in our first conversation, Danny saying, `I don't
think he's going to be here very long. He's going to be a head
coach in this league and it won't take him long to get there
because he's really good,''' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it wouldn't take him long, but he wasn't going
anywhere. When Ainge made his decision to walk away, Colangelo said
he didn't hesitate to give Skiles the job and not on an interim
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott was kind of made for this,'' he said. ``I mean, this was
something he dreamed about, something he always wanted. He saw
himself as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, you never know how it's going to happen or if
it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles directed the Suns to a 40-22 mark. He stressed teamwork.
He stressed hard work. And as uncharacteristic as it sounded to
those used to their wild shoot-'em-up offense, he stressed defense.
</P>
<P>
   Showing confidence and intelligence, he asked Colangelo to bring
back John MacLeod as an assistant coach. MacLeod had been a head
coach in the NBA for 18 years _ and for all or parts of 14 seasons
with Phoenix _ and ranks 10th on the league's all-time win list
(707 victories).
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches who look in the mirror know themselves pretty well,''
Colangelo said. ``Know their own strengths and weaknesses. And the
kind of people you should have assisting are those that kind of
fill in the blanks. What John brought was experience. And that was
indication that Scott's not intimidated by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Said MacLeod: ``I think that says something about Scotty. He
wasn't threatened. He wasn't looking at it from that perspective.
He was looking at it from having a veteran, experienced coach who's
been in the playoffs, who's coached 1300-some games, who could help
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The players already knew Skiles, and responded quickly to his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not having a dominant big man, the Suns allowed just
93.7 points per game. Over a full season, that would have been the
second-fewest points allowed in team history. Opponents shot a
team-record-low .424 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles had built his own career through hard work and attitude
and he didn't have to say much to get his message across.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's doing his job, he's more a reserved type of guy,''
said Suns veteran Cliff Robinson. ``He's not really the type to be
out there laughing and joking. He's serious. That's what we've come
to expect from him. But at the same time, when he's away from this,
he's a cool guy to hang out with.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles said that's the way he was even as a youth growing up in
Plymouth, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just very, very intense even at a young age,'' Skiles
said earlier this year. ``I was cognizant then that some people
were kind of against me. If a Little League game was rained out, I
was hard to handle. I was not an easy child to raise by anybody's
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles wasn't just aware of the movie ``Hoosiers,'' he lived it.
He led the state in scoring in 1982. He hit a 25-foot shot in the
closing seconds to send the state championship game into overtime,
scoring 39 points in the double-OT victory. Plymouth became the
smallest school to win the Indiana state title since Milan in 1954
_ Milan was the school made famous by ``Hoosiers.''
</P>
<P>
   At Michigan State he was the nation's second-leading scorer
(27.4) before being taken with the 22nd overall pick by Milwaukee.
In Orlando, he played with O'Neal, Brian Shaw and current Suns
guard Penny Hardaway. His 30 assists against Denver on Dec. 30,
1990 is an NBA record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great player and from the look of things, he's going
to be a great coach in this league,'' O'Neal said. ``He's pretty
good right now, but in a couple years, he's going to be one of the
dominant coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo rewarded Skiles with a five-year contract last month.
Rumor has it, Skiles smiled. His unexpected opening could be
leading to a lengthy run. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 28, a California man who uses the Internet name
``golfpoorly'' put a half dozen items up for sale on eBay, the
online auction company. Along with an unopened roll of twine, a
never inflated basketball, a Mexican voodoo mask, a Netgear network
card and a pewter frame, he offered a ``great big wild abstract
painting'' that he said was bought years ago at garage sale in
Berkeley and has a small hole inflicted by a son wielding a plastic
tricycle.
</P>
<P>
   The opening bid for each of the items was a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday evening, after 95 offers, bidding for the painting _
which on a computer screen looks vaguely like a landscape swathed
in red, orange and a pinkish accent _ had soared to $135,805. When
the auction closed at 9:49 p.m. Eastern time, a man named Rob
Keereweer in the Netherlands was the high bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual run up was fueled by speculation that the painting
might be a 1952 work by Richard Diebenkorn, the California painter
known for his sublime use of color in abstract and representational
works.
</P>
<P>
   The six-figure sale is not only one of the highest prices paid
online for art, it is also a powerful testimony to the ability of
the Internet to ignite a sales frenzy, even for expensive items
that may or may not be what people think they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still astonished that anyone would pay that much for
something they hadn't seen,'' said John Elderfield, the chief
curator at the Museum of Modern Art and an expert on Diebenkorn.
</P>
<P>
   A real painting by Diebenkorn, who died in 1993, could be worth
millions. The record price at auction was set in November 1998,
when his 1959 painting ``Horizon: Ocean Park'' sold at Sotheby's
for $3.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But eBay does not vouch for the authenticity of anything people
sell on its site. It considers the deals to be private
transactions. And for now at least no one knows for sure whether
``golfpoorly's'' painting is by Diebenkorn or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The palette is right, and the signature is right on,'' said
Will Ameringer, a New York dealer who has sold work by Diebenkorn.
``It's either a good fake or the real thing.'' Other experts
agreed, but they and Ameringer said they could not give definitive
opinions about its authenticity without seeing the painting.
</P>
<P>
   Which is impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kaiser, a private art dealer in Medford, Ore., bid the
painting up to $128,600 on Sunday but then changed his mind. He
said he withdrew his offer after the seller, who, according to
Kaiser, is a lawyer who lives in the Sacramento area, refused to
let him see the painting. ``It made me suspicious when he would not
let me see it when I'm making the effort to drive five hours down
there,'' said Kaiser, who added that he ``buys a lot of art
online.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfpoorly,'' responding to an e-mail message, declined to
comment, citing the advice of his lawyer, the possibility of theft
and tax consequences. He signed the message, ``Ken.'' The name
associated with the e-mail address is K.A. Walton, and a phone
message left at the home of Kenneth Walton in Sacramento was not
returned. That left open several questions, such as why he did not
withdraw the painting once people began attributing it to
Diebenkorn in favor of selling it through the established art
market, where it could presumably attract a much higher price.
</P>
<P>
   But ``golfpoorly'' told his story of the painting online when he
put it up for sale. He bought it, he said, before he got married.
``My wife has never let me keep it in the house,'' he explained _
though he ``always kind of liked it'' _ so he decided to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfpoorly'' said the painting was 2 feet 11 inches by 3 feet
11 inches, and noted that the hole was about an inch and a quarter
long and ``would be easy to fix with duct tape.''
</P>
<P>
   He never said it was a Diebenkorn, but along with a picture of
the entire painting _ incorrectly oriented vertically, which he
noted in his posting _ he posted a close-up of the hole. The
signature, ``R.D. '52,'' was easily discernible in the close-up,
and it stirred up the interest and skepticism as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '50s, Diebenkorn made a series of abstract works in
successive locations for which the cycles are named _ Albuquerque,
N.M., Urbana, Ill., and Berkeley, Calif. The Berkeley series began
around 1953, so an unknown 1952 work would not be unreasonable. The
colors in ``golfpoorly's'' painting match those he used in his
Berkeley series.
</P>
<P>
   A Berkeley painting from 1955 sold for $1.8 million at Sotheby's
in May 1998, and other have sold privately for about $1 million,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfpoorly'' said he was surprised by all the fuss. On Sunday,
he added information to the eBay posting that apologized for not
answering all the inquiries he had and said, ``we're freaked out by
all of this, and because of the high price this painting is going
for (WOW!!!!) I contacted an attorney.'' On the lawyer's advice, he
said, he added the following online: ``This painting is sold in the
same manner as the other items I am selling on eBay, and requires
full payment within 7 days of the auction, in advance of delivery
to the buyer, and is sold as described in the auction description,
without representation as to authorship or authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Golfpoorly'' registered with eBay last summer and has sold
items on eBay a couple of times before. Those who have bought from
him give him good reviews. On his eBay ID card, 13 people did so,
while none rated him negatively. ``Charged me less for shipping
than he quoted,'' wrote one whose handle is ``cheesesix.'' ``A
really nice guy.'' Another buyer, a self-employed, self-described
computer geek in Los Angeles, who claims to buy online all the
time, said the espresso machine he bought from ``golfpoorly'' for
about $280 was ``very good and honestly described.''
</P>
<P>
   Such testimonials undoubtedly enhance ``golfpoorly's''
credibility, but they are hardly relevant to whether this painting
is an authentic Diebenkorn worth six figures.
</P>
<P>
   As online auctions have gathered force in the past few years,
numerous sites have begun to offer art. Those related to the art
world usually have some standards. Artnet.com, for example, says
that ``All lots have been vetted by reputable dealers and compared
with existing auction results,'' while Sotheby's guarantees the
authenticity of works it sells on both sothebys.com and
sothebys.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be no definitive records of online art sales, but
according to Art and Auction magazine, the highest price on an art
site transaction was $168,000 for a 1959 watercolor by Lucio
Fontana, which sold on artnet.com in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay does not keep track of transactions _ there were more than
53 million listings in the last quarter alone, a spokesman said _
but it believes that a Picasso sold for just under $2 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   And sites like eBay are truly ``buyer beware'' locations, a fact
acknowledged by the man who bid $135,605 for ``golfpoorly's''
offering. Declining to speak at length from the Netherlands, where
he lives, he wrote via e-mail, ``I myself would like to concentrate
on the auction right now, the final moment of the auction is in the
middle of the night for me and I need time to explain to my wife
why I am bidding so much money on a painting that I have not seen
in the flesh.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``golfpoorly,'' his other five auction items fetched a
total of $43.75.

SHAQ COULD SEE DOUBLE-TEAM FROM SUNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ As Shaquille O'Neal awaits the FedEx
package delivering his MVP trophy today, he also awaits a different
kind of honor from the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The double team. The triple team. And perhaps, the brass-plated
kitchen sink.
</P>
<P>
   Against mostly single coverage, O'Neal scored 37 points in Game
1 of the Lakers' second-round series against the Suns. So now it's
Phoenix's move, and the Lakers anticipate more double-teams of the
MVP-in-waiting (a news conference for the coronation will be held
this afternoon).
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll happen. They just have to figure out a way to do it,''
coach Phil Jackson said. ``Right now they're just hoping that Luc
(Longley) can stem the tide. And he did the first (quarter). His
body and presence on Shaquille was the difference ... to at least
contend with Shaq's thrust, his first, initial shot. And he started
off very poorly, 1 for 7, but found some second shots and found
some extra energy and then Luc got in foul trouble and he got a
rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, Phoenix doesn't do much double-teaming, and they have
just two days to adopt a strategy for Game 2, Wednesday at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be tough,'' Jackson said. ``They'll have some problems.
What they did well against San Antonio (in the first round) is they
fronted and then they had a person coming from the backside on the
lob passes to David Robinson and then crowd him with that player
from the back, or block shots with (Corie) Blount or (Shawn)
Marion. And they're very athletic and can do that. Against David,
it worked OK, although he scored very well against them. But with
Shaq, his size and ability to overload the floor, and get the ball
to him anyway when he's fronted, will be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who struggled at times against the Sacramento Kings'
double teams in the first round, said he's ready for whatever the
Suns do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to hope my reaction skills are up and ready, so
whatever they do, we just have to react,'' he said. ``They're
probably going to do something different, but we have a lot of
weapons on this team, and as long as I do all the other stuff, like
rebound and defend, my team will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   How would O'Neal stop O'Neal?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the unexplained question,'' he said. ``That's an
`X-Files' question.''
</P>
<P>
   TROPHY TIME: O'Neal was reserved when the subject of winning MVP
came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I get it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That much is a given. The only question is whether he'll be the
first player in history to win unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a nice accolade,'' he said. ``I'm having a
pretty good year. It'd be nice to be appreciated by you guys (in
the media).''
</P>
<P>
   REST TIME: After playing four playoff games in eight days,
Jackson gave his regulars the day off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my standpoint, today is a day that we needed to have
off,'' he said. ``I thought we needed just some time to get live
legs again, so we could play that kind of speed ball that is
required against Phoenix. ... The second thing is the mental
attitude. They have to get the mental attitude to play aggressive
enough, so that we don't get complacent or lackadaisical.''
</P>
<P>
   BIG HEADS: Having routed the Sacramento Kings twice only to see
them tie the series, the Lakers are trying to avoid another bout
with overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we had that problem playing against Sacramento,'' John
Salley said. ``We blew them out and we came in relaxed, and they
taxed us for that overconfidence, for that ego thrust that we did
when we went up to Sacramento. So I don't think we're going to run
into that trap again. We know what it's like to embarrass
ourselves. We know it takes 11 more (victories) to win a
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   OUCH REPORT: Suns All-Star Jason Kidd had to skip practice
Monday and probably will sit today as well to rest his sore left
ankle, which he broke March 22. He is questionable for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the game wore on, I could tell that he wasn't doing the
things he really is capable of doing,'' said Lakers guard Derek
Fisher, who has a bone spur in his right ankle. ``I was kind of
joking with him there at the end of the game that we're both out
here hobbling on one foot, trying to do everything we can to help
our teams.'' &QL;

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers first base coach Ed Napoleon
announced his retirement yesterday, ending a 45-year baseball
career. Napoleon, 62, wants to be with his wife Marcy, who has not
been in good health at their home in Bradenton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making the right decision,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon's career began in 1956 as an outfielder for Dothan,
Ala., in the St. Louis Cardinals organization. That was the same
year Mickey Mantle won the Triple Crown and Don Larsen pitched his
perfect game in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon played 15 seasons in the minors, spent 17 years as a
minor-league manager or coach (he managed and played one year) and
another 14 years as a big-league coach with the New York Yankees,
Cleveland Indians, Kansas City Royals, Houston Astros and the
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank Doug Melvin, Johnny Oates, the players and
everybody in the Texas Rangers organization for an outstanding 51/2
years,'' Napoleon said. ``The people here made it even more
difficult to retire at this time. However, it is very important to
me to be home in Florida, and this is the right decision for me and
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon's primary assignment was working with the Rangers
outfielders and, Rusty Greer said, ``He knows as much about playing
the outfield as anybody. More importantly, he's a good person. It's
going to be sad to see him go but I think he's making the right
decision.''  &QL; 
No successor named
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have yet to name a successor for Ed Napoleon but
Oates said the No. 1 priority is to find a someone who can work
with their young outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some ideas, but that will be the No. 1 need,'' Oates
said. ``It's not imperative we stay within the organization but I
would like to.''
</P>
<P>
   One candidate would be Dick McLaughlin, their minor-league
outfield and base-running instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon's departure leaves an opening in the Rangers coaching
staff for the first time since Oates was hired in 1994. He has had
the same six original coaches until Napoleon retired.  &QL; 
Useful acquisition
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners signed free-agent second baseman Mark McLemore from
Texas because he can play in the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   But injuries have forced the team to use him at second base more
than planned, Mariners manager Lou Piniella said. Last night,
McLemore started at second and led off as the Mariners began a
three-game series against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Going in, he led the Mariners in at-bats (104) and stolen bases
(six) and was their fourth-leading run scorer (19) despite a .221
batting average. He also had 19 walks, third best on the team.
Saturday, he delivered the game-winning hit in the ninth inning a
1-0 victory against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stabilizes things,'' Piniella said. ``He's had a slow start
with the bat, but he's taken a lot of pitches at the plate. He's
been getting walks and some key hits.''
</P>
<P>
   McLemore hasn't lost confidence despite not being invited back
by Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't listen to what anybody says,'' McLemore said. ``If I
listened to what everybody said, I would have never lasted 14 days,
much less 14 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners pitcher Aaron Sele, a teammate of McLemore's in Texas
for two seasons, said McLemore hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same-old, same-old,'' Sele said. ``He's having fun.
That's the way he is.''  &QL; 
Sele's value increases
</P>
<P>
   With Freddy Garcia and Jamie Moyer on the disabled list, former
Rangers starter Aaron Sele has become the Mariners' No. 1 starter,
Mariners manager Lou Piniella said. Sele, who will start against
the Rangers tomorrow, is 2-2 with a 4.50 earned-run average. He
leads the Mariners in innings with 38.
</P>
<P>
   Sele has contributed in other ways. Moyer said the team's
younger pitchers have found it easy to turn to the seven-year
veteran for his thoughts about pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the younger guys on the team have a lot of potential
but not a lot of experience,'' Moyer said. ``It's good seeing that
veteran kind of guy. He's been able to add to this clubhouse.''  &QL; 
Former teammates
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele and Mark McLemore said they'll enjoy seeing their
former teammates this week, but the Rangers don't resemble the team
they played for last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've pulled off some trades and let some free agents go _
they're definitely a different team,'' Sele said. ``But they're
still leading the league in hitting. They've put another good team
on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores such as Friday's 17-16 final don't go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team can score some runs,'' McLemore said. ``Trust me _ I
know. I used my legs to score those runs many times.''

NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT IN LAKERLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is Sunday afternoon, and the eternal spring rite known as the
NBA playoffs is set to unfold again at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before the Game 1 tipoff between the Lakers and Phoenix
Suns, Jerry West is a picture of calm.
</P>
<P>
   He is in luxury box suite 10B, private sanctuary of Laker owner
Jerry Buss and his colorful entourage that includes some of the
most resilient hangers-on in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He is standing and gazing down at the magnificent new structure,
and he begins reflecting on the arenas he played in during his Hall
of Fame career in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We once played on the stage at the Shrine Auditorium,'' he
says. ``We once played at the L.A. State gym. This place is so
awesome. There was nothing even close to this when I played. I
played in a lot of old convention halls and civic auditoriums and
cow barns.''
</P>
<P>
   West smiles softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this luxury suite is bigger than most of our locker
rooms were in those days,'' he cracks.
</P>
<P>
   The match begins.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Friday night's raucous atmosphere for the Lakers' Game 5
wipeout of the Sacramento Kings ``My ears still are ringing,'' says
West the crowd is subdued.
</P>
<P>
   So are the Lakers in the early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows who's going to win this series.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns are a nice, little feisty team with athletic players
that eliminated the San Antonio Spurs, but Luc Longley, Cliff
Robinson, Corie Blount and Oliver Miller won't be able to handle
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal misses 6 of his first 7 shots, but you know eventually he
will start dominating the proceedings as the Phoenix coach, Scott
Skiles, curiously chooses to guard him with only one defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a case of what poison you want to choose,'' Skiles will
say afterward. ``If you double team Shaq, he passes out to
teammates for open jump shots. So you concede the 30 to 40 points
to Shaq, and try to put the clamps down on the rest of his
teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one of O'Neal's teammates, Kobe Bryant, is as
superb as O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers are up by only five (46-41) at halftime, but you get
the feeling that they have matters under their control.
</P>
<P>
   As I repair to the Chick Hearn press room, I run into that
well-known fight patron, Magic Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have done as well against Lennox Lewis as that
basketball player (Michael Grant) did,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson nods with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was embarrassing,'' he says, referring to Lewis' second
round devastation of Grant.
</P>
<P>
   The final half follows the expected script, as O'Neal's lurking
presence in the middle forces the Suns into taking mostly outside
shots which they keep missing and as O'Neal and Bryant attack
relentlessly on offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers pull away to a 15-point edge (75-60) at the end of
three quarters, and soon it gets even larger as the bored audience
contents itself watching cheering fans caught on the huge Staples
Center video scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, as I head for the interview room, I run into an old
acquaintance, Jerry Colangelo, the owner of the Suns and Arizona
Diamondbacks whom I've known since 1968 when he was a mere general
manager of the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew you when you couldn't rub two nickels together,'' I say
to the most powerful man in Arizona athletics, now a millionaire
many, many times over.
</P>
<P>
   He laughs, and we reminisce about old times when, as an interim
coach, he nearly led the Suns to colossal upset of the Lakers
during the 1970 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the Lakers down 3-1, but we just couldn't stop Wilt
Chamberlain,'' he recalls wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem as though this Sun team can stop Shaquille
O'Neal, either,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither has any other team been able to stop O'Neal this
season,'' says Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``See you here Wednesday night,'' I say in my good-bye.
</P>
<P>
   ``No you won't,'' says Colangelo. ``My wife and I are going to
Europe. I'm going to be out of the country for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, even Jerry Colangelo knows the destiny that
inevitably awaits the Suns against a Laker team they've failed to
beat in five attempts this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview room, the coaches, Phil Jackson and Scott
Skiles, recite what you expect coaches to recite after a 105-77
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We committed too many turnovers (23) to win,'' says Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to play with good energy at both ends of the court
after a slow start,'' says Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Etc., etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal appears, and says his slow start against the
Suns might be traced to a dramatic change in his evening sleeping
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to bed last night at 11 o'clock, and I haven't gone to
bed that early in eight years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   I ask O'Neal how he feels when he hears the crowd start
chanting, ``MVP! MVP! MVP!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me feel good,'' he says. ``It makes me feel as though
I've been doing a good job. It's a nice accolade to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jerry Buss' private lounge later, Bill Bertka, the venerable
assistant coach, is waxing poetic about Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Shaq continues to improve, he's going to become the best
big man ever,'' he says. ``I think he has the potential to do more
things better than all the other great big men.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson is seated at a table nearby, conversing with a
friend as he carefully nurses a glass of red wine.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson tells me he's living in Playa del Rey, and I ask him how
he likes Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great,'' he says. ``The weather's been great. The
people have been great. The team's been great. What's there to
complain about?''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was an air of curiosity at Christie's on Monday
night as the first big evening sale of the spring got under way.
Not only was it the first sale since the federal antitrust
investigation of Christie's and Sotheby's heated up, but it was
also the first auction since both companies raised the fees they
charge buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Many works sold for far less than their low estimates, but sell
they did. All but five of the 47 works on offer found buyers. The
sale totaled $104.5 million, just above its low estimate of $101
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockefeller Center salesroom was packed with the usual
faces: dealers and collectors who gather twice a year to watch
which way the art market will go. While the sale had moments when
prices soared far above anybody's expectations, many works sold for
far below their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, experts said, had little to do with either the
investigation or the new buyer's premium. When Christie's put the
sale together month ago, there were no major estates, and as a
result they had to convince sellers that now was the right time to
get top dollar for their art. Christie's also had what dealers call
``the Phillips factor.'' With Bernard Arnault, the new owner of
Phillips, offering sellers large sums to compete with Sotheby's and
Christie's, estimates became more aggressive than they might have
otherwise been.
</P>
<P>
   By the day of the auction, however, Christie's had a good idea
of where prices were going and cleverly persuaded sellers to drop
their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   By far the evening's biggest success was for Caillebotte's ``Man
on the Balcony, Boulevard Haussmann'' (1880), which depicts a man
who experts think was the artist's lawyer, Albert Courtier, shaded
by a red-and-white awning, looking out at the boulevard from the
balcony of Caillebotte's Paris apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Seven bidders tried to buy the painting, which had been
estimated at $6 million to $8 million. It eventually sold for $14.3
million to Simon de Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in
Europe, who is now a private dealer and was bidding on behalf of a
collector. The price was a record for Caillebotte, seven times his
previous record of $2 million, set at Christie's in London in 1989
at the height of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigation, which came to wide
attention when two top officials at Sotheby's resigned in February,
centers on whether the leadership of Sotheby's Christie's colluded
to set commissions they charge buyers and sellers. While those
allegations had certainly registered in the minds of those present
at the auction, most drew a firm distinction between the
behind-the-scenes scandal and the art on display.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the pictures that people are interested in,'' said Rodney
Hawes, a 40-something retiree who arrived early to scout the field.
``The antitrust stuff has nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another buyer was even more adamant. A 47-year-old bidder from
London, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said, ``Anybody who
doesn't bid or bids less on a painting they love and want for their
collection because of some investigation is insane.''
</P>
<P>
   The evening's most expensive painting was one of the greatest
examples of Monet's ``Waterlily'' series, painted by the lily pond
behind the artist's house in Giverny, outside Paris. This one, from
1906, has been in the same unidentified private collection for more
than 85 years and is in pristine condition. Estimated at $20
million to $25 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder
for $20.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include Christie's commission, 17.5 percent of the
first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates
do not reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Another Monet that received considerable attention was
``Windmills in Holland,'' an 1871 landscape that captured the
artist's talent for capturing flickering reflections of light on
water. It sold for $3 million, its low estimate, to an unidentified
telephone bidder. The painting came from the estate of Guy
Bjorkman, a businessman who divided his time between Manhattan and
Geneva before his death last year. Also being sold from his estate
was an 1890 Toulouse-Lautrec portrait of a woman known only as
Berthe the Deaf. This was one of the evening's biggest casualties.
Estimated at $6 million to $8 million, nobody raised a paddle.

AGAINST DEVILS, IT IS SIX AND OUT FOR THE LEAFS  

</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Devils ignored failures of the past
in dominating the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-0, Monday night to win
their second-round series in six games and reach the Eastern
Conference finals for the first time since capturing the Stanley
Cup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The last three times the Devils had led a four-of-seven-game
series, 3-2, they had lost twice, including last season against the
Penguins and in 1994 to the Rangers. Judging by the way they Devils
played at Continental Arena Monday night, they didn't forget those
failures. They allowed just six shots on goal _ the fewest allowed
in the playoffs or regular season since expansion in 1967 _ and
took the lead just 18 seconds into the game. With Scott Stevens
leading the way, they were more physical and dominated all parts of
the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' hits on Tomas Kaberle and Kevyn Adams Saturday night in
Toronto most likely reverberated in Monday night's encounter. Those
two crunching open-ice hits by the Devils' captain were reminiscent
of his thunderous hit on Detroit's Slava Kozlov in the second game
of the Stanley Cup finals in 1995, when the Devils swept the Red
Wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why he's our captain,'' said John Madden, a rookie
center, who has been playing with a high level of intensity in the
playoffs. ``He's always given us a lift, whether scoring goals or
making hits like that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Martin Brodeur earned his second shutout of the playoffs
and eighth of his playoff career, the defense and the physical
players did their part. In addition, Petr Sykora and Jason Arnott
scored against Curtis Joseph in the early stages of the first and
second periods. Madden's empty-net goal with six seconds left iced
the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs failed to convert on their two power plays
Monday night, leaving them 0 for 20 in this series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils will face the winner of the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh
series, which the Flyers are leading, 3-2. Game 6 is in Pittsburgh
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora put the Devils on the right track 18 seconds into the
game when he dug out the puck in a crowd in front of Joseph for his
fourth goal of these playoffs. The goal came after Patrik Elias
kicked the puck from behind the goal to the right of Joseph on a
play that started with Arnott keeping the puck near Joseph the
first time the Devils entered Toronto's zone.
</P>
<P>
   Arnott scored the Devils' second goal 25 seconds into the second
period. This time it was Sykora who made the pass from behind the
goal.Arnott, who was in the slot to take the pass, scored his
second goal of the playoffs. The sequence started with Ken Daneyko
keeping the puck in Toronto's zone.
</P>
<P>
   Sarcastic chants of ``Cu-jo, Cu-jo'' for Toronto's goaltender
and patriotic chants of ``U.S.A., U.S.A.'' shortly after Arnott's
goal echoed throughout Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd gave Stevens and the Devils a standing ovation
midway through the third period when Stevens crushed Tie Domi,
Toronto's main policeman, with an open-ice hit midway as the Maple
Leaf entered the Devils' zone.
</P>
<P>
   With the privilege of making the last change, Robinson
maintained the line of Bobby Holik, Sergei Brylin and Randy McKay
for almost the entire game. Holik was so effective against Mats
Sundin that the captain of the Maple Leafs even took a roughing
penalty against Holik.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive pairing against Sundin's line was Stevens and
Brian Rafalski. And for the sixth time in the series, they played
so well it inspired the rest of the Devils to raise their game to a
higher level.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who took 27 shots on goal, were so effective
defensively in the first two periods that they allowed five shots
in the 40 minutes, including just two in the second period. The
defensive play of Madden and Jay Pandolfo was particularly
inspiring for the Devils; it bordered on brilliance in shutting
down the Maple Leafs' second manpower advantage.
</P>
<P>
   After a team meeting Monday, Daneyko, the defenseman who has
played in all of the Devils' 118 playoff games, recalled the
Devils' previous postseason failures. ``You don't forget those
things,'' he said.

</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It's not quite seven weeks since Larry
Robinson took command as their coach, but in the Devils' sudden
success, it seems like seven years.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23 the Devils still had the best overall record in the
Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League, but they were in
a 5-10-2 slump. Lou Lamoriello, their prescient president and
general manager, judged that the team had lost what he called its
``ice discipline.'' So he sacked Robbie Ftorek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we were playing,'' Lamoriello said at the time, ``I
didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the Devils now halfway through the long dark Stanley
Cup tunnel, Lamoriello can see the light.
</P>
<P>
   In playing a virtually perfect game Tuesday night, the Devils
moved into the conference finals with a 3-0 shutout that limited
the Toronto Maple Leafs to only six shots on net _ the lowest
one-game total in either the regular schedule or the playoffs since
the NHL began to keep that statistic in its 1967-1968 expansion
season.
</P>
<P>
   Only six shots on net. That's now the symbol of how Larry
Robinson, in his firm and fatherly manner over the last seven
weeks, has restored the Devils' ``ice discipline'' established by
Coach Jacques Lemaire in the 1995 Stanley Cup triumph when Robinson
was an assistant coach. And maybe even improved on Lemaire's
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry keeps reminding us,'' said Scott Stevens, the Devils'
captain, ``that once we stop and play a simple game, we're a much
better hockey team. He's got our forwards doing a fantastic job of
checking. That's how Dallas won the cup last year; their forwards
were unbelievable. And that's how we've been able to limit the
opposing shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Daneyko, who has seen eight coaches come and go in his 15
seasons as a Devils defenseman, appreciated the way Robinson
simplifies strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an honest guy, a straight shooter,'' Daneyko said. ``Some
coaches go on and on for half an hour with Xs and Os, but the
players' attention span is never that long. Larry can get it done
in three minutes. He's a great translator. He can explain it and
simplify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daneyko thought Robinson has a ``toughness'' he didn't possess
in four frustrating seasons as the Los Angeles Kings coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives us a kick in the butt when we need it,'' Daneyko
said. ``He did it in the Florida series and he did it after the
opener in Toronto when we thought we had played well even though we
didn't win. He reminded us that if we didn't win, we didn't play
well enough.''
</P>
<P>
   During a game, you'll see Robinson talking quietly to a player,
sometimes patting a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discipline starts behind the bench and Larry is very cool back
there,'' Stevens said. ``If you see your coach jumping around, you
tend to get excited too. I've always liked a coach who stays calm,
who coaches the game and stays off the refs. Larry's calm and he
keeps the players the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long before Ftorek was fired, he was suspended for one game
for throwing part of the Devils' bench on the ice to protest a
referee's call.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is different. When a scrum broke out between goaltender
Martin Brodeur and Maple Leaf forward Darcy Tucker as the Devils'
4-3 victory ended Saturday night in Toronto, the Devils coach made
sure none of his players on the bench left the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want any of our people being suspended,'' he
explained, ``over something silly like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 solid seasons with the Montreal Canadiens as a Hall of
Fame defenseman, Robinson was considered hockey's heavyweight
champion when a fight developed, but he was never a goon. He earned
six Stanley Cup rings, including four in a row from 1976 to 1979,
but for all his glory, he was always humble. And he's humble now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about me,'' he said. ``It's about those 24 guys
that have been here since September. They're the guys out there
sweating and bleeding. All I do is point them in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   That direction is toward the other end of the long dark Stanley
Cup tunnel. Only time will tell if the Devils can get through that
tunnel to a Summer of partying with Lord Stanley's silver chalice,
but at least Lou Lamoriello can see the light. So can the Devils
and so can their seven-week miracle-worker, Larry Robinson.

GOODEN FALTERS AGAINST YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Veteran baseball people called him the greatest young
pitcher they had ever seen when he was 19 years old. But at 35,
Dwight Gooden is hanging on, accepting opportunity from any team
willing to extend it to him.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a minor league deal with the Houston Astros before
spring training _ National Association, not National League _ and
after one start of four innings for the pitching-starved Astros, he
was sold to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Now Gooden is pitching for
his hometown team and is 10 victories short of 200.
</P>
<P>
   But those 10 might seem like 10,000 to Gooden when he has games
like Monday night's, in which he was pasted in a 6-3 loss to the
Yankees, his first regular-season start against the team he pitched
a no-hitter for in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez, Clay Bellinger and Paul O'Neill hit home runs for
the Yankees. Andy Pettitte (2-1) threw six and one-third impressive
innings, and Mariano Rivera bounced back from his worst outing of
the season to earn his 12th save in a seven-pitch ninth inning. The
Yankees have 9 victories in their last 11 games and are 21-9.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, who won a Cy Young award with the Mets 15 years ago,
pitched for the Cleveland Indians the last two years but never
pitched against the Yankees during the regular season, because the
rotation didn't fall right, because he was injured or because
Manager Mike Hargrove was afraid of pitching him against the
Yankees, believing Gooden's emotions might overcome him.
</P>
<P>
   But Gooden probably needed as much emotion as possible Monday
night to overcome his lack of raw stuff. He threw 33 pitches in the
first inning, and the Yankee hitters did not swing and miss one
time. They swung with gusto, windmill hacks, as if they knew the
precise identity and location of the next pitch. Bernie Williams
crushed a high drive down the right-field line in the inning, a
ball hit so hard that even if you had your eyes closed, you would
have known it was going to travel a very long way.
</P>
<P>
   That drive hooked foul, barely, Williams running all the way to
first base, thinking it would stay fair, before he jerked his head
in dismay. Gooden's fate appeared all but assured, even with the
game scoreless. He had nothing with which to combat the Yankee
hitters, no good fastball or curve, not much control. He was going
to take a beating.
</P>
<P>
   Williams drew a walk, with Ricky Ledee already standing on
second base, and Gooden fell behind Martinez three balls and no
strikes. Martinez took one strike before blistering the next pitch
into the upper deck in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte gave the lead back over the second and third innings,
while falling into the pattern of trying to throw almost every
pitch inside to right-handed hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays' batters adjusted, Jose Canseco and Bubba
Trammell and others moving backward in the batter's box as they
swung and pulling Pettitte's pitches. Canseco stepped back and
slammed a double with two out in the third, driving home Gerald
Williams with the tying run. But Pettitte started pitching to both
sides of the plate in the fourth, fanning Kevin Stocker on a
fastball over the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough time for the Yankees to finish Gooden once and
for all. Gooden tried blowing a high fastball past Bellinger, but
Bellinger measured it perfectly, hammering it straight back over
Gooden's head, over the head of Gerald Williams in center field,
over the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden retreated behind the mound to rub a new baseball, his
mouth pursed, sweat pouring down his cheeks and forehead.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed back up the mound, and after issuing another walk, he
attempted to spin a curve low to O'Neill. But O'Neill bent over,
like someone playing croquet on a warm spring evening, and lined
the ball into the right-field stands, a two-run homer. Gooden won
two of his first three starts for the Devil Rays, the 189th and
190th victories of his career, but his night was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Rothschild took the ball from him, and as Gooden
reached the Devil Ray dugout, teammates reached out to shake his
hand and slap him on the back, an unusual reaction, considering
that the Yankees had just pounded him for six runs on six hits and
four walks over four and a third innings.

SORE FOOT MAY MAKE HARDAWAY AN EASY MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ One shoe was off, temporarily easing the discomfort in
Tim Hardaway's sprained left foot after the Miami Heat's 90-minute
practice Monday. The pressure on Hardaway, though, is expected to
be more intense on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Like a boxer targeting an opponent's bleeding wound, Hardaway
believes the Knicks will force him to defend more often against
penetration by the point guards in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway almost rolled over on his ankle trying to defend the
Knicks' Charlie Ward, who blew by him on a nifty fake and crossover
move in the third quarter of Game 1 on Sunday. Hardaway left the
court immediately and missed seven minutes while having his ankle
retaped in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll put the ball on the floor and drive more to see if I'm
able to stay with it,'' Hardaway said. ``I'd do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, who said he was 80 to 85 percent, had 6 points, 7
assists and 1 rebound in 30 minutes in Game 1. In four
regular-season meetings against the Knicks, he averaged 15.3
points, 7.8 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 37.5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't need to make any adjustments against me,'' Hardaway
said. ``I really didn't do anything. Hopefully, I'll be able to
play the same minutes I did Sunday and make a few more shots.
Mostly, I just want to be out there and be aggressive and lead my
team. I know I won't be able to do certain moves. But I know I'm
helping because I'm still a threat out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway's presence kept the Knicks' attention on the perimeter
and away from double-teaming Alonzo Mourning down low. Defensively,
Hardaway will be a liability if either Chris Childs or Ward
exploits his injured foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``One leg or arm, I still want him out there,'' Mourning said.
``He still has a huge effect on our play.'' Riley's Viewpoint
</P>
<P>
   After spending 90 minutes reviewing videotapes of Game 1, Heat
Coach Pat Riley offered the same analysis he did Sunday: the Heat's
defense was strong, but the Knicks, particularly Larry Johnson (4
of 9) and Latrell Sprewell (4 of 12), did not shoot well in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scored 6 of his 8 points in the first four minutes, but
disappeared in the fourth, missing the one shot he took _ an open
24-footer _ with 1 minute 11 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell sank two free throws in final minute, but clanked his
only two field-goal attempts. Neither player seemed in sync with
the offense down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major adjustment we've got to make is in some certain
situations where they had open shots and just didn't make them,''
Riley said. ``We can't expect that to happen again. Even though we
won, it was still very unclear. We can't sit idly by and think we
caused them to miss those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley also seemed more concerned about containing Sprewell,
Johnson and Allan Houston than he did about stopping Patrick Ewing,
who had 17 points and 9 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked a little stiff when he fell down a few times,''
Riley said. ``But he had a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley also pointed to turnovers and the Heat's shot selection in
the fourth quarter. ``We only took three or four bad shots and had
zero turnovers,'' Riley said. ``For us, that's rare. We took care
of the ball when it mattered most.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had one fewer turnover than the Heat (13-12), but
committed five turnovers in the fourth quarter. The Camby Factor
</P>
<P>
   The Heat's P.J. Brown wondered why the Knicks did not play
Marcus Camby as much as _ or more than _ Larry Johnson in Game 1.
In 27 minutes, Camby scored 11 points on 4-of-5 shooting and
grabbed 13 rebounds. In 39 minutes, Johnson had 8 points and 6
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different story if they play Camby more,'' Brown said.
``It means a lot more work for me. If you can get a body on him and
hurt his activeness, you can contain him. But it's not that
easy.'' &QL;

FURNACE'S LINK TO AIR CONDITIONER KILLED 6 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSLYN HEIGHTS, N.Y. _ A Long Island doctor who returned home
Sunday morning after working the late shift knew right away that he
had made a ghastly mistake, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   When Dr. Andrei Kranz, 42, opened his door, he found six family
members and friends dead in bed, all in their nightclothes. Among
them were his parents and his 3-year-old daughter. He tried to
resuscitate them and failed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, the moment the doctor saw the bodies he
suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. He told the police that he had
disconnected a carbon monoxide detector last summer because the
alarm was constantly going off, keeping him and his family from
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was indeed accidental carbon monoxide
intoxication, said Diane Makunas, a spokeswoman for the county
medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   The furnace and the air-conditioning system are both in a closed
basement room of Kranz's home. The exhaust vent for the
air-conditioner was closed and its intake filter was clogged. As
the heat turned oppressive on Friday afternoon, someone in the
house turned on the air-conditioning without turning off the
furnace, the police said. With no other source of air, the
conditioner pulled in the furnace fumes, cooled them and sent the
fumes throughout the house.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were Kranz's parents, Marcus Kranz, 85, and Victoria
Kranz, 74; his daughter; a live-in nanny, Emelia Dumtru, 58; and
two house guests, Dr. Emil Campeanu, 75, and his wife, Maria, 68,
of Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Kranz's wife, Anka, and stepdaughter were in Romania, family
friends said.

VAN GUNDY'S STRATEGY LACKED ONLY A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It only took one game for Jeff Van Gundy to go from the
genius who produced the blueprint to stop Vince Carter to the
second-guessed coach who left Marcus Camby on the bench at the end
of Sunday's Game 1 loss in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, Marcus, I thought, played very well,'' Van Gundy said
Monday, put in a position to defend himself after Camby had 11
points and 13 rebounds but did not play the last four minutes of
the game. ``But I really do believe we went down the stretch in
those three games against Toronto the same way and got the same
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, Larry Johnson did not hit the open 3-pointer to win
the game. On Sunday, with 1 minute 11 seconds remaining, Johnson
was left open but rushed his shot and left it well off the side of
the rim. If he had made the 3-pointer, the Knicks would have had a
1-point lead and the outcome might have been different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset every time something doesn't work, and it didn't
work,'' Van Gundy said. ``So believe me, you guys aren't the first
to evaluate me, I do it for myself. When it doesn't work, you made
the wrong decision as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about Marcus being on a roll. I thought that was our
best unit to finish with in Game 1. I thought Marcus played well. I
thought Larry played well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players, like Latrell Sprewell, wondered about Van Gundy's
strategy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Marcus is playing like that, he definitely needs to play,
but it's up to Jeff to decide that, though,'' said Sprewell, who
noted that he talked to Camby after the game and found his teammate
discouraged. ``We talked. But Marcus isn't the type, at this point,
to pout or anything like that. We're all about winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he just understands that Jeff wants him to come off
the bench. Obviously, I think Marcus probably would rather start.
And like I've said, we all want to play as many minutes as
possible. But we have so much talent, that's a difficult thing for
Jeff to go back and forth with. I think Marcus understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Camby was very accepting of his role in Game 1. He
didn't complain or question his coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just play in the concept of the team and within my game,''
he said. ``If it is coming out in the last five minutes, so be it.
The guys who are out there on the court are definitely money
players. Larry is a proven big-time player, as we saw last
series.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Toronto, an open 3-pointer for Johnson sealed Van Gundy
from the second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that ball swings to Larry and he makes it, everyone is
talking about something else today,'' Van Gundy said. ``People want
to make it out to be a complicated issue. But if you make your
shots, like we did in Toronto, it covers up the mistakes. If you
miss down the stretch, they aren't covered up as much.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: BUILDING A RESUME ON PERSEVERANCE  

</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCONUT GROVE, Fla. _ He was cut by Pat Riley, renounced by Rick
Pitino and traded by Larry Brown. On perseverance alone, you have
to love Bruce Bowen's resume.
</P>
<P>
   His last pit stop before his current tour of duty, his third,
with the Miami Heat? Bowen spent two days with the worst team in
the Eastern Conference. Then the Chicago Bulls released him.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to be told by three of the game's alleged
miracle workers that they like your talent and desire but you no
longer fit into their salary cap or roster plans.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bulls? As if they can't give you a decent run before the
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   You expect Bowen to nod his head with I-told-you-so
satisfaction, take a thinly veiled shot at everyone who served him
his walking papers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the player who appeared on the New York sports radar on
Sunday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the
Knicks _ the rangy 6-foot-7-inch swingman who put a hand in Allan
Houston's face, steered Latrell Sprewell toward the Heat front line
and made an important 3-pointer in Miami's victory _ folded his
arms and allowed a half-smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the business,'' he said Monday in the LaSalle High
School gymnasium, where the Heat prepared for Game 2 on Tuesday
night. ``I felt like I would play somewhere. It was just a matter
of when.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your perspective, Bowen either arrived at the right
place at the right time for Miami or else the Knicks were literally
in the wrong place at the wrong time when he became available.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy wanted Bowen badly for his ability
to come off the bench to defend big guards aggressively. But the
Heat claimed Bowen off waivers on Feb. 23 because of a quirk of
timing. Under National Basketball Association rules, teams with
inferior records get to claim players before those with better
records. Feb. 23 happened to be one of only two days all season
that the Knicks were in sole possession of first place in the
Atlantic Division, ahead of the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of good fortune that goes into this,'' Van Gundy
said. ``Everyone knows we wanted him, but it's just how it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen is not a franchise player, but he is one of those
athletic, long-limbed guys who make defenses better. He played 12
of the most efficient minutes off the Miami bench on Sunday, coming
in to guard Houston and switching to Sprewell when Marcus Camby
replaced Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Released by Riley after spending one week in training camp with
Miami in 1995, Bowen was brought back for a month at the close of
the 1996-97 season. He played in one game, and Riley did not
re-sign him. Bowen also played for Pitino in Boston for two seasons
before moving to Philadelphia last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 76ers, who liked him, shipped Bowen to Chicago to make
financial room for Toni Kukoc in the three-team trade with the
Golden State Warriors on Feb. 16. Bowen made it out of Chicago and
into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think God is moving in my life,'' he said. ``I'm a faithful
person. It's not the peaches and cream in this league that a lot of
people feel. It takes a lot of prayer and a lot of faith just to
get by.''
</P>
<P>
   His big-picture perspective and likable demeanor helped his
cause. There is more to Bowen than merely Cut by Riley and Traded
by Brown.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in a tough neighborhood in Fresno, Calif., and turned
down many opportunities to join the gang life, which claimed three
of his cousins. Bowen went on to star at Cal State-Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen was not drafted by the NBA, but he never got down about
his journeyman plight. He viewed his playing for five teams in
three years as valuable experience and tried not to focus on the
rejections. When Riley first released him, Bowen thought it was
cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed,'' he said. ``It was my first actual league
experience. Coming out of college, you don't ever think about the
business side of everything. But I called and told him I
appreciated the opportunity. I think that kind of caught him off
guard, because so many guys leave without saying anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, with so many tall shooting guards carving up his
team, Riley was happy to rehire Bowen. ``He basically said, `We
like your defense on the big guards in this league,''' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said after Game 1: ``When Allan and Latrell Sprewell stare
you in the eyes, some players get pretty defensive. Bruce is the
opposite. He and Dan Majerle get after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen is unsure how he will try to help contain Sprewell and
Houston for the rest of the series, but he already has a fairly
comprehensive scouting report laid out.
</P>
<P>
   ``All he needs is a little space to get up,'' Bowen said of
Houston. ``He can penetrate and kick, penetrate and pull up. You
have to try and limit him with his air space and hopefully force
him to beat you with the drive, if that's what you're trying to do.

SPORTS COLUMN: NEW ERA BRINGS MORE OFFENSE AND FANS TO BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stop. Just stop. Cease and desist. Enough already. Let the
concern and consternation over the increase in home runs and runs
end here and now. Instead of tearing out the hair and gnashing the
teeth, sit back and relax and enjoy what we have. It's a new era
for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened before. The advent of Babe Ruth marked the
beginning of an era that made baseball the country's sport of
choice. Without Ruth and the home runs he produced, baseball would
have withered and died eons ago. If an escalation of the Ruthian
experience is occurring now, let it be. Don't look for ways to
stifle it.
</P>
<P>
   Fans evidently don't find fault with the outbreak of scoring.
They may attend games this season in record numbers. That possible
development is what Major League Baseball anticipates, at least, so
why would anyone want to do anything to take away from the fans
something they appear to like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans are enjoying it,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said
Monday. ``Did we design this? No. We aren't that smart. We ought to
watch it and analyze it, but is it necessarily bad? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday night about 39,000 fans sat at The Ballpark in
Arlington and watched a game that could become the signature event
of the new era. Oakland led Texas, 15-7, after six and a half
innings, but the Rangers won the game, 17-16, scoring 10 runs in
the last three innings. The fans who were there were ecstatic and
will talk about the game for months, if not years, to come. No one
asked for his money back. It was 4 hours 1 minute of great
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The purists, of course, cringed. The purists, however, are not
paying the players' inflated salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Teams played 457 games in the first five weeks of the season.
They averaged 10.76 runs and 2.59 home runs a game. Pitchers
compiled a 4.96 earned run average in that period.
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists suspect that the ball has been doctored to
make it easier for batters to hit it out of the park. The fact is
home runs and runs have increased nearly every year since the first
of two expansions that added four teams in the 1990s. In 1992, the
year before the first expansion, teams averaged 8.39 runs and 1.45
home runs a game, and pitchers compiled a 3.80 ERA in the first 457
games.
</P>
<P>
   With the postexpansion proliferation of scoring and home run
hitting, new standards have to be established. The new era, for
example, needs a new ERA. A 3.00 earned run average used to be
considered good for a pitcher. With the average ERA up by about a
third, that standard has to be raised to 4.00. Last season the
American League had only eight starting pitchers at 4.00 or lower.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers are the players who are affected most adversely in the
new era. For the most part, they are fodder for hitters who have
become stronger and in parks that have become smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halladay is supposed to be a good young pitcher for Toronto,
but in seven starts this season he has an 11.53 ERA Jose Lima, a
21-game winner for Houston last year, has a 9.53 ERA in seven
starts and has been battered for a major league-high 16 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It is middle relief pitchers, though, who deserve hazard pay for
their efforts. With pitching staffs short on talent generally, if
the starter is knocked out early, his departure triggers a parade
of ineffective relievers who should still be learning their craft
in the minor leagues or who never demonstrated enough ability to
pitch in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Tanyon Sturtze is a reliever for the White Sox whose
professional career spanned the 1990's. In that decade, he spent
all but 110 playing days in the minors. Relieving for the White Sox
this season, he has a 13.03 ERA in eight appearances covering nine
and two-thirds innings &UR; . &LR; 
 &UR;  &LR;  Home run standards, too, must be raised because of inflation.
From 1976 until 1995, excluding the strike seasons of 1981 and
1994, the American and National League home run champions averaged
42 home runs. In the last five seasons, their successors have hit
an average of 53 home runs a year. Using that 26 percent inflation
rate, if 30 home runs had been considered a benchmark for sluggers,
that number should now be at least 38, if not 40.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's new era, however, has not eliminated low-scoring
games. This season has already produced seven 1-0 games and 14 2-1
games. Boston has lost a pair of 1-0 decisions; Los Angeles
suffered two 1-0 losses in consecutive games with different teams.
Cleveland lost two consecutive 2-1 games to different teams. The
Mets have won three 2-1 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Each day or set of days can still produce vastly different
results. Colorado scored 43 runs in three games against Montreal
last week, then went to San Francisco and was shut out twice in two
games.
</P>
<P>
   A premium is placed on good pitching more than ever in the new
era. But the success of Pedro Martinez (1.22), Randy Johnson
(0.93), Tom Glavine (1.73) and some others shows that hitters
haven't assumed command completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson using a different ball?''
Selig asked. ``Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials are nevertheless studying developments in the
new era. They are having the balls tested, they will go to Costa
Rica and tour the Rawlings factory where the balls are made, they
will study bats, they are considering raising the mound in a couple
of rookie minor leagues to see what effect such a change could have
on hitting.
</P>
<P>
   Officials met Monday with Rawlings people, who for the 972nd
time vowed that they had made no change in the balls. If that is
so, let the new era continue and take baseball wherever Mark
McGwire and friends lead it. Just leave a few 1-0 games around for
old times' sake. &QL;

ANALYSIS: A SINGULAR FUNERAL FOR A SINGULAR MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ The funeral fit the man. And of course the city too.
It was majestic, sacramental, solemn, prayerful. That was
uppermost. But it didn't lack a touch of the ticker-tape parade
either, and more than a touch of in-your-face political
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom has so much political, moral and cultural explosiveness
been put into such proximity as in the first few pews of St.
Patrick's Cathedral on Monday, where President Clinton and Hillary
Rodham Clinton knelt with Vice President Gore, the Bush dynasty,
father and son, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Gov. George Pataki,
Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. There were two former mayors, Edward Koch
and David Dinkins, and _ well, the idea is clear. Draw all the
lines of alliance, rivalry, anger and affection among those
individuals and the results would be as messy as a child's
scribble.
</P>
<P>
   It was Cardinal John O'Connor, along with the importance of New
York City, who brought all those leaders there. One suspects that
he would have been delighted and his mischievous sense of humor set
working overtime.
</P>
<P>
   If this was a national event for a national religious leader, it
was also an international event for a major figure in an
international church. There were five Roman Catholic cardinals from
overseas plus the two Americans, Cardinal William Baum and Cardinal
Edmund Szoka, who work in Rome. No less than Cardinal Angelo
Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state, celebrated the Mass. To go
any higher it would have had to be the pope himself.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a personal event, reflecting O'Connor himself. There
was his signature emphasis on what the church calls its defense of
life, with opposition to abortion and euthanasia at its core, but
fleshed out to include international peacemaking, the rights of
workers, the poor and the sick, and the condemnation of capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In O'Connor's style, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston was utterly
direct with this message _ no matter how uncomfortable he might be
making a group of political leaders, virtually none of whom could
qualify as ``unambiguously pro life'' by the standards spelled out
in the Boston prelate's homily.
</P>
<P>
   Very visible at the funeral and frequently mentioned was another
of O'Connor's typically personal initiatives, the founding of the
Sisters of Life, an order of nuns who devote themselves to the
cause largely through prayer but also service to women in need.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the cardinal's request that the Mass not be a tribute to
him, his profile and personality loomed so large as to put all else
in the shadows; the other nuns and priests, the lay workers and
active parishioners, the vast New York Catholic church of parishes
and neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago died in November 1996,
his funeral had gospel music and singing in Polish and Spanish
along with Gregorian chant. It had brief prayers offered by lay
people in many of the archdiocese's languages. The homily was
delivered not by a high official but a local priest, the cardinal's
longtime aide.
</P>
<P>
   It was a simple fact of geography, not of anyone's planning,
that Bernardin was buried with his predecessors in a cemetery 15
miles from his cathedral. The cortege drove through the
archdiocese's city streets, far from downtown and past churches and
schools and saloons and used car lots, too, and past clusters of
construction workers doffing their hard hats, elderly folks braving
the November drizzle and schoolchildren waving signs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, by contrast, was buried within his own cathedral,
smack in the middle of Manhattan. The journey was entirely within
the cathedral and surrounded by men in vestments. It was a moving
moment when the magnificent choir had completed its Latin chant of
``May the angels escort you into paradise,'' and then the
worshipers gave the cardinal a final volley of applause before the
coffin was carried down to the crypt.
</P>
<P>
   (START OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some who belong to the New York church of parish bazaars and
religious education classes and Altar and Rosary Societies were
pressing against the police barriers across Fifth Avenue, but most,
one supposed, had to watch on television.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet the funeral did not always seem to float above and beyond
this New York church in a realm of Vatican influence, national
politics and the New York's leader's very special concerns. The
service could come suddenly down to earth in the way that O'Connor
often did, the way so frequently mentioned during the last week,
with personal attention to a specific individual.
</P>
<P>
   When, at the very end of the service, Baum thanked several
people who had helped O'Connor to the end, he did not stop with
family and aides but went on to one of the most faithful but least
known of the workers, Maura O'Kelly, who oversaw the cardinal's
residence as she had for his two predecessors. O'Connor would have
been delighted with that, too.

IN THE LAND OF SOUND BITES, EMRICK IS A MOUTHFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For five years, Mike Emrick enriched Fox's coverage of the
National Hockey League. But for its NHL games this season, and the
next four, ABC chose to use ESPN's voices, and not to employ
Emrick.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Emrick out was expected because of the ABC-ESPN
corporate connection. But not having Emrick means that ABC's No. 1
hockey voice is not the absolute best.
</P>
<P>
   Emrick's skills remain on display during Devils games on Fox
Sports New York. His play-by-play is smooth, clear, linguistically
absorbing and as grammatically sharp as it is possible to be at
hockey's pace.
</P>
<P>
   In one 22-second sound bite late in Game 5 of the Devils-Toronto
playoff series Saturday night, Emrick showed his vocal dexterity.
With the Devils leading, 3-2, with 6 minutes 15 seconds left in the
game, Emrick said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a shot fought off by Niedermayer. Niedermayer hugs the
boards. It's Thomas. The pass behind is cut off by Stevens and
dumped along for Claude Lemieux. Shoots it along. Kaberle tried to
play it further. Niedermayer's stick knocked out of his hand, so
it's shillelaghed back out again by Stevens. Brought on by
Pandolfo. To Madden. Madden, cruising in, fires! Score!''
</P>
<P>
   Emrick calls radio on TV, and unintrusive camera work is the
best way to illustrate that. In a telecast with action as ferocious
as Saturday's was in its final minutes, the FSNY director Joe
O'Rourke rarely strayed from the game camera mounted high at center
ice.
</P>
<P>
   To bring viewers closer to the game, it has become fashionable
in live hockey for directors to jump to close-ups, low-angle corner
shots or the cameras from above the goals. Each option holds
potential rewards to jazz up the telecast but risks losing sight of
the puck, a developing three-on-two rush or linear perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, if I feel I'm winning the gambles, I do it, but if
I'm losing, I back off,'' O'Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the right conservative direction was needed, Emrick's
words found almost perfect accompaniment. Four quick cuts were made
from four minutes left in the third period until 2:50 remained.
From that point until 17 seconds were left _ a patch with
relentless action and no stoppages _ FSNY never shifted live from
the center-ice roost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game dictated that,'' O'Rourke said. ``When it's flying
like that, all you can do is make people mad by cutting away. I
couldn't see the sense in guessing where to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, however, FSNY's center-ice perch at Continental
Arena seemed like the worst way to watch the Devils-Toronto series.
ESPN, CBC, the Canadian network, and SRC, the French-language
broadcaster, got preferred space in the traditional center-ice
position on the arena's first tier, pushing FSNY up a level, which
brought vertigo to hockey viewing. By the next game in New Jersey,
two nights later, FSNY had reclaimed a lower position. &QL; 
Missed Shots, Cheap Shots
</P>
<P>
   The last few minutes of Game 1 of the Knicks-Miami National
Basketball Association playoff series on Sunday on NBC offered less
verbal clarity than FSNY provided during the Devils-Maple Leafs
game.
</P>
<P>
   You had to wonder what Bill Walton, an NBC analyst, meant in
labeling Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy a prophet for saying the
series would come down to ``one play, one shot, one tipped ball, a
long 3 or an offensive rebound.'' Not many options left, are there?
You, too, can be a seer if you foresee every possibility but an
84-foot shot.
</P>
<P>
   Walton and Steve Jones, the co-analyst, also provided a safe
haven for Allan Houston, who too often evades criticism for his
inadequate ballhandling.
</P>
<P>
   Jones praised Houston for ``playing with control'' after hitting
the second of two jumpers, which put the Knicks ahead, 81-79. But
neither announcer said a word _ not even a ``horrible'' from Walton
_ when Houston made two turnovers, one on an ill-advised pass to
Patrick Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Walton criticized Chris Childs for flinging 3-point
shots when he should have been setting up Houston, Larry Johnson or
Latrell Sprewell, he seemed not to care enough to comment when
Childs faked a 3-pointer, then traveled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the NBC announcers found it easier to criticize questionable
3-point shots missed by Miami's Tim Hardaway, who is hampered by an
ankle injury. After the first of the shots, an air ball, Tom
Hammond, the play-by-play announcer asked, ``What in the world was
that about?'' &QL;

BELLSOUTH SAID TO BE IN DEAL WITH GE SATELLITE DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bidding to offer digital television service throughout the
Southeast, the BellSouth Corp. intends to announce Tuesday that it
has signed a long-term contract to purchase satellite services from
the General Electric Co., an executive close to the deal said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth had been rumored to be in discussions with Loral Space
and Communications Ltd., one of GE's rivals in the satellite
industry.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday exactly why BellSouth, the Southeast's
dominant local telephone carrier, instead choose General Electric's
Americom division. Americom, however, claims to operate North
America's biggest satellite fleet, with at least a dozen
satellites. The executive close to the deal said that GE had
committed to launching a new satellite to be used primarily by
BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   While BellSouth and GE do not expect to announce financial terms
or the specific length of the contract Tuesday, BellSouth does
intend to announce plans to offer satellite television service to
the 14 million households it already serves by the first half of
2002, the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   A BellSouth spokesman and a GE spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, which recently agreed to fold its wireless telephone
unit into a joint venture with SBC Communications Inc., currently
sells television service to about 120,000 households in 11
Southeastern markets. That operation uses a combination of wired
and ground-based wireless systems, but the company apparently
believed that only satellite technology would allow BellSouth to
compete against cable television operators across the company's
region.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, SBC announced a wide-ranging marketing partnership
with DirecTV Inc., which is a subsidiary of the General Motors
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But while that deal merely allowed SBC to distribute DirecTV's
services, BellSouth seems to be taking a more hands-on approach. GE
does not currently market satellite television directly to United
States consumers. The new service will bear only the BellSouth
brand, said an executive close to the deal, adding that BellSouth
has not yet selected a contractor to manufacture the necessary
satellite dishes.

ISLE OF CAPRI CASINOS AGREES TO FINE 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven Mississippi casinos have agreed to fines totaling $1.05
million for multiple violations of anti-money-laundering reporting
requirements under federal banking laws.
</P>
<P>
   Isle of Capri Casinos Inc., which is seeking regulatory approval
to buy the Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City, was among the
gambling operations cited by the U.S. Treasury Department's
Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, also known as FinCEN.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri Gaming Commission officials said Monday that they would
review the federal government's case against Isle of Capri in
connection with the sale, which company officials have said they
hope to close by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   According to settlement documents, all the violations were for
the casinos' failure to properly report cash transactions in excess
of $10,000 during various periods between 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   A 1986 law added cash-intensive casinos to the Treasury
Department's widespread monitoring of financial institutions to
detect money laundering activities. Missouri casinos are less
vulnerable to laundering because of the state's $500 wagering loss
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Allan B. Solomon, Isle of Capri vice president and general
counsel, brushed off the fines as a minor infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a big deal,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of it was intentional. A lot of it is inadvertent
failures or not checking the right box (on forms) due to the
inexperience of employees when we first opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Isle's Biloxi casino opened in 1992 and was fined $227,500 for
44 violations during 1993. Isle's Vicksburg casino opened in 1993
and was fined $150,000 for 31 violations in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A Treasury spokeswoman said the lag time of several years from
offense to prosecution was not unusual in such cases, which
typically are uncovered during Internal Revenue Service audits.
</P>
<P>
   During the mid to late '90s, FinCEN collected more than $2
million in fines for similar reporting violations by a dozen
Atlantic City casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Other Mississippi casinos in Gulfport, Biloxi, Natchez and
Vicksburg also were fined.

KC LEADERS WORK TO COUNTER FALL IN SMALL-BUSINESS RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
 2TAKES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JOYCE SMITH KNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Stung by recent research that Kansas City has
slacked off in entrepreneurial support, area business groups are
battling back.
</P>
<P>
   Cognetics Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., company that tracks
activities of 10 million businesses, recently downgraded Kansas
City's ranking as a place to start and grow a small business. The
company said its criteria for ranking the top 50 metropolitan areas
_ Kansas City fell from 14th in 1999 to 23rd _ were subjective and
difficult to measure.
</P>
<P>
   That's not good enough for the Metropolitan Entrepreneurs
Council of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, the council has formed a task force to
examine Kansas City's entrepreneurial environment. It wants to know
what Kansas City can brag about in terms of small-business
development and define what barriers local entrepreneurs face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't going to say their rankings aren't any good, but in
many ways Kansas City would top the list,'' said Becky Blades,
chairwoman of the entrepreneurs council. ``We want to explore what
things make a city good for entrepreneurs, the resources that
entrepreneurs say helped them. The Kauffman Center alone represents
a resource that no other city can come close to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Kayne, director for community initiative at the Kauffman
Center for Entrepreneurial Leadership, said Cognetics looked at
things such as quality of life, but needed to broaden its
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to look at is: What would be the measures for
Kansas City, and how can we bring those measures up?'' Kayne said.
``We're never going to have skiing in Kansas City. And yes, I miss
sailing on Chesapeake Bay. But where else can I have a
3,000-square-foot house for under $200,000?''
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 68,000 businesses in Kansas City, 98 percent are
small businesses employing fewer than 250 people. They contribute
$124 billion annually to the Kansas City economy and employ nearly
640,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has more than 80 organizations to assist those small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of people just going out and hanging up a shingle, we
are educating entrepreneurs and improving their success rate,''
Blades said. ``The challenge is to coordinate those efforts and to
let the entrepreneurs know what organizations are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's successful entrepreneurs have given back to the
business community through programs such as the Helzberg
Entrepreneurial Mentoring Program and the Kauffman Center.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 people recently attended the Energizing
Entrepreneurs 2000 small-business expo at Bartle Hall, one of the
largest such expos in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber's annual small-business luncheon Friday is among the
nation's largest and will attract 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just been a lot of focus on trying to serve
entrepreneurs,'' said Bill Reisler, managing director of Kansas
City Equity Partners, a venture capital firm. ``As a result, we're
getting more business starts; we're getting more activity. Out of
that, you are getting more quality teams that deserve venture
investment. Out of that, you get more successful, nationally
noticed businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Before opening Plaza Personnel Ltd. in 1997, Sharon McInerney
took the Women's Entrepreneurial Training Program at Avila College
and researched her plan for nine months at the Small Business
Administration's One Stop Capital Shop.
</P>
<P>
   She found she needed more working capital, and obtained a loan
backed by the SBA.
</P>
<P>
   McInerney continues to receive business counseling through
Johnson County Community College's Small Business Development
Center and mentoring through the SBA's Office of Women Business
Ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the business you want to start really well and are
confident about how things are going to work,'' McInerney said.
``But you need that to make a good presentation and sell that to
the banker. Some people hastily come up with an idea and expect to
put it in place in a couple of months, and it doesn't happen that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Fish, president of 4-year-old FishNet Security, took the
Kauffman Center's FastTrac entrepreneurship training program. The
global network security solutions company had 1999 revenue of $5.3
million and expects to triple that this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The class really generates a lot of thinking,'' Fish said.
``It also introduces you to business strategies of other
entrepreneurs. I recommend the program to anyone that is wanting to
start their own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Area small businesses historically have faced a lack of capital.
But that, too, is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists reportedly invested a record $157 million in
area companies during the first three months of the year,
surpassing the record $143 million for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kansas City has a bit of its own inferiority
complex,'' Reisler said. ``I hear it from entrepreneurs all the
time: `You can't raise money here.' But $160 million, that's not
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Reisler said the real question was whether it's harder to get
venture capital in Kansas City than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, with the exception of the Silicon Valley, Denver,
Austin and the Boston area, Kansas City fares pretty well,''
Reisler said. ``The amount of money vs. the amount of entrepreneurs
is a pretty good balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayne would like to see lawyers, accountants and consultants
trading services for equity positions in start-ups, a popular
concept in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to build that culture here,'' Kayne said. ``Cash is
the most valuable asset new entrepreneurs have.''
</P>
<P>
   Area small-business experts also are concerned about the lack of
skilled labor, the availability of health insurance and the ability
to get companies up to speed in technology.
</P>
<P>
   With a low unemployment rate, area companies are having trouble
finding any workers, let alone skilled ones.

   Computer Virus Is Traced To Apartment in Philippines
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen law enforcement agents raided a Manila
apartment from which they said a malicious computer program was
unleashed last week, disrupting computer systems around the world.
They took one resident into custody and ordered his roommate, a
woman, to turn herself in.
</P>
<P>
   The agents, including two representing the FBI, apparently
expected to find the computer from which the attack was started. A
local official said that no computer was found, but that a box
containing 17 items including telephones, wires, computer disks and
computer magazines was seized. The officials would not say what had
led them to the apartment and did not characterize the moves as

HENRY LASKAU, RACE WALKER, 83
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry Laskau, who walked out of Hitler's Germany and became
America's best race walker for a decade after World War II, died
Sunday in Coconut Creek, Fla. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Hilde, told The Associated Press that Laskau had
suffered from Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Laskau, who later became known as Henry, was born Sept.
12, 1916, in Berlin. Although he was one of Germany's best
1,500-meter and 5,000-meter runners, he, like other German Jews,
was repeatedly passed by for international teams. In 1938, he was
sent to a German labor camp, the holding ground for Jews before
being sent to the death camps.
</P>
<P>
   After about three months, with the help of a sympathetic guard,
Laskau left the camp one night and made his way to France, where he
boarded a ship to Cuba. Nine months later, he was in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Laskau did counterintelligence work overseas for
the Army, serving as an interrogator of SS officers. He later
learned that most of his family had died in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1946, after his Army discharge, he decided to
resume his running career. One Sunday morning, he went to Macombs
Dam Park, next to Yankee Stadium, to work out. The only other
person there was Nat Jaeger, a race walker, who suggested that
Laskau switch from running to walking.
</P>
<P>
   He did, and a month later, at 5 feet 8 inches and 138 pounds, he
was competing in this difficult heel-and-toe discipline. The next
summer, he won a national championship, and for a decade he did not
lose to another American.
</P>
<P>
   From 1947 through 1957, competing for the Maccabi Athletic Club
and the 92nd Street YMHA, he won 42 national titles from a mile to
25 kilometers (15.5 miles). He won the Amateur Athletic Union's
national 10-kilometer title 11 consecutive years outdoors and the
mile title 10 consecutive years indoors. He won four Maccabiah
Games titles, the last in 1965 at age 49 when he came out of an
eight-year retirement for the race.
</P>
<P>
   He was so good that even track officials did not always believe
his performances. In a 1952 fund-raising meet at odd distances at
Randalls Island in New York, Wes Santee won the three-quarter-mile
run and Laskau the half-mile walk, each in 2 minutes 58.2 seconds.
Laskau's time broke a 75-year-old record, but recognition was
delayed because a member of the records committee argued that it
was ``physically impossible'' to walk that fast.
</P>
<P>
   He was named to the USA/Mobil team as the best indoor walker
ever. He was often nominated to the United States Track and Field
Hall of Fame, but was not elected to it until 1997, largely because
of a built-in prejudice against race walking as a stepchild of
running.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, he retired from his freight-forwarding business and
moved to the Miami area, where he sometimes supervised freight
operations for El Al Israel Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Even in retirement, he took long walks every day, and his
enthusiasm led to what is now the annual Henry Laskau Race Walk in
Coconut Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slowed down a little in the last few years,'' Roy Chernock,
a retired track coach and close friend, said in an interview before
Laskau's death, ``but he still walks faster than you and I could
ever do.''
</P>
<P>
   Laskau is survived by his wife; two sons, Michael of New York
and Howard of Raleigh, N.C.; and two grandchildren.  &QL;

KC LEADERS WORK TO COUNTER FALL IN SMALL-BUSINESS RANKING 
</HEADLINE>
 2ND TAKE-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY JOYCE SMITH KNIGHT-RIDDER NEWSPAPERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``Virtually everybody is employed that can be
employed,'' said Brad Douglas, acting regional administrator for
the SBA in Kansas City. ``Small businesses are looking at creative
ways to address the problem. If they want to keep people, they have
to pay more than minimum wage.''
</P>
<P>
   GeoAccess Inc., an Overland Park-based Internet and software
solutions provider for the managed health care industry, provides
free lunches and snacks to its 225 employees. Other companies let
employees bring their dogs to work or provide an area for employee
naps.
</P>
<P>
   More companies also will need information technology workers to
manage and constantly innovate systems, said Susan Catts, president
of Silicon Prairie Technology Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure we have a critical mass of people here to
support the companies that are choosing to be in this region,''
Catts said. ``Particularly small companies that get founded here,
you want to hold on to them. You don't want to put them in a
situation where they grow only so much, and then they have to leave
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Brass Ross Vending of Kansas City grew steadily for six years,
but revenue has been stagnant the past three. John Ross, owner of
the vending company, blames the minority ``glass ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an African-American male who has been in business for
nine years, and I've consistently seen the rules change when we are
on the edge of a lucrative contract,'' Ross said. ``When we get
close to big money, a lot of people don't want to see us advance.''
</P>
<P>
   A. Marie Young, executive director of the Black Chamber of
Commerce of Greater Kansas City, said several established
minority-owned businesses had closed in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only grow so far; that's what's happening to these 15-
to 20-year-old companies,'' Young said. ``There's such a tight,
closed circle, we're not able to get east of Troost, so to speak.
We spend so much of our time just trying to fight to get in the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks and other service providers often develop programs aimed
at the minority community but rarely ask minorities what they need,
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were sick and you were the doctor, could you help me
without asking me what my problems are? That does not happen,''
Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Paul Chaurand, executive director of the Hispanic Economic
Development Corp., said service providers needed to understand the
cultural differences involved when working with Hispanics. Recent
immigrants are often distrustful of banks and prefer to borrow from
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they need to build credit with a lender,'' Chaurand said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Luciani of the Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce said
the chamber worked with many area minority organizations to ensure
that its programs are meeting their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a great effort so we don't exclude people,'' said
Luciani, senior vice president for economic growth and development
at the chamber. ``We are geographically sensitive, racially
sensitive and ethnically sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber's new Minority Business Alliance Partnership will
link mentors with small-business owners to help the operations
continue to grow through subcontractors, prime contracts and better
access to capital. Other programs are open to all entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But while resources are important, Young said, minorities still
need the opportunity to use what they've learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I was a college student with numerous degrees and I
can't get a job, I'm not working, I'm not able to do the things
I've been trained to do,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City can point to a diverse group of businesses that have
experienced rapid growth _ Three Dog Bakery, LaserCycle, Peripheral
Vision InfoSystems, Birch Telecom and GeoAccess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're attracting attention, and that's a good thing for
entrepreneurs,'' Reisler said. ``So by most of the tests that we
can see, the environment continues to improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Cognetics said Kansas City lost points in its annual rankings
because of its industrial flavor _ an image that may fade as the
city gears up for a knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique point in time for the Kansas City region,''
Kayne said. ``We're going to be a powerful biotech community in the
next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stowers Institute can help raise Kansas City's reputation as
a research center, and a task force of area businesspeople is
looking at ways to expand research and support commercial
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Cognetics also based its results on employee and sales growth.
But Blades said researchers needed to consider micro and home-based
businesses of five employees or fewer. Some of those ``lifestyle
companies'' may not want to grow any larger and Kansas City has the
support systems, such as the Home Business Connection, to help them
succeed at that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City is a place where people come together and give of
themselves to help each other. People gave to me and helped me when
there was nothing I could give back to them,'' Blades said of her
public relations and marketing company, Blades &AMP; Associates. ``Now
I'm trying to give back.''

(PHOENIX) - Senior citizens in Phoenix are surfing the Net more
than their peers anywhere else in the country, according to America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-area seniors - those 55 and older - stay online an
average of 22 hours a week, compared with an average of 18 hours
for seniors in other high-use cities. The national average for all
ages is 7 hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix's seniors may be more computer savvy because of many
local computer classes and the computer centers at many retirement
communities. Education and income also are higher for seniors here,
Vincent C. Huffman of Scottsdale Community College said.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors are the fastest-growing group of Internet users, making
up 13 percent of the online population, AOL's Kathie Lentz said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 3,200 seniors surveyed nationwide said they go
online to e-mail children, grandchildren and friends. Others use it
to do research, check financial investments, find medical news or
search travel options.
</P>
<P>
   Like Phoenix's Bettie Brenner, 74, many seniors are finding that
computers keep them active and involved.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner is a birder and follows the migration patterns on the
Internet.
