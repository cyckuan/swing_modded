PATRIOTS GET GOING WITH A MOVING VICTORY

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ This old house still had all the comforts of
home Monday night. Playing their first game at Foxboro Stadium
since owner Robert Kraft announced he was moving the team to
Hartford in 2001, the Patriots survived for at least one more night
by pulling out a last-minute 26-23 win over the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking off the effects of a sore right hand, Drew Bledsoe
marched the Patriots 80 yards, hitting Shawn Jefferson with a
25-yard touchdown pass with 34 seconds left to send the old fans
into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who completed 28 of 54 passes for 423 yards, with two
interceptions and two touchdowns, converted two third-down plays
and two fourth-down plays along the way.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the drive, his right hand was hit by Shane
Burton as he released the ball. Bledsoe had to take warmup tosses
on the sideline and at one point Scott Zolak was helmeted and ready
to enter.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson caught six passes for a career-high 131 yards. In
addition to the TD, he had a 14-yard reception on fourth and 10 to
the Miami 40 and an 11-yarder on fourth and 6 to the 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins got the ball back with 29 seconds left and
completed a 46-yard Hail Mary pass. With 5 seconds left and the
ball at midfield, Dan Marino completed another pass, but time
expired before Miami could call a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   The win left the Patriots at 6-5, within a game of the Dolphins,
Jets, and Bills in the AFC East. Some of the sellout crowd may have
been upset with Kraft, but overall the fans seemed well-behaved,
only once booing the Patriots when they couldn't move the ball.
</P>
<P>
   As they promised, the Patriots did open up their offense, using
several fakes and play-action passes. In the first half, Bledsoe
threw the ball downfield to Jefferson for two 30-yard-plus plays
and even ran a keeper up the middle for 11 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not good enough to gain a lead in the first 30
minutes, as the Patriots trailed at halftime, 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots seemed buoyed by the return of Terry Glenn, which
seemed to spread out the defense and create more downfield
opportunities for Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Miami coach Jimmy Johnson must have sensed the potential
volatility of the crowd, knowing that he could tap into it by
scoring first. So, in the first quarter, on fourth and 10 at the
Patriots' 35, Johnson elected not to attempt a long field goal in a
swirling wind. And he elected not to punt. What he elected to do
was to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Marino showed he can still drill it when he needs
to, hitting Oronde Gadsden on the fly at the 17. A diving attempt
to break up the pass by Ty Law failed, and Gadsden ran in for a
touchdown with 8:17 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   There was silence.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins started the drive at their 28 and took a much
different approach than what the Patriots expected: They came out
throwing. Marino found tight end Troy Drayton for a 26-yard gain
that got the Dolphins into Patriot territory at the 47. After an
8-yard toss to Stanley Pritchard got it to the 35, the Patriots'
defense got stingy, creating the fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   The Gadsden score marked the first time this season _ and second
time in his career _ that Law has been beaten for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were not deterred. On the first play of a drive
that began at the 31, Bledsoe threw deep to Jefferson, who got
behind coverage for a 38-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried to run but again found it a futile exercise
as Robert Edwards found no room. So Bledsoe went with something
more familiar: passes to Ben Coates. The big tight end caught a
14-yard pass that got the ball to the 8. Two plays later, Coates
got away with murder when he knocked down strong safety Calvin
Jackson before Bledsoe delivered the ball for a free catch in the
end zone and the tying score.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were stopping the run in the first half, and Steve
Israel picked off a Marino pass _ Marino's 12th interception in his
last seven games against the Patriots. But the New England offense
couldn't capitalize. The Patriots pulled a Miami and went for it on
fourth and 3 from the Dolphins' 38. Bledsoe found Jefferson over
the middle, but the veteran receiver dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   While Marino's interception wasn't costly to his team, Bledsoe's
was.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe was trying to lead rookie receiver Tony Simmons down the
left sideline but underthrew the ball and it was intercepted by Sam
Madison, who returned it to the Patriots' 37.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-yard face-mask penalty on Ted Johnson put the Dolphins in
business at the 14, and two plays later Gadsden got behind Chris
Canty on a slant and caught an 11-yard pea from Marino to give the
Dolphins a 14-7 lead with seven minutes remaining in the half.
</P>
<P>
   But the Patriots weren't done.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Bledsoe went deep to Jefferson for 33 yards to the
Miami 47. Terry Glenn, who had missed four games with a hamstring
pull, caught an 8-yard pass to the 36 on third and 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the drive stalled when Coates, who was held the entire way
to the end zone by Zach Thomas, couldn't come up with Bledsoe's
toss. The quarterback and the tight end argued the call, but the
Patriots had to settle for a 26-yard field goal by Adam Vinatieri
with 1:08 remaining that made it a 14-10 game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots played a little backward ball before pulling within
1 point, 14-13, in the third quarter. They got as far as the 17
when Calvin Jackson was called for a face-mask penalty on Glenn
following an 8-yard reception. But the Patriots lost ground from
there, as Bledsoe was sacked for a 10-yard loss after Lovett
Purnell was called for holding.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was livid at Purnell, and chewed out the backup tight
end out as he came off the field. The Patriots settled for a
44-yard Vinatieri field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins drove 71 yards to answer, taking a 17-13 lead on a
21-yard Olindo Mare field goal with 4:40 remaining in the third
quarter. Costly penalties _ a face mask on Chris Slade and an
interference call on Lawyer Milloy _ helped the Dolphins march down
field.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots made it 17-16 on Vinatieri's 45-yard boot with 31
seconds remaining in the third quarter, as the Patriots abandoned
the run and went to a no-huddle. Three passes _ two to Coates and
one to Glenn _ got the Patriots into field goal range.

UNION'S PROBLEMS DON'T TAINT THE MAYOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With NY-UNION-FRAUD)  (nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was that campaign television commercial in 1997
that depicted a prominent member of District Council 37 embracing
the candidate, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. There was the endorsement of
Giuliani's re-election that same year by the council's top
official. Above all, there was the council's ratification of a city
contract with a two-year pay freeze in 1996 that turned out to be a
mayoral coup.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now, Giuliani has enjoyed the perception that
he had forged close ties to the leadership of District Council 37,
the city's largest municipal union with 120,000 members. That
impression served him on several levels, including its
counterintuitive nature: a Republican Mayor being lauded as a
friend of labor by the officials of a traditionally Democratic
union.
</P>
<P>
   But now District Council 37 is reeling from criminal and
internal investigations into widespread corruption. The latest blow
came Monday, when two top officials resigned amid allegations that
ballot fraud had tainted the contract vote in 1996. A natural
question then arises: What does all this union turbulence mean for
Giuliani?
</P>
<P>
   At first blush it might appear that the corruption allegations
could taint a public official who earned his reputation as a
corruption-fighting federal prosecutor. In truth, it probably will
have no impact at all, say his aides and labor analysts, with the
outside chance that it might resurface if he seeks higher office.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year contract stands and probably will not be reopened,
they say. When does it expire, at the end of 2000, this
term-limited mayor will either already be gone _ depending on his
political aspirations _ or approaching his last months in office.
Finally, as Deputy Mayor Randy Levine says, it is not the mayor's
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything having to do with vote tampering and election fraud
is outrageous, despicable and has to be condemned,'' Levine said.
``But this has nothing to do with Rudy Giuliani. This is an
internal union matter. It is unfortunate that this union doesn't
seem to have adequate controls, but the mayor's role is
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, after a contentious battle, the union approved
a five-year contract with the city with no raises the first two
years and a combined 13 percent pay increase for the final three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The contract allowed the mayor to hold down spending at a time
of fiscal crisis and to keep the peace with the union that
represents more than half the city's workers. It also permitted him
to continue reducing the size of city government, because no job
security had been promised to union members working as aides in
municipal hospitals. And it established a pattern in municipal
contracts that was soon followed by other unions.
</P>
<P>
   The contract had its critics. Many within the union leveled
accusations of ballot fraud. Good-government groups complained that
the back-loaded structure of the contract, with a 6 percent pay
increase in the last year, would cause fiscal havoc in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Levine said Giuliani is fair but tough; so tough, in fact, that
so far no municipal union has sought to negotiate new contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little early,'' Levine said. ``But what they tell me is
that it may be easier negotiating with the next mayor, whoever that
may be.''

RENO NONCOMMITTAL ON GIVING GORE CASE TO SPECIAL PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite and clarify 1st, 2nd, 6th and 17th grafs. No other
changes.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Several of Attorney General Janet Reno's close
aides advised her Monday that federal law required her to seek an
independent counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's
political fund-raising efforts, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the other advisers who met with her privately at the
Justice Department disputed that interpretation of the law. Reno,
who must decide the issue by Tuesday, is still considered likely to
reject such an appointment, the officials said, a move that would
spare Gore further scrutiny at a critical phase of his effort to
solidify his presidential credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has remained taciturn. At the conclusion of Monday's
meeting, she informed her aides that she was unprepared to declare
whether she had decided to refer the allegations about Gore's case
to an outside prosecutor, the officials said. The debate, said one
official, was ``spirited.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Gore's case is whether the independent counsel law
permits Reno to close an inquiry when there are relevant facts in
dispute _ in this case conflicting witness accounts of senior
campaign officials who, along with Gore, attended a Nov. 21, 1995,
White House fund-raising meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Some participants of the meeting recalled discussing how the
funds raised by Gore would be divided for direct and indirect
campaign efforts; others said that was not discussed, and a few
could not recall the meeting's specifics, law enforcement officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the conflicting accounts, the split among her top
aides reflects a longstanding legal debate within the Justice
Department about how to interpret a key provision of the
independent counsel statute. One side says the law clearly dictates
seeking an independent counsel when contradictory evidence cannot
be resolved. The other side argues that Reno is not obligated to
seek an independent counsel because the case, partly based on
whether the money Gore raised was used legally, is so technical
that a prosecutor would be unlikely to obtain an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision in the Gore case is the first of three
independent counsel decisions that she must make in the next two
weeks. Under the independent counsel statute, Reno has 90 days to
decide whether to go forward with an inquiry. The three-month
period for Gore ends Tuesday. After Gore, she must decide next week
whether to seek an appointment in the case of Harold Ickes, the
former White House deputy chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Reno must decide whether to seek an outside counsel
to investigate whether President Clinton and his aides broke the
law when they set up a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign
financed by the Democratic National Committee. Federal rules limit
such ad campaigns to generic party ads, but Federal Election
Commission auditors have said the ads directly supported the
Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has referred allegations against six Clinton
administration officials to independent prosecutors, has never
allowed an outside counsel to review any issue directly related to
how the Democrats financed the 1996 campaign, although she has
considered the issue on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   In part, officials said they believed that Reno's unwillingness
to open the Democrats to the potentially sweeping scrutiny of an
independent prosecutor stems from a view within the Justice
Department that the loosely written campaign finance laws offer
little traction for prosecutors attempting to seek evidence of
criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly attacked
Reno, accusing her of blatantly using her office as a political
shield for the White House, protecting not only Clinton, but the
Democratic Party. She opened the inquiries into Gore, Ickes and
Clinton only after Charles La Bella wrote her a memo recommending
an independent counsel. La Bella's memo came after FBI Director
Louis Freeh had reached a similar conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Justice Department, officials said Reno's narrow view
of the law _in the campaign finance context _ is based on a
different perception that some independent counsels have misused
the offices.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has been said by some aides to have expressed concern about
the conduct of more than one independent counsel. She has
disapproved of some tactics, like when prosecutors unfairly expose
low-level witnesses to the expense and embarrassment of criminal
inquiries that seemed to continue and expand long after
departmental prosecutors would have dropped them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reno has been careful to avoid voicing her complaints
in public, some of her aides have criticized the conduct of Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, and Donald Smaltz, the prosecutor
who has investigated Mike Espy, the former agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, Reno opened a 90-day independent counsel inquiry
in September after a memorandum surfaced with an aide's handwritten
notes that seemed to shed new light on Gore's role. The aide's
notes suggested that Gore could have known much more about the
regulatory limits on his political fund-raising than the vice
president had acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has said that he did not realize that some of the large
contributions he solicited in phone calls from his White House
office would be divided into different Democratic Party accounts.
But the memo, in which Gore was to said to have remarked ``count me
in'' on making fund-raising phone calls, suggested that he could
have known that the money he raised would be split between hard and
soft money accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions known as soft money can be used only for limited
purposes to finance general party activities like registration
drives. They are unregulated. Hard money is regulated and subject
to limits, and was spent directly on Clinton-Gore re-election
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly technical question of whether Gore knew the
distinction between hard money and soft money is significant
because Reno has said that any solicitations for the Clinton
re-election effort _ that is, solicitation of hard money _ by the
president or the vice president, could have been illegal. She
reasoned that under election laws, Clinton and Gore were
prohibited, as federal officials, from soliciting funds on
government property.

BELLSOUTH BUYBACK, OTHER MOVES BOOST STRATEGIC VALUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street has been waiting months for BellSouth Corp. to do
something dramatic in response to the consolidation that is
happening among phone companies all around it. So far, BellSouth
has not obliged.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday BellSouth showed that it was determined to lay up
supplies, in the form of value in its stock, in preparation for the
next round of financial battles. The company said it would split
its stock, raise its dividend and buy back up to $3 billion worth
of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements added momentum to a stock-promotion campaign
that BellSouth's executives have appeared to be waging since early
this fall. BellSouth recently encouraged some analysts to raise
their predictions for the company's financial performance and
touted the stock's performance with reporters. Monday, the shares
rose $2.125, to $83.50, on the Big Board.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, BellSouth has had reason to boast. From the
beginning of 1997 through the end of last week, BellSouth's stock
had gained 98.5 percent. That beat the gains of each of the other
five big regional phone companies _ Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, GTE,
SBC Communications and U S West _ by at least 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth says it has not changed the way it discusses its
stock. But naturally, the perception of a stock-promotion campaign
has raised the question of whether BellSouth is seeking a more
valuable currency in its stock with the idea of pursuing a large
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one were focused on some of the transforming events, the
mergers, those are generally based on stock and the better your
stock is doing, the better positioned you are for those deals,''
said Ronald M. Dykes, BellSouth's chief financial officer, adding
that the primary reason for Monday's moves was to return cash to
shareholders. ``No matter how the industry shapes up, it helps to
have a strong currency.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth said its stock would split next month and that the
dividend-increase and stock buyback would start next year.

NO RATIONALE EXPLANATION FOR THIS TRADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does the stock market know something the rest of us do not about
the terms of America Online's proposed purchase of Netscape
Communications?
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the kind of unusual trading in Netscape's stock
that took place Monday would have been seen as an indication that
another buyer was going to emerge to bid up Netscape's price. But
with all the irrationally exuberant trading in Internet companies,
it was difficult to read such reasoning _ or any rationale at all _
into the stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   After reports of the proposed deal appeared in Monday morning's
newspapers, Netscape released a statement confirming negotiations
but indicating that a final agreement had not been reached. It said
that the proposed transaction would involve an exchange of 0.45
share of America Online for each share of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for much of Monday Netscape traded at a value equal to 0.47
times the value of America Online's shares, sometimes more. That
was exactly the opposite of the normal trading pattern, in which
the stock of takeover targets trades at a discount to the stated
purchase price, typically an acknowledgment that the deal might be
called off.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely explanation for Monday's pricing, several
analysts said, was not that some investors knew too much but that
many knew too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that retail investors have gotten enthusiastic and
haven't quite figured out what is going on here and done the
math,'' said Daniel Rimer, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   As with much of the trading in Internet stocks, a great deal of
activity consisted of small trades by individuals rather than the
larger blocks by institutional investors that dominate trading in
most other industries. The average trade in Netscape's stock
yesterday was 615 shares, far smaller than for a typical industrial
company.
</P>
<P>
   Even smaller was the trade size in the typical Internet darling
stocks, and that may explain why their share prices surged on news
of a deal that would do nothing but make competition tougher.
</P>
<P>
   The stock of Yahoo, the leading Internet portal, whose business
is the main target of the America Online-Netscape deal, jumped
$30.4375, to $221.4375, propelled by trades averaging just 458
shares each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo's stock did not react rationally today,'' said Derek
Brown, an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan. ``The potential move of
AOL more aggressively into the Web business heightens the level of
competition long-term for Yahoo and others.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Internet stocks that jumped were Amazon.com,
which rose $37.375, to $218, and Lycos, another portal service, up
$4.3125, to $65.0625.
</P>
<P>
   In that environment, shares in America Online reacted relatively
modestly, increasing $4.75, to $89.625; Netscape gained $2.75, to
$41.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in many ways it has been the 376 percent run-up in
the price of America Online's stock in the last year or so that
made a Netscape deal possible. America Online is now worth $41
billion, a multiple of 368 times earnings. With its shares valued
at such an unheard of price-earnings ratio, America Online can
afford to make acquisitions by trading its stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all funny money when you think about it,'' said Shaun
Andrikopoulos, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown. He figured that the
deal would probably add to America Online's earnings in a year,
though key details were still unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest uncertainty is what happens to Netscape's business
of selling World Wide Web servers and other industrial-strength
software to corporate users. Despite the rapid growth of its
Netcenter Web portal site, this software business will still
account for three-quarters of Netscape's revenue in 1999, Brown of
Volpe Brown estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the surging value of the other Internet
leaders made more big acquisitions all the more likely. Yahoo, for
example, now has a market value of some $21 billion, slightly more
than the value of CBS.
</P>
<P>
   And while CBS shareholders would no doubt be wary of exchanging
shares in the TV network for the supremely volatile Yahoo shares,
Yahoo is nonetheless in a position to buy all manner of Internet
and related companies.

COYOTES ARE A HOWLING SUCCESS

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As recently as the end of last season, when the
Phoenix Coyotes were eliminated from the playoffs in the first
round by the Detroit Red Wings, they were viewed as a talented team
with poor chemistry that probably would never develop into one of
the top contenders in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   But more than six weeks into the Coyotes' third season since
departing Winnipeg for the desert, Phoenix has risen to the top of
the NHL.

   With an 11-2-2 record, the Coyotes _ who visit the Kings on
Saturday night _ have been the NHL's biggest and best surprise.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Coyotes long been known for such big-name
offensive players as Keith Tkachuk and Jeremy Roenick, the most
important factor in their success has been their defense.
</P>
<P>
   In their last 11 games, the Coyotes are 9-0-2, and they have not
allowed more than two goals in any of their last 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning because we've got all the guys on the same
page,'' Tkachuk said. ``The problem we had last year was guys were
taking too many nights off. This year, everybody's playing solid
every night. But one or two guys can't carry this team. The NHL is
too good. Obviously, our goaltending (Nikolai Khabibulin and Jimmy
Waite) has definitely helped. The goaltending has been absolutely
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Tkachuk, the Coyotes' strong start appears to have helped
him get beyond the bad feelings Phoenix fans had for him after his
preseason holdout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I have to prove is to win,'' Tkachuk said.
``That's the bottom line. You're measured on winning _ team
success, not individual stats. I've scored 50 before. That's fine.
I don't have to prove I can score 50. I've got to prove I can lead
this team and do the right things so we're there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey city: Teams change their uniforms for a variety of
reasons, not the least of which is to entice fans to reach into
their wallets to restock their clothing supplies.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Kings, who changed their uniforms this
season, the strategy appears to be working.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lloyd Haymes of the NHL, the Kings ranked 20th of
27 NHL teams in jersey sales in 1997. This year, the Kings have
moved up to 14th, and their new jerseys weren't introduced until
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kings director of merchandise Mark Moehlenkamp,
through this season's first eight home games, sales of Kings
merchandise were up 169 percent over the first eight home games of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Moehlenkamp said that aside from a desire to increase
merchandise revenue, the Kings changed their uniforms for several
reasons: to have a new look when they move into the Staples Center
next year, to have a more traditional look by reintroducing the
crown in their logo that was on their original uniforms when the
team entered the NHL in 1967, and to try to rid themselves of the
unwanted identification with street gangs that their old
silver-and-black uniforms had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really more a case of hopefully they won't,'' Moehlenkamp
said when asked if the Kings felt confident their new look would
not be adopted by gangs. ``But there are no assurances, quite
frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Roamin' Vopat: One month ago, the Kings traded center Roman
Vopat to Colorado for Eric Lacroix. Since then, Colorado has traded
Vopat to Chicago, which then traded the 22-year-old Czech to
Philadelphia. Vopat originally came to the Kings in the 1996 deal
that briefly sent Wayne Gretzky to the St. Louis Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Of his recent and involuntary nomadic ways, Vopat said: ``It was
unbelievable. I can't say how I felt. I was 19 (when acquired by
the Kings) and I thought I was going to stay in L.A. But I got
traded after two years. Soon as you get traded, you get traded
again? Three times in three weeks? That hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first game for the Flyers, Vopat had one shift and used
the opportunity to check Pittsburgh defenseman Victor Ignatjev (a
former Long Beach Ice Dog) into the boards. Ignatjev suffered a
shoulder injury on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Vopat's travels may be over. Flyers general manager Bob Clarke
has never made a secret of his admiration for players capable of a
little of the old ultraviolence, and he thinks Vopat is just such a
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good fighter,'' Clarke said. ``Not really his forte,
but he can take care of himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Tragic predicament: Dallas' Mike Modano recently attributed his
slow start to the distraction of having to manage the money from
the six-year, $43.5-million contract he signed last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of wore on me and I was tired a lot,'' Modano said.
``You try as much as you can not to bring that to the rink. But
it's tough when it weighs on you the 22 hours you're not at the
rink. Then, the other two, you try to focus on hockey.`
</P>
<P>
   Modano said he spent the Stars' five-day break between games in
October working on his investments. When the break ended, he went
nine games without a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I didn't want it to creep into my game, it did,''
he said. ``I hate to use it as an excuse; I felt I could handle it
and concentrate on hockey. But it kind of caught up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Get out your crying towels. &QL;

USC'S WIN OVER UNLV WAS SIGNIFICANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not a nonconference schedule, it's a
nonschedule.
</P>
<P>
   That might be a cynical way of looking at USC's first nine games
of the season, but it also demonstrates why last Friday's 71-68
victory over Nevada-Las Vegas could be extremely important to the
Trojans' postseason plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans should go no worse than 8-1 in the preseason
following their upset of the Rebels. USC plays Long Beach State,
St. Bonaventure, UC Santa Barbara and Loyola Marymount before its
Dec. 12 game against No.8 Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Trojans lose at Kansas, they should finish up with
victories over American University and Arkansas State before
starting Pacific-10 Conference play.
</P>
<P>
   That means anyone evaluating USC, like perhaps the NCAA
Tournament selection committee, will look closely at the UNLV
result.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby said he wasn't concerned about the way the
Trojans' victory over UNLV will be interpreted in power rankings or
national polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are playing one game at a time,'' Bibby said. ``My
assistants are more concerned about that than me. My concern is to
make sure we're growing as a basketball team. Not power ratings.
Not where we are in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A big and small impact: Two games into the season, no one is
making a bigger impact than sophomore Brian Scalabrine and freshman
Brandon Granville, two players who were not on the team a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Scalabrine leads USC in scoring (14.5 points) and
rebounding (9.0) and is shooting 67 percent from field.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Scalabrine) makes the difference. In the ratings we have,
he's been in the top two or three in all the practices,'' Bibby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Granville, who is just 5-9, has been the surprise of the team so
far, calmly directing the offense in the first two games even
though he was not expected to start this soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandon Granville has a lot of heart,'' Bibby said. ``He's a
smart guard. He's not a super quick guard. He's not a great
ballhandler or defensive player, but he plays with the air of a
winning player. It says a lot about the way he played against UNLV
and those hostile fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Granville had 15 points, seven assists and six rebounds against
the Rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Coming back slowly: Point guard Kevin Augustine, who started 10
games last season, is still trying to work his way back into the
playing rotation. Augustine went just five minutes against UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the third guard behind Brandon and Quincy (Wilder),''
Bibby said. ``He'll get his chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's OK: Bibby said Jarvis Turner has not been bothered
recently by the back spasms that he has experienced since the start
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was OK (Sunday). I don't think it's a factor,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Doubting Thomas? Bibby said he doesn't know if freshman
quarterback Jason Thomas will play basketball this season. Thomas
has recovered from ankle surgery and is practicing with the
football team. Since USC is going to a bowl game, Thomas probably
could not join the basketball team before January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' Bibby said. ``We haven't talked since the
football season started. It's up to Jason.''

CIGARETTE MAKERS ANNOUNCE LARGE PRICE RISE
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Smokers will soon feel the effect of the new $206
billion tobacco settlement deal, as leading cigarette makers said
on Monday that they would raise wholesale prices by the largest
amount in history.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Philip Morris Cos. Inc., the producer of Marlboro brand
cigarettes, and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a unit of RJR Nabisco
Holdings Corp., the producer of Winston brand cigarettes, said they
would raise cigarette prices 45 cents a package.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted that producers might raise wholesale
prices sharply on Monday as the industry signed a huge legal
settlement with 46 states over litigation brought against tobacco
companies to recover health care costs related to smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But the price increases were somewhat higher than expected, and
the two other major companies that participated in the tobacco
accord, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco _ owned by BAT Industries PLC _
and Lorillard Tobacco _ owned by Loews Corp. _ are expected to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The price increase, if passed along fully to consumers, would
raise the average cost of a package of cigarettes to $2.45.
</P>
<P>
   But in the cigarette industry, the full effect of such price
increases is not always felt by the consumer because competitive
discounting by manufacturers takes place on the wholesale level.
</P>
<P>
   Following settlements over the past year with four states _
Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas _ under which the tobacco
industry agreed to pay a total of $40 billion over 25 years,
producers announced wholesale price increases of 20 cents a pack to
reflect the cost of those settlements. But for competitive reasons,
some makers did not pass those price increases through on all their
brands, in order to gain marketplace advantages over their rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have put the cost of the settlement plan with the 46
states at about 35 to 40 cents a pack. Under the accord, the $206
billion would be paid over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials made no secret in settlement talks that the
cost of the accord would be borne by smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of such a price increase was the thrust of a
furious attack by the tobacco industry on a $516 billion tobacco
bill defeated in the Senate this year. That bill would have raised
the price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10, and the industry began
a $50 million advertising campaign depicting it as a tax-and-spend
bill that would only take money out of the pockets of smokers.
</P>
<P>
   That campaign was credited in part for the bill's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had believed that the companies would introduce
price increase reflecting the cost of the latest settlement plan
slowly. But last Friday, after 46 state officials signed on to the
agreement, Gary Black, a tobacco industry analyst with Sanford C.
Bernstein, an investment company, said he believed that producers
would announce massive price increases on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement plan, manufacturers agreed to make a number
of marketing changes, including removing all tobacco billboards and
no longer giving away or selling merchandise like caps emblazoned
with the brand names of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the agreements on marketing changes, federal
regulators said yesterday they planned to drop their case against
R.J. Reynolds, which they had accused of harming children with its
Joe Camel advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Federal Trade Commission said they would file a
motion to dismiss the case because the tobacco deal would achieve
the objectives of banning cartoon characters in tobacco advertising
and financing anti-tobacco campaigns directed toward youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that continuing this litigation in light of the
state settlement would serve no public purpose and would be merely
a waste of resources,'' a trade commission lawyer, Joel Winston,
told an administrative law judge at a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement brings to an end state lawsuits filed to recover
Medicaid funds spent treating smoking related diseases. Along with
the 46 states it covers, the newest accord applies to five U.S.
territories.

FILLING UP ON FRIENDSHIP FOR FOUR DECADES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Dennis McCarthy is a columnist with the Los Angeles Daily News.) 
BY DENNIS McCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a cozy Thanksgiving dinner the Comstocks and the Kirbys
sat down to that first time in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight kids, four adults and one 12-pound turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, they're up to 54 people, two 20-pound turkeys
and a ham.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it rains, the kids are going to have to eat in the
garage,'' Irma is telling Kay on Monday, as the two matriarchs map
out the logistics of their families sharing their 40th consecutive
Thanksgiving dinner together.
</P>
<P>
   It began as one young family reaching out to another that found
itself alone on Thanksgiving after moving from Canada to the Los
Angeles suburb of Reseda in 1958. Since then, it has evolved into a
holiday saga of friendship and love -- not to mention a heck of a
lot of tables and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children grew up, babies followed marriages and death came
by,'' Irma Comstock Ajhar says, putting her arm around Kay Kirby.
``We've cried and we've laughed together.''
</P>
<P>
   All because a week before Thanksgiving in 1958, one woman looks
across the room at a church social and recognizes the face of
another woman she had seen at her children's school open house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out we were both new to the (San Fernando) Valley,
so we decided to have Thanksgiving together because the Kirbys
didn't know anyone and had no plans to celebrate it,'' Irma says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, Thanksgiving was in October and not a big deal,''
Kay adds. ``But here, we really got into the warm, family feeling
of it. I told Irma that the next year, we'd have it at my house.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the Comstocks and Kirbys have been doing ever
since -- trading off Thanksgivings at each other's homes, with the
host family cooking the turkey and hot dishes, and the guest family
bringing all the deserts and chips.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the tables get a little longer, the turkeys a little
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The Comstocks -- Irma and Richard -- had nine children together
before Richard died of a heart attack in 1987. Irma later
remarried, and she and her new husband have carried on the
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The Kirbys -- Kay and Peter -- have six children of their own.
</P>
<P>
   These kids, in turn, now have their own children and everyone
looks forward to this day when the two clans come from all over the
country and state to reunite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids were always great friends growing up and this gives
them a chance to catch up on each other's lives at least once a
year,'' Kay says. ``Plus, we all get to see and play with the new
babies in the families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful. I don't know what Thanksgiving would be
without this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, hosting 54 people for dinner in a 2,400-square-foot house
might sound like a logistical nightmare to some, but the way Irma
and Kay see it, the more the better.
</P>
<P>
   Both women scoff at the idea of catering the dinner, or worse,
going out somewhere. It wouldn't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never crowded when it's family,'' Kay says. ``Besides,
everybody is always too busy laughing to notice there's no place to
sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   There will come a time this Thanksgiving when the matriarchs
will sit their grandchildren down and tell them the story of how
this friendship began 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tell them how it is that two families have come together to
become one every Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's important for the children to know how lucky
they are to have family and friends like this,'' Kay says. ``When
you get good friends, you keep good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Irma smiles and looks out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``You sure it's not going to rain Thursday?'' she asks her
friend, before they both burst out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly be a first, the kids having to eat
Thanksgiving dinner out in the garage.

UCLA MAKES PROGRESS IN BCS RANKINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The No. &UR;  &LR; 2 Bruins increased their lead over Kansas
State and closed the gap on Tennessee in the latest Bowl
Championship Series rankings, and they can thank two computers for
it.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA moved from second to first in the Seattle Times rankings
and from fifth to fourth in the New York Times power poll.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Bruins' computer average _ one of four
components in the BCS poll _ dropped from 2.33 to 1.75, and their
lead over Kansas State expanded by a half-point in the overall BCS
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   The teams with the lowest BCS point total on Dec. 6 will play
for the national title in the Fiesta Bowl. What seemed a remote
possibility a month ago now seems all too real: an undefeated team
may be left out of the national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'm in favor of a playoff system,'' Bruins coach
Bob Toledo said. ``If all three are undefeated... two (teams) are
going to be happy and one is going to be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   And that team could be the Bruins, despite their 1.24-point lead
on Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Victory margin and schedule strength are crucial
ingredients to the BCS poll. If Kansas State impressively defeats
Texas A&AMP;M, which has the 13th-ranked schedule, while UCLA modestly
beats Miami, which has the 73rd-ranked schedule, the Wildcats could
make up the difference.
</P>
<P>
   To secure a berth in the Fiesta Bowl, the Bruins need to gain
one spot in either of the top-25 polls. (They are currently No.3 in
both.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get to No.2 in one of the polls, that's a half-point
difference in the BCS,'' said BCS co-creator Charles Bloom. ``That
would really help.''
</P>
<P>
   The final BCS rankings will be announced Dec. 6 at approximately
10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   No regrets: Toledo offered no apologies for quarterback Cade
McNown's third-and-9 bootleg run with 30 seconds left _ a play USC
coach Paul Hackett believed was unsportsmanlike.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Toledo was surprised by Hackett's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw six passes in the second half,'' Toledo said. ``If he
was concerned about that one play, he's got a problem. That's his
problem. There's a lot more plays he should be concerned about.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown faked a sweep to the left and reversed his field, running
23 yards down the right side. Toledo said the decision to reverse
was McNown's, but he added: ``I could have thrown a pass.''
</P>
<P>
   As is customary, the coaches met briefly on the field after the
game. According to Toledo, Hackett said, ``I hope (McNown) did that
on his own,'' then failed to congratulate Toledo on the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiting update: Asi Faoa, a linebacker from Magnolia High
School in Anaheim, gave UCLA an oral commitment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Faoa, 6-5 and 220 pounds, received scholarship offers from UCLA
and Kansas, according to Student Sports Magazine. He can play any
linebacker position but views himself as an outside
linebacker/defensive end in the mold of Danjuan Magee, Brendon
Ayanbadejo and Santi Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Faoa is the third player to commit to UCLA, following Venice
quarterback J.P. Losman and Temecula safety Ryan Wikert.
</P>
<P>
   Playing it safe: Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges
stepped out of character when they ordered McNown to take a knee
with a 17-point lead and 59 seconds left in the first half. UCLA
had first down on its 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone for it in that situation, but I felt we were in
total control and I didn't want to do anything to give them
momentum,'' Toledo said. ``I'd do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sometimes) you have a gut feeling that you're in control, and
I felt that way after the first quarter. I felt we could do what we
need to do to win. I felt very confident.''
</P>
<P>
   No more yellow: UCLA's improvement in recent weeks coincides
with a decline in penalties. The Bruins committed five at
Washington and two against USC.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising statistic from Saturday's emotional
game was the penalty total: five.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many penalties could have been called, but the officials
did an outstanding job of letting the players decide the game,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Record crowds: UCLA averaged 73,709 fans per game this season,
breaking the school single-season record of 69,812 set in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins also led the Pac-10 in attendance for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo, who had four sacks
against USC, was named Pac-10 defensive player of the week.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is 10-0 for the second time in school history, joining the
1946 team.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will practice today and Wednesday, then take four
days off for Thanksgiving.

SEAHAWKS THROW DASH OF `SPICE' ON STALE DISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jon Kitna: Spice Boy.
</P>
<P>
   No, you won't find him singing on a hot CD. You'll find him
quarterbacking on a cold DOA team.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawk coach Dennis Erickson, rolling back the position's
odometer almost two decades, said Monday his new starting
quarterback would add ``some spice'' to the Seahawk offense, which,
as you may have tasted, has been as flavorful as Sam Adams' laundry
hamper.
</P>
<P>
   How much a third-stringer can contribute after 11 weeks running
the scout-team offense in practice is highly suspect. Then again,
the Seahawks rank 29th in the 30-team NFL in third-down
conversions, so it would be hard for any of the Spice Girls to do
worse.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Moon does not bear exclusive responsibility for the
failure. His is simply the easiest position to alter with the most
potential for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   But Moon has, in a single season, slid from extraordinary to
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna is perhaps the one guy on the roster who cannot do that,
only because Kitna is not likely to be extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Still, unlike Moon, he can only improve. Also unlike Moon, he
can move a little bit and take a hit.
</P>
<P>
   While the Seahawks offense has taken numerous hits, it is better
if the hits are administered four yards downfield instead of in the
pocket. Kitna is not likely to explode on the Houston/Tennessee
Oilers/
</P>
<P>
   Titans (the first sports team ever to be mistaken for an e-mail
address) Sunday in the Kingdome in the fashion of Steve Young. But
at least he is a mobile mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Moon has become predictable. Not only is he locking on to his
primary receivers too frequently, he's zero threat to run away. He
can still roll out some, but when a quarterback's subconscious
knows the next hit may be the career finale, it's not hard to
communicate that through some mending ribs straight to the heart.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was distinct in Sunday's defeat in Dallas.
Impressive as was Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman's passing,
particularly under heavy Seahawk pressure, he did a simpler thing
that made him even more effective.
</P>
<P>
   He ran the ball. Sure, it was only five times for 14 yards. But
one was a 10-yard scramble from the pocket for a first down at the
Seahawk 34 on the last play of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The play will be little noted nor long remembered, except by
football fans who haven't seen it in a while, such as all those in
Seattle. Aikman made a play where there was none, and sustained a
drive that became a Dallas touchdown and a 23-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder how much the Seahawks would give for a third-down play
like that? In the five games since their mid-October bye, the
Seahawks have made just nine third downs in 55 attempts, yet have
won two and lost relatively closely the other three.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the mistakes that will cost Erickson and most of his
staff their jobs this offseason, perhaps a third-down play a game
that leads to a touchdown drive would have been enough to have made
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   That's how close it is in the great middle of the NFL. Any extra
weapon is a big advantage. The trendy weapon of this season is
quarterback mobility.
</P>
<P>
   QBs such as Young, Aikman, Randall Cunningham, Jake Plummer and
Kordell Stewart force defenses to curtail the emphasis on extra
pass-cover guys. ESPN came up with a stat Sunday night that said in
the category of career scoring runs of 20 or more yards, Young was
second-highest in NFL history. Denver's John Elway was long the
master, but no longer needs to rely on his legs with such a
superlative cast around him.
</P>
<P>
   The linebacker or safety who drops into coverage against Moon's
throws might have to freeze a moment against a footloose QB. A
moment can make all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   Moon was intimate with the virtue for years. In his last season
in the CFL with Edmonton in 1983, he rushed for 527 yards in 85
carries, a 6.2 average. In his heyday in Houston with the
run-and-shoot offense, his occasional forays were daggers in
defenses.
</P>
<P>
   But the last three seasons, age has caught up. It's not so much
a matter of lost quickness as it is slower recovery from the hits.
Moon doesn't want to risk a clobbering in the open field, or
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to quantify the cumulative toll taken by 20 years of
weekly poundings, but suffice to say it is beyond the comprehension
of the average mortal. There's a reason most NFL running backs
don't last much longer than five years before they drift toward the
sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's increasing immobility could be indulged when he passed as
accurately as he did most of last season. But this year, at 42 with
a mistake-riddled offense hampered by a mediocre line, Moon's
descent into ordinariness and predictability made the Seahawks even
more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the quarterback switch now, of course, is that
the horse is so far beyond the barn door that it can only be found
by satellite. But team and league politics dictate a player of
Moon's distinction isn't benched until the evidence is irrefutable.
</P>
<P>
   Six losses in eight games makes the verdict easy.
</P>
<P>
   Old Spice makes a nice after-shave, but it's not much against a
blitz.

MOON LOSES STARTING JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Warren Moon came to work Monday with a hunch
that he might be replaced as the Seahawks' starting quarterback.
Before the day was over, it had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Kitna will make his second NFL start in Sunday's game
against the Tennessee Oilers at the Kingdome. Moon will be the
backup and John Friesz the inactive third quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I totally agree with, but I accept it,''
Moon said. ``I have to accept that. If it will make our team
better, I definitely will accept it. That's what I'm hoping. That
it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before meeting with coach Dennis Erickson, Moon dropped a
couple of hints in the locker room that he could be out. It was one
of Moon's better reads of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is a one-game switch or the first step toward
replacing Moon for the final five games of this disappointing
season, and beyond, will depend on how well Kitna performs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope I would have a few weeks, and hopefully it will
be a deal where I could finish out the season,'' said Kitna, a
real-life local-boy-makes-good story waiting to happen. He played
at Central Washington University and Tacoma's Lincoln High School
before signing with the Seahawks as a free agent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With the Seahawks at 5-6 and realistically _ if not
mathematically _ eliminated from the playoffs, Erickson made the
move many feel is too late in coming. Even if the Seahawks were to
win their final five games, it is not likely they would earn a
playoff berth for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the situation that I would have hoped for,'' Kitna
said. ``I knew coming into the season that the only way I was going
to play was either by injury or by us not playing well. ... So on
one hand, it's excitement. But on the other hand, there's still a
little bit of a downer on it because of the situation we're in.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson is hoping Kitna can do what Moon has been unable to:
jump-start an offense that has slumped to 27th in the NFL. The
Seahawks' offense hasn't ranked this low since the 2-14 season of
1992, when it was dead last in the then 28-team league.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have lost six of their past eight games, and the
offense has scored only seven touchdowns in the six losses. They
have converted only nine third-down situations in their past five
games, dropping their third-down conversion percentage to .252
after 11 games, which ranks 29th in the league (Minnesota being No.
1 at .531; the New York Giants No. 30 at .240).
</P>
<P>
   After calculating all these numbers, Erickson came up with No. 7
(Kitna), not No. 1 (Moon).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're stagnant, like we are right now, you need to get
some kind of a spark,'' Erickson said. ``Obviously that's a
position that can give you a spark, and Jon is a guy who moves
around and does different things. So we're going to give him the
opportunity to see what he can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we're making the change is because we feel he can
be successful, not just to make the change,'' said Erickson, who
discovered Kitna at Central Washington and has dubbed him ``the
quarterback of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon has been benched briefly for ineffectiveness two other
times, both while playing with the Houston Oilers: once in 1985,
when he was replaced by Oliver Luck; and again in 1992, when Cody
Carlson took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to hurt my ego and psyche a little bit that I
wasn't able to get it done,'' Moon said. ``But the bottom line is,
let's get it done as a Seahawks football team. Hopefully, this will
enable us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Moon, who is in his 21st professional season, Kitna has
played very little in his first three years in the NFL. He got his
first start against the Raiders last year and rallied the Seahawks
to victory in the second half. He threw 12 passes in a mop-up role
during the Week 4 loss at Kansas City this season. Other than that,
he has played in preseason games and spent the regular season
working as the scout-team quarterback in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna said the move surprised him, especially because he first
heard about it from Moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little uncomfortable when Warren came and told me,
just because I don't feel like he was the problem,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   Is this move rooted in panic? Or with an eye to the future?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it should be classified as either right now,''
said Moon, who turned 42 last week. ``I don't think we're looking
to the future yet. I think it's too early to give up on this
season. And I don't think we're panicking. I think Dennis has
probably gone about as long as he feels he can with what's been
going on.''

KINGS' JOHNSON SUSPENDED FOR 12 GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kings enforcer Matt Johnson received a
birthday present from the NHL office Monday, though it would more
appropriately be termed a booby prize.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who turned 23 on Monday, was suspended without pay for
12 games by NHL vice president Colin Campbell for his actions in a
5-1 loss Thursday to the New York Rangers. Campbell said he
suspended Johnson because of a league-wide crackdown on deliberate
blows to the head and because of Johnson's past record of
indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who served the first game of his sentence Saturday when
the Kings beat Chicago, was suspended for a blind-side hit that
briefly knocked Rangers defenseman Jeff Beukeboom unconscious.
Beukeboom suffered what is believed to be a mild concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Based on his $650,000 salary, the suspension will cost Johnson
$95,121. He will be eligible to play again on Dec. 22 at
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very severe suspension, but it's something we have
to deal with and we will move on,'' said Kings general manager Dave
Taylor, who attended Monday's hourlong hearing in New York with
Johnson and agent Ron Salcer. ``The message is that players can't
take matters into their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the Kings will not appeal Johnson's sentence, the
longest in the NHL since then-King Tony Granato was suspended for
15 games in 1994 for slamming his stick over the head of
Pittsburgh's Neil Wilkinson.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation Beukeboom also might be suspended,
for kicking the feet out from under Glen Murray a few minutes
before Johnson's actions, which were believed to have been
retaliatory. But Beukeboom received no discipline beyond the minor
penalty he received Thursday.

PATRIOTS DEFEAT DOLPHINS, 26-23 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe was throwing interceptions. The
New England defenders were committing crucial face-mask penalties.
This was no way for a team that was trying to keep its season alive
to play.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe overcame his mistakes and engineered one of the most
dramatic comebacks this season with a last minute, 25-yard
touchdown pass to wide receiver Shawn Jefferson that lifted the
Patriots to a 26-23 victory over the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe took New England on a 15-play, 80-yard drive in just 2
minutes 53 seconds and hit Jefferson as he broke free into the end
zone. To keep the drive alive, Bledsoe completed passes on
third-and-11, third- and-10, fourth-and-10 and fourth-and-7.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, neither offense could pull away and capture
any real momentum. A 14-10 Miami halftime lead became 14-13 after a
44-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal and then 17-13 after an Olindo
Mare 21-yard kick. New England cut the score to 17-16 in the fourth
quarter after a 45-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots took the lead for the first time after two crucial
plays. New England, for much of the game, used a five wide receiver
set with no running backs for the first time all year. It seemed to
completely confuse the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   A 49-yard pass to fullback Tony Carter, who was split wide, put
the Patriots at the Miami 14. Then Bledsoe, again working out of
the five-receiver set, ran a draw play up the middle for seven
yards. But a third down pass was incomplete and the Patriots
settled for a 24-yard field goal and 19-17 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That left quarterback Dan Marino, who has engineered more
comebacks than Bill Clinton, to try and work the late-game heroics.
Marino slowly moved the offense down the field, looking like the
Marino of old. He was simply brilliant, picking apart the Patriots
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Marino put the Dolphins at the New England 4 where
running back Karim Abdul-Jabbar ran in barely untouched for a Miami
23-19 lead with 3 minutes and 22 seconds left. Marino took the team
48 yards in 8 plays. The 2-point try to wide receiver Lamar Thomas
was incomplete after he dropped the pass.
</P>
<P>
   After the score, Bledsoe began a comeback of his own. Bledsoe,
who whacked his hand on the helmet of a Miami player late in the
fourth quarter, threw an incomplete pass on third down with just
under two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots called timeout and Bledsoe had his hand checked. He
came back into the game, threw a fourth down pass in the face of a
blitz 13 yards to Jefferson for the first down to the Miami 40.
Then came another fourth down, this one six yards to go. Jefferson
again made the catch, for 12 yards, to the Miami 25 with 34 seconds
left. The series of passes to Jefferson probably saved the season.
He had 6 catches for 131 yards.
</P>
<P>
   This is an eventful time in the often-tumultuous life of the
Patriots, whose owner, Robert Kraft, signed an exclusive deal on
Monday night to negotiate with the state of Connecticut on moving
to Hartford in 2001. Although Kraft had been talking with
Connecticut officials for years, most thought he would keep the
team close to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Players said that all the talk about moving was not a
distraction and that they made jokes about having to sell their
homes. But others said that being constantly asked about the move
by reporters, family and friends during the week of such a huge
game was a major irritant.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots officials were somewhat worried about how fans would
react to the announcement before and during tonight's game. But
besides a few obnoxious signs _ no more than usual for a Patriots
game _ and a smattering of boos when the offense at times stalled
(also not unusual), nothing out of the ordinary happened. In fact,
the team got its usual standing ovation when it came onto the
field.
</P>
<P>
   More of a concern to fans, and especially the Patriots, was
getting their offense back on track. On their opening drive, the
Patriots were three downs and out, something that has happened
often this season. It didn't take Miami long to score, however.
Johnson made a gutsy call on fourth-and-10 at the New England 35: a
pass play to wide receiver Oronde Gadsden. He made a great
fingertip catch at the 15, then stumbled into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots responded with a touchdown drive that ended with
the 245-pound tight end Ben Coates scoring after he clearly pushed
off the 195-pound safety Calvin Jackson. The dead giveaway was when
Jackson, hit in the chest with the right shoulder of Coates, was
vaulted into the air as if he had jets in his shoes. The officials
missed the call and Coates had an 8-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Both offenses were at times dreadful and this game film will not
make it to the officiating Hall of Fame because of numerous bad
calls and decisions, including one on pass play that made Johnson
so angry he ran along the sideline waving his arms and screaming
for a penalty. The first half in particular was marred by
penalties, dropped passes and predictable play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   An interception of a Bledsoe pass in the second quarter led to
Miami taking a 14-7 second quarter.Marino found Gadsden again, this
time for an 11-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Patriots, perhaps envisioning the prospect of sitting
home during the playoffs, showed a sense of urgency and came right
back with a drive of their own. It went 14 plays, 72 yards and
ended with just a 25-yard field goal. The drive was stopped when
linebacker Zach Thomas held Coates, with the officials failing
again to make a call as the pass fell incomplete. &QL;

UW WOMEN'S BASKETBALL ATTENDANCE KEEPS DECLINING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The golden era for women's basketball at the
University of Washington apparently is over, and school officials
are trying to identify the reasons and find solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite back-to-back winning seasons and NCAA postseason
tournament invitations both seasons under new coach June Daugherty,
fewer people are attending Husky home games. The decline has been
steady, from 4,579 a game in 1993-94 to 3,609 last season.
</P>
<P>
   A program that twice ranked fourth nationally in average home
attendance _ most recently in 1990-91 _ was 23rd last season. NCAA
champion Tennessee led the nation in attendance, averaging 14,969
fans in 16 home games.
</P>
<P>
   It must be pointed out that when the Huskies ranked fourth, they
averaged 4,053 fans per game. That same figure would have ranked
them 15th last season.
</P>
<P>
   But with women's basketball rising in popularity nationally, why
is attendance at UW games falling?
</P>
<P>
   ``There probably have been a number of factors, but there isn't
one we can point to,'' said Leslie Wurzberger, the UW marketing and
promotions director. ``We are spending a lot of time asking people
what they think is the reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the potential factors:
</P>
<P>
   -- Coach Chris Gobrecht, who orchestrated the women's program
during a remarkably successful 11-year run beginning in 1985,
departed after the 1995-96 season with eight 20-plus win seasons,
two league championships, one co-championship and nine NCAA
tournament berths.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Huskies haven't contended for a Pac-10 title in three
seasons or advanced beyond the first round of the NCAA tourney
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   -- Competition for the entertainment dollar is tough in a
metropolitan area that has pro football, basketball and baseball.
Stanford (10th in attendance) is the only other school ranked ahead
of the Huskies in attendance that must compete with the pros.
</P>
<P>
   -- The professional Reign began playing in 1996, giving
Seattle-area fans of women's basketball another team to follow.
</P>
<P>
   -- The UW men's program was a shambles for most of the women's
boom period, until Bob Bender became the coach.
</P>
<P>
   -- A love affair burned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all new and exciting 10 years ago,'' said Kathy
Anderson, a former Gobrecht assistant and now an assistant to
athletic director Barbara Hedges. ``The newness wore off.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is a city of many bandwagons, and its sports fans
climbed aboard the Montlake Women's Express in the 1989-90 season.
The team averaged 4,053 fans a game, shattering the previous best
of 2,967 per game in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing for me was how the community adopted the
program and the players,'' Anderson said. ``It was unbelievably
exciting to watch the community develop that relationship with the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Gobrecht, now at USC, was known almost as much for her
demonstrative courtside manner as her in-your-face defense.
</P>
<P>
   Daugherty's demeanor is calmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have a coaching change, that is going to bring
disruption in your season-ticket holders until they see what you're
going to do,'' Daugherty said. ``When I came here (from Boise
State), I knew I was following in the footsteps of someone who did
a great job for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come into a situation like this, it's doubly hard.
Ask Jim Lambright what it was like following Don James. You know
that coming in, but it's important to be yourself and mold a
program the way you want to mold it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely going in the right direction, and I hope the
fans recognize this and grow with us.''
</P>
<P>
   When the current senior Huskies _ Jamie Redd, Malinda Lynch,
Amber Hall and Molly Hills _ began their collegiate careers in
1994, fan interest in women's basketball at UW was at an all-time
high. The women's team consistently was among the most-watched
teams in the country and had outdrawn the UW men's team five
consecutive seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It was a terrific recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, from South Jordan, Utah, was familiar with the program
before she saw her first Husky home game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was against Stanford and the place was packed,'' she said.
``It was awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been large crowds since. Just not as large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love our crowds, but I have seen them taper off a little and
that makes me sad,'' Lynch said. ``We are working as hard as ever
before and have a very exciting team.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows were raised Nov. 15 when only 1,963 fans attended the
women's regular-season opener vs. the Iowa Hawkeyes despite
extensive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed in the crowd, but sports-wise, there was a
lot going on that weekend,'' Daugherty said.
</P>
<P>
   The Husky opener came the day after the UW football team played
host to then-No. 2 UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Football is an all-day event,'' Wurzberger said, ``and to give
up both days of your weekend is asking a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a coincidence _ or because the Huskies haven't had
a 20-win season, challenged for a Pac-10 title or advanced beyond
the first round of the NCAA tourney _ the drop in attendance
coincides with the Reign's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Reign only brings more attention to our game,'' Daugherty
said, ``but a lot of our fans cross over and it's hard to go to
four or five games a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that some Husky season-ticket holders either
changed allegiance to the Reign or reduced the number of UW games
they attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feedback I've gotten the past few years is there are too
many (women's basketball) games,'' Wurzberger said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Reign and Huskies are working to help each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that having a pro team in Seattle would help
promote women's basketball overall,'' said Reign general manager
Karen Bryant, a UW alumna. ``We have a great working relationship
with the UW, and I would be surprised if we are having a negative
impact on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked really hard to make sure we don't have any
scheduling conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reign was one of the American Basketball League's weakest
teams in its first two seasons, but has started strong this year,
which might further diminish the Huskies' Pac-10 attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to get our biggest crowds during the conference,''
Hills said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent drop-off, the Huskies have been second or
third in league attendance for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   After the average home crowd slipped to a five-year low last
season, UW officials sent a survey to season-ticket holders looking
for reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed:
</P>
<P>
   -- Fifty-six percent attend all home games.
</P>
<P>
   -- Six percent do not attend non-conference games.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fifty-three percent bring families.
</P>
<P>
   -- Thirty percent have UW football season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fourteen percent have men's basketball season tickets.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sixty percent attend Reign games.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say the success of the men's team _ reaching
the NCAA Sweet 16 last season _ hasn't had a negative effect on the
women because only 14 percent of those polled buy tickets for both
teams.
</P>
<P>
   So the search for answers continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that we've had a decline in attendance,''
Wurzberger said, ``but I don't think we've had a decline in
enthusiasm.''

education programs offered by medical schools and biomedical
research institutions to give laypeople insight into the world of
medicine, are drawing crowds all over the country. In New York,
2,200 people vie for the 600 seats available each night. In Denver
it sells out every year. On eight consecutive Tuesdays this fall,
over 500 people attended the mini medical school at Emory
University to listen to lectures by medical school professors on
topics such as the mind, the musculoskeletal system, and cancer. By
Christine Day.

ROLE (AND ROSE) REVERSAL  
 THIS TIME ASU COULD BE SPOILER 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-ARIZONA-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruce Snyder insists he won't raise the issue with his team, but
rest assured, the players know:
</P>
<P>
   ASU could keep Arizona out of the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Sound funny? There's a reason. The Sun Devils have never knocked
the Wildcats out of a trip to Pasadena. Twice Arizona has kept ASU
from making the trip. On Friday in Tucson, the Sun Devils hope to
return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't brought it up, and I don't think I will,'' ASU Coach
Snyder said. ``That's not the emphasis. What you want to do, in any
rival game, is beat the other team just because they're the other
team. Regardless of what the benefits or downside to what a win or
loss might be, it's the thrill of playing in the game and playing
well enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh huh.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Dick Tomey, too, insists he hasn't uttered the
words ``Rose Bowl'' to his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure guys think about bowls and so on,'' he said. ``All I
know is I think we'll be in a good bowl. Beyond that, we really
have no control, other than the way we play against ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the most important game in our season left, so we just
have to focus on playing our best game of the year, because that's
what it will take to win.''
</P>
<P>
   (See previous ``uh huh.'')
</P>
<P>
   Three things must happen for Arizona to receive an invitation to
Pasadena:
</P>
<P>
   UCLA must finish first or second in the Bowl Championship Series
standings. The Bruins are currently second, with one game to play
at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats must beat the Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl must opt to pick a Pac-10 team over an at-large
team. It would not be obligated to do so, and many have speculated
that Notre Dame would get the nod.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue interests ASU most, for several reasons. One, a
Sun Devils victory would guarantee a winning season and a likely
bowl berth. Two, a victory would mean payback.
</P>
<P>
   The latter issue may mean more to longtime fans than current
players.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, ASU was 8-2 under first-year coach John
Cooper. Arizona, coached by Larry Smith, was 7-3 and headed for a
Sun Bowl meeting with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Just before kickoff in Tempe, Southern California knocked off
UCLA in Los Angeles, giving the Sun Devils an opportunity to secure
their first Rose Bowl berth with a victory or tie.
</P>
<P>
   With 5:29 left in the game, Arizona's Max Zendejas missed a
52-yard field goal try, but a procedure penalty against the
Wildcats gave him another shot. He made the 57-yard try to tie the
game at 13.
</P>
<P>
   ASU took the ensuing kickoff with a chance to run out the clock,
but Arizona's Stan Mataele sacked ASU's Jeff Van Raaphorst, caused
a fumbled and recovered it at the ASU 20. Zendejas kicked a 32-yard
field goal to secure a 16-13 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils had to settle for a Holiday Bowl meeting with
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Three years earlier, it was much the same.
</P>
<P>
   ASU got a chance for a Rose Bowl invitation after Washington
State knocked off Washington during ASU's bye week.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils came into Tucson with a 9-1 record. Arizona was
5-4-1 and confident.
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. The Wildcats led, 10-0, at the half and 26-0
after three quarters and were never really challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the (roles are reversed), I'm approaching it the
same way,'' Tomey said. ``I don't think in games like this it
matters which side you are on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know each other well. We know each other's players.
Coaching staffs have coached against each other. There are not many
secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats had a few secrets up their sleeve last season. A
handful of trick plays contributed to Arizona's 28-16 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, ASU was favored. The Sun Devils were 8-2, No. 12 in
the nation and had a possible bowl championship series on the line.
The Wildcats were 5-5 and looking to become bowl eligible.
</P>
<P>
   They did with the win and earned a spot in the Insight.Com Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This game has impacted both teams in a variety of ways over the
years, but for many fans, 1986 stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Wildcats were the spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils had already secured a Rose Bowl berth and needed
only a victory over Arizona to lock up an undefeated season. Sun
Devils quarterback Van Raaphorst passed for 437 yards and two
touchdowns but threw three interceptions, including one Chuck Cecil
ran back 106 yards in the game's defining moment. ASU was trailing
24-10 in the fourth quarter but driving for what it hoped would be
a game-turning score. The Sun Devils never recovered. &QL;

HE HAD A FOOT IN BOTH CAMPS  
 DOHERTY COACHED AT ASU, UA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He showed Vince Lombardi the T-formation. He was one reason the
Arizona Interscholastic Association keeps teams off the field on
Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Ed Doherty, football pioneer, became the only man to
be a head football coach at both Arizona State and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, with the rivalry, nobody would ever consider that,''
said Pete Doherty, one of Ed's nine children, who played
quarterback for his father at St. Mary's High in 1965 and '66.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty's last two ASU teams beat UA in 1949 and 1950, laying
the foundation for a competitive rivalry instead of a UA-dominated
series.
</P>
<P>
   When Doherty moved to Tucson in 1957 to coach the UA for two
seasons, he was razzed by some of the ASU players who played for
him in the late '40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he was a traitor,'' said Wilford ``Whizzer'' White,
a dazzling back for Doherty in Tempe. ``We had fun with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, 79, whose health has been on the decline for years,
wasn't available to be interviewed. He lives in Tucson, where his
last coaching job was at Salpointe High in the late 1970s and early
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   But his college memories remain at ASU, where he had much more
success than he did in his two seasons at UA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he still relates more to ASU than he does to UA,''
White said.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty was 25-17 from 1947 to '50 at ASU, then known as Arizona
State College. His last two teams went a combined 16-5 and played
in the Salad Bowl. At UA, he was 4-15-1.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, a quarterback at Boston College in the early 1940s,
arrived in Arizona as a nattily dressed man who loved to create
offensive plays on a whim during practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the more creative offensive coaches I've ever
seen,'' said Morrison Warren, who played fullback for Doherty at
ASU.
</P>
<P>
   The year before Doherty got to Tempe, UA had scored a 67-0
knockout over ASU. In Doherty's first season, ASU led UA in the
first half before falling, 26-13. His last two ASU teams beat UA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That started the respect,'' Warren said. ``Arizona didn't look
at us as a pushover anymore. That showed the respect for the
quality of his coaching ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty had a hard time staying put. Other coaching stops
included Rhode Island, Xavier, Holy Cross and a stint as an
assistant for the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   He told ``The Arizona Republic'' in 1991 that he left ASU
because he felt he would be pressured by some alums to violate NCAA
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never liked college very well,'' he said in '91. ``I wasn't
good at it. I couldn't recruit worth a damn. Unless you recruit,
you don't win in college. In high school, you take what shows up
and make the most of it.''
</P>
<P>
   After his playing days at Boston College, while stationed at a
Brooklyn Navy yard in the 1940s, Doherty would go to St. Cecilia's
High in New Jersey, where he helped out a guy named Lombardi. He
taught Lombardi the T-formation, said Bill Quinn, who played with
Doherty at BC and was one of his assistants at ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't know that and take umbrage to it, but I
know, because I was there,'' Quinn said. ``Lombardi was a good
student.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty returned to his first love, high school coaching, at St.
Mary's, where he started many traditions that remain today. He led
the Knights to 5A state titles in 1967 and '68 and to a state
runner-up finish in '69, when they lost their only game in the
final to Central.
</P>
<P>
   At Salpointe, he took the Lancers to a state runner-up finish in
'81.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Lavin, now coach at Bourgade, was a 22-year-old assistant in
'67 for Doherty when he won his first title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had diarrhea for two weeks, I was so nervous,'' Lavin said.
``He was such a legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They called him Ed the Head. He was a cerebral coach, very
analytical. It was amazing how he could pick apart defenses. He was
very innovative.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite health problems, Doherty worked relentlessly. A high
school rule was imposed in the 1960s because of his work ethic, his
son believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the Doherty rules was, `No practices on Sundays,' ''
Pete Doherty said. ``He was non-stop in game preparation. In the
'60s, coaches never heard of working seven days a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Doherty has undergone countless surgeries. His left leg was
amputated. His arteries have been unclogged and rerouted. He's
battled ulcer and gall bladder problems and aneurysms.
</P>
<P>
   ``His medical history would defy Ripley,'' said Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn was amazed to see his friend show up to a Tempe restaurant
before last year's ASU-Arizona game to honor the '47 ASU team,
Doherty's first.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty isn't able to make the annual get-together this week
with his former players and assistants from ASU.
</P>
<P>
   But they remember fondly the way he got young, local talent to
blend with World War II veterans into an overachieving team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we were glorifying our own efforts,'' Quinn said. ``But
those four years were special. It was a short time, but Ed did some
great things with the talent he had. He didn't have the best
talent, but he got them to achieve to their fullest. I believe Ed
had something to do with the development of ASU football.''

11 REASONS TO CHEER COYOTES HAVEN'T LOST IN A MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been such a long time since the Coyotes lost a game, you'd
think they wouldn't remember it. It's been more than a month _ 34
days, to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough enough trying to remember what you ate for dinner on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time, but we all remember that defeat,''
Coyotes forward Rick Tocchet said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Oct. 22. A Thursday. The Coyotes were in Dallas and lost
to the Stars, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were mad,'' Tocchet said. ``Shoney (Coach Jim Schoenfeld)
was mad. The whole team was mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like it was last year, where it was, `Oh, we played
well in Dallas.' No, we ``should'' have won the game. It's a whole
new different attitude around here this year.''
</P>

   Since Dallas, the Coyotes have peeled off a league-leading
11-game undefeated streak of nine wins, no losses and two ties.
Phoenix (11-2-2) can make it an even dozen _ one shy of tying the
franchise record _ by beating the visiting Chicago Blackhawks
(5-12-3) tonight at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Though not even close to the NHL's all-time record of 35
consecutive undefeated games, set by the Philadelphia Flyers in
1979-80, it's a significant streak nonetheless. With that in mind,
here are 11 reasons for the Coyotes' 11-game run:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Commitment to teamwork &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team's star players got together at the beginning of the
season and decided to check their egos at the door. Left wing Keith
Tkachuk and center Jeremy Roenick are no longer consumed by who's
No. 1 or No. 1A. Together, with the help of right wing Rick Tocchet
and other veterans, they have vowed to embrace the team concept.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment quickly spread. Nobody's trying to do it all by
himself; the proof is that 14 players have scored goals. Also,
every player has been willing to pay the price defensively. They've
created turnovers with relentless pursuit, especially between the
blue lines, and they're each taking turns diving to the ice to
block shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league is so competitive and all the teams are pretty even
now, so you really have to be working together and be on the same
page,'' defenseman Jyrki Lumme said. ``Bottom line, that's been the
biggest thing for us as far as I'm concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Goals-against factor &QL;  No team since the 1958-59 Montreal
Canadiens has gone this long
without allowing more than two goals in a game. The Coyotes have
held opponents to two or fewer in 14 straight, a post-expansion
record. During that span, they have allowed two goals six times,
one goal six times and have posted two shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they have given up only 22 goals in 15 games _
seven fewer than the next-closest team (Buffalo) and 50 fewer than
the worst (Chicago). In the last nine games of the streak, they
also have allowed only two third-period goals by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Men behind the mask &QL;  Where would the Coyotes be without their
goalie tandem of
Nikolai Khabibulin and Jimmy Waite? Not at the top of the NHL
standings, where they were leading the league with 24 points
entering Monday's games.
</P>
<P>
   Waite (4-0-1) and Khabibulin (7-2-1) are ranked first and second
among all goalies with 0.98 and 1.67 goals-against average. Waite,
who recently started four straight games and went 3-0-1 to win
Player of the Week honors, also leads with a .962 save percentage.
Khabibulin (.933) is tied for fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy played great while I was out (because of a bruised
hand),'' said Khabibulin, who will make his third straight start
tonight. ``But it was important for my confidence, I think, that I
came back and played well when it was my turn to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Roenick's revitalization &QL;  First, he made a commitment to his
loved ones to be a
better family man. Then he made a commitment to the Coyotes and
himself to be a better hockey player.
</P>
<P>
   On the ice, he's leading the club with 19 points (five goals, 14
assists), and he's done it despite altering his game from his
free-wheeling ways to a more fundamental north-south style of
skating. He's still an exciting player to watch, but it's more
accommodating for his linemate Tkachuk. And it's safer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge commitment for the benefit of the team and for
the benefit of Jeremy Roenick,'' said former NHL player Charlie
Simmer, the team's television analyst. ``You play as reckless as he
does and the hits are pretty severe. I think it's great the way
he's changed it up, and I think he's probably liking it a little
more now, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; De-fense, de-fense &QL;  This is the
strongest batch of blueliners the franchise has ever assembled.
Though not the biggest or most physical, the Coyotes' defensemen
are clearing the puck and moving it up crisply to the forwards
better than anyone in the game right now.
</P>
<P>
   They have great speed and mobility. Oleg Tverdovsky, free-agent
addition Lumme and the reliable Teppo Numminen aren't afraid to
join the rush and create almost man advantage-type situations
because of their offensive creativity. Stay-at-home types such as
Gerald Diduck and Keith Carney make it a complete group.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Penalty killers &QL;  It might be the
toughest job in hockey, and statistically, the Coyotes are the best
at it. They lead the NHL with the No. 1-ranked penalty-killing
unit. They have killed off 67 of 73 power plays (91.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Specialists such as Bob Corkum, Mike Stapleton and Juha Ylonen
have put a vice-like grip on opposing clubs. The Coyotes have
allowed only six power play goals; to put that in perspective, 17
teams have scored double that or more.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Captain Coyote &QL;  His contract
fiasco behind him, his captaincy reconfirmed, Tkachuk is off to a
huge start with 10 goals _ a pace that would put him at 56. His 217
goals since the start of the 1993-94 season are the most of any
player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing great,'' Roenick said. ``And he's having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Coaching stability &QL;  For the first
time in five .years, the team will have the same head coach for two
straight seasons. Schoenfeld has got the players to buy into his
team-first system, and they're seeing the rewards for it.
</P>
<P>
   Assistants John Tortorella and Gordie Roberts have taken on
added responsibilities this season and are future head-coaching
material. Goalie instructor Benoit Allaire has the greatest job in
hockey right now.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Practice facilities &QL;  Having their
own practice facility in north Scottsdale, complete with two sheets
of quality ice, several locker rooms and meeting rooms, plus a
state-of-the-art weight and conditioning room, has been a huge
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Before their $10 million headquarters opened in March, the
Coyotes never were quite sure where they would practice from one
day to the next. The Ice Den is close to their homes, convenient
and comfortable, and a big reason why the players seem in better
condition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Schedule  &UR; makers &QL;  In the beginning, they hated the idea of
.playing one game every
four days, but a leisurely early season schedule has allowed the
Coyotes extra time for rest, detailed practices and film sessions.
It's probably also why they've managed to stay so healthy.
</P>
<P>
   It took 27 days before the team played nine games. A hectic
December awaits, however, with 10 of 14 games away from home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Real sport, real fans &QL;  According to Tkachuk and others, America
West Arena is a
building that opposing teams are starting to fear. The fans are
rabid and, even despite the occasional ``red out'' when Detroit
comes to town, are acting as a sixth man on the ice for the home
team, Tkachuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the greatest fans in the world,'' he said. ``They're
a big reason why we're winning.'' &QL;

1 WORD OFF LIMITS TO CARDS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For much of the year the ``P'' word has been avoided, purposely.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals' wild win over the Washington Redskins on
Sunday put the team not only in control of its own destiny, but in
the driver's seat for the third NFC wild-card playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-5, they have a one-game lead over New Orleans and a
two-game lead over several others. But they have a two-game edge
over the Saints in NFC play, which is a tiebreaker after
head-to-head result. They play the Saints in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't been in this position since they were 7-4
in their first season in the Valley in 1988, when quarterback Neil
Lomax was sidelined because of an arthritic hip. Five losses
followed.
</P>
<P>
   So as they prepare for Sunday's game at Kansas City, AFC West
champion last year and now residing in the basement after losing
six straight, is it time to talk about the ``P'' word?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not yet,'' receiver Rob Moore said, firmly.
</P>
<P>
   When will the time come?
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get there,'' he said, more firmly. ``It's way too
early. It's a goal, but we're playing a good Kansas City team
that's coming off some tough losses. It's not going to be an easy
test.''
</P>
<P>
   Added defensive end Andre Wadsworth, ``The only time to talk
about playoffs is if you have nine or 10 wins. There's plenty of
football left to be played. We have to take games one game at a
time, one play at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we're reluctant to talk about it. Maybe if we
were a team that went to the playoffs every year, you would talk
about it, but we've gotta cross that bridge when we come to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Moore adds a good point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our offense and defense could put a complete game together,
we'd be all right. But that remains to be seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive unit carried a confused young offense during the
first part of the season; now a suddenly hot offense has had to
bail out a suddenly shell-shocked defense the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   Quick factoids: The 45-42 win in Washington marks the first time
in recorded Cardinals history (since 1920) that they surrendered 40
points and won. What's more, the franchise has allowed 40 or more
points only 40 times in that 68-year stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' defense has fallen to next to last in points
allowed in the NFC and ranks 26th in the NFL, allowing 274.
Conversely, an offense that ranked 29th in the NFL in total offense
a month ago now ranks 16th and is climbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter how we win,'' linebacker Jamir Miller said.
``A win is a win. We have some things we need to get corrected.
We'll work on them on Wednesday and see if we can get them
corrected. Hey, we've got to go out on Sunday and play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a case of us playing a little softer more than
anything. Trent Green was putting the ball on the money, and we
weren't coming out of our zones as hard as we were earlier because
we had the big lead. It worked to their advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin, however, said the Cardinals changed little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to slow them down,'' he said. ``We tried blitzes,
played man coverage, zone, zone blitzes, double coverage and
weren't successful in any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins attacked the Cardinals' corners, more notably their
right corner, with receivers using double moves and cuts. Right
cornerback Tommy Knight came up lame again with the same hamstring
problem, and replacements J.B. Brown and J.J. McCleskey were
schooled (and so was the normally reliable Aeneas Williams).
</P>
<P>
   ``The right side certainly was a problem in this game; they
worked that area and had success throwing to our right,'' Tobin
said. ``But they threw to the other side, too. And down the middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work on double moves and cuts this week. Those
things don't go away. If one team does it, other people look at
films, too. We have to figure ways to stop it. That, and on our
jams. You are allowed to jam within five yards, and we were doing
it at seven to eight yards. We have to tighten that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said it's unlikely the team will add another cornerback to
bolster the right side, citing a couple of reasons: Few, if any, of
the caliber needed are available; and with only five games left, it
would take an exceptional corner to play the system well so
quickly.

D-BACKS SHOW FINLEY AROUND BOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Bernie Williams and his agent talked with Boston Red Sox
officials on Monday, the Diamondbacks began to focus on another
center fielder _ Steve Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, a two-time Gold Glove winner who helped San Diego claim
the National League pennant, toured Bank One Ballpark with his
wife. Leading the way were Diamondbacks Managing General Partner
Jerry Colangelo, General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr. and Manager Buck
Showalter and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, which lasted approximately five hours, went well,
according to Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were very interested. There's a mutual interest
on both sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola was due to have further discussion with Finley's
agent, Tommy Tanzer, late Monday night. Tanzer was not on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who turns 34 in March, has a career .275 average. He
made $3.4 million while having a slow year with the bat for the
Padres _ .249 with 14 home runs and 67 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   He is said to be looking for at least a four-year deal. Even if
his salary were to rise a bit from 1998, it still would be much
less than that of Williams, who is seeking a seven-year contract at
close to $14 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks denied they made an offer to Williams. Baseball
sources said the team might be willing to pay more than $12 million
but less than $14 million per season.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said the team's interest in Finley doesn't mean the
door is closed on Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep a lot of baseballs in the air, because you
are never sure what people are going to do,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's signing of outfielder Brian Jordan on Monday could
trigger a domino effect. The New York Yankees, Williams' previous
team, are on the verge of signing Albert Belle, which could lead
the Red Sox to sign Williams. &QL;  &QL; 
Tall in Texas &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Randy Johnson, Arizona's primary target this winter,
visited with Texas Rangers officials in Arlington, Texas, on Monday
and got a tour of The Ballpark from Nolan Ryan, his longtime
confidant. Johnson visited the Anaheim Angels and the Los Angeles
Dodgers over the weekend and attended a Mighty Ducks hockey game
with Disney chairman Michael Eisner, whose company owns the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo met with Johnson's two agents in Phoenix on Sunday
night and spoke again with one of them by phone Monday afternoon.
Johnson may announce his decision by the end of this week. &QL;  &QL;

TOMEY: RIVALRY HARD TO CONTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Arizona Coach Dick Tomey is determined that there will
be no repeat Friday of the 1996 brawl with Arizona State, but the
potential is always there.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey was reminded of it Saturday while watching news footage of
a fight that broke out before Florida State's victory over Florida
at Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, rivals couldn't control their emotions during a
highly charged moment that turned ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey conceded that coaches have a tough job preparing young
players for a long-awaited confrontation with a long-time rival.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dilemma. Coaches want their players to be full of fight,
but they don't want punches thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fine line,'' said Tomey, whose team got into a brawl
during the third quarter of the 1996 game after Wildcats defensive
tackle Daniel Greer was hit from behind. ``You want to be more
intense, hit harder, run faster and care about this game more than
any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, you want them to walk that fine line of good judgment
when it comes to not hitting late and getting penalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe you can do it. But, yeah, it's difficult.'' &QL;  &QL; 
On second thought &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Greer, now a senior, was asked repeatedly Monday to look back on
the 1996 incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll never be erased,'' he finally said.
</P>
<P>
   He also continued to dismiss praise for a season that has a
chance to be Arizona's best ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done anything yet,'' Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A smart number: Defensive end Eli Wnek, a redshirt freshman from
Glendale Ironwood High School, leads the Pac-10's All-Academic team
with a 3.75 grade-point average. He also is the youngest player to
make the 25-member team.
</P>
<P>
   Tomey likes to look people in the eye, and that might be a
reason Arizona recruited defensive lineman Keoni Fraser, a freshman
who had to stretch to reach his listed height of 6 feet. ``Nobody
recruited Keoni because he's short,'' Tomey said. ``But I like
short guys. I'm short.''
</P>
<P>
   Still on a record pace: With every catch Friday, receivers
Dennis Northcutt and Jeremy McDaniel can break Arizona's record for
combined receptions. By combining for 11 against California,
Northcutt and McDaniel pushed their season total to 116, which
broke a 24-year old mark held by Theopolis Bell and Scott Piper.

AWAITING BOWL BID, HUSKIES LOOK FORWARD AND BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ On the 100th day since they began fall practice, they
rested. The Washington Huskies looked gratefully back at 11
football games, at an impending bowl trip to Hawaii and at their
weary bones.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body is beat up,'' sighed Mr. Multi-purpose, Joe Jarzynka.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Washington is to receive its official invitation to
either the Aloha or Oahu Bowl on Christmas Day. For most, it's a
thrill. For others, it's repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going back is not as exciting for me, partly because I
expected more,'' Jarzynka said. ``It doesn't symbolize improvement.
... I had Rose Bowl visions, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies will try to realize those visions next year with a
new quarterback, probably Marques Tuiasosopo. At least UW coach Jim
Lambright didn't sound like a guy introducing a boffo competition
between Tuiasosopo and reserve J.K. Scott when he said of
Tuiasosopo, ``He's the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have clamored for Tuiasosopo in favor of Brock Huard
soon will get the full dose. Lambright says that will wait until
after the bowl game, although Washington will try to re-establish
the run game next year; Christmas Day will be intended as Brock
Huard's stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He carries this one out exactly as we have all season long,''
Lambright said. ``This is an accomplishment Brock got us to, so we
want to make sure this is also his bowl game.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as Huard's statistics declined this year, Tuiasosopo's also
felt the brunt of a lesser supporting cast. There was no Jerome
Pathon, for instance, to flag down passes off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo completed 50.6 percent of his passes compared with
57.8 last year and had a touchdown-to-interception ratio of 2-5
compared with 3-1 in 1997. He did relieve an injured Huard for
victories against Utah State and Cal, while in '97, Washington was
upset by Oregon in Tuiasosopo's only starting appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``His feet are a great escape and a great tool for us to use,''
Lambright said. ``At this point, we have to work a lot more on his
passing. It's a combination of mechanics and just repetitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo doesn't have a mega-arm, but the Huskies feel they
can win with it. He is a terrific leader, so the main question
surrounds how he handles the role of being an every-down
quarterback rather than a change-of-pace substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to gain more grasp of the overall quarterback
position,'' Jarzynka said. ``He's an outstanding option runner, he
moves real well, but he doesn't necessarily have that quarterback
mentality. He's more of a pure athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to get out there and work a lot with his throwing,
balance up his throwing and running ability.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Scott, says Jarzynka: ``J.K. might have a better arm than
Brock. He has a little bit of a control problem, a little bit of an
accuracy problem. Control, as far as touch passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo, 6-foot-2 and 210 pounds, will be a third-year junior
in 1999. Scott, 6-3 and 210, will be a redshirt sophomore. He
played only two years of high school football in Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Huard announced after Saturday's 16-9 Apple Cup victory over
Washington State that he was leaving early for the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we worked for everything we got,'' Huard said
Monday. ``Nothing was given to the '98 Huskies. I think that's
going to make it more meaningful when we look back on it.''
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD: Washington's 1999 schedule has opening non-league
games with BYU, Air Force and Colorado, no bye week, and wicked
consecutive November road games with Arizona, the probable
preseason Pac-10 favorite, and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   With a late opener (Sept. 11), moving a November game up may
make sense, although Lambright said he knew of no proposed move of
a game. Usually those TV-inspired changes are made in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   TRACKING TOALEI: Asked what he would tell little-used JC
transfer defensive tackle Toalei Mulitauaopele for the offseason,
Lambright said, ``Run.'' And he repeated the word six times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's improved,'' said fellow tackle Mac Tuiaea. ``It's just a
matter of him understanding what he needs in terms of adjusting to
the time commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   TWO-SPORT TUSSLE: Next fall, it will be a year from the 2000
Olympics, which take place during football season. Wide receiver
Ja'Warren Hooker, a super sprinter who had only nine catches this
year while fighting football injuries, might have to choose which
sport to play if he intends to make a run at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think he'll have to make a decision until you get
right down to the year,'' Lambright said.
</P>
<P>
   IFS, ANDS, MUTTS: Lambright says the Huskies will leave for
Hawaii when final exams are completed, probably Dec. 17 or 18. ...
Lambright says the Huskies will try to recruit a scholarship
kicker. ``The good thing is, we got so much publicity about needing
a kicker,'' he said. ... FS Hakim Akbar broke a metacarpal (hand)
bone, but Lambright says it should mend in time for bowl practices.
... Lambright says he doesn't know of any UW assistant coaches
leaving the program. Given the squad's limitations, he said, ``I'm
not sure we've ever had a more productive (coaching) year.'' ... LB
Lester Towns likely needs a long rest for his injured foot.
``Hopefully, we can get him walking so it doesn't look like he's 90
years old,'' Lambright kidded. ... As for whether power has shifted
to the Oregon schools, which staged a memorable Civil War game,
Lambright said, ``There has been a shift of power from Washington
to everybody during the sanctions.''

THOSE FOLKS IN PURPLE MAY SEE RED

<P>
   If the current Bowl Championship Series standings remain
unchanged through Dec. 6, the folks in Manhattan, Kan., might turn
a deeper shade of purple.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State, undefeated and ranked third in the BCS standings
last week, had hoped to gain ground on No. 2 UCLA this week.
Instead, the Wildcats dropped a half point further behind the
Bruins, who gained ground in the computer rankings and strength of
schedule components of the formula.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, ranked No. 1 in the AP, stayed atop the BCS ranking,
but its lead over UCLA was cut by more than half.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS was formed to ensure that the top two teams in the
country meet in a bowl game _ this year it's the Fiesta Bowl _ but
it hasn't quieted the call for a playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   That cry probably will grow louder should the three top-ranked
teams remain undefeated entering the bowl games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of our better options,'' said Herman Frazier,
Fiesta Bowl president, ``but I'm not sure it's the worst-case
scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   That scenario is why many people, including UCLA Coach Bob
Toledo, favor a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all three are undefeated . . . two people are going to be
happy and one is going to be very disappointed,'' he said. ``I
don't know how else to solve it. I just know it's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation last week that the Wildcats could
pass UCLA even if both teams finished undefeated. But the Wildcats
fell further behind, despite beating No. 19 Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, meanwhile, surged even though they won against an
unranked team, Southern California. They jumped from second to
first in the ``Seattle'' ``Times'' computer rankings and from fifth
to fourth in the ``New York Times'' rankings. Their strength of
schedule also improved from 12th in the country to eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Playing USC helped, even though it is unranked, because the
Trojans have the third toughest schedule in the country, according
to the ``Seattle Times'' computer rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Angry Kansas State fans might want to direct their questions to
Coach Bill Snyder and his philosophy of scheduling easy
non-conference games. While UCLA scheduled Texas, Houston and
Miami, Kansas State faced Northern Illinois, Northeastern Louisiana
and Indiana State, which is in Division I-AA.
</P>
<P>
   The top three ranked teams have a total of four games remaining,
and if they all finish undefeated, criticism of the BCS formula is
sure to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee plays Vanderbilt on Saturday and then faces either
Arkansas or Mississippi State in the SEC title game on Dec. 5 in
Atlanta. UCLA plays at Miami on Dec. 5, and Kansas State has the
Big 12 title game remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA is not assured of a spot in the Fiesta Bowl even if it
beats Miami and finishes 11-0. Kansas State could still pass the
Bruins if the Wildcats win the Big 12 title game.
</P>
<P>
   If all three of the top-ranked teams were to lose, that likely
would move Florida State into the Fiesta Bowl, where it could
possibly face Texas A&AMP;M or Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing has been interesting,'' Frazier said. ``I
still think it's working so far. I think there's always going to be
criticism of anything like this from people who want a true
national championship.''

NORTHRIDGE STADIUM PLAN CAUSES UPROAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ It has come down to either the North Campus
or Pierce College for a new football field for Cal State
Northridge, and the site committee will recommend only one to
school president Blenda Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In an electrically charged meeting Monday filled with arguments
and chanting, CSUN's site committee voted 7 to 3 in favor of
recommending the North Campus as an on-campus site for an 8,000- to
9,000-seat stadium. The area residents emotionally denounced such a
move.
</P>
<P>
   Previously the committee voted to recommend a $1 million
renovation project at Pierce College as an off-campus alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night there was a deviation from that original plan.
Instead of recommending to CSUN President Blenda Wilson an
on-campus and an off-campus site, committee chairman David Honda
said the site committee will make one recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-hour session ended, CSUN spokesman John Chandler
said this was not the last meeting. At least one more will take
place, though a date wasn't set.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about the football stadium,'' said Frank Canter, a
member of the Zelzah Coalition. ``This is about a money-making
proposal. I really think that this community is basically,
overwhelmingly (agreed) that a stadium on campus is not going to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the protesters brought signs stating, ``No Stadium in My
Backyard,'' and, ``No more lies about the size.''
</P>
<P>
   A petition was circulated to block the move and a table was set
up with the words: ``This stadium could be used for loud rock
concerts! Rock concerts draw drugs and crime.''
</P>
<P>
   At times the meeting deteriorated into a poor man's ``Jerry
Springer Show'' with chants of ``No stadium'' and boos for people
in favor of the North Campus stadium. At times there was yelling
and finger-pointing by people on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   There were also personal, oral attacks against the football
program and its players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty sad,'' CSUN freshman offensive lineman Keith
Kincaid said. ``The football program wants to have the community
behind it. I didn't know it was going to be like this when I
decided to come to the meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN police were present in case the estimated 150 people in
attendance got out of control. The detractors and supporters showed
up to see plans drawn by Tom Tindall, CSUN director of facility
planning, detailing how a stadium would be situated on the North
Campus.
</P>
<P>
   The on-campus site approved by the committee is approximately 50
yards south of the existing 7,500-seat North Campus Stadium. The
football field would be 210 feet from Lindley Avenue, 375 feet from
Zelzah Avenue and considerably further from Lassen Street. Tindall
also outlined how the university would answer the complaints of
area residential groups.
</P>
<P>
   That includes traffic, noise, lighting, parking, the size of the
facility and the type of events at the facility. Tindall said
landscape buffers would be built to mitigate the noise.
</P>
<P>
   But area residents said there was a strong sense of distrust
toward the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about a non-trust,'' said Lois Raybin, a Northridge
Townhomes backer. ``We don't know who to trust anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of residents showed up to support the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Oberman, president of CSUN's alumni association, told the
raucous crowd the association's board of directors, which
represents 130,000 alums, voted unanimously to support an on-campus
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything less than on campus would be unacceptable,'' Oberman
said.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN needs to build a new stadium because the existing one will
be a casualty of the MiniMed biotech facilities. Originally, CSUN
administrators wanted to build a 12,000 to 15,000-seat stadium to
comply with an earlier agreement with the Big Sky Conference. Upon
accepting membership into the Big Sky three years ago, CSUN
promised a new stadium. Conference commissioner Doug Fullerton said
he wanted the stadium on campus and in the 12,000 to 15,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   But in an e-mail to Wilson on Monday, Fullerton said otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe if you were to build an `elegant' 8000-9000 seat
stadium with good press, team and officials' facilities, I believe
the presidents would react favorably,'' Fullerton wrote. ``I would
ask that in the design you allow for future expansion should you
want to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Honda said after the next meeting he will attempt to get a
written recommendation to Wilson within 30 to 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson will make a decision on the site. If it's on the North
Campus, area residents threatened to block construction via the
courts.

SWANN'S RETURN DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Cardinals are going to win Sunday at Kansas City, they
will have to do it again without stellar defensive tackle Eric
Swann, who still isn't ready to play after undergoing arthroscopic
knee surgery four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with our medical people (Monday) and he won't be back
this week,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``We will increase his level
of activity this weekend, and if he responds, he'll be back for the
New York Giants game. If he doesn't, then we'll move it back a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Swann was initially projected to be back for this weekend's
game. &QL;  &QL; 
Wild-card race  &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have the easiest road of the teams they're
competing with for the third wild-card spot, but Tobin is far from
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got five games left, and we're not going to get in the
playoffs by winning six games,'' Tobin said. ``However it shakes
out, we have to win some games. We're aware of our position. We're
not living in a cocoon, or in the stratosphere, or whatever that
thing is they live in _ Biosphere, I guess. Unless we win, it
doesn't matter.'' &QL;  &QL; 
Sidelines &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jake Plummer's three rushing touchdowns in Washington marked the
first time a quarterback has turned the trick in the NFL since
Archie Manning did it in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The offense has scored 66 points in its last six quarters. The
31-point lead in Washington was the largest for the Cardinals in
165 games, and the 45 points are the most since the team beat New
Orleans, 49-31, in 1977, when the offense featured Jim Hart, J.V.
Cain, Terry Metcalf, Jim Otis, Conrad Dobler and Dan Dierdorf.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of cornerback Tommy Knight, who has a hamstring
injury, won't be determined until Wednesday. &QL;  &QL;

UTAH WHIPS SUN DEVILS IN HAWAII 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-UTAH-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ Before playing Utah in the first game of the
Maui Invitational on Monday, Arizona State Coach Rob Evans was
worried because he had only two scorers, forward Bobby Lazor and
guard Eddie House.
</P>
<P>
   Evans had two players score in double figures against the Utes.
But Lazor wasn't one of them. In fact, he had just one field goal
as ASU lost, 65-48, at the Lahaina Civic Center.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Lazor, defended mainly by 6-9 Alex Jensen, made 1
of 11 shots. He didn't score a basket until 2:01 remained and the
game long since settled. Averaging 18 points a game coming in, he
had nine points. House and guard Jason Patton each had 12 for the
Sun Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (1-2) made the game close at halftime, ending the first half
with five straight field goals. But aside from that, the Sun Devils
made 8 of 47 shots and finished at 25 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Utah (2-1), ranked 18th nationally, got 24 points from Andre
Miller, its All-American point guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils fell to the losers' bracket and will play Kansas
State today at 2 p.m. The Wildcats squandered a huge lead in the
second half and lost to Indiana, 71-70, earlier Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first defeat of the year for Kansas State, which has
beaten St. Mary's (Calif.), California State-Fullerton and Division
II Washburn. The Wildcats led by 17 points with 12:58 to go and had
a 12-point lead with 5:09 remaining before falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   Although Evans is a man-to-man kind of guy, the Sun Devils came
out in a zone defense and stayed there. Probably Utah's 4-for-35
shooting from three-point range in its first two games had
something to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for a while. Miller was kept from penetrating, the
inside game was non-existent and the Utes were cold. But then they
started to find the range, and a three-pointer by Jensen put Utah
up, 23-9, with 4:10 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ASU also was content to fire from outside, but the Sun Devils
were shooting blanks. Trailing by 14, they were 4 of 25 from the
field. And when freshman forward Chad Prewitt, starting for the
first time, stepped to the line with 3:29 left in the first half, a
fan yelled, ``Break 10 before the half!''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt made both free throws and, with walk-on Ron DuBois
running the team from the point instead of Alton Mason, and Patton
also providing a spark, ASU got hot. They closed the half with four
straight three-pointers, two by DuBois, and trailed by just three,
28-25, at halftime. What made the comeback even more improbable was
that Lazor was scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   Utah made 6 of 12 three-point attempts in the half, 3 of 9
inside the arc. ASU was 5 of 11 from three-point range before
halftime, but was just 4 of 20 on closer shots.
</P>
<P>
   Lazor finally scored with 15:37 left in the game two free throws
to make it 33-31 Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils came within one when Patton made a free throw.
But Jensen scored on a feed from Miller, and Miller drove to the
basket in front of a passel of NBA personnel to put the Utes up by
five with 11:44 to go. &QL;

HEALTH STUDY REPORTS 10% INCREASE IN AIDS INFECTIONS WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grim new figures on the global AIDS epidemic show the disease
tightening its grip throughout the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber update issued in advance of World AIDS Day next
week, health authorities at the United Nations and World Health
Organization estimated 33.4 million people worldwide will be living
with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That's a 10 percent increase from a year ago, taking into
account 5.8 million new infections in 1998 and a record 2.5 million
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Every minute of every day, 11 people are now becoming infected
with HIV somewhere around the world. AIDS is moving rapidly into
rural areas on the Asian continent, destroying many African
societies and claiming increasing numbers of women and children
where ever the disease strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is continuing spread of HIV nearly everywhere,'' said
Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, one of the agencies
sponsoring the new report.
</P>
<P>
   Once regarded in Western countries as a disease that affected
mostly gay men and intravenous drug users, in most of the world it
is now steamrolling through mainstream society _ spreading to women
with no risk factor other than having sex with their husbands, who
then pass the virus on to their children.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 2.1 million women were newly infected, according to
the latest estimates. Women now account for 43 percent of all those
living with HIV, up from 41 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 590,000 children under age 15 were counted among
those who contracted the virus in 1998, or one-tenth of the total.
Young people between the ages of 10 to 24 account for half of all
new infections.
</P>
<P>
   During a telephone briefing Monday from London, Piot noted that
about 100 million young people become sexually active each year.
And an increasing number will become HIV carriers without realizing
it.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures take note of the dramatic drop in
AIDS-related deaths occurring in the United States and Western
Europe as a result of combination drug therapies. But the drugs are
far too costly to make a difference in the many poor nations of
Africa and Asia, where AIDS has become a catastrophe of
mind-boggling scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The epidemic has not been overcome anywhere,'' the new report
concludes. ``Virtually every country in the world has seen new
infections in 1998, and the epidemic is frankly out of control in
many places.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the wealthy nations that have seen AIDS deaths decline have
little cause to celebrate, officials said, noting that the
proportion of the population infected with HIV is higher than ever.
That's because people already infected are living longer, while the
number of new infections _ 44,000 in the United States this year _
has shown no sign of decline, showing an especially ominous rise
among African Americans and other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Sub-Saharan Africa, the epicenter of the global AIDS disaster,
accounts for 70 percent of all new HIV infections and 80 percent of
deaths attributed to the virus in 1998. A shocking 21 million
adults and 1.5 million children on the African continent are now
infected.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities estimate AIDS is responsible for roughly 5,500
funerals per day in Africa, ruining families along with hopes for
economic development. In countries such as Botswana, Namibia and
Swaziland, 20 percent to 26 percent of all those between the ages
of 15 and 49 have AIDS or are carrying the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Piot offered scant hopes for any improvement next year in the
global AIDS picture, despite prospects for fewer deaths in the
United States and Western Europe. Instead, he predicted a shifting
pattern of infections as the virus spreads into new territories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasingly, the spotlight is on the spread of HIV through
the Asian continent,'' the report concluded. ``While rates remain
low relative to some other regions, well over 7 million Asians are
already infected, and HIV is clearly beginning to spread in earnest
through the vast populations of India and China.''

of communal life, there is a note of solitude or wildness that must
be struck from time to time in order for a certain harmony to be
maintained. ``

 &HT;    Youngster makes sacrifice, urges others to also donate to
victims
 &HT;    By Dale Huffman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Chris Anderson, 11, of Butler Twp. was watching
television one Sunday morning when the images of those victimized
and killed by Hurricane Mitch caught his eye and his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Chris had been saving $100 his grandmother gave him on his
birthday in August to purchase snowboarding equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chris saw those pictures from Central America, he came to
us and said he wanted to help,'' said Terry Anderson, his mother.
``He collected his birthday money and he didn't stop there.''
</P>
<P>
   The mother said she was asked to match the $100, which she did.
Then he asked his father and his grandparents to make a match also.
</P>
<P>
   When it was totaled, it meant one child in the Miami Valley had
sent $500 to the American Red Cross to help the survivors of the
hurricane-ravaged areas of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing what this boy has done,'' said David Petreman,
who teaches Spanish at Wright State University and who has visited
Central America on several occasions. ``For someone his age to
think in terms of helping others, and making a personal sacrifice
says a lot about his character. It is a wonderful thing and is
heart-warming.''
</P>
<P>
   The donation from young Chris Anderson was channeled into a fund
for the Red Cross that Petreman had started on campus shortly after
the disaster. The boy's mother works as an associate director for
informational services in the university library and heard of
Petreman's fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students, faculty, so many have rallied to donate,'' Petreman
said. ``Money does not come easy for students. But I passed the hat
in my classes, and I was surprised how generous everyone was. But
the gesture from this 11-year-old is really what impressed us
most.''
</P>
<P>
   Petreman has turned over $1,600 to the Dayton chapter of the
American Red Cross. Chris, who is a fifth-grader at St. Rita's
School in Harrison Twp., said he was moved to donate his nest egg
after he saw ``this picture of some people on the ground. They were
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought that I really didn't need a snowboard that bad.
I would share my birthday money. You know, it makes you feel
good.''
</P>

 &HT;    Shysters share shady trait with quick-to-sue folk: No ethics
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ It was like a fast-forward of an old Burt
Reynolds road movie. ``Hold onto your backside!'' my son shouted as
he floored the accelerator and whipped us onto the shoulder of the
road. ``Oh ----, Mom!'' he cursed as he gaped into the rearview
mirror in disbelief. ``He's going to nail us!''
</P>
<P>
   Within a split second, there was a sickening jolt followed
immediately by the gut-wrenching sound of metal and fiberglass
locked in their death throes. My beloved old Bronco had been chewed
up and spit out by a Pepsi truck on a congested interstate just
outside of Columbus. In an instant, my four-wheeled friend had
become a highway statistic.
</P>
<P>
   Dumbfounded, my son and I stared at one another as the Bronco,
with us strapped into it like two testing ground dummies, careened
to a screeching halt alongside the jammed up highway. We sat there
mute, waiting for the dust to settle. ``I really thought we were
going upside down,'' he said in awe. ``You OK?''
</P>
<P>
   I nodded dumbly. ``How about you?'' He swiveled his head a
couple of times, tentatively, and declared himself fit to walk the
hundred or so yards up the side of the road to the next wreck (the
one that had bottled up traffic in the first place) to ask the
officers to lend a hand.
</P>
<P>
   While we waited, we made a few crummy jokes about whiplash,
invisible back injuries, and maybe even the possibility of
developing a nervous tic. We had a good chuckle and let it go,
savoring the fact that we were alive and unhurt and might still be
able to make it to the east side cigar store before the Cuban
</P>
<P>
   lady stopped handrolling the cigars my son wanted to buy for his
father's birthday present.
</P>
<P>
   That was Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon and a hundred miles to the north, an odd
scenario had begun to unfold. My front porch mail basket was
overflowing with letters whose return addresses read like a Who's
Who of Columbus law firms. Am I being sued, I wondered, for getting
in the way of a Pepsi truck?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. It didn't take a crate of pop to fall on me before I
realized that each of these impressive letterheads had a copy of my
accident report enclosed. I wondered: Does the term ``ambulance
chaser'' apply here?
</P>
<P>
   The first letter informed me that according to the Columbus
Police Department Accident Records, I had recently been involved in
an automobile accident. Hell, I already knew that and had the mess
in my garage to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   His firm, he wrote, offers ``FREE'' initial consultation to
discuss my rights and to handle my personal injury case on a
contingent fee basis, but added (in parentheses) that even if I
didn't get any money, I was still responsible for his expenses. Now
this kind of says to me that should my neck brace and pathetic limp
fail to soften up the judge, I still owe Perry Mason some bucks for
checking it out.
</P>
<P>
   Another legal beagle offered to talk to me for an hour, FREE, in
order to discuss my injuries and the money damages to which I might
be entitled: personal injury, pain, suffering, medical bills,
property damage, and lost wages to name a few. Now this kind of
confuses me because right there on the accident report attached to
the back of his letter, it clearly states that ``A'' (that's me)
and ``B'' (my son) were ``5'' (not injured) and ``1'' (apparently
normal).
</P>
<P>
   The report continues to explain that the occupants of the chewed
up Bronco were wearing seatbelts and were not suspected of being
under the influence of alcohol or any other funny stuff that might
have caused us to drive onto the interstate looking to turn
ourselves into roadkill.
</P>
<P>
   Cut and dried. There was an accident. No one was hurt. And as
long as Pepsi Cola fixes my Bronco, I'm happy. The last thing I'm
looking for is legal pettifoggery to muddy the waters.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I've developed a real attitude about folks who
sue other folks for everything including when the neighbor's dog
tips over their garbage can. I blame it on a lack of backbone and a
nonexistent code of ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Add shysters to the list.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Got your eyes set on a special toy for the little
ones?
</P>
<P>
   If so, it pays to shop early.
</P>
<P>
   Several makers of high-tech toys said there are limited supplies
(did you really expect them to say otherwise?) but the early birds
should not have much of a problem.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lego's Mindstorms robotics building system can be
found in Toys ``R'' Us, Target, Media Play and Zany Brainy. Buyers
can order the set directly by calling 1-800-453-4652.
</P>
<P>
   There's already a run on Furby, the $29.99 furry interactive
creature that is causing quite a stir in toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   If you know the toy you want, it also pays to visit the toy
manufacturer's Web site for more information. Some sites even let
you play games online.

 &HT;    Toys that play back
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forget G.I. Joe.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't send cars roaring down the streets of Los Angeles
at speeds exceeding 200 miles an hour or help Crash Bandicoot
collect crystals to save the world, then it probably won't make
Alexander Diaz's Christmas list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably has 20 CD-ROMs at home for his computer,'' said
Alexander's dad, Rene Diaz, owner of Atlanta-based Diaz Wholesale &AMP;
Manufacturing Co. ``He's very in tune with what's cool. Nowadays,
almost everything is high tech, and he likes interactive toys.''
</P>
<P>
   For many kids like 6-year-old Alexander, what's cool is whatever
is hot in the latest video games and high-tech toys, which include
everything from Mattel's $99.99 My Interactive Pooh that can be
programmed to say a child's name and ``remember'' her birthday, to
Playmates' Amazing Amy, a wonder doll that can tell which clothes
she should have on based on the time of day and the foods she wants
to eat. (Please don't try to feed her a banana when she said she
was thirsty, and don't try to give her breakfast at dinner time.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's kids live in a time when Dad has a beeper and Mom has
a cellular phone,'' said Christopher Byrne, a toy industry expert
and contributing editor of Playthings Marketwatch. ``Technology is
part of their universe. Technology represents the first major
innovation in the toy industry since World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand for technologically advanced toys is sweeping the
$22.6 billion toy industry _ so much so that once-popular offerings
like board games are experiencing a downturn. For the first six
months of 1998, sales of board games were down 15 percent from the
same period a year earlier, according to NPD Group, a research
firm. The pressure not to be defeated by a microchip is so intense
that toy makers even have CD-ROM versions of ``Candy Land,'' ``The
Game of Life'' and ``Monopoly,'' which also has a hand-held
version.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing Amy, for instance, has touch and resistance sensors and
a microprocessor that tells her when to use more than 10,000
phrases. She also has about 500k of computer memory.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest toys this season is the gremlin-like Furby, a
$29.99 virtual pet that responds to touch, light, other Furbies
and, best of all, has a regular sleep pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hampton, Furby's inventor, said he got the idea after
viewing digital versions of virtual pets.
</P>
<P>
   His virtual pet, created for Tiger Electronics, is soft, furry,
and speaks ``Furbish'' and English.
</P>
<P>
   Furby interacts with his environment through some simple rules
of programming Hampton calls ``emergent behavior.'' Furby's toy
technology is possible because the creature features internal
processing power just a bit above the old Apple II, Hampton said.
``Compared to a Pentium 333 it isn't very fast, but for a toy
selling for about $30 that's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that old staple Legos has gone high tech.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company expects its $200 Mindstorms robotics
building system, which is sold in toy and electronic stores, to be
among the season's most popular offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Mindstorms (which has its own Web site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .legomindstorms.com) was developed with cooperation from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and targets kids ages 11 and
up. Youngsters build robots using a microcomputer and Lego pieces.
The creations can move and carry objects.
</P>
<P>
   Other high-tech offerings this season include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbie Photo Designer Digital Camera (Mattel, $69.99). Girls
can use a digital camera to take photos and see them instantly on
their computers. Away from the computer, the camera stores up to
six photos at a time.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Totally Twister'' (Hasbro, $24.99). A new take on the old
``Twister'' game. Players can use this hand-held electronic game
that has a ``cool'' voice and soundtrack to twist, turn and touch
colored buttons.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Rugrats Movie Game'' (Nintendo

 &HT;    Life should be a little more like mathematics: certain
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ How can 24 hours last a lifetime? It happens every
time you're waiting for medical test results.
</P>
<P>
   We've all been there. Unexpected symptoms. The call to the
doctor. The round of tests. The wait.
</P>
<P>
   Possibilities _ all dire _ race through our minds, doing laps
with our emotions.
</P>
<P>
   I spent just such a 24 hours recently. That morning, I had
called my doctor and begged the nurse to fit me into his busy day's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll wait as long as it takes,'' I told her. And I did. It was
worth it. Better than sitting at home waiting with only my own
scary thoughts for company.
</P>
<P>
   This day turned out to be a good one for me. The doctor had
reassuring news. None of the dire possibilities I had been
imagining were going to come true, it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite our theology, I don't think any of us can help but feel
we've somehow dodged the bullet in these situations. This time,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the medical office and walking through the parking lot
toward my car in the gathering dusk, I looked down and saw a
child's math paper on the asphalt. Tire tread marks crisscrossed
it.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at those simple, neat rows of addition and subtraction
problems, I nearly burst into tears.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how I longed at that moment to be 8 years old, when my
biggest concern was the sum of 27 and 14 _ to have the answers to
all my problems march in orderly rows across a white paper.
</P>
<P>
   I've heard it said that mathematicians, in the order and
certainty of their equations, can discover the beauty and truth of
life. In fact, there's a little-advertised movie out titled Pi that
addresses this issue.
</P>
<P>
   I haven't seen it, but I'm told it's an odd, disturbing film
with more deep meaning than I'll ever catch. One of the
protagonist's premises is this: All of life is reflected in
patterns that can be expressed in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at that smudged sheet of elementary math problems, I
could almost relate to that. Don't we all long for a world where
two plus two always adds up to four? It doesn't. Not when one day
you're healthy as a horse and the next you're lying on an examining
table wearing a hankie-sized piece of cotton wondering if you'll
survive the chemotherapy. That doesn't add up.
</P>
<P>
   One of our sons is fascinated with math. One night he showed us
Sierpinski's Triangle, where addition creates patterns that form
never-ending triangles, into infinity. Another time, he pulled up
fractals on the computer screen to show us how the patterns repeat
themselves endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   I remember one day he came home from an English essay test
totally stressed out, even though he knew the subject well.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter?'' I asked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so open,'' he sighed heavily. ``The answer can be
anything or nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   I know the feeling. The answer to my medical test that day could
have been anything or nothing at all. I didn't like the odds. And,
like an essay answer, I had no control over the teacher's grading
process.
</P>
<P>
   I've never particularly appreciated math. Typically, I don't
like foregone conclusions. There's no fun in that to me. No
mystery. No adventure. If you know how to arrive at the answer, why
make the trip?
</P>
<P>
   But then, on days like this one, I look at a dirty math paper
and it reduces me to tears. Sometimes, you like for things to add
up right.

 &HT;    In the company of dogs: A shelter story
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As Ace lingers, his tricks become less
dependable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sit up, Ace!'' commands Penny Davis, the gentle animal-care
provider who has taken a bit of a shine to this dog. He knows it;
he paws at her knee and wags his tail. ``When he came in,'' she
says, ``he was great at this stuff. He knew all sorts of tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   He's getting rusty from disuse.
</P>
<P>
   Ace is wearing plenty of identification. He has numbered tags
from Illinois in addition to a custom-made tag with his name on it.
His owners have been contacted, and they said a relative will be in
to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   The staff knows bits and pieces of his story, for it's rare that
a dog comes into the Montgomery County Animal Shelter with tags.
It's almost unheard of for a dog to come in with tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, nobody comes for Ace. So he waits.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7896: Mixed breed; brown, white and red. Stray, picked up in
Dayton, Oct. 7. Female, not spayed.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted Oct. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The dogs' stories begin in the middle, the beginnings all
mysteries with few clues. The end is often brutal and swift: Death.
</P>
<P>
   But often _ just often enough, perhaps _ the end is a fairy
tale's happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   For every person who comes to the Montgomery County Animal
Shelter to look, in vain, for their lost pet, there's a reunion
that has the whole staff smiling. For every dog dropped off by an
owner tired of its shedding, there's a new family formed. Or so it
seems. The balance may be made only in the heads of the shelter
workers, who've seen it all and then some, but who live for the
ugly mutt finally found by his lady, who never gave up; for the
big, black chow who lingered in the adoption ward for almost three
months before being taken home by a shelter volunteer; for the
puppies who find boys. For the reunions.
</P>
<P>
   Among the statistics of dogs arriving and dying, there are happy
stories. In a perfect world, every story would be a happy story.
But at the shelter, the staff will settle for the few that come
their way _ very relatively few, in the grand scheme of things, but
just enough, perhaps, to keep them reporting for work.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8013: Poodle mix; gray and black. Stray, picked up in West
Carrollton, Oct. 11. Male, neutered.
</P>
<P>
   Owner claimed Oct. 13
</P>
<P>
   Where am I?
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Debbie Rogers drove for miles, looking. Searching.
</P>
<P>
   Where are they?
</P>
<P>
   Best guess is that he chased something out of their big yard and
just got lost, being relatively new to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm.
</P>
<P>
   Smokey was given to the Rogers by a family member who couldn't
keep him any longer. They'd had him for just a few months. Debbie
was already deeply in love, and now the big dog was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove for two days looking and looking,'' she says, sitting
in her wheelchair outside the shelter on a Monday morning at 10:15.
Debbie knew: in 15 minutes they'd let her in to look for her dog.
``He has to be in there,'' she said. ``He just has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 10:30 a.m., and the shelter doors open to the public.
There's a line of people waiting to get inside, all there for one
reason: To find a dog. Their dog, be it the dog they know well or a
dog they've yet to meet.
</P>
<P>
   He thumps his tail when Penny comes to his cage. She's talking
to him, soothing him with words he's heard before. Good dog. Good
boy. There you go, boy. She hooks him to a rope fastened to a wall,
where he stands and watches while Penny cleans his cage. Then he's
led back inside the cage. He's still wagging his tail. There's
fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10:30 a.m. and the doors are just opening, but truth is,
the shelter never sleeps. The building is staffed 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. There are dogs and cats to feed, cages to clean
and clean again. There is paperwork. There are phones to answer,
emergencies to attend. Injured animal _ the shelter responds.
Police need assistance _ the shelter responds. Dog bites man _ the
shelter responds.
</P>
<P>
   When you call about the strange shepherd loping down your
street, the shelter will respond. But you'll have to get in line.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows his name. He sits, lies down, gets back up, barks a
little. He wags his tail when people walk by, looking at them with
curiosity. With hope? He's been there since Saturday. It's Monday
morning, and he waits.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6582: Poodle; black and gray. Stray, picked up in Trotwood,
Aug. 22. Male, not neutered. Note on file: Dog cowers in cage when
approached, timid.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the adoption area, a glass-walled room of cages stacked
three high, would be full of new dogs ready to be looked over by
the interested public. Usually, a vet would have been in early to
check out the animals who've sat out their waiting period _ three
days for an unlicensed dog, 14 days for those with tags. Once their
time has passed, the dogs belong to Montgomery County, to the
shelter, which decides their fate according to hard and fast rules
and often-bent guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But this Monday the vet was unable to make it. This Monday, the
dogs will wait a little longer in their cages, being fed and cared
for to the best of the stretched staff's ability. Maybe a vet will
come Wednesday _ the next scheduled vet-check day.
</P>
<P>
   Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, for an hour or two, contracted
vets come and evaluate the dogs' health. The public knows that
these are the best days to come for a new pet. People know that by
10:30 a.m. on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, the stock is
replenished with dogs who are ready to go home. But not to the home
they knew; that home, if there was one, is lost to these dogs.
</P>
<P>
   These dogs need a new home. With someone, with anyone.
</P>
<P>
   He's in the back, in the general population with the others
who've been captured or released to the shelter by their rightful
owners who don't want, or can't keep, or got tired of them. He got
lost and he was caught, brought to this place that's smelly and
loud. He sits and he waits.
</P>
<P>
   The shelter is a nondescript, dark-brown building that squats in
a row of industrial complexes on Webster Street, just inside the
Vandalia city line. It's one of the three main Montgomery County
agencies that deal with the welfare of stray animals, but it's the
only one that has to. It's a law-enforcement agency, created to
enforce Section 955 of the Ohio Revised Code, the law that requires
dogs to be confined, licensed, and controlled. Its territory
stretches from Englewood to Farmersville and all points in between.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 9,013 dogs were ``processed'' by the shelter. The
largest percentage _ 5,688 _ are dogs caught, though the preferred
term is ``rescued,'' by animal-control officers driving
radio-equipped vans. But into the mix add dogs captured in
municipalities with their own officers _ Kettering, Miamisburg,
West Carrollton, Trotwood, Moraine _ and the dogs brought to the
shelter by their owners _ 940 in 1997 _ for reasons both
understandable and unconscionable.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8012: Mixed breed; tan, black and white. Stray, picked up in
Dayton, Oct. 11. Female, not spayed.
</P>
<P>
   Adopted Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 720 dogs were adopted into new homes. Last year,
5,547 dogs were killed, then frozen, then burned into ash.
</P>
<P>
   He sits in his cage. There's nothing else to do.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Smokey, but nobody here knows it.
</P>
<P>
   And he waits.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10:30 a.m. and the Rogers are led inside the kennel by
Penny Davis. They maneuver down the narrow aisles between the dog
runs and the dog cages. Debbie Rogers strains to see each dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he is, there he is,'' she says, finally, relief flooding
her. ``I knew he had to be in here. There was no where else he
could be.''
</P>
<P>
   There she is. There he is. There they are. Good!
</P>
<P>
   ``Smokey, Smokey. How are you, boy?'' Debbie Rogers looks up at
her husband. There are tears on her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks a little thinner, don't you think?'' says Frank,
scratching his dog's head through the bars of the cage. Behind him,
Davis gives her eyes a slight roll. The shelter workers hear that a
lot: ``You didn't feed my dog. His cage isn't clean. He's all
dirty.'' They hear these things, but they also hear a lot of
``Thank yous,'' through the tears of grateful owners reclaiming
loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Debbie Rogers are sent to the lobby to pay their fine
and buy Smokey a license, which they happily do. They're all
reunited in front of the shelter, and it's hard to tell who's more
eager to leave the place _ the people or their dog.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6788: German shepherd; black and tan. Released by owner to
shelter because of behavior, Aug. 29. Male, not neutered. Note on
file: Aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Aug. 31
</P>
<P>
   She's a striking animal, typical of huskies who look at you with
one brown eye, one blue. She was running along the highway near
Lyons Road in Miami Twp., and the traffic down there didn't leave
her much of a chance. But she made it into the minivan of the
Armstrong family who, says the mom, ``fell in love on the ride
over'' to the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The Armstrongs put a Finders Request memo on ``their'' dog, this
young husky, meaning that if the dog isn't claimed, they would get
first chance to adopt her.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, they got a call. No one had come during the
dog's sanctioned holding period. She'd made it through vet check.
She was about to be put into the general adoption population,
unless . . . . Were they serious about adopting her themselves?
</P>
<P>
   The Armstrongs, mother Annette, father Bill, with sons Tyler, 5,
and baby Jack, piled in the van for the trip back to the shelter.
</P>
<P>
   The husky was waiting, happy to see them, happy to see anybody.
She was a young, vigorous and gangly puppy. She was beautiful, and
she was going to be a handful.
</P>
<P>
   Annette listened carefully as David Vollette explained the
basics of house training, obedience, food. He stressed the
importance of spaying their new pet, just as soon as they could.
She listened, as Sadie, or Magic (the name was a matter of debate)
bounced around the boys.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler loved her. From a distance.
</P>
<P>
   As they got back in the van and headed for home, Annette smiled
ruefully and said, ``We always said we'd never have a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody counted on the husky pup with one brown and one blue eye
saved from the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6997: Shepherd mix; brown and black. Stray, picked up in
Dayton Sept. 4. Male, not neutered. Injured, left rear leg.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Sept. 9
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Smith's huge laugh echoes through the offices; her
throaty voice resonates over the phone. She minces no words, she
plays no games. She comes on strong and she doesn't let up. Sit and
listen, she'll do most of the talking.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is the director of the shelter. She runs a staff,
constantly short, of about 30 people. She runs it well, so well
that she spends a great deal of time out in the community speaking
to any group that wants her.
</P>
<P>
   She's assisted by two senior managers: Donna Wilson, who
oversees the workers who stay inside the Shelter building; and Bob
Sexton, who's in charge of the animal-control officers working the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   She loves to talk to schools, where she used to be accompanied
by her dog, Buddy, until someone told her that if that dog bit
anybody she'd be in big, big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, I didn't take a dog at all,'' she says. ``But
people kept bugging me about it . . . . Here all this time, I
thought it was me they were inviting.''
</P>
<P>
   So she chose a nice-looking shepherd mix from one day's take at
the shelter. She named the dog Shiloh, and had her licensed to the
county commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't know if they know that,'' she grins, punctuating
with her trademark wink. ``Her full name's Shiloh Montgomery.''
</P>
<P>
   It's almost laughable, the idea of any dog of Stephanie's being
a biter. She abides neither growl nor sneer, and takes every curled
lip for what it is: A warning.
</P>
<P>
   She will budge not at all on the shelter's one hard and fast
rule: Any dog that shows any sign of aggression is dead. Period. No
debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always saying, `Look at their circumstances. Give
them a chance.' And sure, of course! These dogs are stressed _
majorly stressed. Who knows what's happened to them? Who knows
where they came from? If people treated me the way some of these
dogs have been treated, I'd be biting people. You'd better believe
I'd be biting.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith turns, looks around at the dogs under her care.
</P>
<P>
   ``But look at all these dogs, in the same circumstances, that
are still wagging their tails, happy to see everybody.'' That day
at the shelter, there are dozens such dogs, smiling and wagging all
over the place.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of temperamentally sound animals, and Smith
has to be sure that any dog she places in a person's home will not
be a danger to them.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters have been sued over adopted dogs who bite, she says.
``By the time a dog leaves here, it's been exposed to every
possible kind of person. Black people, white people, men, women . .
. . We are as sure as we can be that the dog is temperamentally
sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Take Tripod, the three-legged rottweiler hopping around the
clinic. The missing leg is a mystery, and so it shall remain.
Abuse? Accident? Animal trap? No one knows but Tripod, and she's
not talking.
</P>
<P>
   But she's wagging her tail, or what the tail-cropper left of it,
and she's smiling. Scratch her ears, she smiles some more. (She was
adopted soon after.)
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie saunters through the kennel. She stops at the cage of
a young, brown mutt. She bends over, talking baby talk and
scratching him under his chin. He wiggles in ecstasy; Stephanie
drops a biscuit in his cage. Shelter workers are full of biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way under any circumstance this dog is going to
bite someone. Just look at him,'' she offers her cheek for a kiss,
which comes immediately in the form of a short little lick. ``He's
a little sweetheart.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 7894: Shepherd mix; black, tan and white. Male, not
neutered. Released to shelter Oct. 7 by resident who found dog four
months ago, can't keep dog any longer. Dog has behavior problems.
Note on file: Fear biter, very scared. Red dot.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Oct. 8.
</P>
<P>
   He was a messy old mop of a dog, dirty and matted befitting one
who came from the streets. That's all they knew, that he came from
the street. A street in Montgomery County.
</P>
<P>
   The day he passed vet check, the very day he went into the
adoption ward, a family with two little girls gave him the
once-over. The twice-over. But the magic wasn't there, the
connection wasn't made and he went back in his cage. He didn't
mind, especially when the woman came and took him out again _ this
time for a shave and a haircut in a big, warm tub.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7017: Poodle; black. Stray, picked up in Dayton,Sept. 5.
Male, not neutered. Note on file: Did not pass vet check.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Newly shorn and looking good, he was put back in the cage for
public appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   And the Benningtons came along. They knew what they were doing,
having adopted, ``oh, I can't begin to remember how many'' dogs
there, says Connie Bennington.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted a dog, mainly for their other dog, another shelter
find named Cody who, Connie believed, was lonely. They've got
plenty of room _ a fenced-in acre on their Dayton land _ and an
easygoing attitude: ``Our dogs sleep on the bed with us,'' Connie
says.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8011: Labrador mix; black, brown and white. Stray, picked up
in Clayton Oct. 11. Male, not neutered.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   It took Cody about a day to get used to the newcomer, whom the
Benningtons named Shadd.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear he'd never had people food, and we know he'd
never had much attention. We'd pick him up and kiss him and snuggle
with him _ he just didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's a big baby. He's rotten,'' says Connie. ``He and Cody
play like they've known each other forever.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 7892: Chihuahua mix; black. Stray.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8000: Pit bull mix; black &AMP; white. Stray.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   No. 6001: Chow; cinnamon. Stray.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Neutered and made fully shot-worthy by the Benningtons' vet,
who's grown used to their shelter mutts, Shadd is letting his hair
grow out, spending his days outside with Cody when the weather
permits. It's a dream life for a dog, and it certainly was a change
for Shadd, who came from nowhere into into the land of enchantment
and a new best friend named Cody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' says Connie, ``what a little bit of love and
attention can do. This dog, he's a stinker.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiles.
</P>
<P>
   No. 2557: Chow; black and red. Stray, picked up in Harrison Twp.
April 13. Male, not neutered. Note on file: Ear infection. Very
friendly dog.
</P>
<P>
   Euthanized April 16.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody came for Ace. But he stayed healthy during the two-week
holding period mandatory for dogs with tags. He stayed healthy and
he stayed happy. After passing his vet check, Ace went up for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   He was there when Del Thacker came in with his adult daughter,
who was looking for a dog of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me I had to see this dog,'' Thacker recalls. ``I
don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a match, and Del, who wanted a bigger dog with none of
the housetraining troubles of puppies, adopted Ace that day.
</P>
<P>
   Thacker works a swing shift, and Ace, he says, ``just rolls with
it.'' Nothing's chewed, no ``accidents,'' no trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real laid-back, that's what I like about him,'' says
Thacker, who heard sketchy stories of Ace's police-training
background from the shelter staff. ``I really don't know (where he
came from). Here he's just Ace. Big Ace, that's what I call him at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Home. Ace's home. That says it all.

 &HT;    The other Tom Wolfe
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The watch is mercifully ended. Tom Wolfe has not just
left the building but skipped town. The Second Coming, if it comes,
will not be more celebrated than Wolfe's stay in Atlanta. He was
everywhere, and everywhere lionized. From the Piedmont Driving Club
to the Atlanta History Center, the author of ``A Man in Full'' was
the man of the moment, a Southerner who was more than another
swizzle stick in Manhattan's literary life.
</P>
<P>
   The South treats its native sons better these days. It has
always loved them like no one else, but an earlier Tom Wolfe knew
how it could also turn on them. Had there been a watch for that Tom
Wolfe, it would not have been to celebrate him. It's easy to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   In October of 1929, on the eve of the Great Crash, sons and
daughters of immigrants sat in a New York City college classroom.
They were waiting for their eccentric English instructor, who
everyone knew was writing a book. Momentarily, one of them recalled
years later, their disheveled 6-foot-6 teacher came ``busting into
class, clutching a smashed hat to one side of his bosom and a
brightly jacketed copy of his new book over his heaving heart.''
Thomas Wolfe had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Homeward, Angel'' was published when he was not yet 30
years old. William Faulkner's ``The Sound and the Fury'' and Ernest
Hemingway's ``A Farewell to Arms'' were published in the same year,
but in the fall of 1929 Thomas Wolfe was bigger than either and
bigger than Tom Wolfe, too.
</P>
<P>
   But no parades awaited him in his hometown. A local librarian
refused to order Wolfe's novel for her library, her stand for
decency applauded by a citizen who wrote: ``Do not let any
influence persuade you to let his buckets of night soil sit on your
shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, I stopped in Asheville, N.C., and drove by the
Thomas Wolfe home, where I had made a pilgrimage years earlier. His
detractors thought him unreadable in his own day, and he is unread
in ours. But at least one of his biographers, David Herbert Donald
of Harvard University, found in Wolfe's fiction ``a remarkably full
social history of the United States during the first four decades
of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Many would make a similar claim for the contemporary Tom Wolfe,
a chronicler of our vanities and ambitions. No one would think to
compare the two beyond that, either as men or as writers. One is a
dapper darling of the modern media; the other was a brooding giant
of overreaching ambition, staggering vitality and an insatiable
lust for rich women. More than anything, he was a man isolated
within himself.
</P>
<P>
   The most one could say, now that today's Tom Wolfe has two
novels under his belt, is that they write very big books. In Thomas
Wolfe's case, they were so big that the endlessly patient Maxwell
Perkins said editing him was like holding on to the fin of a
plunging whale. When Perkins agreed to take him on, he had
scribbled a manuscript twice the length of ``War and Peace,'' and
still wasn't finished.
</P>
<P>
   In the life of that Thomas Wolfe, there was the pathos of a
tragic figure. ``You are one of the rocks to which my life is
anchored,'' Wolfe wrote Perkins once. True as it was, the
relationship would rupture in hurt feelings, like his affair with
Aline Bernstein, a married woman 18 years older. Together, they
were _ in Andrew Turnbull's words _ ``the twin engines that got
Wolfe's heavy plane off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Both endured and forgave Wolfe's rages and furies, much as
Asheville would forgive him his heresies. In September of 1938,
nine years after it was ready to hang him, the town stood at
attention for the funeral of its prodigal son, dead at 38 from
tuberculosis. The First Presbyterian Church resounded with hymns,
and the Rev. R.F. Campbell read from Wolfe's ``Of Time and the
River.''
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier, Aline Bernstein had wanted to come when it became
apparent that Wolfe would not make it, the great vitality draining
rapidly away. Maxwell Perkins, fearing her appearance would upset
him, dissuaded her. Perkins _ ``the silent friend of Tom's
spirit,'' as Andrew Turnbull called him _ was an honorary
pallbearer but stayed in the background, as he always had. At the
graveside, he stood off by himself in a grove of maple and oak, a
line from ``King Lear'' running through his head: ``He hates them
that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   This forgotten Thomas Wolfe was on the rack all his life,
Perkins believed, and, had he lived, ever would be.
</P>
<P>
   His last letter, written from the hospital, was to Perkins. All
his trust in his old friend was restored, and his affection with
it, and he thanked him ``1,000 times.'' Touched, Perkins showed the
letter to a few intimates. ``Max,'' one of them said, ``You and
Aline made Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Perkins said, ``Tom had the wit to find us.''

 &HT;    The other Tom Wolfe
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The watch is mercifully ended. Tom Wolfe has not just
left the building but skipped town. The Second Coming, if it comes,
will not be more celebrated than Wolfe's stay in Atlanta. He was
everywhere, and everywhere lionized. From the Piedmont Driving Club
to the Atlanta History Center, the author of ``A Man in Full'' was
the man of the moment, a Southerner who was more than another
swizzle stick in Manhattan's literary life.
</P>
<P>
   The South treats its native sons better these days. It has
always loved them like no one else, but an earlier Tom Wolfe knew
how it could also turn on them. Had there been a watch for that Tom
Wolfe, it would not have been to celebrate him. It's easy to
forget.
</P>
<P>
   In October of 1929, on the eve of the Great Crash, sons and
daughters of immigrants sat in a New York City college classroom.
They were waiting for their eccentric English instructor, who
everyone knew was writing a book. Momentarily, one of them recalled
years later, their disheveled 6-foot-6 teacher came ``busting into
class, clutching a smashed hat to one side of his bosom and a
brightly jacketed copy of his new book over his heaving heart.''
Thomas Wolfe had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Homeward, Angel'' was published when he was not yet 30
years old. William Faulkner's ``The Sound and the Fury'' and Ernest
Hemingway's ``A Farewell to Arms'' were published in the same year,
but in the fall of 1929 Thomas Wolfe was bigger than either and
bigger than Tom Wolfe, too.
</P>
<P>
   But no parades awaited him in his hometown. A local librarian
refused to order Wolfe's novel for her library, her stand for
decency applauded by a citizen who wrote: ``Do not let any
influence persuade you to let his buckets of night soil sit on your
shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, I stopped in Asheville, N.C., and drove by the
Thomas Wolfe home, where I had made a pilgrimage years earlier. His
detractors thought him unreadable in his own day, and he is unread
in ours. But at least one of his biographers, David Herbert Donald
of Harvard University, found in Wolfe's fiction ``a remarkably full
social history of the United States during the first four decades
of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Many would make a similar claim for the contemporary Tom Wolfe,
a chronicler of our vanities and ambitions. No one would think to
compare the two beyond that, either as men or as writers. One is a
dapper darling of the modern media; the other was a brooding giant
of overreaching ambition, staggering vitality and an insatiable
lust for rich women. More than anything, he was a man isolated
within himself.
</P>
<P>
   The most one could say, now that today's Tom Wolfe has two
novels under his belt, is that they write very big books. In Thomas
Wolfe's case, they were so big that the endlessly patient Maxwell
Perkins said editing him was like holding on to the fin of a
plunging whale. When Perkins agreed to take him on, he had
scribbled a manuscript twice the length of ``War and Peace,'' and
still wasn't finished.
</P>
<P>
   In the life of that Thomas Wolfe, there was the athos of a
tragic figure. ``You are one of the rocks to which my life is
anchored,'' Wolfe wrote Perkins once. True as it was, the
relationship would rupture in hurt feelings, like his affair with
Aline Bernstein, a married woman 18 years older. Together, they
were _ in Andrew Turnbull's words _ ``the twin engines that got
Wolfe's heavy plane off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Both endured and forgave Wolfe's rages and furies, much as
Asheville would forgive him his heresies. In September of 1938,
nine years after it was ready to hang him, the town stood at
attention for the funeral of its prodigal son, dead at 38 from
tuberculosis. The First Presbyterian Church resounded with hymns,
and the Rev. R.F. Campbell read from Wolfe's ``Of Time and the
River.''
</P>
<P>
   Days earlier, Aline Bernstein had wanted to come when it became
apparent that Wolfe would not make it, the great vitality draining
rapidly away. Maxwell Perkins, fearing her appearance would upset
him, dissuaded her. Perkins _ ``the silent friend of Tom's
spirit,'' as Andrew Turnbull called him _ was an honorary
pallbearer but stayed in the background, as he always had. At the
graveside, he stood off by himself in a grove of maple and oak, a
line from ``King Lear'' running through his head: ``He hates them
that would upon the rack of this tough world stretch him out
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   This forgotten Thomas Wolfe was on the rack all his life,
Perkins believed, and, had he lived, ever would be.
</P>
<P>
   His last letter, written from the hospital, was to Perkins. All
his trust in his old friend was restored, and his affection with
it, and he thanked him ``1,000 times.'' Touched, Perkins showed the
letter to a few intimates. ``Max,'' one of them said, ``You and
Aline made Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Perkins said, ``Tom had the wit to find us.''

 &HT;    It's all about O. Mare
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wander around the Miami Dolphins' locker
room asking about Olindo Mare and you will hear the same words over
and over.
</P>
<P>
   (ITALICS)
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   (END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   They are descriptions that are so simple, so seemingly obvious,
that their significance almost doesn't register.
</P>
<P>
   Then you remember that Mare is a placekicker. That the last time
the Dolphins met the Patriots he scored all his team's points. That
his 43-yard field goal in overtime gave Miami a 12-9 victory. And,
most of all, that his teammates put him on their shoulders and
carried him part of the way to the Pro Player Stadium locker room.
</P>
<P>
   With that image in mind, the meaning of his teammates are saying
becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
   It's like John Bock, the offensive lineman who first lifted
Mare, explained: ``Some kickers have never really been football
players. They don't really fit in. That's not the case with Olindo.
... He has everybody's respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The stereotype of a placekicker is this: He seems to fit into an
NFL locker room like Kate Moss fits in a Weight Watchers meeting.
He is small. He can do little more than kick a ball a long way. He
can't tackle. He grew up thousands of miles away, not knowing the
difference between a touchback and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Beano Cook once said, ``The two most important jobs in America
are held by foreigners _ room service and field-goal kicking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mare, of course, proves this wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, at 5-foot-10 and 186 pounds, he is small compared not only
to the rest of the people in his locker room but also to the new
wave of bigger kickers in the league. But he hardly grew up a
thousand miles away. More like a few thousands yards.
</P>
<P>
   His father came from Italy. But he was born in Hollywood and
raised in Cooper City, where he spent his weekends cheering for the
Dolphins, never thinking that one day he would be dressing a couple
lockers away from Dan Marino.
</P>
<P>
   That mere homegrown touch, however, hardly explains how, midway
through his second NFL season, Mare has earned the respect of
Marino and the rest of the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   To understand that, let's go to the obstacle course.
</P>
<P>
   To spice up the offseason training, special teams coach Mike
Westhoff had the players play a little game. They split into two
teams, everybody but offensive linemen involved, and one by one ran
an obstacle course. Then, the two teams picked three players to
represent them in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Mare was one of the players picked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the linebackers and defensive backs are picking a kicker
to represent them, it tells you something,'' Westhoff said. ``He
competes.''
</P>
<P>
   And he often wins. Whether it's on the obstacle course or the
golf course _ where he shoots in the low '80s.
</P>
<P>
   His athletic ability has prompted to the Dolphins to change the
playbook, inserting an onside kick that has worked to perfection
and a trick play that has not. And although the kick fake _ Mare
takes the ball and runs _ failed miserably in the first try, an
extra point against the Jets, don't be surprised if it the Dolphins
try it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most athletic kicker I've ever been around,'' tight
end Troy Drayton said. ``Hell, he probably can outrun some of our
receivers. ... Plus, he's aggressive. He likes to get down and
dirty like the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans' lasting memories of Mare may be his game-tying or
game-winning kicks _ he had three his rookie season _ but his
teammates like to recall something that happened in the final
preseason game this year against Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins scored on the opening drive. Then, after making the
extra point, Mare booted the kickoff two yards into the end zone.
The Packers' Roell Preston, who has returned three kicks for
touchdowns, burst through a couple holes and began a sprint down
the sideline. He only had one more person to beat, the kicker. And
he was charging.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farther back on the field you are the tougher it is to
make the tackle,'' Mare explains. ``Obviously the returners are
faster than me, so you have to run up and get the angle, try to cut
them off.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he did more than that. He cut off Preston, grabbed
a hold of his jersey, pushed him out of bounds and slung him to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Flags came flying.
</P>
<P>
   Unnecessary roughness. On a kicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up to me after the game and said, `Why'd you have to
do that to me?''' Mare said. ``You know he was hearing about it
from his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Mare. Linebacker O.J. Brigance, the Dolphins' special
team captain, grinned as he recalled the tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a linebacker's mentality,'' Brigance said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second tackle he made in the preseason. And although
Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson doesn't seeing like penalties or blown
kickoff coverages, this combination the two seemed to put a glint
of approval in his eye.
</P>
<P>
   His kicker was a football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sometimes kickers are so isolated, and they have so
much time away from the rest of the team, that they get a little
off-base,'' Johnson said last week. ``But Olindo's a regular guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Mare made the switch from his first love, soccer, to
football, eventually earning a scholarship to attend Syracuse for
his final two years of college, he has made a point to be a part of
the team. At Syracuse practices, he often could be seen running
pass routes or playing running back on the scout team _ although
some of that can be traced to being a native Floridian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would get cold and I'd ask to do something just to keep
moving,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even in the Florida summer, Mare goes the same offseason
drills as everyone else on the team. He does it more to be in shape
than to earn respect, but he realized that is an added benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know I'm not this kid who's just here to kick a few balls
and ride the bike for 10 minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before games, Mare is hardly a recluse. To the contrary, he can
be seen running around the field. Catching balls. Throwing balls.
And, yes, kicking balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has endless energy,'' punter Klaus Wilmsmeyer said, shaking
his head.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the game, the part of his job where Mare is forced to
turn off the energy, to sit and wait, to isolate himself from his
teammates while he gets into his own little world.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, this also is where he earns his teammates respect.
</P>
<P>
   He has made 13 of 15 field goals this season, making him _ at
least at this moment _ the most accurate kicker in Dolphins'
history (80.4 percent). His only misses are from more than 50
yards: a 51-yarder in the season opener at Indianapolis and a
54-yarder at Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's kicking from 50 yards, I can turn my back,'' Drayton
said. ``I have that much confidence it's going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the history of the Dolphins-Patriots series _ each
of the last three meetings has been decided by three points or less
_ it wouldn't be surprising if tonight's game came down to a kick
by Mare.
</P>
<P>
   So while much of the attention for the past week has been on the
11 names on New England's injury report, maybe Miami fans shouldn't
have been celebrating. There, on the Dolphins' report, was this:
Mare (hip) probable.
</P>
<P>
   When approached for an interview Thursday, Mare grimaced as he
slipped on a pair of sweatpants, then explained he had to go get
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   He later shrugged off the soreness, calling it ``normal at this
time of the year'' and recalling that two days before the last
meeting with New England he wasn't exactly emitting positive vibes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed four field goals in practice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When it counted, though, he made four, adding another chapter to
what he calls a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   The kid from Cooper City is a professional football player.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask his teammates.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: Suckers not what some doctors ordered
 &HT;    (Eds: A compilation of health stories that moved in the past
week.)
 &HT;    Staff report
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What looks like a lollipop, tastes like a cough drop and has
some doctors concerned? Answer: A new product called Cough Pops.
</P>
<P>
   This cough drop on a stick is aimed at children and adults who
need temporary relief from minor cold and sore throat discomfort.
However, a child health specialist thinks the warning on the label
isn't strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very bad idea,'' said Dr. Sara O'Heron,
maternal child health specialist at Atlanta's Emory University.
``You're giving the message that it's candy. How can you tell them,
`No, you can't have another one of those, but you can have three
suckers?' How are you going to childproof those?''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for CoughCo Inc. in Aurora, Ohio, the company
that makes Cough Pops, said they are safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids love them,'' said Lisa Dean. ``There isn't any medicine
that would hurt them in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Ward, chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics'
Committee on Drugs, agrees. Because the throat lozenges are
basically just sugar and pectin, Ward doesn't think there's
anything harmful about manufacturing them in lollipop form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important part of the regulation of medicines that
look like candy is that they be given in the correct dosage and
that parents be well aware of that dosage and not exceed it,'' Ward
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our instructions are not to promote it near candy,'' Dornbush
added. ``It's among the cough-cold products so the parent picking
it up would know.''
</P>
<P>
   Cough Pops, made with chelated zinc, come in menthol, cherry and
lemon flavors. A box of eight has a suggested retail price of $2.49
to $2.99. The Get Better Bear retails for $1.49 to $1.99 for a box
of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Study points up problems for elderly drivers
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Testing older drivers for depth perception and
ability to see traffic signals would be a better test of skills
than judging them on night vision, University of Utah researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing Utah traffic accident data from 1992 to 1995 involving
people age 70 and older, the study found no support of the common
perception that older drivers cannot see as well at night and,
therefore, cause crashes.
</P>
<P>
   That theory, as well as the belief that older drivers lose
control of motor vehicles at high speeds, has been floated in many
states as reasons for restricting senior citizens' driver's
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A difference in older drivers and younger drivers involved in
crashes at night did not pan out,'' said Larry Cook, a statistician
for the University of Utah team that presented its findings
recently at the annual American Public Health Association meeting.
``And the odds ratio for a serious crash at highway speed vs. other
speeds was no different for older drivers than younger drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger drivers for the study were defined as ages 30-39.
</P>
<P>
   Where older drivers are more likely to cause crashes is at
crowded intersections, making left-hand turns and failing to yield
the right of way. They are almost four times as likely as younger
drivers to cause a crash by failing to yield and 1.5 times more
likely to cause an accident by running a stop sign or red light,
the study showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests older drivers have trouble spotting traffic signs
and signals in a cluttered visual field at any time of day,'' Cook
said. ``Depth perception may also be a factor because we found many
T-bone-type collisions (crashes in which one car broadsides a
second car) caused by turning left and running into oncoming
traffic. These are usually caused when drivers fail to judge the
speed of oncoming traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines target smarter, healthier babies
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of recent research indicating the first three years
of life are critical ones in a child's brain development, the state
of Georgia has developed voluntary guidelines to help child care
providers nurture smarter and healthier babies.
</P>
<P>
   Although developed by the Department of Human Resources' Office
of Regulatory Services and Child Care Licensing Section, the
guidelines are not a part of the minimum requirements a child care
provider must meet to continue operating.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, discussed at a recent DHR board meeting, give
child care providers basic information about what infants and
toddlers are capable of doing at specific ages and what toys and
activities child care workers should make available to stimulate
intellectual development.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, regulatory services had not stressed the importance
of sensory stimulation or provided information about brain
development. Georgia's licensing requirements focus on safety and
nutrition issues such as adequate meals, adult supervision and fire
evacuation plans.

 &HT;    Conservative Jews who intermarry banned as leaders
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Susann Ferarra was not happy to learn
that the rabbinical powers that be have decreed her unfit to hold
her job as executive director of Temple Beth David in Palm Beach
Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   She is, after all, a committed Jew. She has dedicated her
professional life to the Jewish community and her personal life
raising two observant children.
</P>
<P>
   But she married a Catholic. And as far as the highest rabbinical
assembly in the Conservative movement is concerned, that means she
cannot be a positive role model.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling this spring by the Rabbinical Assembly's Committee
on Jewish Laws and Standards, Jews who intermarry were banned from
holding leadership positions such as teacher, rabbi, cantor or
youth worker in Conservative-affiliated institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Pope's official pronouncements, the committee's
opinion does not have the weight of religious law. Fortunately for
Ferarra, the rabbi at her temple, David Goldstein, is choosing to
ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the assembly's ruling counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically telling (intermarried employees) to go
away,'' he said. ``If I got fired after this, I'd probably go to
the courts. This is discrimination. It's not discrimination because
of who you are, it's because of who you married.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Elliot Dorff of Los Angeles, the committee's vice
chairman, said he's confident the ruling is legally sound.
</P>
<P>
   But it points to the intensifying struggle within the Jewish
community to come to grips with an increasing intermarriage rate.
</P>
<P>
   Is it appropriate, for instance, for a rabbi to send a letter of
congratulations to the parents of a child who marries outside the
faith? Or to officiate at the wedding of a congregant who is
marrying a non-Jew?
</P>
<P>
   ``These are major questions,'' said Rabbi Richard Yellin, who
supports the ruling and who recently moved from Israel to lead
Temple Emeth in Delray Beach. ``They are part of a larger issue:
how do you keep a congregation Jewish?''
</P>
<P>
   On one side are those who want to slow the rate of Jews marrying
outside their religion by marginalizing intermarried couples
through guidelines like this ruling.
</P>
<P>
   On the other are those who believe intermarriage is an immutable
fact of modern life and a more logical tact is to welcome
intermarried couples into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Along the fault lines lie plenty of unanswered questions and
potential pitfalls. To avoid those pitfalls, most of the
Conservative rabbis in Palm Beach County interviewed for this story
said they favored the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   They said it reflects their current practices. Now it lets them
keep the peace by citing the rule instead of their own authority.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Epstein, a New York rabbi who is executive vice president
of United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism and the author of the
ruling, said the interpretation was unanimously supported by
committee members because it's necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize intermarriage exists, but we would prefer people in
role model positions . . . also model the ideal Jewish family,''
Epstein said. ``This is absolutely not a rejection of anybody. This
does not say to an individual that we don't respect you; it says we
don't think that you may be the appropriate role model.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was first printed this spring in JTS Magazine: The
Journal of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America and is titled
``Employing an Intermarried Jew.'' In three pages it cites
historical injunctions against intermarriage from biblical times _
when sharing a cup of wine with a non-Jew was prohibited _ through
modern times, when it was decided Conservative intermarried Jews
would not receive the honor of being called to read from the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really more of a sharpening of our position (on
intermarriage) than a change,'' said Dorff. ``We don't do this out
of meanness or nastiness; we do this out of a real concern for the
continuity of Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate of intermarriage has increased dramatically, from about
10 percent in 1965 to between 38 percent and 52 percent today,
according to several surveys. The last decade has seen an enormous
push by Jewish institutions, from synagogues to retirement homes,
to promote marriages within the faith. Hence the growth of Jewish
singles clubs and dinners and Jewish dating services on the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Many rabbis say whatever can be done to staunch assimilation is
a step in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judaism is not just a religion, we are a team,'' said Rabbi
Leonid Feldman of Temple Emanu-El in Palm Beach, a supporter of the
ruling. ``If a Jew marries a non-Jew that means we're not sure that
his children will be part of our team.''

 &HT;    It's all gravy from here
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All it takes to make gravy is broth, flour and fat. Some salt
and pepper. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   So why all the fuss about gravy? Even some veteran cooks refuse
to make it, remembering the failures _ the lumps and the anemic
color, which is what you get if you do it wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Making good gravy is all in the technique, a matter of blending
those three central ingredients in the right way, at the right
time.
</P>
<P>
   But given the evaluation of the available store-bought gravies
(see adjacent story), Thanksgiving is the time to master this skill
once and for all. Even if you make gravy only once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that gravy is one thing on the table that has to be
piping hot. Making it can be a last-minute whirlwind performance at
the stove _ done at about the same time the turkey is being sliced
and the potatoes are being mashed. Doing everything possible ahead
of time is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Because there's a 1-2-3 order to making gravy, here's a primer
to making it right and as easy as possible.
</P>
<P>
   THE STOCK: You need turkey broth to make gravy. While some
prebasted birds that have been injected with broth exude a lot of
liquid, you'll need about 4 cups for a batch of gravy. Make your
own ahead of time with the turkey neck and giblets. Simmer in water
with celery, carrots, onion, salt and pepper for an hour. This can
be done the night before. Reserve the neck and giblets, if you
like, and dice them for giblet gravy. Store the broth, covered, in
the refrigerator. If you want to use the liver as well as the heart
and gizzard, cook it in the stock just for the last five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   THE FAT: Once the turkey is out of the oven and resting on a
serving plate, pour the juices off, ideally into a quart glass
measuring pitcher. You can skim the fat from the top and use it.
(It helps to stick the container in the freezer for a few minutes
so the fat rises to the top more quickly). Figure on using 1/3 to
1/2 cup fat. Or you can substitute butter.
</P>
<P>
   THE FLOUR: A lot of homemade gravy is pale and tastes of raw
flour. That just means the flour and fat mixture wasn't cooked long
enough. It should bubble and color nicely before the liquid is
added. To avoid lumps, use a whisk to blend in the flour. If you
don`t have one, this is the time to buy one. They're cheap.
</P>
<P>
   THE PAN: The best gravy is made in the bottom of the roaster,
where you can stir up the caramelized bits that add flavor to the
finished product. However, cooks who scorn prebasted birds may find
that the bottom of the pan has scorched. The choice then is to
start with a clean saucepan, butter and homemade turkey stock.
</P>
<P>
   Once the gravy is browned and thickened it's OK to let it simmer
at a bare bubble in the roaster at the back of the stove, keeping
it warm for the turkey, dressing and mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   And, remember, if your efforts are lumpy, run the gravy quickly
through a food processor and no one will know.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY GRAVY
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 quart
</P>
<P>
   chilled turkey stock (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup fat, either from the pan drippings or butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   cooked, diced giblets, if desired
</P>
<P>
   When turkey is removed from roaster and set aside to rest, pour
off and reserve any accumulated juices. Skim off and reserve fat
</P>
<P>
   Add enough turkey stock to the pan juices to make 4 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Add enough butter to reserved turkey fat to make 1/2 cup.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the fat in either the roaster or a large, clean saucepan.
Over medium heat whisk in the flour and cook, stirring
occasionally, until bubbling and aromatic and the mixture begins to
color. Gradually whisk in 4 cups of the combined drippings and
broth. Scrape the bottom of the roaster with the whisk to loosen
the flavorful brown bits. Cook until thick. Season with salt and
pepper. Add the giblets if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Options: If the guests are adults, deglaze the pan with a half
cup of wine such as a nutty Madeira, and stir to loosen up the bits
and pieces stuck to the pan. Add that to the reserved pan juices to
be used in making the gravy.
</P>
<P>
   To get a head start on Thanksgiving, make turkey stock now. For
real turkey taste you want the native bird, not chicken, but turkey
parts can be hard to come by. Buy turkey wings, backs etc. at the
Bowman &AMP; Landes Turkey Farm, 6490 E. Ross Road, New Carlisle
(between Ohio 201 and 202, north of Ohio 40).
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY STOCK
</P>
<P>
   turkey neck, heart and gizzard
</P>
<P>
   1 rib celery (leaves included), cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, cut into quarters
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs parsley
</P>
<P>
   2 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 grinds black pepper
</P>
<P>
   5 cups cold water
</P>
<P>
   salt
</P>
<P>
   Place all ingredients in a medium saucepan with a lid. Bring to
a boil, skimming off froth if a clear stock is essential (it isn't
with gravy). Turn the heat down so that the broth just simmers.
Cook for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the turkey parts and let cool before dicing. Strain and
discard the solids.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate promptly. When chilled, remove and save any fat that
has accumulated on the refrigerated turkey broth. It can be used as
part of the fat in the gravy.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to add the liver, just add it to the broth and cook
for just five minutes or it will be overcooked. Or saute the liver
in a bit of butter and add to the cooked giblets.
</P>
<P>
   Options: For richer flavor and color, roast the turkey pieces
with the chunks of onion, celery and carrot in a 400-degree oven
until nicely browned. Then proceed with the recipe.

A $50 MILLION CULTURAL WINDFALL SETS A CITY ASTIR  
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADISON, Wis. _ Onstage between songs during a recent concert at
the Civic Center here, Lyle Lovett was seeking a way to explain to
the audience why he likes coming to Madison. It's friendly, he
said. Accommodating. That afternoon, he said, he and his girlfriend
were walking along State Street, the main thoroughfare connecting
the University of Wisconsin campus and the State Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met a nice gentleman,'' Lovett said in his familiar
deadpan. ``And he agreed to stop reciting a poem to us for five
bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good line, capturing Madison's wry and lively street
life. And in a backhand, unintended way, it was also an apt
characterization of the cultural life of this city of some 200,000
people, which is bursting with arts groups that need a home and
have their hands out.
</P>
<P>
   And though, unlike the street poet, the groups are generally not
so willing to sell their silence, they have, like him, recently had
a windfall. In July a local businessman, W. Jerome Frautschi,
announced that he would donate $50 million for the construction of
an arts district downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary gift _ equal to about one-third of Madison's
annual tax revenue, not to mention more than half of the annual
budget of the National Endowment for the Arts _ is to be used for
renovation and building. It immediately brought forth wish lists
from dozens of local arts groups: for exhibition spaces to concert
halls to dance studios to a reading room for poets to a
state-of-the-art movie theater for archival films.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard about the gift, we immediately started
dreaming,'' said Sandra Madden, executive director of the Madison
Symphony Orchestra, which plays 16 concerts a year in the
2,200-seat Oscar Mayer Theater, a hall, in the city-owned Civic
Center, that is acknowledged to have poor acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is more than evident that new performance spaces are
needed here. The Oscar Mayer is booked nearly every night of the
year for the local symphony, the opera, occasionally the ballet and
a myriad of traveling musicals, dance troupes and road shows by the
likes of Lovett and his band.
</P>
<P>
   The 330-seat Isthmus Playhouse, the Civic Center's other
theater, can barely contain the yearly schedule of the Madison
Repertory Theater, the city's only Equity company, whose production
of ``How I Learned to Drive'' ran through Nov. 22, and CTM, a
community troupe that produces mostly for children. The troupe is
getting less than a week of stage rehearsals before its ``Christmas
Carol'' opens on Nov. 27. There is no theater in town between the
two in size, and a house of 500 to 1,000 seats is hungrily
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the squeeze, six other theater groups recently
leased a decaying movie house, the Esquire Theater, across Capitol
Square from the Civic Center and began raising the money to
renovate it. The city considered, then rejected as architecturally
unfeasible, a proposal to turn another theater, the Orpheum, into a
music hall; now a stir has arisen over the proposal of a private
group to turn it into an Imax house. There are theaters and
performance spaces on campus, rentable on occasion, but the
university keeps them pretty busy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the city's two art museums, the Elvehjem on campus, with its
eclectic collection, is planning a much needed expansion, and the
Madison Art Center, also housed in the Civic Center, recently had
to remove paintings from an upstairs gallery in order to hold a
dinner for trustees. Even commercial sites for rock-and-roll are
scarce these days, odd for a university town. But one place burned
down in 1996, and a handful of others have been shut for noise and
liquor ordinance violations. Coffeehouses, more than clubs, now
engage bands.
</P>
<P>
   Frautschi (rhymes with grouchy, the family likes to say), 67,
recently retired as vice chairman of Webcrafters, an educational
printing company, but the money for his gift came from his
investment in the Pleasant Co., the makers of the American Girl
doll collection. Frautschi's wife, Pleasant Rowland, founded the
company, which was bought in June by Mattel, the toymaker, for $700
million.
</P>
<P>
   An affable man with a direct and modest manner, Frautschi is an
admittedly middle-brow arts appreciator, with a fondness for the
symphony and the melodies of Andrew Lloyd Webber. His family
settled in Madison in the 1860s, and he is unabashed in his loyalty
to the city. Asked the obvious question _ why the arts? _ he
responded that hospitals and other social services should be the
focus of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt all along that the public sector, the taxpayer, has
the responsibility to take care of those in need,'' he said. ``The
arts shouldn't necessarily be a priority for the taxpayer, so it
behooves the private sector to step in. To have real quality of
life in a city, the arts have to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he paid for a study of the arts in Madison; the
recommendations were unambiguous. ``The need for new, improved or
expanded cultural space in the city of Madison is real and
profound,'' the study said. And this dovetailed with Frautschi's
belief that downtown Madison, particularly the State Street area,
``could use a face lift.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he started the Overture Foundation, to be dedicated to
local philanthropy, and when his wife's company was sold, he took
$50 million and earmarked it for the new arts district. Then he
hired the city's planning and development director, George E.
Austin, to direct what has come to be known as the Overture
project.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about the project is how open-ended it
is. At the very least, the gift has created an opportunity for the
city and its arts community that is unusual, if not unique. In most
cities, after all, development plans are in place before the money
is. Here, the challenge is the reverse. The money is there; how
should it be spent?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe if we waited for the public sector to do
something like this, it would ever happen,'' said Sue Bauman, the
Mayor. ``It's going to be a catalyst for a new, sparkling _ I don't
know what.''
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Madison has never been exactly downtrodden, but it has
long been sluggish and undistinguished, its architecture dominated
by the dome of the Capitol, a magnificent building dating from
1909, now 10 years into a 14-year, $130 million renovation.
Recently, redevelopment has been creeping like kudzu along ``the
isthmus,'' the strip of land that connects the Capitol and the
university and separates the city's two large lakes.
</P>
<P>
   New building has been spurred by two prominent projects: the
Kohl Center, a campus arena, and Monona Terrace, a lakeside
convention center based on a Frank Lloyd Wright design. (A plaque
on the roof commemorates the singer Otis Redding, who died on Dec.
10, 1967, when his plane, arriving for a Madison gig, went down in
Lake Monona.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Frautschi gift, city leaders anticipate new
theaters and gallery spaces that will generate stores and
restaurants and increase tourism. The entire block on which the
Civic Center sits has been designated for the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should go way beyond the arts, affecting housing and
commerce in the area,'' said Lynn Eich, executive director of the
Dane County Cultural Affairs Commission, which, with both public
and private foundation money, makes grants to local arts groups of
more than $300,000 a year. ``I'm hoping the whole profile of
downtown will change, and we'll see some exciting architecture in
the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   (Government financing for the arts in Madison is relatively
poor. The city supports the operation of the Civic Center with
about $1 million a year but otherwise does not include arts support
in the budget; the State of Wisconsin ranks 40th in per capita
dollars appropriated for the arts.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to change a city profile is to court controversy, and
though no one can actually criticize a gift of $50 million, there
is some interesting grumbling going on. This city has, after all,
been known as a home for counterculture as much as culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear `$50 million,' I think `synthetic art implant,'''
said Scott Dikkers, the editor of The Onion, a satirical newspaper
with a growing national reputation. ``It seems like it's going to
be art for 40- and 50-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Dikkers, who is 33, and others made the point that Madison's
cultural life has long been fed by students and recent graduates,
and that the new arts district would swivel the city away from its
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town is always trying to be bigger than it is,'' said
John Krewson, a writer for The Onion. ``I've lived here all my
life, and giving $50 million to Madison for the arts is like giving
$50,000 to a student for a car. He'll go out and buy a Camaro. The
town doesn't know what to do with that much money.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who are anticipating being left out,
particularly easy to find among the city's many rock musicians. ``I
wonder how much this has to do with the arts,'' said John Davis,
54, who has been playing guitar in Madison blues bands for 30 years
and who was among many in town who wondered whether the Frautschi
money would be better spent on artists rather than buildings. ``It
has to do with improving the city. I'm not against concerts and
theater, but the art I'm interested in is produced in smoky
clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Another inevitable question is what will happen when it is
decided how the money will be spent. As it turns out, $50 million
is not that much; proposals made to the Overture board would
already cost out at more than twice that, said Robert B. D'Angelo,
director of the city's Department of Public Facilities, who runs
the Civic Center and is chairman of Overture's advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   This has engendered partnerships among arts groups that would
ordinarily fend for themselves but are now trying to figure out
how, say, one new theater might accommodate audiences for dance,
theater and music. Indeed, the mantra among arts officials is that
the Overture project is not about arts organizations: ``It's about
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, everyone is aware that many groups will not
get what they ask for, and disappointment is bound to be rampant.
Privately, many arts officials say they expect Frautschi to give
even more money after the plans for the district are formalized.
Even if true, this seems at least as audacious as Lyle Lovett's
street poet, proof of the adage that no good deed goes unpunished.
</P>
<P>
   Frautschi said he meant the gift almost as a challenge grant, to
encourage local arts groups to step up their programming, and other
local donors to step up their giving; new quarters mean greater
audience expectations, after all. And he acknowledged that his main
worry is that too many demands will be placed on his gift.
</P>
<P>
   D'Angelo put it more succinctly. ``Right now, we're in the
honeymoon phase,'' he said. ``People can look at the gift and still
say, `It's for me.' We haven't ticked anyone off yet.''

MARKET BULL 
 TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 24. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow's big day leads at USA Today, the New York Times and the
Los Angeles Times, and is the right-hand leader at the Wall Street
Journal. The Washington Post off-leads the story in deference to
the opening of bidding on D.C.'s beloved Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow starts Tuesday at a record high and the papers'
consensus is that this is due to the three Federal Reserve interest
rate cuts, increased merger and acquisition activities and a
general sense that the global economic crisis is on its way to
being handled.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT throws in Bill Clinton's renewed hold on his office, and
says the list of causes are ``the right reasons,'' but never says
why they are right or what would make for wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT adds some more technical reasons to this list: the
growth of the M-2 money supply (what we've got in checking
accounts, savings accounts and money market funds) and investors'
closing of short positions (buying stocks now to close out past
sales of borrowed stocks that were bets the market was going
south).
</P>
<P>
   The LAT and the WSJ note the quickness with which the market
came back from its recent 20 percent drop, the LAT saying that it
was ``the shortest bear market in history.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times and Journal say Monday's events are a kind of salute
to raging bull quote-machine Abby Joseph Cohen. In these papers,
Cohen redirects any suggestion of personal brilliance back to a
cool, professional assessment of market conditions. But in the WP's
Cohen coverage, we see another side: there, she is said to gush
that her prediction has come true.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT says that an overlooked theme of the market rebound is
that ``most individual investors never lost their nerve.'' The same
point is made on the NYT editorial page by Floyd Norris, who says
that investors weren't dissuaded by the overseas financial crisis
nor the losses suffered by high-rollers in hedge funds. But the LAT
goes on to say that investors are ``much more brave'' because among
other things, the Fed has cut rates and Congress has funded the IMF
and Japan has apparently advanced a good banking plan. It's hard to
reconcile these two points of view. Either investors care about
such high-falutin' matters or they don't, right?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the WSJ, the LAT and WP refer to a warning made two
years by Alan Greenspan about the dangers of investors'
``irrational exuberance.'' But it's not clear from any of these
stories whether the market's gain of nearly 3,000 points (this
upswing is noted by the LAT) since then is confirmation or
refutation of Greenspan's fears. And it's hard to see what would
make it clear, which is why these daily market move stories are
different from many news stories. Daily market moves are radically
underdetermined. And hence the papers shouldn't spend so much space
on their meaning. They really don't have one.
</P>
<P>
   The USAT front brings startling news for parents of infants: the
government's Consumer Product Safety Commission is recalling nearly
10 million foldable playpens because their raised rivets can
strangle toddlers by catching on their clothes or pacifiers. This
has already happened to eight children since 1982. It's not clear
from the story why the recall is being done now.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT and LAT fronts report on the jury's acquittal on all
charges yesterday of Susan McDougal in her California fraud and
embezzlement trial. Although Whitewater and Ken Starr were banned
topics in the courtroom, it's apparent that some jurors thought the
state case was an attempt to pressure McDougal to cooperate in that
matter. According to the LAT, jurors never seriously contemplated
guilty verdicts on any of the nine counts.
</P>
<P>
   The USAT off-lead reports that the Georgia Supreme Court has
thrown out the state's anti-sodomy law, which was once upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court. The story is carried inside at the NYT. The
decision is being heralded by gay activists. But since both papers
point out that the case prompting this decision was one involving
heterosexual contact and that there are plenty of other states that
still likewise ban oral and anal contact between opposite sexes,
it's not clear why this isn't a big deal to the general population
too. Perhaps because such statutes aren't often used to arrest
heterosexuals? The stories don't say.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT provides some facts from a recent survey conducted last
week by Le Figaro: Only 47 percent of French people bathe daily,
only 60 percent change their underwear daily, and 6 percent never
wash their hands. Although Today's Papers once came to the same
conclusions one July day on the Metro, this story cries out for
context: How do Americans come out in a similar survey?
</P>
<P>
   The last vehicle for truly unconstrained opinion in a newspaper
is the photograph. If you doubt this, go get last Sunday's NYT and
turn to page 5 of the ``Week in Review.'' There, accompanying a
story about politicians speaking their minds about other countries,
you'll find a looming picture of Al Gore, cropped so close that
none of his hair is visible and you can see the sweat that's
bubbling out of every giant pore in his face. Note that the verbal
equivalent: ``Gore, looking like a crazed criminal with something
to hide, said...'' would never pass muster. What did Gore ever do
to deserve this?

VISITORS TO TEXAS HILL COUNTRY FIND ENCHANTMENT IN THE ROCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: With ENCHANTED-ROCK-INFO)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ Following the winding Ranch Road 965
north of Fredericksburg, an unusual sight awaits the newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Turn a corner amid the farms in the Texas Hill Country and there
is Enchanted Rock, a bald dome of pink granite that looms high like
nothing else in the surrounding areas of Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Enchanted Rock State Natural Area, a spot so popular
that attendance is often limited on weekends and holidays to keep
the fragile plant life from being trampled.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the 1,643-acre park is the domelike peak that
rises 425 feet. It's surrounded by smaller granite hills that are
part of the same vast piece of granite. Like an iceberg, only the
top is exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The granite formation, partially uncovered by eons of erosion,
is 1 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   The first human visitors, more than 10,000 years ago, were
hunters and gatherers. Later, tribes such as the Comamche, Apache
and Tonkawa used the rock as a base. The Tonkawa are believed to
have been descendants of the prehistoric tribes and were there when
Spanish explorers stumbled upon the outcropping in the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
   One such explorer was captured by Indians but escaped using the
vast surface of the exposed granite. Thus the name: swallowed by
the rock, the man was believed by the natives to have joined the
spirits of the enchanted past.
</P>
<P>
   Another enchantment is the way the rock has been heard to creak,
crackle and groan, sounds attributed to the granite's expansion in
daytime heating and its contractions in nighttime cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at the park and after setting up camp or
establishing a picnic site, it's time to conquer the central dome
by taking the Summit Trail.
</P>
<P>
   From the parking lot to the top, the walk is fairly easy, about
six-tenths of a mile. The rock's slope invites visitors to sit and
rest in stages of the climb to take in the spreading Hill Country
views.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the exposed rock is dotted with islands of
vegetation called vernal pools. Ecologists study the grasses and
the small animals that live there.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, park officials must go to great lengths, with signs and
brochures, to keep visitors from using the pools as restrooms or
places for garbage. These ``weather pits'' are for looking, not
touching.
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky, a multicolored lizard with a bright orange
belly might scamper out of one of the soil islands and greet you
with its floppy tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Serious climbers seeking more challenging angles than the Summit
Trail should register at the entrance office and get details on
recommended climbs of varying difficulty and learn the park's
climbing rules.
</P>
<P>
   Hardier hikers are in for a treat with the four-mile Loop Trail,
a giant circle through the park that rings the huge dome. The trail
seems to pass through several ecospheres as the scenery evolves at
every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers going counterclockwise will come across Sandy Creek
during the first mile, a good place to see while-tail deer. The
trail then turns left in front of the hill called Buzzard's Roose.
The name is appropriate, for buzzards constantly circle the peak,
their wide-spread wings barely moving.
</P>
<P>
   The back stretch offers wonderful views of Enchanted Rock's
steep side. The trail then becomes flatter and more woodsy. A side
trail diverts to Moss Lake. Another spur leads hikers to a point
called Scenic Overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Near the trail's end is a spooky landscape with 40- to 50-foot
high granite formations in all possible shapes. Passing between
such rocks and encountering new scenes on the twisting trail is one
of the highlights of the hike.
</P>
<P>
   The state park has four camping areas, a large-tent area plus
three designated primitive camping sites reachable only by foot.
Those are near Buzzard's Roost, Moss Lake and below the Scenic
Overlook along Walnut Spring.
</P>
<P>
   Campers should make reservations ahead of their visits.
Picnickers and campers should bring their own firewood for grills
(ground fires are prohibited). The park sometimes has a small
supply of firewood for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Forgotten camping and picnic items may be purchased at the
Crabapple General Store 4 miles north of the park entrance on Ranch
Road 965. The store also has camping grounds in back. The charge is
$5 per night.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer the comforts of home to the hard earth,
more than 300 bed-and-breakfast inns operate nearby.

FOR A FORMAL LOOK, TOP OFF CANDLES WITH A SHADE 
</HEADLINE>

 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Once used for lighting purposes only, candles
have lately become a common accessory in almost every room of the
house, from the bath and family room to the kitchen and dining
room.
</P>
<P>
   Candles also can be found for sale in almost any store, from the
supermarket to the card shop. They come in virtually every size,
shape and scent. But for a more formal and decorative look, place a
candle in a wood, metal or glass candlestick, place a metal candle
follower over the top of the candle and then top that with a
decorative candle shade to diffuse and soften the light of a
flickering flame.
</P>
<P>
   Candle shades offer a flattering light for the complexion, as
well as keeping the flame from reflecting in the eyes of dinner
guests.
</P>
<P>
   Candle shades were popular in the 19th century. Many of those
elegant, beaded, fringed, cut-out and hand-painted styles are being
re-created by hand today by cottage-industry individuals and are
sold through boutiques or other retail stores specializing in
decorative accessories for the home.
</P>
<P>
   Candle shades also come in silver plate or brass, with either a
cut-out design or solid, smooth surface. However, the solid metal
shades tend to hold the heat in, making the candle melt faster and
making the follower list as it melts down. Always use straight,
hard Colonial classic candles, which sell for approximately $2
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Never leave a lighted shade-covered candle unattended. Make sure
the candle is upright, and not tilted.
</P>
<P>
   Freezing the candle will help it last longer and burn
straighter. A felt holder at the base will help to keep it secure
in the candlestick.
</P>
<P>
   The metal follower may vary a bit in size, so it's wise to take
it along when choosing a new shade.
</P>
<P>
   You can find mass-produced candle shades and candlesticks as a
set starting at $15. Shades alone can cost $72 for a large handmade
shade. The silver plate follower costs approximately $20, and brass
followers cost approximately $10 each.

SURVEY SHOWS ELECTRONICS TOP GIFT LISTS

<P>
   What's the most popular holiday gift this year?
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey by the industrial conglomerate 3M, 27
percent of Americans put stereos, TVs, computers and the like at
the top of their wish lists. Next in line are clothing (18
percent), books (14 percent) and jewelry (13 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Although Americans love their gadgets, the survey also revealed
electronics aren't big-ticket items for most people: A full 80
percent spent less than $500 last year on the stuff.
</P>
<P>
   MARKETING 101: For a lesson in how the chattering furball named
Furby became this season's Tickle Me Elmo, consider: Furby was
unveiled way back in the first quarter of the year, at a major toy
convention in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   There, the proto-Furby talked up a storm, won over toy buyers
and promptly disappeared. Magazine and newspaper editors began
hearing about Furby during the summer, even though the creature
wouldn't be on store shelves until almost November.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally arrived, we too rushed out to hear him chirp in
his own language, Furbish. Find the $30 critter, if you can, at
most toy stores.
</P>
<P>
   TEMPERAMENTAL TUTOR: Quite the opposite of friendly Furby is a
computerized chess game called Ivan ``The Terrible.'' In his
teaching mode, Ivan will offer suggestions and ask gentle
questions, to which you answer yes or no, and help you improve your
game.
</P>
<P>
   Turn him into an opponent, though, and avuncular Ivan becomes a
tormentor. In a voice that sounds like Sean Connery's, Ivan says
things such as, ``Is that the best you can do?'' and ``Want a hint?
I will give you a hint. Give up,'' and, after a lengthy ponder on
your part, ``Are you sleeping or are you playing chess?''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan features a vocabulary of 500 words, 100 levels of chess and
sound effects including horses galloping, bugles blowing and swords
clashing. Find the $150 Ivan in electronics stores or order
directly by calling 800-59-CHESS (800-592-4377); Web site:

SONDHEIM TURNS CRITIC, SEES TROUBLE ON BROADWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Stephen Sondheim is his own worst critic.
</P>
<P>
   The celebrated Broadway lyricist and composer, making a rare
public appearance recently at a New York State Writers Institute
talk, spoke with humor and disarming bluntness. He talked about his
lyrics, his current project, his grim diagnosis of Broadway, his
memories of Ethel Merman and the ups and downs of his own output _
a career that spans such arch American classics as ``Sweeney
Todd,'' ``Company'' and ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum.''
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim was too sharp, too honest, too at ease with himself and
his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   And they are many. One of the most roundly lauded
composer-lyricists of this half of the century, Sondheim is the
Oscar Hammerstein protege who startled Broadway with a new, slyly
sophisticated brand of musical theater. His brand of show tune was
serious music that stopped short of opera: accessible yet erudite,
hilarious yet complex. He's the object of an ardent following, the
subject of a new biography (by Meryle Secrest) and the recipient of
numerous awards, from Tonys to Grammys to the Kennedy Center
Honors. When he refers to ``Lenny,'' he means Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what came across in his talk was the temperance of his ego.
He spoke critically, for instance, of the decision to cast very
young actors in ``Merrily We Roll Along,'' which demanded mature
professionals. He was (and still is) ``embarrassed'' by some of his
lyrics for Leonard Bernstein's ``West Side Story'' _ particularly
``It's alarming how charming I feel,'' sung by a Puerto Rican
(Maria) with the flippant elan of Oscar Wilde. And he was
surprisingly hard on the entire show, which he characterized as ``a
triumph of style over substance. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no substitute for a good story, and `Romeo and Juliet'
is a good story,'' Sondheim said.
</P>
<P>
   But where ``Romeo and Juliet'' boasts specific characters,
``West Side Story'' builds its story on thinly drawn stereotypes.
``They're sort of generic characters in the lyrics as well as the
book. ... For me, it's not satisfying.''
</P>
<P>
   A small, trim man with gray hair and a tidy beard, Sondheim, 68,
wears a face that's worn with life.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote his first musical as a teen-ager. In his 20s, he
reached Broadway as a lyricist, in his 30s he reached it as a
composer (with ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum,''
in 1962), and by the age of 40 he'd written ``Company.'' ``A Little
Night Music'' followed, as did ``The Frogs'' (performed in a Yale
swimming pool), ``Sweeney Todd,'' ``Sunday in the Park With
George,'' ``Merrily We Roll Along'' and ``Into the Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   His last full-blown musical, ``Passion,'' opened on Broadway in
1994. He described his next one, a theatrical treatment of the
brothers Wilson and Addison Mizner _ one a card shark, wit and
welterweight boxer, the other a noted architect. ``They were very
close when the world was against them. When the world wasn't, they
were constantly in competition with each other,'' Sondheim said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilson left some wisecracks, but Addison left some buildings _
and that's what it's about. It's called `Wiseguys.'''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by the Kennedy Center, it will go into production
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim was pessimistic about the current and future state of
Broadway theater, saying flat-out that the industry is on its
final, wobbly legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very little vitality on Broadway. There's a lot of
vitality at the box office ... (but) I think it's dying. Healthy
theater is not all musicals.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the easiest show he wrote: ``Sweeney Todd.'' The
best musical ever written: Gershwin's ``Porgy and Bess.'' And his
opinion of Lorenz Hart: ``I don't like Lorenz Hart's lyrics because
he's lazy. His inflections are all off.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim believes adamantly that good lyrics should reflect the
natural cadences of speech. ``I'm a conversational lyric writer,''
he said. ``There are other kinds, but I've always thought that the
only way to write lyrics is to imitate speech. ... I'm very
conscious of inflection.''
</P>
<P>
   He told a handful of anecdotes about Broadway grande dame Ethel
Merman, a brassy, overpowering woman trained in the low comedy of
old Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very straightforward; she was not terribly bright, and
she was really professional,'' said Sondheim, who worked with her
on ``Gypsy'' in the late 1950s. During a revival of Irving Berlin's
``Annie Get Your Gun,'' he said, Merman shared a scene with an
Indian chief played by Jerry Orbach (now on the television program
``Law and Order'').
</P>
<P>
   One night she confronted Orbach backstage: What, she wanted to
know, was he doing during her long speech in the boat? He was
reacting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry, look,'' she replied. ``I don't react to your speech,
you don't react to mine. You hear what I'm saying?''

INTERVIEWING JOB CANDIDATES REQUIRES SOME FANCY FOOTWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Dr. Pierre Mornell once asked dozens of his
executive clients to tell him two things about the worst person
they ever hired: How long it took to resolve the situation and how
much it cost.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Mornell, a psychiatrist, had spent years counseling
businesses about hiring key people, their answers stunned him. They
estimated that the median cost for that one mistake was $300,000 _
and it took the company a year to resolve it.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the things that led him to write ``Hiring Smart,''
a book from Ten Speed Press in Berkeley that offers 45 tips for
bosses who want to choose the best employees and avoid the costly
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mornell offered a few favorite tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Pay attention to what people do, not what they say.''
Mornell suggests such things as taking candidates for a walk around
the office or plant to see how they interact with others, asking
their opinion about a proposal or assigning them to write a page or
two about what they see as the strengths and weaknesses of your
company's Web site or one of its stores or plants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit a candidate's first interview to 20 minutes. That lets
you see if the chemistry is there without wasting much time.
</P>
<P>
   _ In later interviews, ask all your initial questions at once,
then shut up and listen. Mornell believes interviewers often talk
too much, sometimes telegraphing what answers they expect or trying
to sell the company to the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   _ All careers have peaks and valleys. If you don't know where
your candidate's valleys are and what caused them, you're ignoring
future problems. ``It's not a question of if they're going to
occur,'' he says, ``it's what they're going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mornell says people often gain insight about what is important
in life when they go through a painful period, such as a serious
illness. In the same way, companies often don't gain insight about
dangerous flaws in their hiring process until they make a severe
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   You can take steps to avoid those mistakes long before your
candidates walk in the door. Even before the 20-minute interviews,
Mornell suggests that companies have their most intuitive person
call the prospects for a couple of minutes each, simply to find out
how easy or hard they are to reach and whether they have good phone
skills.
</P>
<P>
   Those who fail in those two areas don't even get their 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   During interviews, Mornell suggests throwing applicants a few
curves, like asking what bumper stickers they have on their car. In
the book, he tells how Larry Stupski, vice chairman of Charles
Schwab &AMP; Co., would ask the sort of question that Peter Falk used
on ``Columbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he knew plenty about the Human Resources department,
he would often play dumb and ask candidates for the department what
exactly a human resource director does.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the candidate could explain the job in detail, clearly and
concisely, Larry went on to the next question,'' Mornell writes.
``If the candidate spoke in jargon and buzzwords, Larry nodded and
smiled, but he always thought, `Gotcha!'''
</P>
<P>
   Mornell suggests that when taking notes during an interview,
divide the page into two vertical columns. Use one column for notes
about what the candidate says, and the other for what you're
thinking: questions, missing pieces, feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes your best insights come not during the formal
interviews, but before or after them. He says one technique you can
use is to walk the candidates back to their cars _ what people
drive and how it looks can say a lot about them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest surprise walking a candidate to his car was when I
discovered the candidate's wife sitting inside the automobile,
waiting for him,'' Mornell writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two hours in a hot car on a warm August day said more about
the candidate and his relationship with his wife, and her
acceptance of that relationship, than any of my questions in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against my recommendation, the man was hired for an operation
in Arizona. Predictably, his relationship with female employees was
an unmitigated disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the end of interviews, Mornell often asks the applicant to
call him in a few days, then they work out a time and day for the
call. Surprisingly, though, 15 percent of finalists don't make the
call at the agreed upon time.
</P>
<P>
   A lot more people make another basic mistake. Even though career
book after career book tells job applicants to write thank you
notes to those who interview them, Mornell says it wouldn't take
him long to count up how many notes he has received in 16 years of
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember every person who sent a note,'' he says. Mornell
adds that e-mail is acceptable for sending the notes, but the note
in any format should be personal rather than reading like a form
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Mornell suggests companies check public records to find out what
they can about candidates; sometimes it helps interviewers check a
candidate's honesty by asking a question when they already know the
answer from those records. He also suggests asking candidates what
their references will tell you when they call, which gives them a
chance to address any awkward situations.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to check references, his favorite method is to
call at a time when you assume the references will be out of the
office. Leave a message naming the candidate and saying they were
listed as references, then say, ``Please call me back if the
candidate was outstanding.''

PLENTY TO BE GRATEFUL FOR THIS THANKSGIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Of all the aspects of Thanksgiving that I adore,
my favorite may be an activity that is almost exclusive to
newspaper columnists: Publicly listing many of the things for which
I am grateful.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a refreshing departure from the columnist's usual
task: Find an ax and grind it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, I am especially grateful for:
</P>
<P>
   _ The results of the recent elections. I still wonder, am I
dreaming? The Republican Party in awkward disarray. The Christian
Right finally slapped back a pace or two. A Democratic governor and
lieutenant governor for California with our two and only senators
remaining Democrats and women. What an embarrassment of riches.
</P>
<P>
   _ On a related note, the window display at Streetlights Records
in San Francisco's Noe Valley. It sports miniature black coffins
filled with skeletons that have Newt Gingrich's face pasted onto
the skulls. Newsweek's ``The Loser'' cover is the centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   _ A real crab season. Despite all the travesties we have visited
upon nature _ polluted water bodies, species driven to the edge of
extinction by condominium developments and shopping malls _
crabbers are still hauling up tons of the sweet-meat crustaceans.
This year, if crab folks, wholesalers and restaurateurs can come to
an agreement, the industrious among us will be able to buy crab
fresh off the boat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Living beside the Pacific Ocean. No matter where you reside in
San Francisco, you can walk outside your house some nights and
smell the sea as if it were across the street. Miraculously, gulls
still scream above the traffic din of gridlocked downtown.
</P>
<P>
   _ Archbishop William Levada of San Francisco. Although it is
costing the Catholic diocese a fortune, Levada has made it easier
for beautiful old churches like Old St. Mary's, St. Paul's, St.
Patrick's and St. Boniface to scrape up the millions they need for
legally mandated earthquake retrofitting. The man seems to get that
these are not just ``buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Rev. Glenda Hope and all the folks who do the heavy
spiritual lifting at San Francisco Network Ministries. These are
people who still mean it every day when they say, ``Give me your
tired, your poor.''

FINDING THE GOOD LIFE BEYOND FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEN GALLEGOS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ People think I am a football fan. Maybe it's
because I look like a typical guy, or perhaps it's my fading
athletic build, or possibly it's just the color of my hair.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, on football Sundays strangers will
persistently ask me about ``the game,'' or ``whom the Niners are
playing'' or for updates on ``the score.''
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is that I hate football and haven't actually
watched a game since college. Twenty years ago, I stopped watching
football because I realized that it was an idiotic game that
combined all the violence of boxing without the grace, all the
repetition of basketball without the ballet and all the stupidity
of professional wrestling without the humor.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, I loved all sports. I still love baseball and retain a
guilty interest in boxing. But not football. For 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   What has life been like for a typical guy who doesn't spend his
weekends watching football? In college, it immediately increased my
cachet with pretty, off-beat intellectual women I would meet on
Sundays in bookstores, museums and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   I can honestly say that my football-free existence opened up the
worlds of politics, literature and art for me while doing wonders
for my social life.
</P>
<P>
   After I got married and became a parent, not watching football
gave me every weekend to be with my wife and boys. We learned that
the best time to do family activities was on football Sundays.
Movies aren't as crowded. I'm usually one of a handful of dads in
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Children's museums, parks and playgrounds are all less crowded.
Even though I hate football, I actually love football season _
especially Super Bowl Sunday _ because it's the best opportunity to
do family activities.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose it is lucky for me that I was interested in football
until I was about 18, because I have retained from that period a
knowledge of football trivia. This is useful. Possessing some
knowledge of sports trivia can sometimes be a plus in a man's
career pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   You never know if you got that promotion because you deserved it
or because when the boss mentioned 1970s Oakland Raiders star Jack
Tatum, you were the only person in the room who knew that his
nickname was ``the Assassin.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is funny, and maybe my two little boys will get older and
want to watch football every weekend. If that day comes, then I'll
probably start watching football with them.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows? Maybe I'll even learn to like it again. Until
that day, I'll just have to smile and shrug my shoulders when
strangers want to know the score.

HYDE SETS TRAP THAT LEADS TO DASH'S RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- No doubt, in time, Sam Dash will hit the law
school circuit.
</P>
<P>
   And when he does, there is also no doubt that the smartest kids
in the classes on hair-splitting will thrill to his dazzling
explanations of how the same conduct by Ken Starr he said was
``unlawful'' before the House Judiciary Committee last week was not
unlawful in Starr's written presentation to the House in September.
</P>
<P>
   Dash will also no doubt be brilliant as he explains his own role
in leaving poor chairman Henry Hyde with a case that can only be
made via the inferences of Starr, because the witnesses and the
evidence are at best ambivalent and often exculpatory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of us will wrestle with Dash's mixed-message
resignation _ not solely on ethics issues, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   One clue came within hours of Dash's public departure, when all
of Starr's deputies began doing one of the few things they do
consistently well _ leak like sieves.
</P>
<P>
   While the boss stayed on the high road, the Starr deputies
portrayed Dash's professed concerns about dispassionate neutrality
in total contrast to his behavior when the impeachment referral was
being prepared late last summer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dash, the Starr deputies angrily leaked, who had insisted
on many of the escalations in rhetoric that characterized this
argumentative submission; and it was Dash, they also leaked, who
virtually alone came up with the silliest charges in the entire
document, that President Clinton abused his power by asserting
rights and priveliges in court.
</P>
<P>
   Good points, by the way, but they miss the largest point, that
Starr is making the errors of a passionate advocate of the
president's removal from office, whose constitutional sin is
designed to fill the huge void left by Hyde's misfeasance and
nonfeasance, and that of his inept impeachment director, Chicago
crony David Schippers.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it from Starr's point of view. He sends his referral to
Capitol Hill more than two months ago, and what happens? Nothing
but gutter politics.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter who we are eventually told pulled which string
_ Newt Gingrich or Hyde himself _ but all that happens is that the
argumentative, soft-core pornographic referral is made public just
as the congressional election campaign is heating up. The same
thing happens to all of Starr's backup material and grand jury
records, including the famous video of Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing else happens, except that Schippers plays with
Starr's language in a rewrite of Starr's rewrite of testimony he
never heard from witnesses he never met.
</P>
<P>
   When the public doesn't buy into the political strategy, when it
in fact backfires, Hyde switches gears while denying he is doing
so. Despite the fact that he has failed to take one step toward
developing the House's own factual record, despite his insistence
that the Judiciary Committee will look beyond the Monica Lewinsky
matter, he says the entire impeachment matter is nonetheless to be
wrapped up before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   To short-circuit the absence of effort to develop the House's
own evidentiary record, Hyde then sends the White House his list of
81 ``affirm or deny'' questions, seeking either a Clinton assent to
Starr's allegations or another presumably perjurious set of sworn
denials.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he calls Starr as (to date)the sole public hearing
witness. Hyde could say the Democrats had sought him, but they
sought him on the understandable assumption that Starr would appear
as one witness to answer questions about his investigation, while
other witnesses would deal directly with the factual issues in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde called him as if he were one of those fact witnesses.
But Starr had admitted to Clinton lawyer David Kendall that out of
the entire record he sent Congress _ 134 FBI interviews, 19
investigative depositions, and 115 grand jury sessions _ he had
participated in only one, the President's White House testimony on
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Hyde set the constitutional trap over which Dash
resigned, on the grounds that Starr usurped Congress's sole power
of impeachment by arguing the case for it.
</P>
<P>
   To be accurate, though, there was one part of the case Starr
didn't argue as he had in his referral, and which committee
Democrats didn't, either. This just happened to be the basis for
the allegation of perjury that dwarfs the others, and indeed from
which the entire case flows and on which it depends.
</P>
<P>
   This is the charge that Clinton committed perjury in his Paula
Jones deposition 10 months ago when he denied ``sex'' with
Lewinsky, and then compounded it in August when he denied to the
grand jury that he lied in that deposition.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, Starr had to accept the absurd, convoluted, and
perverted definition of sex Jones's lawyers gave the president, and
then to show via Lewinsky's unchallenged testimony that certain
acts occurred as she alleged. Hence, the pornography and the
political problem.
</P>
<P>
   The same ridiculous burden was faced by the White House in
defense of Clinton, though he, in fact, denied the Lewinsky sex
narrative. Hence all the silliness about ``legally accurate'' false
testimony and the Democrats' plea to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains, however, that the impeachment case exists only
in Ken Starr's inferential conclusions, not in a record developed
by the House.
</P>
<P>
   It's in fine shape for a shouting match on cable TV, but not for
the second impeachment vote in American history. And that is as
much Henry Hyde's fault as it is Ken Starr's.

WHEN A HARVEST WAS MORE THAN CORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I recently put out a call for answers to a puzzle: If the word
autumn didn't join the English language till the 1300s, and fall
came two centuries later, what was the Old English word for the
season? By the following morning, e-mails from two readers _ David
Formanek of Arlington, Mass. and Jan Ziolkowski, a Harvard
medievalist _ had supplied the answer: harvest, now pretty much
limited to crops and metaphors, was once the season's name as well.
</P>
<P>
   Haerfest, wrote Ziolkowski, also formed the root of such words
as haerfestlic (autumnal), haerfestmonath (harvest-month,
September), and haerfesttima (autumn, harvest-time). As both
writers noted, modern German still uses the cognate word Herbst,
autumn. In English, though, autumn and fall gradually appropriated
harvest's role as a name for the third season of the year.
</P>
<P>
   As for the British-American split _ they prefer autumn, we go
for fall _ Ziolkowski wondered whether New England's more sudden,
dramatic ``fall of the leaf'' might have made the word fall seem
more appropriate here than in Britain, where a gentle climate makes
for a more restrained autumn. ``Maybe the reactions to your column
(fall-out?) will lead to a definitive study,'' he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Several other readers pointed out that though there are only
five nouns for the seasons _ spring, summer, fall, autumn, winter _
other, Latinate seasonal words are still in everyday use as
adjectives or verbs. In describing the spring and fall equinoxes,
for example, ``the more common adjectival forms are autumnal and
vernal,'' writes planetary scientist Brian Marsden from Cambridge.
And though we rarely use the adjectives hibernal and estival,
``bears still hibernate and African toads estivate,'' notes Richard
Sachs of Chelmsford.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Germanic forms of those verbs, winter and summer,
are also still current. And while you may have doubts about the
sort of people who winter and summer, you can't blame the language:
These are not new ``verbifications'' but centuries-old verbs with
deep roots in the Germanic languages. Spring and fall, already
burdened with meanings, are not used this way, though there's
evidence of an effort to adopt spring in the sense of ``spend the
season'': The sole citation in the Oxford English Dictionary, dated
1835, is ``Every third man has wintered at Naples, springed at
Vienna.'' This coinage, however, was clearly a recipe for trouble _
``She springed at Vienna, summered in Norway, and falled at Rome''?
_ and it seems not to have survived many winters.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
What kind of verb am I?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wording of my lexical plea in the same column _ that ``some
generous medievalist will e-mail with the answer'' _ brought a
query from Kristina Nilsson of Newton, Mass., wondering about the
with in that phrase. Wouldn't ``e-mail the answer'' be more
logical, she asked, since mail is the closest relative of e-mail?
</P>
<P>
   Interesting question: Is e-mail a version of the verb mail, or
is it more like write? I could have used Nilsson's short version,
or said e-mail me the answer, or even e-mail me with the answer,
though that seemed long. Perhaps it should have been write (to) me
with the answer, given that a medievalist might well prefer the
pen-and-parchment method. But write the answer &UR;  &LR; alone wouldn't
work; it's grammatical enough, but it doesn't, as it were, get the
answer to me. A number of similar formulations are available, each
with its own variations _ call with the answer, phone (me) with the
answer, supply (me) (with) the answer. Probably none of these would
bother the average native speaker; but e-mail is new to the
language, still trying out various idiomatic combinations, and
people have different feelings about which ones sound ``normal.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the birth of e-mail provoked a momentary tizzy among
usagists who thought the word shouldn't be a verb; they wanted us
to say send an e-mail. Traces of the debate linger in the new
Dictionary of Modern American Usage from Oxford University Press,
where e-mail is treated as a noun that is ``coming to be used as a
verb.'' The usage example, coincidentally, addresses our question,
and Oxford chooses the long version: ``Please e-mail me with the
answer.''

HEREDITARY LORDS WON'T GO QUIETLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When the House of Lords thumbed its nose last week at
Prime Minister Tony Blair,, vetoing a government bill for the fifth
time, Blair comforted himself by noting that it would be the last
roar of those he and his advisers refer to derisively as dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   But if those who inherit their titles in the House of Lords are
dinosaurs, they are of the carnivorous kind found at Jurassic Park,
and they have vowed not to lumber quietly into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 1,164 Lords, or peers, as members of the upper house of
Parliament are known, 759 of them are so-called hereditary peers
who got their seats simply because they were born noblemen. The
rest are appointed as so-called life peers. For about 700 years,
hereditary peers have passed their seats down through the
generations, like their titles.
</P>
<P>
   Of European countries that have bicameral forms of government,
Britain is the only one whose upper house has seats that are
inherited exclusively by the rich and privileged.
</P>
<P>
   Blair sees the hereditary peers as not fitting in with his plan
to modernize British democracy and make it more like the rest of
Europe. Blair and his Labor Party see the hereditary peers as an
embarrassing leftover of the days when an aristocracy ruled
Britain, and they cringe at the thought that a group of effete
nobles can stymie the wishes of an elected government.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle that has become the hereditary peers' Waterloo
has allowed them to cast themselves as the noble defenders of
democracy in the face of an arrogant government that wants to
handpick its European parliamentarians and eliminate one of the few
checks on its power.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, this is a simple political fight. Blair wants the
European Parliament election system to be similar to that used in
most other European Union countries, in which parties put forward
candidates, and voters cast their ballot for the party, not
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the Lords say these so-called ``closed lists'' are
undemocratic, and have vetoed the bill five times. All the Lords
can do is postpone legislation from becoming law for a year. The
reality is, no matter how much the Lords put up a fuss, even if
they filibuster until next fall, the new European voting system
will become law. In fact, next fall is when the hereditary peers
are expected to lose their voting and speaking privileges in the
Lords under a bill introduced by the Blair government.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides say something much more important than how
European elections are held here is at stake. The government says
the hereditary peers are an example of outdated, undemocratic
elitism, men who came to their jobs by the accident of birth, who
because of their traditional ties to the Conservative Party give a
permanent, built-in advantage to one party.
</P>
<P>
   The peers and their supporters contend that it is the Blair
government that is undemocratic, wanting to expand its patronage
turf while neutering one of the few institutions here that can slow
down a government that has had the biggest majority in the House of
Commons for nearly two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Timothy Beaumont says that while both sides are trying to
portray themselves as principled, neither is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair is trying to create a system that is blatantly
undemocratic,'' Beaumont said. Yet Beaumont, a Liberal Democrat who
was made a life peer in 1968, suspects some of the hereditary peers
are not as concerned with democracy as they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to be covered in glory in this one,'' said
Beaumont, describing the controversy as the most ignoble one he has
seen in his 30 years in the house.
</P>
<P>
   As Britain becomes a country less bound by tradition, the Lords
are something of an anachronism. There are fewer than 100 women
peers, and hardly any minorities. It is the quintessential rich
white guys' club.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Lords have been championing themselves as
champions of the people, they seem to have little in common with
the common people, and have historically curbed government attempts
to whittle away the vestiges of privilege. For example, while the
majority of British people have said they want an end to fox
hunting, the overwhelming choice of hereditary peers is not only to
support fox hunting, but to take part in it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in recent years the hereditary peers have been ``down''
with the people, voting against tuition fees for Scottish college
students and against a wildly unpopular government ban on T-bone
steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Britons have been debating whether and how to reform the Lords
for nearly a century. One of Blair's predecessors, David Lloyd
George, trimmed back the Lords' power after the upper house
rejected the Liberal government's attempt to raise taxes on the
rich in 1909. But Blair has the votes that Lloyd George never did.
</P>
<P>
   Lord James Mackay, who as Lord Chancellor from 1987 until last
year was Britain's highest legal authority, says he has no problem
with reforming the Lords, but says it is pointless unless there is
a set of guiding principles agreed to up front.
</P>
<P>
   Viscount Cranborne, the Tory leader in the Lords, echoes that
sentiment, saying, ``I will go quietly if a properly independent
chamber takes our place.''
</P>
<P>
   But like most Conservatives, Cranborne says he does not believe
Blair wants to make government more democratic, but simply wants to
emasculate one of the few checks on his power.
</P>
<P>
   The Blairites can barely hide their contempt for the hereditary
peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't said they're all hopeless, but quite a few of them
are,'' said Baroness Margaret Jay, the Labor leader in the Lords.
</P>
<P>
   But even Labor stalwarts are divided. Lord Robert Winston says
he was in favor of scrapping the hereditary peers when he entered
the upper house three years ago. But he said it took him just three
days ``to recognize my prejudice.'' He said contrary to the
upper-crust stereotypes that he and others had of hereditary peers,
he found it impossible to tell the difference between them and life
peers, saying there were good and bad, liberal and conservative,
with no discernible voting patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe the hereditary principle to be indefensible,''
Winston wrote recently. ``What concerns me is that I cannot think
of a more logical alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither, apparently, can the Blair administration, which is why
so many peers are suspicious of the government's rhetoric about
getting rid of them to make Britain more democratic.
</P>
<P>
   As Winston sees it, if the hereditary principle is wrong, then
the monarchy should be scrapped, too. Blair, however, wouldn't
touch that with a 10-foot scepter. Last year, Blair described Queen
Elizabeth as representing ``the best of British.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Queen spelled out the government's legislative
plans for the next year in her annual speech to Parliament. Topping
them is the elimination of the hereditary peers, a foregone
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Beaumont says that one of the few peers who can hold his
head up is Lord Peter Shore, who was a Labor government Cabinet
minister in the 1970s, but refuses to go along with his party on
the new election system. Beaumont said he has watched in admiration
as Shore has made a principled stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord Shore is a democrat,'' he said admiringly, as if there
were no higher praise for a nobleman _ or a commoner.

RESCUE EFFORT WAS IN GOOD HANDS WITH BLEDSOE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There are two signature games in Drew
Bledsoe's career so far.
</P>
<P>
   The first was four years ago when he threw 70 passes against the
Minnesota Vikings to bring the Patriots back from a 20-0 deficit to
win in overtime, 26-20.
</P>
<P>
   That was the game that turned around the then-hapless franchise.
They won seven straight games and made the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he saved the Patriots' season from ending here
against the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Against Minnesota, Bledsoe was put in a shotgun formation and
stayed in it to complete 45 passes for three touchdowns and 426
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the circumstances, Monday night was better. With the
season on the line, once again he was placed in the shotgun and
asked to bring his team back.
</P>
<P>
   He did, completing 28 of 54 passes for 423 yards, including a
25-yarder to Shawn Jefferson for the winning touchdown with 29
seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe and Jefferson were the show. In the end, they were the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson (six catches, 131 yards) took advantage of backup
safety Brian Walker, who simply couldn't cover him. In two
fourth-down situations on the final drive _ in which the Patriots
wiped out a 23-19 deficit _ Jefferson had Walker man-to-man and
beat him to make first-down catches.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with Miami playing a three-deep zone, Walker was in the
middle of the field when Jefferson, coming down the left seam, got
open to make the catch in the end zone. That should never happen.
But it did, and the Patriots are alive.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the game, this particular group of Patriots had Dan
Marino's number. In the last two years, the star Miami quarterback
had one touchdown pass and 12 interceptions against New England.
</P>
<P>
   But in this game, he was outstanding. Marino completed 24 of 38
passes for 289 yards, with two TDs and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   The game became a shootout between Marino and Bledsoe because
neither team could run the ball. The Dolphins had 33 yards rushing,
the Patriots 41.
</P>
<P>
   The game officials let most everything go. Both offensive lines
were holding all over the place and nothing was being called.
Receivers and defensive backs were banging each other around, and
they let it go.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the game, Bledsoe had only one reliable target, Ben
Coates, who caught nine balls for 78 yards. Marino, likewise,
focused on O.J. McDuffie, who caught eight for 86 yards.
</P>
<P>
   However, with time running out, and Bledsoe taking everything on
his shoulders, he had to switch to Jefferson, as Coates hurt his
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth and 7 at the Miami 37, with just 43 seconds to play,
coach Pete Carroll was calling for a timeout at the Patriots bench.
But Bledsoe shook him off, then drilled a first-down pass to
Jefferson on the right sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team could stop the pass. Miami gave up a whopping 18
first downs through the air. The Patriots, still the worst in the
league vs. the pass, gave up 13.
</P>
<P>
   But the key was the Patriots' pass protection. Bledsoe threw 54
times but was sacked just once, despite facing a multitude of
blitzes. He saved the day. And the season.

PATRIOT TV GAMES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Finneran's Folly II:
</P>
<P>
   It appears that the National Football League, with the help of
Bob Kraft, is developing a scorched earth policy for Greater
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, on the day he signed a memorandum of understanding
with the state of Connecticut to move the Patriots to Hartford,
Kraft said that commissioner Paul Tagliabue assured him no new team
would move into the ``region'' (a new word in the NFL lexicon all
of a sudden).
</P>
<P>
   Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that if someone such as Paul Fireman decides he
wants to build his own stadium, buy another NFL team _ say, the
Buffalo Bills _ and bring it to Boston, then the league is going to
say he can't?
</P>
<P>
   We asked the NFL for a clarification Monday, and this is what
league vice president Joe Browne had to say:
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston already has a team. The New England Patriots. And the
fans in Boston will continue to see their Patriots games on
television just as they have the last 27 years while the team has
played in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, many of our teams don't think `Boston' when they
think of the New England Patriots. The visiting teams fly into
Providence, R.I., when they play in Foxborough. They stay in a
Providence hotel the night before the game. Even two years ago when
the Patriots hosted the AFC Championship game against Jacksonville,
we had the league media headquarters in Providence, not Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I say, nothing has changed since last Thursday's
announcement. If the Massachusetts political leaders want to lure
another team to Boston, the move would require a three-quarter vote
from the other teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, I have a hard time seeing another team going to
Boston in the foreseeable future. A team needs a state-of-the-art
stadium. If the city and state legislature were not even willing to
spend money on basic infrastructure for a privately built stadium
by one of their own citizens (Kraft), why would they spend hundreds
of millions of dollars to build a stadium for an outsider coming
into town for the first time?''
</P>
<P>
   The distance between Boston and Hartford is 99 miles. Three
years ago, the Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore, which is within
50 miles of the Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the Raiders left Oakland for Los Angeles, 50 miles away
from the Rams in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Then three years ago, the Rams left Anaheim for St. Louis,
moving into the same state, Missouri, as the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, would the NFL assure Kraft that no one would move
into Boston, which is 99 miles away from Hartford and not even in
the same state?
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though someone wants to put the screws to local fans
who have supported the Patriots so well over the years but simply
do not want to follow them to Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   This is reinforced by what seems to be a changing NFL policy on
TV blackouts. Last week, NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said the
Hartford games would have to be sellouts before they could be shown
on TV in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But wait a minute. The NFL blackout policy is supposed to cover
only 75 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they try to do that,'' says US Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.),
``that's a late hit on Eastern Massachusetts. There is no reason
for them to do something like that. When the Patriots were 1-15 and
not selling out, were the games blacked out in Hartford? I don't
think so. I think that is the parallel.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the deal in Connecticut, it seems they expect
not to sell out there. Why else would they give them all the
guarantees to pay for empty seats? But as far as I am concerned,
Boston is beyond the blackout area and should be able to see
Patriot games.''
</P>
<P>
   Markey is the ranking Democrat on the House Telecommunications
Committee in Washington and represents the North Shore area, so he
is going to watch how this situation develops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope the NFL policy stays the way it is,'' says Ed
Godman, the general manager of Channel 4 (WBZ-TV), the local CBS
affiliate, which has the rights to AFC games. ``I think it would be
in the best interests of our station and CBS to have Patriot games
back here in the Boston market.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL policy is unclear. On one hand, Green Bay Packers home
games are not supposed to be fed to Milwaukee, which is about 110
miles away, unless they are sold out. But the games are always sold
out. Conversely, Cincinnati Bengals home games, when they are not
sold out, are still shown in Columbus, which is about 100 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   So, like many NFL rules, this one seems to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Is the NFL's threat to black out Patriots games an attempt to
force Massachusetts fans to go to Hartford?
</P>
<P>
   It sure seems that way.
</P>
<P>
   And if the NFL is able to bully Boston around, then we can once
again thank Tom Finneran for screwing so many people just to
satisfy his own ego.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's sticking it to Kraft has nothing to do politics. This
is personal. He doesn't like Kraft. Kraft's wife, Myra, backed
Finneran's opponent, Richie Voke, for speaker. When Voke lost, so
did Kraft, and eventually Patriot fans and the state of
Massachusetts.

EYES FROM THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By M.  R. MONTGOMERY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. _ Dan Finamore, curator of the department of
maritime art and history at the Peabody Essex Museum, is too
modest. ``Well, there was a gap in the schedule,'' he recalled,
``and I said, `Hey, why don't we do a photography show?''' What he
meant was ``Hey, we've got a million photographs in our
collections, and it's about time we let the public in on the
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a simple sample of the collection turned
into something that Finamore didn't expect _ a show of 130 images
that transcends any single organizing principle. The show is, and
is more than, a history of photographic technique and a collection
of images of the end of sail through the age of motorized vessels.
This is no mere record of interesting historical events captured in
black-and-white.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the show comes from its basic source: These are
photographs, with a handful of exceptions, taken from the mariner's
point of view. Even when taken by landlubbers (Shanghai portrait
photographers, itinerant daguerreotype makers, or war
correspondents), the results are not about the sea; they are of the
sea, sprung from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't claim we looked at all 1 million images,'' Finamore
allowed, ``but we looked at a great many, and I was frankly amazed
at what we had.'' What he had was infinite variety. There may be
hundreds of photographs of ships' crews, but not one that says more
about the US Navy at the turn of this century than a group
portrait, taken by a professional photographer, of the men of the
Isla de Cuba. The viewer's first reaction is likely to be a passing
glance, and then the question: ``Is that sailor really holding a
goat?'' The men of the Cuba (who have shaped their uniform caps
into all sorts of nonregulation shapes) have sneaked a whole
menagerie on board. This is not the Navy according to the Navy
Department, this is a photograph of the reality of shipboard life:
occasional obstreperous amusement as a safe harbor in a sea of
ennui, danger, disassociation, and exile. The picture may be posed,
but the monkeys, dogs, cats, parrots, and the goat are real.
</P>
<P>
   Other images, often printed from Box Brownie and similar
fixed-focus, fixed-aperture cameras, speak to the seaman's point of
view rather than his condition in life. There is a remarkable print
showing a dismasted fishing schooner, the stubs of the masts rising
not nearly as high as the waves that still threaten the ship. A
sailor stands on the broken stump of the forward mast, peering
seaward, looking for a rescuing vessel. It is not a pose. Beyond
him, slightly out of focus, a few men slump against the rails at
the bow. It is a terrifying picture, altogether different from
Homer's stylized dismasted ship in ``The Gulf Stream.'' There is no
artistic distance to mitigate or stimulate the horror. Beyond the
captured image, it asks a question posed by many of the photographs
on the wall: ``Who could think of going below and getting a camera
at a time like this?''
</P>
<P>
   One person who did think of such things was a passenger on a
cruise ship to Miami, who, no doubt over his wife's objections
(``Harold, you can't be serious!'' at the minimum), takes a little
Kodak out on the deck and captures, barely lit and almost focused,
what appears to be a large, white-topped black cloud towering over
the ship. It is a wave. It is the wave of your worst dreams, and it
is not a picture you wish you had taken.
</P>
<P>
   There are images that do not speak of much more than mere
history, but even they do what art is supposed to do: change your
perspective on the world. A dismasted ship that had been caught in
a typhoon appears in a daguerreotype. It is sitting in a serene
lagoon, the water not rippled even in the minutes-long exposure of
the medium. A building with an oddly shaped roof line sits just
above the ship's pier. It is a picture from the Philippines, taken
before the Civil War. Who had lugged a daguerreotype camera to the
Far East? Is this a photograph to document an insurance claim or a
record of a triumph against nature? Or is it just the beginning of
the modern world, when the images will be purely factual and the
imagination will shift from questions of when and what to the more
complicated issues of how and why?
</P>
<P>
   There is a tension between modernity and retrospection
throughout the exhibition. A number of images seem to have the
precise intent of recording something before it disappears, and
some of them are very specifically from the sailor's perspective. A
disorienting montage of three photographs of one of the last active
combat sailing ships in the US Navy _ the USS Portsmouth _ shows
the vessel under full sail, seen from the very tip of the bowsprit.
The horizon tilts at a slightly different angle in each exposure,
and it takes just a bit of imagination to feel the ship plunging
ahead, an arm clasped around a line, a finger on the shutter
release, a breath held, a hope that the image will even begin to
capture the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Professional photographers, too, succumbed to the power of ships
under way. Enrique Muller Jr. documented sea trials for the US Navy
and, while shooting the USS Connecticut steaming at flank speed,
managed to capsize his photo boat in the bow wave of the
battleship. For sheer potential lethality, his photograph of a
submarine's periscope cutting through a calm sea is as disturbing
as the shark's fin in ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   True, a few of the images could be dismissed as mere curiosities
at first encounter. At the entrance to the show are three
unremarkable daguerreotypes, a man, a boy, a baby. The pictures
sit, casually, on a small portable desk. Then you read that this is
the actual desk from the real cabin of the captain of the Mary
Celeste, the merchantman found in 1872 under sail, completely empty
of all human beings. The man is the captain, the baby is the
youngest child whose impression still indented its bed when the
ship was boarded. The small boy is the only survivor of that
family; he was at boarding school when his world evaporated in the
middle of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   It is an exhibition that works on every level. There are dozens
of images for photographers to study, the curious to wonder at, the
sophisticated gallery-goer to admire. Remarkably, almost every one
of the 130 photographs appeals to all three audiences.

DIARY TELLS BROTHER'S GRIEF AFTER STORM SANK SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. on Nov. 26 a century ago, the top-of-the line steamer
Portland sailed from India Wharf in Boston with an estimated 192
passengers and crew. Their destination was Portland, Maine, but
their destiny was death in a storm that ultimately would bear the
ship's name.
</P>
<P>
   One George Kenniston Jr., a 20-year old Bowdoin College student,
was aboard that night, returning home from a Thanksgiving meal at
his Aunt Mabel's home in Hyde Park. Waiting for Kenniston in Maine
was his brother William, a country doctor who was raised on Yankee
principles of restraint and moderation _ and who kept a journal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The journal, recently ``discovered'' by a grandson who lives
in Arlington, Mass., details how William got a lifetime lesson in
self-control as he waited in vain, first for his brother's ship to
come in, then for his brother's body to wash up with wreck debris
that would litter Cape Cod. No shipwreck has claimed more lives in
New England waters than that of the Portland, according to local
naval historians.
</P>
<P>
   A version of the Kenniston story was probably told by relatives
of the estimated 450 people who died in the Portland Storm. Some 36
hours long, the storm claimed at least 150 ships. Massachusetts'
South Shore was hardest hit, particularly Scituate, where waves
obliterated a beach and bumped the mouth of the North River some 3
miles north to where it's located today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Portland Storm became the measuring stick with which all
subsequent storms would be measured until the Blizzard of 1978,''
said Dave &UR;  &LR; Ball of the Scituate Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   At the Scituate Maritime &AMP; Irish Mossing Museum, hanging on a
wall, are a life jacket and a pair of cabin doors from the steamer
Portland, but the ship's story doesn't end there.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Hollis Blanchard's decision to cast off, while many
other captains heeded the storm warnings, remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never know the end of the story because we'll never know
just why the captain sailed that night,'' said Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Another question closer to being solved is where the shipwreck
lies. About midnight the next evening, the first of two-dozen
bodies washed up on the outer shore of Cape Cod. Wrist watches had
stopped for these victims either at 9 a.m. or 9 p.m., the time
difference key to where the ship foundered.
</P>
<P>
   If the watches stopped that morning, currents and an ensuing
northwest wind had many hours to carry the wreckage southeast. If
it was p.m. _ just a few hours before its discovery on the beach _
the wreck would have been nearby. The late maritime author, Edward
Rowe Snow of Boston, insists in his writings that the ship is off
the Cape. Arnold Carr and John Fish, shipwreck researchers and Cape
residents, insist that it is midway between Cape Cod and Cape Ann.
Moreover, they maintain that they have found the wreck using
underwater scanning equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``But have we got the nameplate? No. Not yet,'' said Carr.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately a wreck identification will determine, among other
aspects of the ship's last chapter, just how long passengers fought
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland was a 281-foot paddle-wheeler with luxury
accommodations and a cheap fare _ $1 _ because it was competing
with rail transport between Boston and Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also carried the heart and soul of the African-American
community in Portland,'' said Peter Bachelder, co-author of ``Four
Short Blasts.'' Published last summer, the book attempts to
identify all the victims, which the shipping agent at the time
could not do because the only passenger list went to the bottom
with the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the Portland tragedy, copies of passenger lists
were ordered kept on shore, and paddle-wheels, which are
ineffective in heavy seas, gave way to the propeller.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard had adequate warning that a classic New England
northeaster was brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Historians like Snow &UR;  &LR; thought Blanchard probably believed he
could outrun a storm. The wind direction in Boston suggested that
the storm was passing to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Blanchard had another reason to sail. He wanted to make his
teenage daughter's birthday party home in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   When the Portland sailed, skies were cloudy. But within an hour,
Blanchard found himself in the deep grasp of a blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   Observers reported spotting the steamer knifing into heavy seas
off Cape Ann about 8:30 p.m. After that the Portland was not
conclusively heard from again _ until late the following night,
when debris and bodies came ashore on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lived long and much,'' Dr. William Kenniston wrote in
his journal shortly after the tragedy. ``Life had been running on
smoothly and pleasantly and in a way that seemed likely to continue
... (but now) has been changed.''
</P>
<P>
   William was the grandfather of Christopher Cirker, a
photographic equipment salesman and technician who several years
ago was asked by an elder relative to make copy photographs from an
old journal. Cirker never really read the text, however, until a
month or two ago, when he realized he was holding a yarn in stoic
prose about pain, loss, and a long-forgotten storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose at the core of it all is a need to recognize these
people for what they went through,'' Cirker said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1898, his grandfather William, then unmarried, lived in
Boothbay: ``Sunday morning there was a blizzard raging when I awoke
and again I thought of George and expressed my slight anxiety,'' he
wrote. But as he had done the previous night, he convinced himself
the steamer would not have sailed from Boston because of the
weather.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the Portland Press Herald reported that the
ship had not sailed. ``This relieved me of all worriment and I took
the paper over to Mrs. Freeman,'' the wife of E. Dudley Freeman,
William's best friend and another ship passenger.
</P>
<P>
   But by Tuesday, he still had not heard from his brother or
friend. Then he got a telegram from family members in Boston saying
the steamer had sailed.
</P>
<P>
   By lunch he was getting word that debris from the ship was
washing ashore on the Cape. William and George had been the closest
of several siblings. But in his journal, he sticks to essentials
such as borrowing cash from friends for the train trip to Boston,
then to Cape Cod, hoping to claim his brother's remains. He located
the body of his friend Freeman, but not that of his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never shall I forget the scene of that awful day. We were not
alone in the search for our dead _ nor were we the only ones
unsuccessful ... nor shall I forget (at an undertaker's hut in
Orleans) the dim rays of the old undertaker's lantern in the cold
shed of its ghastly tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dec. 5, Dr. William Kenniston returned to work ``to
take up the routine of my practice, though with little heart for
it.''

TEENS FIND `GOOD VIBE' IN ALL-NIGHT RAVE PARTIES  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAYE BEELER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - In a back alley off Main Street in Mesa, Ariz.,
hundreds of teenagers and young adults converge in a kaleidoscopic
tangle, dressed like sci-fi conventiongoers on their way to an
all-night slumber party.
</P>
<P>
   They're jittery with a can't-wait feeling, knowing they'll soon
be psychicly free-falling through a rave, a form of all-night,
semi-clandestine partying that has re-invented itself again and
again over the past 10 years. It has become more slick, commercial
and global in its reach.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rave every weekend in the Valley, drawing at least
1,000 young people, who find their way to the site by dialing up a
recorded message or clicking on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are part of the scene to some degree. But more important
are the opportunities a rave offers for losing yourself in
pulsating music, escaping your frustrations, feeling free enough to
fly.
</P>
<P>
   In this crowd, faces and shoulders sparkle with glitter, bodies
flash with Day-Glo necklaces, bracelets and Magic Marker-size
decorative sticks. Feather boas and fairy wings sweep across barely
clothed torsos.
</P>
<P>
   Necks and arms drip with children's costume jewelry _ edible
candy, colorful beads, animal charms. Heads and faces peek from
under brightly colored hairpieces, Afro wigs and surgical masks.
Pacifiers and lollipops project from partiers' mouths.
</P>
<P>
   The outrageous get-ups sum up the essence of the rave scene, a
free-flowing experience driven by the throbbing, synthesized beat
of electro music, which is heavy on bass and light on lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   Through the music, ravers are free to be who they want to be in
this place, on this night.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``It's all about the vibe. This is a spiritual thing. I feel
like I get high just listening to the music,'' one girl says.
</P>
<P>
   Clutching their $20 admission, they back up against the
building, forming two loose lines.
</P>
<P>
   From the open doorway, the heat and music escape into the cool
evening, tantalizing the impatient revelers with their intensity
and the psychedelic possibilities waiting inside. They're just 20
bones away from The Funky (expletive) Happens Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Raves have been around since the early 1990s, but they have
taken on a new form. The scene is still untamed, propelled by wild
dancing, drugs and secrecy, but the parties are more commercial.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, rave organizers would find a dilapidated
warehouse and plug in a couple of turntables and speakers. The
scene was undercover and underground. The pumping music was
powerful and magnetic.
</P>
<P>
   Party promoters would print up a couple hundred fliers and
selectively distribute them. Admission was less than $5.
</P>
<P>
   Now raves generate crazy-new money. Promoters pack the house
with a couple thousand people at $20 a head. A good night at a
``dope'' rave can bring in $40,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some ravers don't mind traveling to get their groove on. At
Phoenix area raves, people come from as far away as California,
Colorado, New Mexico and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters advertise on the Internet and distribute glossy fliers
publicizing the appearances of much-worshipped deejays.
</P>
<P>
   These fliers herald the name of the rave and a phone number.
When dialed, a recorded message provides directions to the rave.
</P>
<P>
   On the first Saturday in October, the message directed people to
the Nile, a renovated movie theater at 105 W. Main St. in Mesa, and
the Funky (expletive) Happens Tour _ a national show with an
internationally known deejay. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE FUNKY TOUR: OCT. 3, 1998 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the Nile, ravers seem deliriously happy. In the cavernous
room, bodies work every available space. It's so crowded that it's
hard to get to the bathroom or the water stations, or even to find
room to dance. The room is dark except for the blinking of
high-tech laser lights and the sweeping movements of glow sticks
waved by dancers.
</P>
<P>
   The room is smoky and has an odd collection of smells:
marijuana, clove cigarettes and Vicks VapoRub, which some ravers
believe helps them breathe more easily in the polluted air.
</P>
<P>
   George Hudak, 18, nibbles on a Day-Glo alien doll attached to
his necklace as he cruises through a sequence of fluid movements.
He is wearing a skeletonlike glove that glows red when he activates
its controls.
</P>
<P>
   He's already handed out more than $200 worth of goodies to
people here, most of them ages 14 to 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought candy, glow sticks and teddy bears for everyone,''
he says. ``It's the way. Everyone is so supportive and nice to each
other. It's a good vibe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravers hug a lot. They will ask to drink from your bottled
water, offer you candy or admit they're on the hallucinogenic
designer drug Ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   As the layers of music wash over their bodies, ravers take an
internal journey. They forget they are surrounded by four walls,
that other people are in the room, that the moon has said good
night.
</P>
<P>
   When ravers tire of dancing, they simply sit wherever they
happen to be standing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the kids give each other back rubs. Others post a
lookout as a youth licks a piece of paper no bigger than a postage
stamp, which suggests he's taking a hit of LSD.
</P>
<P>
   A few kids press their bodies and faces into the humongous
speakers, which are stacked to the ceiling. Others lie on the
floor, their bodies vibrating to bass strong enough to shake the
stalls in the bathroom. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
EARTHDANCE 98: OCT. 10, 1998 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The party at the Falcon Field hangar in Mesa is the kind of
place where raves used to be held _ mysterious and edgy. The blue
lights of the runway give it a surreal backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   Earthdance _ a global dance rave held in 52 locations
simultaneously _ is intended to raise money to help Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet tracks the rave scene, allowing such international
coordination. In Arizona, ravers frequent www.azraves.org, where
you can find calendar information, reviews, photographs and music
links.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the hangar, a candlelight shrine to the Dalai Lama glows
red, green and blue against the far wall. A few kids circulate a
petition protesting the Chinese occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing this for his holiness,'' says the promoter, Randy
Blankenship, a private investigator.
</P>
<P>
   But his holiness isn't going to get his tonight. At 1:40 a.m.,
Mesa police officers bust up the party. A police helicopter hovers
in the sky, shining a spotlight on the kids, who scream obscenities
and gesture with middle fingers extended.
</P>
<P>
   Officers say they shut down the party after receiving complaints
about the noise and people driving on runways. No arrests were made
and no report was filed.
</P>
<P>
   From California to Florida, police and city officials have shut
down raves, confiscated illegal drugs and rushed hallucinating kids
to hospitals. In Tampa, the city went so far as to outlaw raves.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Mike Torres, a spokesman for the Phoenix Police, says city
officials look askance at raves because of potential problems
including fire code violations, safety concerns, and the
consumption of drugs and liquor with little or no supervision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a problem with that type of dancing,'' Torres says.
``It becomes a free-for-all. In order to have that kind of fun, you
have to get into the right mind-set. The kids are conditioning
themselves prior to getting in. They are taking hallucinogens, such
as LSD.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that some kids at raves do drugs, including crystal
meth, Ecstasy and marijuana as well as LSD. Sometimes, drugs are
offered only a short distance from security guards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dusty Cagle, 17, a Greenway High School senior, admits drugs
are part of the scene but adds that drugs are elsewhere, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get offered drugs walking to school,'' she says. ``You got
to choose. You want to listen to the music, meditate, let yourself
go. Or you want to screw up your brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Cagle went to her first rave when she was 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets kids off the streets, gives them something to do,''
she says. ``You will never see any kids fighting or arguing. This
is a safe place. It's like a shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents agree.
</P>
<P>
   Lorena Izenberg of Mesa allows her 14-year-old son, Tyler
Woodruff, to attend raves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't sell alcohol,'' Izenberg says. ``They search the
kids before they go in. As long as he keeps his grades up, he can
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodruff, an eighth-grader at Stapley Junior High, says he is
there for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a place to dance to get away from reality, to release
frustrations,'' he says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOONSHINE OVER AMERICA 98: OCT. 24, 1998 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Nile on Oct. 24, about 1,000 ravers come out,
waiting to hear DJ Keoki, the headliner. Keoki, 34, is near the end
of his rave career but still draws fans.
</P>
<P>
   At a Denver rave, Miah Lovato, 18, of Albuquerque, heard that
Keoki would spin in Phoenix. Lovato and his friends call themselves
the Confetti Crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're candy ravers,'' says Lovato, wearing layers of kiddie
jewelry and trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Candy ravers tend to fixate on kiddie accessories. They wear
jewelry and clothes that grade-school children might wear. They
also pass out candy, such as Smarties, Jolly Ranchers and
Blow-Pops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more than a style of dressing _ it's an attitude,''
Lovato says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SKUL: NOV. 7, 1998 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first Saturday in November offers an extravagant event
produced by promoter Angel Lovado and his partner, Larenzo
Contriras.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many raves have become Kmart raves,'' Lovado says. ``People
think because they have $10,000 they can rent a warehouse and get
any old deejay. It's deeper than that.''
</P>
<P>
   At ``The Dome,'' a renovated warehouse under the Seventh Avenue
bridge, between Grant Avenue and Jefferson Street in Phoenix, the
promoters put on a $20,000 show.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters say these productions often take three to six months
to arrange. Permits must be secured, a site found, fliers printed,
deejays hired and flown in, equipment set up, portable toilets
rented.
</P>
<P>
   This event features Sugar Twist, an international club
performance group. The members _ from the U.S., Germany and
Amsterdam _ include fire-eaters, a contortionist, a stilt-walker,
two trapeze artists and dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Fire-eater Airick Heater, 32, has a techno-punk look going:
silver studs in his face, elephant tattoos on his forehead and
neck. The holes in his earlobes can stretch to fit a soda can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an apocalyptic sense of fashion. But I'm very
passive,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 5 a.m., the promoters end the party. Several
hundred kids hang around until the needle is lifted from the last
vinyl record.
</P>
<P>
   Lovado, the promoter, believes electro music is big and getting
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually it will get to a point that this music is on the
radio 24 hours a day. When these kids get older, they won't know
such artists as Mariah Carey.''
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Cohen, media director for Moonshine Records in Los
Angeles, believes the rave scene is flatlining.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about as big as it's going to get,'' he says in a phone
interview from LA. ``It's not going to explode. The music doesn't
have heart and soul. It doesn't look at you. It's all
computer-generated. The human input is minimum. Nobody is
sweating.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the case for the deejays. But for the under-21 crowd
_ too young to get into most nightclubs and bars _ they sweat
through the night, dancing at the one place that will have them. &QL;

TOUGH ROUTE SEEN FOR HUB SUIT VS. GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As Mayor Thomas M. Menino stood in the rain last week
talking of his planned lawsuit against gun manufacturers to recoup
costs associated with handgun violence in the city, a small crowd
gathered under umbrellas straining to hear him.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor made his remarks standing beside the Massachusetts
Turnpike, across from a new billboard urging gun owners to lock
their guns and prevent shooting accidents involving children. Cars
and trucks roared by, and Menino had to raise his voice above the
din.
</P>
<P>
   He may also have trouble being heard in court, legal specialists
say, where Menino faces steep challenges as he presses ahead with
the lawsuit. Specialists say that trying to extract millions from
gun makers for the cost of urban violence will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stretch,'' Kenneth Simons, a professor at Boston
University's law school and a specialist in liability, said of
lawsuits that seek damages from gun manufacturers, distributors,
and stores. Boston is preparing such a suit, following actions by
Chicago and New Orleans. ``It will definitely involve the extension
of existing legal principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is a surge of excitement about the gun-industry
lawsuits being brought by municipalities _ spurred in part by the
successes of state lawsuits against the tobacco industry _ there is
also widespread recognition that the suits are by no means easy
wins.
</P>
<P>
   They will require some stretching of laws governing product
liability.
</P>
<P>
   And the gun industry stands at the ready with potent precedents
that manufacturers cannot be held responsible for shootings where
their product is involved. Should distillers be responsible for
alcoholics, industry attorneys ask, or cattle ranchers responsible
for clogged arteries due to the consumption of red meat?
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, city officials are scrambling to put together the
strongest possible case. The city attorney, Merita Hopkins, met
with John Auerbach, head of the Public Health Commission, and aides
to the mayor Tuesday to put together the framework for the lawsuit,
said Menino aide Peter Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate choices are whether to model the Boston suit after
the New Orleans lawsuit, which alleges that gun manufacturers make
an inherently defective _ that is, unsafe _ product; or the Chicago
lawsuit, which alleges that gun makers and distributors knowingly
violate public nuisance laws by flooding the market with guns
favored by gang members; or, most likely, a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of issues we're still wrestling with,''
Welsh said. ``Clearly we're going to move ahead with product
liability. We've begun to look at nuisance. We need to determine
the proper jurisdiction, state or federal. And then put a dollar
figure on damages.... You don't want to throw something together
that doesn't have a hope of success.''
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the lawsuits being brought by the cities is not
necessarily to prevail in a trial. Municipalities hope to settle
with the gun industry, thereby reaping the kind of big money that
cigarette makers are paying to states that brought lawsuits against
them. Gun-control advocates also hope the threat of lawsuits will
prompt gun makers to put better safety locks on guns or voluntarily
scale back certain marketing efforts around cities.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston's legal team will have to put in long hours to make
sure the city lawsuit packs enough punch to be taken seriously by
gun makers, specialists say. Some of the arguments are new and
untested.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as easy as the claim in the tobacco case that they
are marketing it to innocent youths,'' said Simons, the BU law
professor.
</P>
<P>
   Courts may be concerned about the fairness of making
manufacturers responsible for the effects of their product when a
criminal uses a gun. The lawsuits could have a better chance if the
alleged liability were confined to shooting accidents, Simons
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless courts decide to change the law, it's a case that
probably won't survive a motion to dismiss,'' said David Kopel, a
law professor associated with the Independence Institute, a think
tank in Colorado supportive of the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kopel recalled that the city of Memphis tried to sue strip
clubs, alleging they created a public nuisance and attempting to
recover damages. ``The court said, `Hey, if you don't like strip
clubs, don't come to the courts, go to the Legislature.'''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gun industry has public relations people calling for
reality checks and downplaying this, but they're overestimating if
they think these old arguments are going to hold up,'' said Kip
Reader, a Cleveland attorney and chairman of the Tort and Insurance
Practice Section for the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are reasonable claims. They will involve a lot of work,
and there may be some initial skepticism from some judges and
jurors. But that's just the kind of skepticism you saw initially
with tobacco,'' said Richard Daynard, head of the Tobacco Products
Liability Project at Northeastern University. ``As (the cities)
work on it, I think they'll find paydirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, said the
Boston lawsuit could be promising, especially if there is ``smoking
gun'' evidence about gun manufacturers flooding the market with
guns around urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, he argued, it could inspire regulators to
take a fresh look at the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had more responsible and responsive legislatures that
took a more consistent overview of social problems, there would be
less impulse for courts to give this occasional prod,'' Tribe said.
``In fact, ... it takes a kind of dialogue among the branches of
government to get things going. It may look sloppy, but on balance,
it's a constructive interaction.''

HENRY HAMPTON: HIS VISION WAS INSPIRATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's difficult to overestimate the impressive legacy of Henry
Hampton, who died over the weekend at 58.
</P>
<P>
   The robust African-American brought energy and style, class and
accessibility, and intelligence and verve to a genre that often
suffers from the worst sin of all _ dullness.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's Blackside group produced ``Eyes on the Prize,'' the
definitive miniseries on the civil rights movement, which won
dozens of awards, including a Peabody and a DuPont. The
organization also made ``Eyes on the Prize II,'' a magnificent
sequel; ``The Great Depression''; and the five-hour series
``America's War on Poverty,'' a devastating, highly personal story
of how the United States failed its poor. In the latter, the
Hampton touch was particularly apparent. While not flinching from
the hollow-faced victims of orchestrated economic horror, Hampton
also gave them a dignity society seldom allows its lower classes.
Not since James Agee and Walker Evans collaborated on ``Let Us Now
Praise Famous Men'' has a document so elegantly captured the grim
face of hopelessness. And Hampton, through cool logic and artful
imagery, let the viewer know that it wasn't the victim's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ken Burns and other PBS documentarians who rely heavily
on talking heads and expert testimony, Hampton headed directly to
the sources. Whether it was a young girl whose life was forever
scarred by racism or a railroad worker stung by a strike, Hampton
never masked their pain through intellectual generalizations that
meekly try to explain away an American tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hampton had every right to be bitter. He scrambled to get
funding for ``Eyes on the Prize'' after many PBS sponsors turned
him down because of his ``inexperience.'' After that, he was
rejected because his films were ``too political'' at a time when
PBS was sensitive about funding films that might be seen as
critical of the Washington establishment, to whom the network
turned for money.
</P>
<P>
   But the films aren't Hampton's only significant contribution.
Hampton should be remembered not only for what he got done but how
he got it done.
</P>
<P>
   For those who had the pleasure of spending a few minutes in his
company, it was clear that ego had nothing to do with his
accomplishments. He never referred to the films as ``his,'' but as
``ours,'' acknowledging the contributions of everyone from
production assistants to producers Terry Kay Rockefeller, Callie
Crossley, and Orlando Blackwell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work as a team,'' he said a few years ago. ``Everyone makes
their own contribution _ none more significant than another.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton believed that teamwork was the key.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't accomplish anything by yourself,'' he said. ``Only a
fool believes that.'' Now that he's left us, we'll see what can be
accomplished without his unique, inspirational vision.

<P>
   UNDATED - The government is going after the killer with a
vehemence every victim's family dreams about.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the president's Cabinet flew in to the area to draw
attention to the case. All the TV stations and newspapers showed up
to watch Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt talk about how it was
``incomprehensible'' that anyone ``would resort to this kind of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The story was on the evening news and in all the papers.
</P>
<P>
   But, as good as publicity and moral indignation might be, it's
not often enough to motivate someone into turning in a killer. For
that, authorities need a more persuasive, a more convincing, more
practical law enforcement tool _ cash.
</P>
<P>
   This case has it.
</P>
<P>
   A $30,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the
arrests of the killer or killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that's a lot of money,'' said Ed Hutchinson, whose son
Ron was one of three people found shot to death in the Agua Fria
riverbed last Easter, a murder that's still unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 grand isn't for Ed's kid, however. It's for the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wolf is here to stay,'' a defiant Babbitt said earlier
this month. He was talking about the Mexican wolves being
reintroduced into Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Several have been killed during the past year. The government
offered a $10,000 reward. The environmental group Defender of
Wildlife added another $10,000. The Southwest Center for Biological
Diversity in Tucson added $5,000 more. And the author of ``Dances
With Wolves,'' Michael Blake, tossed in $5,000 more. &QL; 
An enviable effort &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hutchinson, without a son since April, envies the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The detectives told us nobody would come forward for less than
$5,000,'' he said. ``Well, with some work, we've got our reward up
to $11,000. But so far, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, 26-year-old Ron Hutchinson, along with Dewey Peters
IV, also 26, and 21-year-old Crystal Lynn Allison were found shot
to death. Ron had been at college, and hadn't been home long when
he ran into his old friend Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Saturday night, Dewey invited him to go with him to the
river,'' Ed said. ``It's a gathering place for young people. They
party down there.''
</P>
<P>
   A kid in an off-road vehicle spotted the bodies Sunday morning.
Two were in the bed of a pickup truck. One was on the ground
nearby. Sheriff's deputies don't have many leads.
</P>
<P>
   No Cabinet member has taken up the cause. The reward money is
more than most murder cases draw, thanks to a couple of corporate
contributions, but it's still not as much as the wolves are
getting.
</P>
<P>
   It outdoes the $1,000 offered for average cases in the local
Silent Witness program, however. Cases like that of Kathy
Pinkerton, shot in the head, her body found on the outskirts of
Gilbert after she tried to walk home July 8 after having car
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And Louis Bustamente, who fell asleep in his truck outside a
friend's house July 26 and was found later, shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of them drew the interest of a Cabinet member, either.
And no news conferences were called, like the one Maricopa County
Sheriff Joe Arpaio held over recent cat killings in Ahwatukee. &QL; 
Worth of victims &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the human victims didn't draw a $4,200 reward like
the one the Arizona Humane Society put up for the arrest and
conviction of the cat murderers.
</P>
<P>
   It's comparing apples to oranges, some say.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. About 20 years ago, I read a book called ``Of
Wolves and Men'' by Barry Lopez. You can't read this book and not
appreciate this magnificent animal. And want to protect it. And
study it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, humans aren't an endangered species, like wolves,
though we might be if we don't learn what wolves have to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons about loyalty and fidelity. About sticking together in a
pack. About, first and foremost, taking care of your own. &QL;

SALLY QUINN'S CAPITAL OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers

 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As both a sharp-elbowed Washington journalist and stunning
socialite, Sally Quinn, 57, has always had a knack for stirring the
pot. During her stints at The Washington Post, beginning almost 30
years ago, Quinn revolutionized her paper's Style pages with her
gossipy, gotcha coverage of the rich and famous. In his memoir, her
husband, former Post editor Ben Bradlee, wrote that Henry Kissinger
once said ``he felt like committing suicide after Sally Quinn wrote
about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's Quinn who's being written about as the focal point
of a political, journalistic, and personal firestorm. In a Nov. 2
article marking her return to regular Post duty, she offered up a
Beltway-eye view of the infamous ``disconnect'' _ elite
Washington's preoccupation with the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal
despite the rest of the nation's bone-aching fatigue with it.
</P>
<P>
   Headlined ``Not in Their Backyard,'' her Post story quoted
several dozen Beltway poobahs _ from ABC's Cokie Roberts to the
Reagans' former social secretary Muffie Cabot _ explaining why they
took such umbrage at the president's philandering. Much of the
``Washington Establishment is outraged by the president's behavior
in the Monica Lewinsky scandal,'' Quinn wrote. ``They feel
Washington has been brought into disrepute by the actions of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   For her trouble, Quinn has run afoul of the political zeitgeist,
earning the scorn of New York Times columnist Frank Rich, and
finding herself answering questions about her own sex life. Her
biggest offense: shining a bright light on Washington's insular,
insider culture at a time when much of the country disdains it as
an irrelevant outpost of pomposity.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Quinn said in an interview that she was simply
trying to give voice to official Washington, to provide some
Beltway ``sociology and anthropology.'' But what makes this more
than just a tale of intra-media skirmishing is that Quinn's story
proved what voters revealed in the stunning midterm elections. The
public's distaste for Washington's permanent pundit-and-partying
class outstrips any antipathy toward the wayward renter in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Quinn's story appeared, the C-SPAN lines were on
fire. ``The prevailing mood about the story that day was basically
livid,' recalls C-SPAN spokesman Richard Fahle. In its Nov. 23
cover story headlined ``Impeach the Media,'' New York magazine
declared the Quinn article a classic example of despised
``Washington-think'' and quoted Washington Monthly editor Charlie
Peters trashing it. (``Sally's had a very interesting sex life of
her own,'' he declared.)
</P>
<P>
   But the fiercest counterattack came from Rich, the liberal Times
columnist. In slashing Nov. 7 and 18 op-ed columns, he mocked the
sensibilities of Quinn's ``righteous Washingtonians,'' repeated
Peters' dishy quote, and accused her of ``writing like Tom Wolfe
minus the irony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kill the messenger. But it seems so bizarre,'' says
Quinn of Rich. ``He's having a major tantrum, and nobody knows what
it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradlee has another thought as he muses on the reaction to what
his ex-employee and wife of 20 years has written. ``I think they
wish she would shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;  Quinn and Post executive editor Leonard Downie Jr. say her story
germinated from a growing buzz from Washington insiders, one that
had been virtually ignored in all the stories about public reaction
to the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had written about what people in Washington were
talking about,'' says Quinn. ``We all knew there was a disconnect.
I had no idea I was going to come up with that much intense
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   After conducting ``hundreds'' of interviews, Quinn laid out her
findings. ``If Washington is a tribe, then the president is the
tribal chief,'' she wrote. ``He cannot be seen to dishonor the
tribe.'' She included independent counsel Kenneth Starr as a member
of the tribe, writing that Starr ``Is a Washington insider'' with
``many friends in both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn says she's getting a very positive feedback and Downie
adds that if the rest of the country is appalled, so be it. ``You
can disagree with what we are reporting on,'' he says. ``I really
don't care if we're popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the fallout: Washington Monthly editor Peters said that
``the frightening thing'' is that the article reflected most of the
Washington establishment. ``Sally is a charming person and Sally
made a considerable contribution to Washington journalism in her
early years,'' he added in an interview. ``It's just that she's
gotten into this queen bee thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a column he characterizes as ``tough'' but not ``ad
hominem,'' Rich wrote: ``Luckily for the country, not all the press
lives in Georgetown.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quinn wonders about the motives of her attackers. &UR;  &LR; ``I knew
that there would be a reaction,'' she says. ``I didn't realize it
would be so personal.'' In a December 1997 New York profile of
Quinn that followed the release of her book, ``The Party: A Guide
to Adventurous Entertaining,'' Alex Witchell wrote that her expert
hostess declined to offer her an additional cup of tea and pointed
her in the direction of the nearest cab when the interview was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only I had offered Alex another cup of tea or called her a
cab, this wouldn't be going on,'' says Quinn tartly.
</P>
<P>
   During a difficult Nov. 6 appearance on C-SPAN, Quinn had to
endure a caller's suggestion that she was unfit to judge Clinton
because she had advanced her career by sleeping with Bradlee when
he was her Post boss. ``Take a look at your own life,'' the caller
demanded. ``A lot of people said you slept your way to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Flustered, Quinn responded that ``We didn't get together until I
left the Washington Post and went to CBS'' in 1973. Bradlee's
memoir concurs, but he does acknowledge that he got anonymous mash
notes from Quinn before she left for CBS. And when she returned to
the Post after CBS, he wrote that she was often described as
``Bradlee's live-in girlfriend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so ugly and poisonous of Charlie Peters to say that and
so ugly for Frank to repeat it,'' she says angrily.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One other theory has surfaced in the wake of Quinn's Nov. 2
article: that it is the work of an FOB (Foe of Bill.) There is
certainly some evidence to suggest that the Clintons were not
clicking with her Quinn and her crowd. In a 1997 Times profile,
Quinn described the First Family's diminishing interest in
socializing, saying, ``A lot of people have the sense they're
already out of here in some odd way.'' And she acknowledges that
``we see them (the Clintons) very rarely socially.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a belief in Washington circles that Hillary
Clinton was upset by something Quinn wrote years ago. Some say it
was an August 1992 Post story chronicling Mrs. Clinton's changing
public image. Quinn believes it was a December 1992 piece she did
for Newsweek advising Hillary on how to navigate the ``treacherous
terrain called Washington,`` telling her to get a job outside of
government and to stop attending her husband's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard she was personally disappointed, and I didn't think it
was a hostile piece,'' says Quinn, who claims to have enjoyed a
``cordial'' relationship with Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those searching for a motive for her Nov. 2 story have
circulated a report from the pro-Clinton online magazine Salon
recalling Bradlee's gratitude to Ken Starr for a 1987 ruling that
helped the Post win an expensive libel suit.``He freed us,'' says
Bradlee of Starr. But ``the idea that I am, in any way, a
right-wing anti-Democrat _ that's the first time anyone's said that
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, though, Quinn's critics don't quarrel
with Quinn's reporting, just her subject matter. (Even Rich admits,
``it was an extremely candid and accurate piece.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a portrait of Washington as an elitist group,''
says media analyst and Beltway resident Bernard Kalb. ``This is an
invitation for coast-to-coast psychiatric evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   In her own way, Quinn admits the city needs a shrink. The
Clintons ``had the effect of polarizing so many people who have
been close friends,'' she says. ``The city has been ravaged in a
kind of emotional and psychological way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the New York magazine story, Clinton political operative
James Carville offers his own view of the mental state of Quinn and
her friends. ``I like the way she calls (Washington) a village,''
he said. ``Remember how you were taught in grade school about what
every village had? Idiots.''

A LEAP INTO THE MARKET COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What bear market?
</P>
<P>
   While broad stock market measures eclipsed old records Monday,
scores of companies could boast about powerful rallies of their
own. And most of them have been sorely in need of a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Project Software &AMP; Development Corp. performed just
like many other Massachusetts stocks this summer, slipping from a
springtime high and unable regain its footing before prices had
been cut in half in the early fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bedford, Mass. software company has also typified the
booming recovery in local stocks that began on Oct. 8 and stretched
through Monday's trading. Project Software shares have more than
doubled since then, climbing 114 percent on a pleasant
third-quarter earnings surprise.
</P>
<P>
   An amazing total of 77 stocks, all members of the Bloomberg
Massachusetts index, have appreciated by at least 50 percent in the
last six weeks. The index is made up of 337 issues.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the Bloomberg Massachusetts stocks are up at
least 25 percent during that period. Some are larger companies
battered in the summer stock market, including integrated circuit
maker Analog Devices Inc. (up 57.2 percent), retailer TJX Cos. (up
49.3 percent), computer storage king EMC Corp. (up 43.2 percent),
and BankBoston Corp. (up 42.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   But many of the soaring local stocks are small issues or even
smaller microcap companies, whose prices had bounced back so
dramatically for the very same reason they plunged in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Poor liquidity _ a very limited number of buyers or sellers of a
small stock at any given time _ tends to exaggerate the market's
reaction to good or bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that missed their forecast quarterly earnings often
lost 30 percent to 40 percent of market value in a single day this
summer. For now, companies like Project Software are getting the
same kind of super-ball bounce from performance that exceeds
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Project Software reported quarterly earnings that were 9 cents
per share better than consensus forecasts on Nov. 6, and its stock
bolted up by 8 1/8, gaining 46 percent that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about very small allocations of cash from some of
the large institutions into some of these very small names,'' said
Bernice Behar, manager of the John Hancock Emerging Growth fund.
``It doesn't take very much for these stocks to move very
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate earnings that propel stocks aren't always higher, just
better than expected. Combine the pleasant surprise with lower
interest rates, the lubricant that helps all stocks rise, and
investors are buying.
</P>
<P>
   Money does seem to be moving into companies, big or small, that
can demonstrate an improving profit picture. Defensive measure such
as a company's stock price to its book value was a helpful tool
until the market began its rally, according to Bart Geer, manager
of the State Street Research Alpha fund. Now, Geer said, data
tracking a stock's price in relation to forecasts for its future
profits is more relevant for tracking a more aggressive market.
</P>
<P>
   But earnings reports don't account for all of the stock rallies.
There are a handful of subplots that explain the bounce in these
Massachusetts stocks:
</P>
<P>
   _Internet mania. Locals Lycos Inc. of Waltham (up 139.9 percent)
and CMG Information Services Inc. of Andover (up 117.7 percent)
soared with the rest of the group.
</P>
<P>
   _The financial stock recovery. The Federal Reserve's interest
rate cuts have been good news for most banks. Fleet Financial Group
Inc., which had not fallen nearly so far as BankBoston during the
summer, has advanced 31.8 percent since Oct. 8. Shares of the
state's bigger local banks are mostly up 20 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _The semiconductor rally. Earnings at semiconductor companies _
which were hammered by the Asian contagion _ haven't bounced back
yet, but orders are improving and that's good news to the
businesses that serve them. Semiconductor equipment makers PRI
Automation Inc. of Billerica (up 138.8 percent) and Teradyne Inc.
of Boston (up 93.4 percent) lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   _Special situtations like Aware Inc., the best-performing local
stock with a market value of at least $250 million over the last
six weeks. Aware, up 279 percent during that period, soared when a
United Nations agency adopted an international Internet access
standard that uses Aware's technology.

   BOOKS-COOK (Undated) ``Seasons Readings,'' a roundup of cook and
food books. By Gregory Roberts. (story will move in the ``e''
category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BABE (Undated) This little piggy very nearly didn't make it
to market. As of last week, prints weren't ready and Universal was
telling the world the filmmakers were still synching in the animal
voices. However, the reality was quite different. The studio took
one look at director George Miller's dark vision in this sequel to
``Babe'' ordered him back in the editing room to cut away the
edginess until the film could garner a G, instead of PG, rating.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BUGS (Undated) It's bound to be compared to the recently
released ``Antz,'' but ``A Bug's Life'' is a very different movie
altogether. Its similarities end with the fact that it, too, is
clever, inventive and a lot of fun for the entire family.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-HOME (Undated) Even though its release date has repeatedly
been pushed back, ``Home Fries'' has garnered good word-of-mouth on
the film festival circuit. Still, it's easy to see why this quirky,
odd little movie might be considered a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-CRUISE (Undated) ``The Cruise,'' which is shot in black and
white, makes New York City glisten.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-WIND (Undated) Perhaps some institutions should just be
left alone. Certainly the beloved children's classic, ``The Wind In
The Willows,'' written by novelist Kenneth Grahame and published in
1908, is an example.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-RING (Undated) A disclaimer in the credits states
``Ringmaster'' is not affiliated with Jerry Springer's successful
afternoon talk show. But ``Ringmaster,'' which is Springer's big
screen grab at bigger stardom, is about a TV host named Jerry
Farrelly, who invites ``ordinary Americans'' to come on ``The Jerry
Show,'' air their dirty family laundry, engage in brawls and sit
through penance as Jerry (who has no qualifications as a therapist)
analyzes their actions. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Nechak. (story will move in the ``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BAD (Undated) The publicity materials say ``Very Bad
Things'' is a ``mad, crazed comic vision.'' It might be more
accurate to describe the film as Peter Berg's infantile hostility
fobbing itself off as ``art.''

`A BUG'S LIFE' IS AMBITIOUS _ AND IT SUCCEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's bound to be compared to the recently released ``Antz,'' but
``A Bug's Life'' is a very different movie altogether. Its
similarities end with the fact that it, too, is clever, inventive
and a lot of fun for the entire family.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but it's already been three years since Disney
and Pixar Animation released the smash ``Toy Story.'' If you
thought computer animation and technology were pretty ingenious
then, you'll be amazed by the equally creative strides made in ``A
Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Many major movie and TV talents have contributed their voices to
the film, including Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey, Julia Louis-Dreyfus,
Phyllis Diller, David Hyde Pierce, Denis Leary and Bonnie Hunt as
well as veteran actor Roddy McDowall, who recently passed away.
</P>
<P>
   The story is based upon Aesop's fable about an idle grasshopper,
who whiles away his time playing his fiddle, while a colony of ants
toils nearby. The grasshopper gets hungry and begs the little
workers for food. In ``A Bug's Life,'' the grasshoppers have been
enlarged and turned into villains, with their leader, Hopper
(Spacey), demanding the entire harvest _ or else.
</P>
<P>
   One small ant named Flik (Foley) stands up to Hopper and his
thugs. Despite warnings that it's a ``bug eat bug world out
there,'' Flik treks off toward the big bug city to find
``warriors'' to help his colony fight the enemy. By mistake, he
discovers a flea circus of washed up performers _ a pair of
Hungarian pillbugs, a kindly black widow, a male ladybug and a
praying mantis magician among them.
</P>
<P>
   He mistakes them for brave bugs after he glimpses them engaged
in a bar brawl. Flik and his newfound friends dream up a wild
scheme to rid the ants of their unwanted enemies _ and to help the
Queen Ant (Diller), Princess Atta (Louis-Dreyfus) and the little
princess, Dot _ keep the colony together and safe from harm.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the film, it's virtually impossible to tell if
scenes are computer generated or shot with a CinemaScope camera and
lens. The movie is ambitious in other ways as well. While ``Toy
Story'' focused on a small group of characters and used mostly
indoor sets, much of ``A Bug's Life'' takes place in wide open
spaces so the animation depicts huge vistas, diverse grades of
shade and light, pounding thunderstorms - and ``crowd scenes'' that
included up to 800 ants.
</P>
<P>
   The film's creators were concerned with what they called the
``ick'' factor, since many people loathe bugs and consider them
more than a little creepy. The technicians viewed National
Geographic specials, the documentary ``Microcosmos'' and consulted
entymologists from around the world, then went to work to make
insects appealing to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a quick-witted, fast-paced delight that works on
several levels. The script is elemental and simple so it will to
appeal to very young kids and the jokes are sophisticated enough to
keep adults glued to their seats. And even if the story doesn't
grab hard-hearts and cynics, the artistry is more than enough to
keep all ages rapt.
</P>
<P>
   A Bug's Life. Directed by John Lasseter. Written by Andrew
Stanton, Donald McEnery, Bob Shaw. With the voices of Kevin Spacey,
Dave Foley, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Phyllis Diller, David Hyde Pierce,
Denis Leary. Walt Disney Pictures. 97 minutes. Rated G.

PATRIOTS DISPLAY HEART IN THE FACE OF HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In the end, it was about Heart instead of
Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   It was 20 minutes to midnight when the black cloud finally
lifted over the worst pro football stadium in America. For a few
joyous seconds, there was no thought about injuries, Jets, firings,
or relocations to other states.
</P>
<P>
   With their season about to go down the hopper, their coach about
to face a firing squad, and their owner prepared to join the
Witness Protection Program, the New England Patriots saved their
season and maybe their souls with a pulsating 26-23 victory over
the Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Much-maligned Drew Bledsoe, quarterback of the future Hartford
Patriots, took the Patriots 80 yards in 15 plays, connecting with
Shawn Jefferson for a 25-yard touchdown pass with 29 seconds left
to give the Patriots a rare and badly needed ``Monday Night
Football'' win.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was just about football again. It was about Bledsoe
completing 28 of 54 passes for 423 yards (the second-best effort of
his career) and converting two third-down plays and two fourth-down
plays in the final drive. It was about Jefferson _ who botched a
play that could have won last week's game at Buffalo _ making a
Willie Mays over-the-shoulder catch to bring home the win.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the drama, Bledsoe broke his finger midway through the
drive and almost came out of the game. Bet he's glad he stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was any way I could stay in the game, I was going to
do it,'' Bledsoe said. ``I couldn't get a very good grip on the
ball. The ball was taking off on me a little bit. But I'd be damned
if I was going to let Zo (backup Scott Zolak) come in in that
situation. That's the situation you dream about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of stuff we're counting on and we're going to
need it,'' said Patriots coach Pete Carroll. ``We like to win in
that kind of fashion. It was fun. We needed it. Obviously, we
desperately needed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great time tonight and I hope you did, too. We won a
game in dramatic fashion and we needed it badly. We have to focus
on Buffalo (next week's opponent). We can't go too crazy on one
game because it is just one.''
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake. If Bledsoe hadn't converted the fourth-down
plays, this season was over. The Patriots would have slumped to
5-6, three games behind the Dolphins with an 0-4 record against the
three teams ahead of them in their division.
</P>
<P>
   But the season is not over. There will be football talk for the
rest of this week and some of it will concern play on the gridiron
rather than play in the Connecticut legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's thriller was the first game since Bob ``I cried
when the Braves left town'' Kraft announced his intention to take
the team out of town for 350 million pieces of silver.
</P>
<P>
   In the time-honored tradition of nationally televised New
England football follies, there was a circuslike atmosphere around
Foxboro Stadium until the final drive of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Jilted fans toting signs that maligned Massachusetts Speaker of
the House Thomas Finneran and Kraft filled the parking lots, then
filed into the inadequate stadium to see the Patriots and Fish in
windswept, 52-degree temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   The players were armed with a checklist of handy-dandy excuses.
They've been ravaged by injury and this week had to perform under
the cloud of uncertainty that comes when your owner says he's
moving the team out of state for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   None of this made life any easier for Carroll and his staff. The
Patriots had lost four of their last five and faced the almost
certain prospect that a loss would put them out of the playoffs for
1998. This, in turn, almost certainly would assure that Carroll
would not be on the sideline for any games in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kraft was seen only briefly on the field before the
game. TV crews staked out all corners of the stadium, but the
once-ubiquitous owner was harder to find than Whitey Bulger. He did
give an interview to ABC's Lesley Visser, but on this night there
was no golf cart victory lap, no autograph session, no papal waving
from the owner's box.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's welfare son was on the minds of the fandom. A boy
and his dad carried a sign featuring a cartoon of Kraft toting a
briefcase full of dollars. The script read, ``He could go all the
way ... to Hartford?''
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, a man held a sign with photos of Finneran and
Montgomery Burns, the power plant owner on ``The Simpsons.'' The
sign read, ``Separated at birth.'' Another man held a ``Sack
Finneran'' placard.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of signage in the parking lot as well. A red
pickup featured a tailgate billboard that stated, ``Impeach Tom
Finneran's Dictorial Rule.'' ``Dictorial'' is not a word, but hey,
these are Patriot fans.
</P>
<P>
   The sentiment stretched to Interstate 95, where a blue Chevy
Celebrity wagon rode south sporting plywood on both sides
exclaiming, ``Boycott Pats ... No team, no fans.''
</P>
<P>
   There was concern that the ever-exuberant Patriot fans,
fortified by hours of pregame antifreeze ingestion, might be a tad
rowdy given the recent play of the team, coupled with Kraft's
intent to blow town.
</P>
<P>
   But all that went away as the Dolphins and Patriots put on a
pretty fair display of football.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our fans, I want to say thanks for coming out and
supporting us the way they did,'' said Bledsoe. ``There was a lot
of controversy about the move and all.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, it was about Heart instead of Hartford.

`HOME FRIES' IS QUIRKY AND OFFBEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though its release date has repeatedly been pushed back,
``Home Fries'' has garnered good word-of-mouth on the film festival
circuit. Still, it's easy to see why this quirky, odd little movie
might be considered a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   It has no real star power and boasts such an offbeat sense of
humor that it defies mainstream marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' is reminiscent of of a Beth Henley play (and who
went to see ``Miss Firecracker'' or ``Crimes of the Heart?'') and
Warner Bros. probably didn't know what to do with this gothic
comedy. Now they're pitching it as a ``romance,'' though its unwed
female heroine has been impregnated by her middle-aged married
lover.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Barrymore plays Sally Jackson, a young woman who loves
Dolly Parton and has to work the drive-up window at the local
Burger-Matic so customers can't see her ``condition.'' Her baby's
dad, Henry Lever, has a wife (Catherine O'Hara) and two grown
stepsons, Dorian (Luke Wilson) and Angus (Jake Busey) but
soft-hearted Sally's only just given him the boot because he didn't
tell her he had a wife until after she'd conceived.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry is found dead of unknown causes (he's literally
scared to death), life becomes crazily complicated. Henry's widow
wants to find the bimbo he was fooling around with. Her son Angus
goes on a rampage to rid his manipulative mother of the thorn in
her side _ Henry's unknown mistress.
</P>
<P>
   But Dorian falls in love with Sally. He has no idea she's his
stepdaddy's girlfriend. Sally doesn't know Dorian is Henry's
stepson. All hell breaks loose once Angus figures out who is who
and he goes totally nuts after mom reveals that Dorian was always
her favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The script for ``Home Fries'' was written in 1988 and was
discovered at a screenplay writing contest sponsored by the
governor of Virginia. Vince, its young writer, has gone on to
become a creative consultant for TV's ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, ``Home Fries' has loopy energy and off-kilter charm
that make it likable and even touching in spots. Most of the time
it works, though there are moments that try too hard and miss the
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore and Luke Wilson, who was the best thing in the indie
sleeper ``Bottle Rocket,'' have an easy-going chemistry that's
apparently filtered over into real life. It's Wilson who keeps the
``Home Fries'' burning. He has a neat screen presence that is
heightened by a sleepy sense of comic timing. When he's center
stage, the film cooks. As for the rest, it's an acquired taste.
</P>
<P>
   Home Fries. Directed by Dean Parisot. Written by Vince Gilligan.
Cast: Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson, Catherine O'Hara, Jake Busey,
Shelley Duvall. Warner Bros. 92 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language,
sexual content.

NEW YORK CITY SHINES IN `THE CRUISE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Welcome to New York City,'' says Gray Line tour guide Timothy
``Speed'' Levitch in greeting. ``To tell a literary history is to
tell the story of the world. Fasten your seat belts.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will need to fasten their seat belts as well during this
wild ride of a documentary about Levitch, who does the ``double
decker loop downtown'' and who entertains passengers with a
non-stop monologue that verges on a pathological obsession with the
historical and architectural origins of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch attains a new level of poetry with his rambling musings
about everyone and everything that zips by. The Chrysler Building
is ``uninspired voluptuousness'' and Central Park was ``birthed by
Transcendentalists. No baseball or sweating were allowed.'' He
regales his fares with off-color stories about H.G. Wells, Jack
Reed, Dylan Thomas and Dorothy Parker. He seems to know everything
about the city and its ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   But as Bennett Miller's compulsively watchable documentary
progresses, the cracks in Levitch's veneer begin to show. By the
end, he's spewing venom over the fact that his grandparents think
he's a failure and we begin to wonder if this energized,
larger-than-life character isn't just a bit nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Miller cruises by every corner and landmark in New York on
virtually no budget. Yet ``The Cruise,'' which is shot in black and
white, makes the city glisten. It's an ``organic'' view that takes
us deep into the core of the Big Apple, as well as Levitch's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cruise'' is ultimately about the inter-dependence between
Levitch and the 2{-mile wide, 13{ mile-long island. And though he
admits he has a love/hate relationship with the place, he couldn't
survive anywhere else. He needs the energy it provides to fuel his
crazy pace and with every run-on sentence he utters about New York,
he could just as easily be talking about himself.
</P>
<P>
   He's as much in a state of ``constant fluctuation'' as the city.
Consequently, Miller never has the opportunity to dig too deeply
into Levitch's psychological make-up. While Levitch seems eternally
on the edge of boiling over and spinning out of control, he emerges
as fascinating as the town he loves so much.
</P>
<P>
   The Cruise. Directed by Bennett Miller. Documentary. Artisan
Entertainment. 76 minutes. Unrated.

`THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS' IS A NOVEL BETTER LEFT UNTOUCHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK   The Wind In The Willows. Perhaps some
institutions should just be left alone. Certainly the beloved
children's classic, ``The Wind In The Willows,'' written by
novelist Kenneth Grahame and published in 1908, is an example.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Or, at least, it could have been brought to the screen with less
adult sensibility. Monty Python is too coarse and lead-footed to
depict such a wistful tale.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Terry Jones' (who was a member of the British
comedy troupe) live action approach to Grahame's book is often
plodding and dull and he entirely misses the delicate innuendo in
the timeless tale of old friends Mole, Rat, Toad and Badger. That,
or he's forgotten what it's like to view the world from a less
grown-up point of view.
</P>
<P>
   One day Mole (Steve Coogan) suffers a terrible hardship. His
quiet home, situated in a peaceful meadow owned by Toad (Terry
Jones) has been destroyed by progress. Toad, in his extravagance
and constant need for cash, has sold the land to the greedy Weasel
leader (Antony Sher).
</P>
<P>
   Depressed, Mole consults his friend, Rat (Eric Idle), who just
wants to picnic on the river. But the nasty weasels have a plan to
make picnics illegal on the river. They want to buy all Toad's
property and his palatial Toad Hall and turn it into a dog food
factory. The timid Mole, friendly Rat, and silly Toad must find a
way to keep peace in rural England _ and drum the evil weasels out.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' adaptation also includes human rabbits making love by the
side of the road and weasels drinking and groping each other in
homoerotic glee while flags that strongly resemble Nazi banners
hang on the walls behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Jones defends his version by arguing the story is ``full of
descriptions of a bucolic England that's vanished'' or that it is
``firmly embedded in middle-class society at the turn of the
century, and it's hard to imagine children nowadays responding to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because obviously enough kids still do. But Jones can't find the
balance between Monty Python-esque humor and the childlike world
that ``The Wind In The Willows'' typlifies so well. He's made a
film for adults, not kids.
</P>
<P>
   The Wind In The Willows. Directed and written by Terry Jones.
Cast: Steve Coogan, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Antony
Sher, Nicol Williamson, John Cleese, Stephen Fry, Michael Palin,
Julia Sawalha. Guild Pathe. 88 minutes. Unrated.

OF WOLVES AND MEN AND MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The government is going after the killer with a
vehemence every victim's family dreams about.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the president's Cabinet flew in to the area to draw
attention to the case. All the TV stations and newspapers showed up
to watch Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt talk about how it was
``incomprehensible'' that anyone ``would resort to this kind of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The story was on the evening news and in all the papers.
</P>
<P>
   But, as good as publicity and moral indignation might be, it's
not often enough to motivate someone into turning in a killer. For
that, authorities need a more persuasive, a more convincing, more
practical law enforcement tool _ cash.
</P>
<P>
   This case has it.
</P>
<P>
   A $30,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the
arrests of the killer or killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that's a lot of money,'' said Ed Hutchinson, whose son
Ron was one of three people found shot to death in the Agua Fria
riverbed last Easter, a murder that's still unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   The 30 grand isn't for Ed's kid, however. It's for the wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wolf is here to stay,'' a defiant Babbitt said earlier
this month. He was talking about the Mexican wolves being
reintroduced into Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Several have been killed during the past year. The government
offered a $10,000 reward. The environmental group Defender of
Wildlife added another $10,000. The Southwest Center for Biological
Diversity in Tucson added $5,000 more. And the author of ``Dances
With Wolves,'' Michael Blake, tossed in $5,000 more. &QL; 
An enviable effort &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ed Hutchinson, without a son since April, envies the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The detectives told us nobody would come forward for less than
$5,000,'' he said. ``Well, with some work, we've got our reward up
to $11,000. But so far, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 12, 26-year-old Ron Hutchinson, along with Dewey Peters
IV, also 26, and 21-year-old Crystal Lynn Allison were found shot
to death. Ron had been at college, and hadn't been home long when
he ran into his old friend Dewey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Saturday night, Dewey invited him to go with him to the
river,'' Ed said. ``It's a gathering place for young people. They
party down there.''
</P>
<P>
   A kid in an off-road vehicle spotted the bodies Sunday morning.
Two were in the bed of a pickup truck. One was on the ground
nearby. Sheriff's deputies don't have many leads.
</P>
<P>
   No Cabinet member has taken up the cause. The reward money is
more than most murder cases draw, thanks to a couple of corporate
contributions, but it's still not as much as the wolves are
getting.
</P>
<P>
   It outdoes the $1,000 offered for average cases in the local
Silent Witness program, however. Cases like that of Kathy
Pinkerton, shot in the head, her body found on the outskirts of
Gilbert after she tried to walk home July 8 after having car
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And Louis Bustamente, who fell asleep in his truck outside a
friend's house July 26 and was found later, shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of them drew the interest of a Cabinet member, either.
And no news conferences were called, like the one Maricopa County
Sheriff Joe Arpaio held over recent cat killings in Ahwatukee. &QL; 
Worth of victims &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the human victims didn't draw a $4,200 reward like
the one the Arizona Humane Society put up for the arrest and
conviction of the cat murderers.
</P>
<P>
   It's comparing apples to oranges, some say.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think so. About 20 years ago, I read a book called ``Of
Wolves and Men'' by Barry Lopez. You can't read this book and not
appreciate this magnificent animal. And want to protect it. And
study it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, humans aren't an endangered species, like wolves,
though we might be if we don't learn what wolves have to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons about loyalty and fidelity. About sticking together in a
pack. About, first and foremost, taking care of your own. &QL;

A MODEST PROPOSAL FOR THE 1990S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call me savage, but news that Wall Street firms are laying off
workers has raised spittle to the corners of my mouth and sent me
racing for my carving knife. It is these financial institutions
that have dished up the promise over the years that if we only
followed their advice we'd gorge on a never-ending feast of stock
market riches.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? Now average investors like me are beginning to
wonder whether they will be able to put food on the table in the
wake of the world's economic and stock market bedlam. Sure, stocks
have recovered, but don't be fooled. As the Wall Street layoffs
suggest, the waiter will soon arrive at your table with several
more courses guaranteed to produce indigestion and penury.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with rare belly-rubbing satisfaction that I see in
recent weeks that Merrill Lynch has cut 3,400 jobs. ING Barings has
shaved 1,200 workers. J.P. Morgan is lopping off 5 percent of its
work force, or about 740 people. BT Alex. Brown is reported to be
considering chopping 10 percent of its 18,000 staffers. Other cuts
are expected to follow this first wave.
</P>
<P>
   What a shock for this class of worker. For the past 15 years,
Wall Street employees have enjoyed the fruits of an unparalled rise
in stock prices, no doubt savoring the richest of cuisine and the
finest of liqueurs, and, as will happen, growing fat and succulent
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   With the overabundance of Wall Streeter flesh and the
simultaneous scarcity on the average investor's dinner table, I
feel compelled by fairness to present ``A Modest Proposal for
Preventing the Surplus Workers of the Financial Industry From Being
a Burden to Their Employers, and for Making Them Beneficial to the
Investing Public.''
</P>
<P>
   I humbly propose that in place of laying off these
chubby-cheeked outcasts, Wall Street firms can benefit not only
their own bottom line but also the dining public by slaughtering
the workers and offering them as free grub to the hungry hordes of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, on the face of it my proposal may appear distasteful,
but its advantages are manifold. In the first place, the brokerage
firms will eliminate the costs of job reduction. Slaughtering a
worker obviates the need to pay that worker for graciously
departing from the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, for instance, had to earmark $430 million to do
away with its jobs. The common-sense approach would be a genuine
flesh-and-blood slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   As for cash-strapped investors, they will be pleased by the
aroma of roasting Wall Streeter wafting from their ovens. I would
encourage the financial firms to complete their carcass giveaway by
Thanksgiving, allowing investors to have a broker for dinner rather
than the traditional turkey. Imagine the jubilant face of the
investor as broker juice dribbles over his lips. It is a clinically
proven digestive fact that munching on the roasted meat of a broker
who has plunged you into poverty-stricken retirement reduces an
excess accumu-lation of bile.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope that the financial industry layoffs accelerate.
At the current level, the flow of carcasses will in no way meet the
soaring demand from kitchens across America. Many investors would
like their broker's head on a platter, but it is clear that it will
be some time before every table in our great country is so graced.
What's more, experience has shown that barely 15 percent of any
broker is edible, the rest being composed of little more than hot
air. Had there been more meat on the bone and less hokum on the
tongue from the start, these lamentable circumstances might never
have come to pass.

`VERY BAD THINGS' IS, WELL, VERY BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publicity materials say ``Very Bad Things'' is a ``mad,
crazed comic vision.'' It might be more accurate to describe the
film as Peter Berg's infantile hostility fobbing itself off as
``art.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who is best known as a doctor on the TV series ``Chicago
Hope,'' actually had a moderately promising film career prior to
his moving to the small screen. ``Very Bad Things'' represents his
first effort as a director and writer and it's safe to say he
shouldn't give up his day job.
</P>
<P>
   Few filmmakers do pitch black comedy well. The Coen Brothers had
a success with ``Fargo'' and Scottish director Danny Boyle crossed
over in the United States with ``Shallow Grave.'' Neil LaBute made
waves with his scathing comedy ``In The Company of Men'' (and
recently ``Your Friends and Neighbors'') and Todd Solondz hit the
mark with ``Happiness'' and ``Welcome to the Dollhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Coens and Boyle have also had their share of failures
while working in the genre. Though Berg blatantly borrows from
these more accomplished and better films, he hasn't the skill or
depth to create either true satire or make a barbed statement on
the bleakness of the human condition with this lame effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to hell; hell or prison, whichever comes first,''
laments Adam Berkow (Daniel Stern). In the midst of throwing a stag
party in a ritzy Las Vegas hotel suite for pal Kyle Fisher (Jon
Favreau), who is about to marry ``creature like no other'' Laura
Garrety (Cameron Diaz), the $900 a night live ``entertainment'' is
brutally impaled while having sex with Adam's crazy brother,
Michael (Jeremy Piven). Leave it to Boyd (Christian Slater), a
sociopath of the first order, to come up with a plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can call the police. Or we can dispose of the 105-pound
problem in the desert,'' says Boyd. First, however, all five
friends, including shy mechanic Moore (Leland Orser), must agree to
keep mum about their bad behavior. But like all ill-devised simple
plans, this one runs amok in unanticipated complications. Soon the
``boys'' are battling each other and the trail to hell gets
bloodier and bleaker than Kyle could have ever envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Cliched, badly structured and, by the end, relentlessly tiresome
in its unmitigated gratuitous violence, immaturity and lack of
redemption or purpose, Berg's film seems to be purging some
personal vendetta against humanity. There's no remorse or iota of
conscience in any of the characters; they're all selfish and,
worse, they're boring.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Very Bad Things'' is an indicator of what is passing for
entertainment these days, much less comedy, perhaps it's time we
humans quit thinking of ourselves as the most civilized rung of the
evolutionary ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Very Bad Things. Directed and written by Peter Berg. Cast:
Christian Slater, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Stern, Jon Favreau, Jeanne
Tripplehorn. Polygram Films. 100 minutes. Rated R for graphic
violence, nudity, sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: F

POSTCARDS FROM CLOUD-CUCKOO LAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did the Democrats steal the 1996 election, selling out American
trade policy and defense secrets to China to finance a ``comeback
advertising blitz'' that saved Bill Clinton and Al Gore from defeat
at the hands of Bob Dole, Steve Forbes, and the rest of the GOP?
</P>
<P>
   That's what New York Times columnist William Safire believes.
This proposition is behind the faint, tinny drum-rattling on the
right that still can be heard, as the stalwarts seek to rally the
congressional Republicans to impeachment's froth-and-spittle
stained flag.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno must announce by today whether she
will appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Vice President
Gore. The issue is whether Gore told the truth when he said he did
not know that campaign contributions he solicited would be split
between ``hard'' money &UR;  &LR; (which could be spent on his reelection
campaign) and ``soft'' money (which could be spent only on
``issues'' advertising).
</P>
<P>
   He may have lied. Reno was badgered by the House Judiciary
Committee into launching a preliminary investigation of the matter,
after notes surfaced that suggested Gore may have been aware that
the distinction was being blurred. Nevertheless, the attorney
general is widely expected to say no to an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Certainly not to curry favor with the nation's
editorialists.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editorialized incessantly about the 1996
election over the summer. ``Law School for Reno'' in July was
followed by ``The Firestorm Cometh,'' &UR;  &LR; ``The Prosecutor Who Spoke
Up,'' ``Giving Ms. Reno Time to Study,'' ``The Reno Watch,'' ``One
Tiny Step for Janet Reno,'' ``Another Itty Bitty Reno Step,''
``Janet Reno May Finally Get It,'' and finally, in September, ``The
Change in Ms. Reno's Course.'' (``The subterfuge fooled no one but
Reno and her advisers in the Justice Department's misnamed Public
Integrity section.'')
</P>
<P>
   So did The Wall Street Journal. (``We may still get to the
truth, but probably only after Janet Reno succeeds in first
discrediting her ability to handle it.'') Even The Boston Globe
twice joined in. (``For more than a year now, her failure to act
has created the appearance of partisan political tampering.'')
</P>
<P>
   The hallmark of all these editorials is that they make no
mention of the storm of bitter controversy that has torn the nation
apart for the past year. The presence of Kenneth Starr on the
political and ethical landscape was of no concern as these writers
argued for a new round of investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nation's three leading newspapers, only The Washington
Post has supported the attorney general's cautious reading of the
election laws _ for the good if somewhat narrow reasons that she
herself has offered. The campaign finance laws are too porous to
convict anyone for much of anything, Reno has argued. The decision
of a federal judge last month to dismiss five of six charges
against Democratic Party fund-raiser Maria Hsia demonstrated that
the campaign finance laws themselves are riddled with loopholes;
not even a special prosecutor would stand much of a chance of
gaining convictions.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of things to wonder about in the 1996
presidential elections. Campaign finance was a mess on both sides.
Those presidential coffees and Lincoln bedroom overnights were
hardly high crimes and misdemeanors, however. Not even the
unprecedented probe of presidential financial defenses by Asian
donors was sufficient to warrant extending the four-year
inquisition of a politically appointed prosecutor unchecked by any
other agency of government _ not even by public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of reason to worry about the influence of big
money in politics. The independent counsel law is no way to deal
with the problem. No wonder then that the blue-ribbon committee of
the American Bar Association that helped write the independent
counsel law _ and that lobbied strongly for its reauthorization _
is on the verge of urging that it now be allowed to lapse.
</P>
<P>
   So let's hope it will be three cheers for Reno. Two more
decisions remain after today _ in the matters of former White House
chief of staff Harold Ickes and Clinton himself. Against the
withering scorn of the editorial writers, the attorney general
seems to be ready to maintain her independence.

BOOKS FOR COOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY ROBERTS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year, American book publishers pump out hundreds of
cookbooks: fat and thin, long and short, plain and fancy,
complicated and simple. Finding the wheat among all that chaff is
no easy task, on matter how vivid your culinary imagination.
</P>
<P>
   What can make it easier to sort through the deluge is to come up
with a strategy, a point of view, a hook _ what journalists call an
angle.
</P>
<P>
   Or in this case, several angles. And no angle is more hallowed,
more time-honored, more cherished than ...
</P>
<P>
   THE LOCAL ANGLE
</P>
<P>
   This category includes books either by Northwest authors or
about Northwest cooking . . . or both.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Caprial's Bistro-Style Cuisine,'' by Caprial Pence  &UR; cf58 &LR; (10
Speed Press, 196 pages, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   Caprial Pence used to cook at Fullers in the Seattle Sheraton
Hotel and Towers, and while there, she won the 1991 James Beard
Award as Best Northwest Chef. Since then, she's moved to Portland,
Ore., where she opened Caprial's Bistro, and she hosts a TV cooking
show. In this, her third cookbook, she gives bistro fare a stylish
spin with such recipes as Pork Roast with Pecan Stuffing and Creamy
Mustard Sauce, or Sauted Salmon with Black Bean-Shrimp Salsa.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cooking with Artisan Bread: Using Rustic Loaves for Perfect
Crostini, Panini, Bruschetta, Flavorful Stuffings and Inventive
Main Courses,'' by Gwenyth Bassetti and Jean Galton (Sasquatch
Books, 127 pages, $15.95)
</P>
<P>
   The title alone is a mouthful and covers much of the contents,
which include additional recipes for soups, spreads and even bread
ice cream. Although it opens with a three-day formula for a country
loaf, this is not a breadmaking book. Bassetti founded Seattle's
own Grand Central Bakery, and Galton is a local writer.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Kingston Hotel Cafe Cookbook: Free-spirited Recipes to Warm
the Soul,'' by Judith Weinstock (Sasquatch Books, 157 pages,
$18.95)
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock emphasizes fresh, organic, regional foods in the meals
she prepares at her cozy bistro in the 19th-century Kingston Hotel
on the Kitsap Peninsula, though she's not afraid to mix in Asian or
other ethnic accents. Her cookbook follows the seasons, from
spring's Potato, Sorrel and Nettle Soup to winter's Seared Pork
Tenderloin with Spicy Green Apple-Tequila Sauce. Weinstock is a
former co-owner of The Streamliner Diner on Bainbridge Island and
author of ``The Streamliner Diner Cookbook.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Northwest Berry Cookbook: Finding, Growing and Cooking With
Berries Year-Round,'' by Kathleen Desmond Stang (Sasquatch Books,
144 pages, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   What could be more Northwest than berries? This little paperback
discusses characteristics, seasons, buying, picking and raising
blackberries and raspberries, blueberries and huckleberries,
gooseberries, lingonberries and more. The 40 recipes range from
Bob's Blueberry Blue Cornmeal-Buttermilk Pancakes to Pork Roast
with Blackberry-Pinot Noir Sauce. Stang is a Seattleite who
occasionally contributes to these pages.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Northwest Food &AMP; Wine: Great Food to Serve With the Wines of
Oregon and Washington,'' by Dan and Kathleen Taggart (Sasquatch
Books, 284 pages, $18.95)
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the book is 120 recipes, but wine provides the
organizing principle, with recipes grouped according to the
Northwest wine varieties they are designed to accompany. The
Taggarts, who live near Portland, Ore., also discuss those wines
and sprinkle the text with winemaker bios and other regional
tidbits.
</P>
<P>
   THE CELEBRITY ANGLE
</P>
<P>
   Star chefs, starred restaurants:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ducasse: Flavors of France,'' by Alain Ducasse with Linda
Dannenberg (Artisan, 264 pages, $50).
</P>
<P>
   Ducasse is the only chef in France ever to win six Michelin
stars in one year, which is quite an accomplishment, considering
the top restaurant rating is three stars. He did it with two
three-star restaurants _ one in Paris, the other in Monte Carlo.
This beautifully illustrated, oversized book aims to convey his
secrets to an American audience. It's not Sunday-night supper fare,
unless Bass Fillets Baked in Parchment with Fennel-Truffle Sauce is
your idea of something to munch on while catching the NFL wrapup on
the tube.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Jean-Georges: Cooking at Home with a Four-Star Chef,'' by
Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Mark Bittman (Broadway Books; 224
pages, $35)
</P>
<P>
   With a four-star review from the New York Times (for his newest
restaurant, Jean Georges) and two 1998 James Beard awards
(Outstanding Chef, Best New Restaurant), Vongerichten is the toast
of New York and of haute-cuisine America. He's French, and classic
technique informs his refined cooking. But his penchant for Asian
flavors is well-established and his preparations, judging by the
recipes in this book, are suprisingly simple.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``John Madden's Ultimate Tailgating,'' by John Madden with
Peter Kaminsky (Viking, 224 pages, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   OK, so Madden isn't a celebrity chef. But he is a celebrity, a
star sportscaster who often leads TV crews into the parking lot to
check out the food action outside the football stadium. He's an
unabashed fan of what he calls ``sinkers'' _ heavy eats that plunge
to the bottom of your stomach, and this book is full of them. The
recipes, mostly collected from tailgaters he has met, are designed
for fixing outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Le Bernadin Cookbook: Four-Star Simplicity,'' by Maguy
LeCoze and Eric Ripert (Doubleday, 372 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   LeCoze and Ripert are the owner and chef, respectively, of Le
Bernardin, a swanky, four-star New York restaurant dedicated to the
perfection of seafood. Le Bernardin was named Outstanding
Restaurant at the 1998 James Beard Awards, Ripert the top chef in
New York City. Both are French, and their recipes are rather
high-end, even if the results achieve a certain understated
elegance.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG BOOK,
</P>
<P>
   PRETTY PICTURES
</P>
<P>
   ANGLE
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic gift-book formula.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Saveur Cooks Authentic American,'' by the editors of Saveur
Magazine (Chronicle Books, 320 pages, $40).
</P>
<P>
   Saveur is a lavishly illustrated and artful food magazine, and
this book fits the same pattern. Each of the 175 recipes comes with
a bit of background reporting. Most detail such down-home dishes as
macaroni and cheese, baked beans, fried chicken or strawberry
shortcake, drawn from throughout the land.
</P>
<P>
   THE ITALIAN ANGLE
</P>
<P>
   The American love (or at least the love of American cookbook
publishers) for Italian food continues unabated. The best I could
do was narrow the field to four.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Cucina Ebraica: Flavors of the Italian Jewish Kitchen,'' by
Joyce Goldstein Chronicle Books, 202 pages, $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   A twofer: Italian food and Jewish food in one, presented in an
attractively designed book. Goldstein is a successful restaurateur
(formerly of San Franciso's Square One) and cookbook author who
interweaves her recipes with the history and culinary lore of
Italy's Jews.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Diary of a Tuscan Chef: Recipes and Memories of Good Times
and Great Food,'' by Cesare Casella and Eileen Daspin (Doubleday,
336 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Casella traces his roots in Italian cuisine, speculatively, to
his conception in some unknown Tuscan kitchen. His professional
career started at 13 in his family's restaurant in Italy and has
continued at first-class Italian restaurants in New York.
Recollections supplement the recipes, arranged in seasonal menus.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Flavors of Tuscany: Traditional Recipes from the Tuscan
Countryside,'' by Nancy Harmon Jenkins (Broadway Books, 282 pages,
$27.50).
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins isn't Italian, but she's the next best thing: an
American who spends much of the year in a old stone farmhouse she
owns in Italy. Her book focuses on the rustic, earthy cooking of
her home away from home, with concise recipes and lots of anecdotal
chatter.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Food and Memories of Abruzzo: Italy's Pastoral Land,'' by
Anna Teresa Callen (Macmillan, 459 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing fascination with Italian cooking has meant more
appreciation for its regional variations. Callen, who runs a
cooking school in New York, explores the traditions _ culinary and
otherwise _ of her native Abruzzo, a mountainous region in central
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   THE EXOTIC ANGLE
</P>
<P>
   Keeping on the cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Elephant Walk Cookbook: Cambodian Cuisine from the
Nationally Acclaimed Restaurant,'' by Longteine de Monteiro and
Katherine Neustadt (Houghton Mifflin, 324 pages, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Chinese food is old hat, everybody eats Thai, and Vietnamese
cooking has lost its novelty. How about Cambodian? The press
release for this pretty book describes Cambodian food as ``delicate
and refined . . . less salty that Vietnamese and less sweet than
Thai.'' Be the first on your block to serve Somlah Machou Mouan
(Khmer Chicken Soup With Eggplant) or Hong Chrouk (Pork With
Peanuts and Lilies). De Monteiro, a refugee from the Khmer Rouge,
runs three Cambodian restaurants in greater Boston.
</P>
<P>
   THE A-TO-Z ANGLE
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to leave no stone (or course) uncovered. Here are
three cookbooks develoted to something other than entr &UR; gfacute &LR; ees.
Besides, what's a cookbook list without a dessert book?
</P>
<P>

<P>
   _ ``The Vegetarian Compass: New Directions in Vegetarian
Cooking,'' by Karen Hubert Allison (Little, Brown, 383 pages,
$29.95).
</P>
<P>
   The almost funereal hues of gray, black and maroon are unusual
for the cover of a vegetarian cookbook, and this one seems cast in
a different mold than most of its ilk: more mannered, more
sophisticated. Allison, a former New York restaurateur who died
last year, applied the rigorous techniques of classic French
cuisine to cooking vegetables. But her recipes reflect multiethnic
influences in such preparations as Pumpkin Chile Roulade Filled
With Tomatillo Salsa, or Lima Beans, Chayote and Baby Bok Choy in
Lemongrass Ragout.

<P>
   Mediterranean cooking maven Paula Wolfert (``Mediterranean
Cooking,'' ``The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean,'' ``The
Cooking of South-West France,'' ``Couscous and Other Good Food of
Morocco,'' ``Paula Wolfert's World of Food'') weighs in with what
sounds like a vegetarian cookbook, but isn't. Certainly, greens and
grains play a prominent role and many of the recipes are meat-free,
but there are beef, chicken, fish, pork and lamb dishes as well,
gathered from throughout the Mediterranean Rim.

Peterson goes in for the comprehensive approach. And like them,
he's won a Beard cookbook-of-the-year award (for ``Sauces:
Classical and Contemporary Sauce Making,'' in 1991). What he did
for seafood in 1996 with his reference-shelf book ``Fish &AMP;

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Civil War's battlefields are hundreds of miles from
Boston, but throughout the city are dozens of reminders that it was
the center of antislavery activity for 30 years before the outbreak
of that conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those sites are on the Black Heritage Trail, including
the African Meeting House on Beacon Hill, which is being restored
with $1.4 million in federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also an unofficial abolitionist trail, traced by
Henry Mayer when he was researching ``All on Fire,'' his biography
of William Lloyd Garrison that was a finalist for the National Book
Awards announced last week. Garrison published the fiery
antislavery paper The Liberator in Boston every week from January
1831 until slavery was abolished with adoption of the 13th
Amendment in December 1865.
</P>
<P>
   There is some overlap between the two trails, just as there were
points of intersection between the city's mid-19th-century black
community and the mainly white abolitionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Major antislavery events also took place at, or just outside of,
well-known sites on the city's Freedom Trail, such as Faneuil Hall
and the Old State House. But Mayer notes ruefully that nothing
marks the later events.
</P>
<P>
   Saddest of all, Mayer says, the site of the office from which
Garrison published The Liberator &UR;  &LR; is buried under City Hall Plaza.
The building itself was destroyed in a suspicious fire in 1963 &UR;  &LR; as
efforts were underway to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison had been inspired to join the antislavery cause after
meeting a crusading Quaker editor. And he settled on Boston as the
place to launch his own paper because of the city's small but
active free black community. Many lived on the back slope of Beacon
Hill near the African Meeting House on Smith Court _ among them,
Lewis Hayden and John J. Smith, two black leaders in the
abolitionist movement. Garrison attended a freedom meeting at the
church in July 1829 that, Mayer says, convinced him a
``gradualist'' approach to ending slavery ``was not a viable
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the site of the Liberator office, all of Cornhill,
the crooked street where bookstores and printing shops jostled
along the southern edge of Scollay Square, lost out to urban
renewal in the early 1960s. An earlier office was in the long-gone
Merchants' Hall at the corner of Congress and Water streets. But
Mayer finds enough reminiscent of the area where Garrison worked in
the narrow streets just north of Dock Square.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who would like to follow the abolitionist trail
today, there are two good starting points, both little changed from
when Garrison settled in Boston, determined to launch his
antislavery revolution in the city that had fostered the revolution
against Colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Park Street Church and Faneuil Hall were sites for
abolitionist gatherings. Garrison gave the Fourth of July address
at the church in 1829, in which, Mayer says, he rewrote ``the
Declaration of Independence to include African-Americans and linked
the end of slavery and civil equality as twin goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The most tumultuous events in Boston's antislavery history
occurred in the streets around Court Square _ the square itself is
much as it was in the 1850s, although the porticoed 19th-century
courthouse was replaced with the present building (now the Boston
School Committee headquarters) in 1914.
</P>
<P>
   Abolition was not an instantly popular cause in Boston, and when
the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society, one of several such groups
in the city, scheduled a meeting in October 1835 at the
Anti-Slavery Office at 46 Washington St. _ now the location of the
Washington Street Mall _ a crowd Mayer describes as ``sultry and
disagreeable'' filled the streets in protest and stormed the
meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Theodore Lyman, who had been monitoring the unrest from
his office at City Hall (now known as the Old State House), forced
his way into the meeting, shouting, ``Go home, ladies, go home,''
which they did, after he promised to see them safely through the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison was holed up in a room off the meeting hall and escaped
out a second-floor window. He was spotted and was being hauled out
into the street when two muscular truckmen came to his aid and
propelled him down the street to City Hall, where Lyman gave him
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   But attitudes in the city were changing. Boston had long been a
haven for escaped slaves, and the city's abolitionists were openly
defiant of the nation's Fugitive Slave Law after it was passed in
1850.
</P>
<P>
   The defiance came to a head in May 1854 when federal marshals
arrested Anthony Burns, a slave from Virginia who had arrived in
Boston as a stowaway and had been hidden in the city for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was jailed at the courthouse while federal troops were
sent to Boston to ensure his return to Virginia. But ``with the
streets jammed with angry protesters and Faneuil Hall rocking
nightly with indignant oratory,'' Mayer writes, ``Boston endured
the most dramatic and tumultuous week in its history'' since the
week of the Boston Tea Party in 1773.
</P>
<P>
   Legal maneuvering failed and Burns was ``marched down State
Street completely surrounded by US soldiers'' and transferred to a
revenue cutter anchored in the harbor, Mayer writes, while ``church
bells tolled (and) lampposts and windows were draped in black
mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   That one event, Mayer writes, woke Boston and the North ``to
Garrison's prophetic message'' and set in motion the events that
would lead to the Civil War seven years later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
MAYER ON GARRISON'S TRAIL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the trail of abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, biographer
Henry Mayer tramped the back slope of Beacon Hill, where many
members of the city's black community lived before the Civil War,
and he made sketch maps of streets in the South End, where Garrison
lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked maps to give you context,'' Mayer said.
``It's the way you blow the dust off history.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunching at the Union Oyster House, which opened just north of
Dock Square in 1826, the same year that Garrison first came to
Boston looking for work as a printer, Mayer said it was one of a
number of eating places popular with workers from the nearby print
shops. ``It's just the kind of place where Garrison would have
eaten,'' Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
   The biography ``All on Fire,'' published last month by St.
Martin's Press, was a finalist for the National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer, 57, grew up in North Carolina and attended the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill during the civil rights movement.
``I got involved in a little movement to desegregate the local
movie thea-ter,'' he said, ``and remember the flood of emotion that
came from picketing.''
</P>
<P>
   He taught briefly after graduate school at the University of
California at Berkeley, but a course he developed on the American
Revolution got him interested enough in Patrick Henry to write a
biography of that leader, whose remark ``Give me liberty or give me
death'' became a revolutionary rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, Betsy, is a physician,'' Mayer said, ``and she
supports my writing habit.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer is now at work on another proj-ect, a biography of the
Depression-era photographer Dorothea Lange, but there is still some
unfinished business from the Garrison book.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the sites associated with the Boston's abolitionist
movement are marked, Mayer said _ neither long-gone sites such as
the office where Garrison published his abolitionist newspaper, The
Liberator, nor still-standing buildings such as the Old State House
and Faneuil Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I'd like to see,'' he said.

SEQUEL TO `BABE' NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This little piggy very nearly didn't make it to market.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, prints weren't ready and Universal was telling
the world the filmmakers were still synching in the animal voices.
However, the reality was quite different. The studio took one look
at director George Miller's dark vision in this sequel to ``Babe''
ordered him back in the editing room to cut away the edginess until
the film could garner a G, instead of PG, rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig In the City'' still deserves a PG warning. It's
disturbing and it's doubtful small children will grasp its adult
themes _ and those that do are likely to be scared to death.
</P>
<P>
   One scene sadistically depicts a bull terrier hanging by a chain
with his head submerged in water and one character is a
sophisticated, pink-hued poodle who talks about her past as a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   And Miller, who produced the original ``Babe,'' (it was directed
by Chris Noonan) can't seem to escape pulling from his violent,
cult ``Mad Max'' movies. ``Babe: Pig In the City'' is full of
references to the trilogy and, in the end, Mrs. Hoggett (Magda
Szubinski), is even flying around a hotel lobby in a scene that
strongly resembles the ``thunderdome'' gladiator games from ``Mad
Max Beyond Thunderdome.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Babe'' came to a close, the little ``sheep pig'' had just
won the sheepdog trials with Farmer Hoggett (James Cromwell). The
second film opens with a scary scene of Hoggett falling down a
well. He was to have taken our beloved Babe to the big city to make
a personal appearance and make some money to save the farm from
foreclosure. All the animals are begging Babe to help _ Ferdinand
the duck, the three singing mice, the sheep and sheepdogs Fly and
Rex urge him to find a way to let the humans keep their home safe
from harm.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hoggett steps in and agrees to accompany Babe to town. It's
an adventure that should be fun for Babe. But things don't quite go
as planned. ``More often than not, fortune favors the brave,'' says
the narrator. And Babe must prove his courage in the face of what
will become his darkest hour.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a room in a surreal hotel full of animals with very
few owners, Mrs. Hoggett is hauled away by the DEA because a
drug-sniffing dog has shown Babe how easy it is to get a human
arrested at the airport. Then the hotel is raided by an animal
enforcement agency. Babe's new acquaintances are taken away to
research labs and one is even run over by a van (he survives, but
it's very intense). Babe must muster his wits and save his friends,
find Mrs. Hoggett and keep his promise that the farm will stay
untouched by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The story lands in a lighter world by the end, but it's been a
weird, twisted trip full of mayhem and chaos till then. If audience
reaction is an indicator, most small children at the preview
screening didn't get it and adults, at best, laughed uncomfortably
at heavy political messages about the plight of animals in society.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the film is visually full of imagination and has
some inspired, clever moments. It also thankfully avoids the
scatology that seems to permeate every family film these days. But
it still looks dark, feels darker and is full of iffy bits that
border on questionable taste. Miller, who was a doctor prior to
becoming a director, seems to have little hope for humanity. That
may very well be the case, but he should save it for his next ``Mad
Max'' movie.
</P>

Miller, Judy Morris, Mark Lamprell. Cast: Magda Szubinski, James
Cromwell, Mickey Rooney. Universal Pictures. 95 minutes. Rated G.

HYDE SETS TRAP THAT LEADS TO DASH'S RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- No doubt, in time, Sam Dash will hit the law
school circuit.
</P>
<P>
   And when he does, there is also no doubt that the smartest kids
in the classes on hair-splitting will thrill to his dazzling
explanations of how the same conduct by Ken Starr he said was
``unlawful'' before the House Judiciary Committee last week was not
unlawful in Starr's written presentation to the House in September.
</P>
<P>
   Dash will also no doubt be brilliant as he explains his own role
in leaving poor chairman Henry Hyde with a case that can only be
made via the inferences of Starr, because the witnesses and the
evidence are at best ambivalent and often exculpatory.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rest of us will wrestle with Dash's mixed-message
resignation _ not solely on ethics issues, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   One clue came within hours of Dash's public departure, when all
of Starr's deputies began doing one of the few things they do
consistently well _ leak like sieves.
</P>
<P>
   While the boss stayed on the high road, the Starr deputies
portrayed Dash's professed concerns about dispassionate neutrality
in total contrast to his behavior when the impeachment referral was
being prepared late last summer.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dash, the Starr deputies angrily leaked, who had insisted
on many of the escalations in rhetoric that characterized this
argumentative submission; and it was Dash, they also leaked, who
virtually alone came up with the silliest charges in the entire
document, that President Clinton abused his power by asserting
rights and priveliges in court.
</P>
<P>
   Good points, by the way, but they miss the largest point, that
Starr is making the errors of a passionate advocate of the
president's removal from office, whose constitutional sin is
designed to fill the huge void left by Hyde's misfeasance and
nonfeasance, and that of his inept impeachment director, Chicago
crony David Schippers.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it from Starr's point of view. He sends his referral to
Capitol Hill more than two months ago, and what happens? Nothing
but gutter politics.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter who we are eventually told pulled which string
_ Newt Gingrich or Hyde himself _ but all that happens is that the
argumentative, soft-core pornographic referral is made public just
as the congressional election campaign is heating up. The same
thing happens to all of Starr's backup material and grand jury
records, including the famous video of Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing else happens, except that Schippers plays with
Starr's language in a rewrite of Starr's rewrite of testimony he
never heard from witnesses he never met.
</P>
<P>
   When the public doesn't buy into the political strategy, when it
in fact backfires, Hyde switches gears while denying he is doing
so. Despite the fact that he has failed to take one step toward
developing the House's own factual record, despite his insistence
that the Judiciary Committee will look beyond the Monica Lewinsky
matter, he says the entire impeachment matter is nonetheless to be
wrapped up before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   To short-circuit the absence of effort to develop the House's
own evidentiary record, Hyde then sends the White House his list of
81 ``affirm or deny'' questions, seeking either a Clinton assent to
Starr's allegations or another presumably perjurious set of sworn
denials.
</P>
<P>
   And then, he calls Starr as (to date)the sole public hearing
witness. Hyde could say the Democrats had sought him, but they
sought him on the understandable assumption that Starr would appear
as one witness to answer questions about his investigation, while
other witnesses would deal directly with the factual issues in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde called him as if he were one of those fact witnesses.
But Starr had admitted to Clinton lawyer David Kendall that out of
the entire record he sent Congress _ 134 FBI interviews, 19
investigative depositions, and 115 grand jury sessions _ he had
participated in only one, the President's White House testimony on
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Hyde set the constitutional trap over which Dash
resigned, on the grounds that Starr usurped Congress's sole power
of impeachment by arguing the case for it.
</P>
<P>
   To be accurate, though, there was one part of the case Starr
didn't argue as he had in his referral, and which committee
Democrats didn't, either. This just happened to be the basis for
the allegation of perjury that dwarfs the others, and indeed from
which the entire case flows and on which it depends.
</P>
<P>
   This is the charge that Clinton committed perjury in his Paula
Jones deposition 10 months ago when he denied ``sex'' with
Lewinsky, and then compounded it in August when he denied to the
grand jury that he lied in that deposition.
</P>
<P>
   To prove it, Starr had to accept the absurd, convoluted, and
perverted definition of sex Jones's lawyers gave the president, and
then to show via Lewinsky's unchallenged testimony that certain
acts occurred as she alleged. Hence, the pornography and the
political problem.
</P>
<P>
   The same ridiculous burden was faced by the White House in
defense of Clinton, though he, in fact, denied the Lewinsky sex
narrative. Hence all the silliness about ``legally accurate'' false
testimony and the Democrats' plea to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains, however, that the impeachment case exists only
in Ken Starr's inferential conclusions, not in a record developed
by the House.
</P>
<P>
   It's in fine shape for a shouting match on cable TV, but not for
the second impeachment vote in American history. And that is as
much Henry Hyde's fault as it is Ken Starr's.

AN INN IDEA FOR CATCHING THE YULE SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH CONWAY, N.H. _ If you want to get into the Christmas
spirit, head for the White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   This is ski country. And it's outlet country. And its crafts and
antiques country. But there's no need to step into skis or a shop
to enjoy the lights and wreaths and decorations that transform the
area into a holiday wonderland. And if you're here when a couple of
special events are happening, you just may end up feeling as
Christmasy as one of Santa's elves.
</P>
<P>
   Those events are the Inn to Inn &AMP; Cookie Tour, scheduled for
Saturday, Dec. 12, and the Polar Express, which runs several days
in December and brings to life the delightful children's book about
a magical train trip to the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas was decidedly in the air as my wife, Linda, and I
drove to the White Mountains on a crisp December morning, listening
to holiday music on the car stereo and, for once, enjoying the
sight of snow on the ground and flurries in the air. Our first
stop, appropriately enough, was in Snowville, off Route 153 and
just a few miles from Conway.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowvillage Inn in Snowville was where we chose to start the
tour, a new event sponsored by Country Inns in the White Mountains,
11 New Hampshire Inns that are proud of their variety and charm.
Last year's tour spotlighted four of those inns, letting visitors
admire their holiday decorations, peek into their rooms, and sample
some mulled wine, punch, or cider and cookies. This year, all 11
inns will participate, and you can visit them in any order from
about 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. The tour is self-conducted.
</P>
<P>
   The Snowvillage Inn set the stage for what we'd see wherever we
went: halls decked with garlands and roping, windows lit by
candles, cleverly decorated Christmas trees, and myriad twinkling
lights. In addition, there were such nice touches as candles at the
door, glowing from within ``buckets'' made of ice. Our only regret
was that we wouldn't be there to see the place aglow after dark.
</P>
<P>
   While sipping cider in one of the fireplaced common rooms, we
were greeted by some of the people responsible for the decorations
in the three-building, 18-room inn _ host Kevin Flynn, ably
assisted by daughters Caitlin and Maggie. We learned, among other
things, that for those who simply have to get on skis, the inn is
surrounded by cross-country trails, literally beginning at the
front door.
</P>
<P>
   Touring makes me hungry (everything makes me hungry), so we
drove on Route 16, past the ``Moose Crossing'' signs and past the
outlets, busy with Christmas shoppers, to our second stop, the 1785
Inn in North Conway, which sits on six acres overlooking the Mount
Washington scenic vista. The inn was both the site of a tour and a
buffet luncheon put on by the member inns. But this year, in place
of lunch, all inns will offer an appetizing array of holiday
cookies, and their recipes as well. Thus the name change from last
year's Inn to Inn Tour and Luncheon to this year's Inn to Inn &AMP;
Cookie Tour.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch, we didn't forget about looking at Christmas
decorations. How could we? In the bay window of the main dining
room was a miniature Christmas village, as well as decorations in
the two living rooms and the pub, where hot mulled wine was served.
Innkeepers Becky and Charlie Mallar kept busy as we toured a few of
the 17 individually and tastefully decorated rooms, some of which
have fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Just two minutes away was our third stop, the Buttonwood Inn on
17 acres of Mount Surprise in North Conway. Despite the mountain's
name, we weren't surprised to find the inn decked out in holiday
finery. More than 100 feet of Balsmam fir roping was swagged along
the windows and porches, with pine cones and burgundy bows
interspersed throughout. Inside were two Balsam fir trees and,
waiting for us, poinsettia punch, cookies, and carols.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Needham, who owns the inn with her husband, Peter,
somehow found the time to give us a tour, pointing out not only
what was there (including Shaker furniture and antiques), but what
would be coming. This spring, the inn underwent extensive
renovations, changing it from a nine-room inn to an 10-room inn,
complete with hot tub and conference room. Remaining, thankfully,
is the fieldstone-fireplaced common room with a guest refrigerator,
TV/VCR, and movies. Cross-country ski trails begin at the back
door.
</P>
<P>
   That left one inn on the tour _ the Ellis River House on Route
16 in Jackson, which lives up to its name by overlooking the
pristine Ellis River. It was a Victorian Christmas here, hosted by
inkeepers Barry and Barbara Lubao and including three trees
decorated with old-fashioned trinkets and toys, along with holiday
music played on the baby grand piano. The 18 rooms were decorated
with antiques and Laura Ashley prints; some rooms had fireplaces,
whirlpool baths, or balconies. Outside, there was cross-country
skiing and skating. As with so many of the inns, this one has a
varied history, beginning as a farm at the turn of the century,
later becoming a boarding house, then a private residence, and now
an inn.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it for inn touring. Well ... not quite. We would
get to explore one more, for we had booked reservations at the Inn
at Jackson, also a member of the Country Inns group and just a
quarter-mile from Jackson's famed red covered bridge. We had met
the innkeeper, Lori Tradewell, as she was helping out with the
buffet dinner earlier on the tour. And we found lots to admire
about this 14-room inn, built in 1902 and designed by architect
Stanford White: the holiday lights and decorations; the proximity
of alpine skiing, sleigh rides, and cross-country skiing (again,
right from the door), and shopping; the outdoor Jacuzzi; and the
resident cat, Clever. But mostly we admired our room, with its
fireplace and four-poster bed. Not that we would be there long: It
was time for a memorable meal before boarding the Polar Express.
</P>
<P>
   For dinner, we returned to the 1785 Inn in North Conway, having
earlier noted its extensive menu and wine list. Here we faced the
hardest choices we had to make all day: selecting from among
appetizers ranging from escargot in red wine to blackened scallops,
and main courses that included raspberry duckling, curried chicken,
sherried rabbit, rack of lamb, and black Angus sirloin steak. We
settled on lobster crepe and cinnamon steamed shrimp for
appetizers, and for the main courses, the night's specials: for my
wife, red snapper; for me, the best venison I've ever had _ tender
and not at all gamy.
</P>
<P>
   Thus fortified, we were off to see a Christmas story come to
life.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of minutes from the 1785 Inn is the village train
station, so colorful that it looks like an illustration from a
children's picture book. And that makes it the perfect place for
The Polar Express, a phenomenally successful performance based on
the children's book. This year, the Express will be in its fourth
season and, alas, has already sold out. It's an experience meant to
be shared with children, but even though we had no small people
with us, we were delighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Polar Express'' by Chris Van Allsburg tells of a boy who
mysteriously finds himself invited aboard a train heading for the
North Pole and Santa's stomping grounds, passing snow and trees and
even wolves along the way. Just as in the book, the train features
helpers in treetop-tall chef's hats, doling out hot chocolate and
nougatty candy. And just as in the book, wolves are spotted. (These
particular wolves aren't very scary _ or very realistic, for that
matter. No nightmares here.) From time to time, carolers stroll
through the car, encouraging passengers to sing along.
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes, the train arrives at ... the North Pole! Here,
at the base of a mountain, colored lights play on Santa Claus's
headquarters and create giant shadows of his elves, who are jumping
with excitement over the train's arrival. The elves guide
passengers to Santa's building _ and any resmeblance to a New
Hampshire ski center is pure coincidence, I am sure. Inside, ``The
Polar Express'' is read by the storyteller, Ed Fayle, who does an
excellent, exuberant job. Then Santa arrives and, just as in the
book, he gives out the first gift of Christmas _ a bell from a
reindeer's harness. It, of course, is a magical bell, whose ringing
can be heard only by those who truly believe in Santa. Which means
that on the train ride home, every passenger may well end up with
such a magical, musical bell.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Inn at Jackson, we lit a fire before turning in to
dream Christmas dreams. The next morning, after a breakfast at the
inn of pumpkin bread and French toast, it was time to head home,
stopping and shopping along the way.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend like that, I'm sure I'll be able to hear my
Polar Express bell ring for a long, long time.

VERONA _ HOME TO TWO LOVE-BUGGY KIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERONA, Italy _ Are we sitting where they sat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' says my friend, Aurelio, nothing if not a romantic.
``Right here, I'll bet ... those two love-buggy kids, Juliet and
Romeo.''
</P>
<P>
   She pats the weathered-gray tier of Verona's ancient Roman
Colosseum-style stadium called the Arena, an imposing pen that has
witnessed gladiatorial contests and innumerable other diversions
during its 20 centuries. ``I picture them holding hands. Nuzzling,
and commiserating about their dorky parents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, those hometown stir-fried lovers of the 13th century,
Signorina Capulet and Signor Montague,'' I acknowlege her
enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star-crossed lovers,' I believe Mr. Shakespeare called
them,'' Aurelio replies, frowning. ``Long time ago, but they're
still the eternally hot couple.''
</P>
<P>
   Indented by generations of bottoms, the stone pews remain in use
today in an oval that holds 22,000 customers, usually for the
summer opera season. Most likely both Gounod and Prokofiev's
operas, ``Romeo and Juliet,'' played here as well as Leonard
Bernstein's sing-off, ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   You enter one of the stadium's numerous archways that face
Piazza Bra at the center of town, climb a stairway that opens onto
the field, and pick a spot in the sun among 44 rows. Every seat in
this ampitheater of red brick and amber stone offers good, though
hard-rock, viewing. Like Harvard's stadium, it is for the firm of
fanny.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio has her own theories. ``Here's what happened with those
two: ``Juliet and Romeo meet here at a horse race, in a line where
they're cashing winning tickets. She says, `This is my lucky day,'
and he says, `Mine, too.' Introducing himself, he says, `Why don't
we meet again? Same place tomorrow, for the Verona Derby?'
</P>
<P>
   ``By then they're sitting together, cuddling and cooing.
Although they blow their school lunch money on a spavined long-shot
called Love In Bloom _ a hunch bet because of the name _ it doesn't
matter. `It's still our lucky day,' says Juliet. `But we have to be
careful. My family hates yours worse than cold pasta, and yours
detests mine more than cheap wine. We'd better confine our trysts
to after dark.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Romeo says, `My balcony or yours?' But she laughs, `Your house
doesn't have a balcony, silly. Be there at midnight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio says with a shrug, ``Everybody knows the rest. The
one-night balcony stand-up with her unforgettable line _ `O Romeo,
Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?' The secret wedding. The double
play tragic ending. A winner for Shakespeare even if Love In Bloom,
their horse, wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this city is a winner, too. Doesn't it warm you to stroll
the streets and piazzas that the two of them prowled, looking for
alcoves and passageways where they could snuggle and kiss? Too bad
they didn't have our nice small hotel, the Giulietta e Romeo. But,
of course, it came later, named for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Even without the legend of the local body-heating
boy and girl, Verona would be potent in the romantic mood
department. That is, the original quarter, within aged city walls.
A thumb of real estate that the Romans colonized, it is wrapped
around by the swiftly flowing, soothingly rippling river Adige.
World War II bombing destroyed several prized landmarks, but
they've been faithfully rebuilt. One of them, the fortified
14th-century Scaligero bridge, triple-arched in crimson brick and
pink and gray stone, is a gem for pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   In a paradise for wanderers, the pace is languid, mellow. Still,
some care should be taken in the hip-to-fender walking along
pinched streets. However, the piazzas are quietly free of cars,
rich in intricate medieval architecture _ palaces, churches,
fountains, stairways, statuary, winged Venetian lions _ and
tucked-in restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza delle Erbe is a wonderful jumble of towers and two-and
three-story stone houses packed together. Balconies everywhere, but
this is a balcony-happy community. Structural colors are faded,
tired but noble shades of mustard, pumpkin, lemon, russet, pink,
sage. At the outdoor market are T-shirts bearing the faces of
latter-day and present-day sex symbols: Juliet and Leonardo
DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the arcades and archways of Piazza dei Signori is
a stern, bronze Dante, who, in his ``Divine Comedy,'' touched on
the feud of the Capulets and Montagues (Capuleti and Montecchi to
Italians). Divinity gets plenty of attention in any number of
ancient, fascinating, lavishly decorated churches.
</P>
<P>
   San Francesco al Corso contains a sarcophagus said to be
Juliet's grave, but Aurelio isn't interested. ``She's alive forever
in the hearts of lovers. I don't need to see a tomb.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliet's house and The Balcony of balconies is a different
matter. Not that it's the only famous balcony in town. Revered is
one of iron grillwork overlooking Piazza Bra from which the
revolutionary general Garibaldi cried out to troops and citizenry
in 1867: ``Rome or death!'' Rome (about 300 miles to the south)
resisted, but he lived and united Italy anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a young man in 1933 I saw Mussolini, the dictator, speak
from the same balcony,'' says clothier Alisandro Pedoni, a man of
dignified bearing. ``Fortunately for us, his vision didn't last as
long as Garibaldi's.''
</P>
<P>
   Visions of Juliet are rewarded in the ivied courtyard of the
substantial, attractive brick Capulet home, 23 Via Cappello.
Demure, slender, gowned simply, she stands just below the small
storied balcony of carved stone. A beauty. Sculpted in bronze by
Nereo Constantini 30 years ago, she has become the object of
affection of countless passionate pilgrims, as much a goddess of
love as Venus was for her ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Some place flowers in her right hand. Others have caressed
Juliet's right breast so fervently _ for good luck in love _ that
it gleams, highly polished bronze, a distinct contrast to the rest
of her on whom an olive patina has settled. Is this statue
harassment? Not as unseemly as graffiti defacing the house,
scribblings of the timeless X-loves-Y variety.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, 4 Via delle Arche Scaligeri, is the Montague
homestead, brick and brooding with all the charm of a fortress. But
not even a plaque salutes Romeo. No graffiti. No statue to honor
the 'hood's hunk, one of the fabled Italian heroes of amore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely an oversight,'' says Aurelio, sighing. ``O, Romeo,
Romeo! Wherefore art thou, Romeo?''

AOL COMPLETES DEAL TO BUY NETSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ America Online announced Tuesday that it would
buy Netscape Communications Inc. in a $4.21 billion deal that
affects a majority of American Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Netscape gives the combined companies new
muscle to combat rival Microsoft Corp. in the booming Internet
software market. The federal government is suing Microsoft on
antitrust charges that stem, in part, from its aggressive business
practices against Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Dulles, Va.-based AOL is expected to operate
Netscape as a separate division in Mountain View, Calif. But the
4-year-old Netscape, which produces the software that popularized
the Internet and whose dramatic debut on the stock market was among
the most successful ever, would cease to exist as an independent
entity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This exciting partnership enables us to deliver even better
and more complete products and services to both existing and new
customers,'' said James Barksdale, the Netscape chief executive who
will join AOL's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acquisition of Netscape is a big step forward for America
Online that will greatly accelerate our business momentum,'' AOL
Chairman Steve Case said.
</P>
<P>
   In a side agreement, AOL will license Netscape corporate
software to Sun Microsystems Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is massive,'' said Ira Machefsky, a research partner at
the Palo Alto-based Odeon Capital venture company. ``What you're
witnessing is the birth of an NBC on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal merges the World Wide Web's largest network with the
company that makes a popular Web browsing software. According to
recent figures, there are 50 million Web users in the United
States. AOL accounts for 14 million of those, and Netscape's
Netcenter portal _ a Web page that provides links to other Internet
sites _ on any one day has 20 million users or more.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.21 billion deal, struck late Monday, calls for an
exchange of .45 shares of AOL stock for one share of Netscape
stock, which, at current market values, means Netscape shareholders
will get about $40 per share.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, AOL gets Netscape's browser, and its burgeoning
Netcenter Web portal.
</P>
<P>
   In a three-year deal, Sun Microsystems Inc. will distribute
Netscape's business-level ``server'' software, and AOL will use
Sun's Java programming technology to offer AOL services on what the
company called ``next-generation Internet devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Java lets programs run on a variety of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington-based Consumer Project on Technology, a
public-interest organization run by Ralph Nader, vowed to protest
any AOL-Netscape deal, contending that the market for Internet
software, now divided between Netscape and Microsoft, hampers
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the negotiations said that talks between
representatives of the companies were conducted in a setting of
video conferences, conference calls and endless electronic mail
between the chief executives of all three companies: Barksdale,
Case and Scott McNealy of Sun.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement, sources said, was supposed to be made Monday
before Wall Street opened, but bogged down over complex licensing
and ancillary rights among Sun, Netscape and AOL.
</P>
<P>
   A deal finally was struck via a conference call between the
three executives at about 4 p.m. Monday, the sources said. The pact
was announced to Barksdale by Case using AOL's on-line e-mail
notice, said a Netscape staffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve (Case) finally called Jim (Barksdale) and told him
`You've got mail,''' the staffer said. ``That let Jim know that
there was a done deal.''

THANKFUL . . . BUT NOT TRUTHFUL

   The big travel weekend is coming up as families flock together
to celebrate Thanksgiving much as the Pilgrims did. Or maybe not:
So many of our cherished myths about Thanksgiving are ... well ...
bunk. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   _The first settlers weren't called Pilgrims. Instead, they
modestly referred to themselves as Saints.
</P>
<P>
   _They didn't wear big hats with buckles, either. That was
something 19th-century artists dreamed up.
</P>
<P>
   _The first Thanksgiving was no solemn religious occasion.
Instead, it was a three-day festival that included drinking,
gambling, and target shooting.
</P>
<P>
   _It didn't take place in November but sometime between late
September and mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   _If the celebrants ate turkey at all, it was as a side dish.
Deer was the main course.
</P>
<P>
   _There's no evidence they celebrated the following year.

A GREAT SEASON FOR ART EXHIBITIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston has Monet, Washington has Van Gogh. While these are the
hottest tickets in the museum world now, they are not the only
great art shows available.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't seen the Monet exhibit at the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts (call 617-369-3449), plan on doing so by Dec. 27, when
the exhibit ends. Boston is the only North American site for this
showing of the Impressionist master's works, from his later years
to his death in 1926 at 86.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to catch this blockbuster is by buying a
weekend hotel package that includes tickets to the show good any
time during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Among area hotels with packages are the Hyatt Regency Cambridge
at $190 a night (617-492-1234); and the Seaport Hotel, the city's
newest hotel, beginning at $225 a night (617-385-4000). The
packages include accommodations, two tickets to the exhibit, and
extras. For other hotel packages, call the Boston Convention and
Visitors Bureau at 888-SEE BOSTON.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Gallery of Art in Washington, ``Van Gogh's Van
Goghs: Masterpieces from the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam,''
continues through Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The show is the largest collection of van Gogh's work to be seen
in the United States in 25 years. After Washington, the exhibit
will only be seen in Los Angeles before returning to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   For the exhibit, the gallery has a new policy: Only four
same-day passes per person will be offered, and once the gallery
opens 600 passes will be distributed the first hour, with the
remaining 1,400 passes being distributed at half-hour intervals
from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is free but passes are for
specific time periods only. For information, call 202-737-4215.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of the nicest ways to catch the exhibit is with a
hotel package. One of the best is from the Hay-Adams Hotel,
directly across from the White House. The package, which starts at
$1,400 for two nights, includes breakfasts, afternoon tea, and a
Van Gogh keepsake (call 800-424-5054).
</P>
<P>
   Also at the National Gallery through Jan. 3 is ``Gifts to the
Nation from Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney,'' which includes eight
masterworks bequeathed by philanthropist Betsey Cushing Whitney.
Among them are Vincent van Gogh's ``Self Portrait'' and James
McNeill Whistler's ``Wrapping.''
</P>
<P>
   The gallery is also featuring ``Edo: Art in Japan 1615-1868''
through Feb. 15. The performing arts festival features a variety of
Japanese art forms, from marionettes to acrobats.
</P>
<P>
   Works by Monet are included in ``Impressionists in Winter:
Effets de Neige'' at the Phillips Collection in Washington through
Jan. 3 (202-387-2151.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, the first of Impressionist winter landscape
paintings, includes ``A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur'' (1865)
by Claude Monet, along with works by artists such as Pierre-August
Renoir and Palul Gauguin, whose ``Breton Village in the Snow'' was
found unfinished on his easel in Tahiti at the time of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Also spanning the last years of an artist's life is ``Delacroix:
The Late Work'' at the Philadelphia Museum of Art through Jan. 3
(215-763-8100). The exhibit commemorates the 200th anniversary of
the birth of the French painter and is the only US exhibit of these
works.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Delacroix is considered the last Old Masters, and the
exhibit of 70 paintings and 40 works on paper spans the final years
of the artist's life _ 1798-1863.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hotel packages available for the showing, US
Airways, Amtrak, and National Car Rental are offering discounts on
travel to or in Philadelphia for the exhibition. For complete
information, call the Philadelphia Visitors Center at 800-752-8206.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view in Philadelphia is the new Canaan and Ancient
Israel gallery at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of
Archaelogy and Anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   This new permanent exhibition is the first in North America
dedicated to the archeology of ancient Israel and neighboring
lands.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the role that the Bible has had in shaping the
personal and cultural identities of people throughout the world,
the new exhibit digs deep into the past to consider the question,
``What shaped the identities of the Bible's people?'' Special
hotel-and-travel packages are also available; call 800-752-8206.
</P>
<P>
   ``Degas and the Little Dancer,'' at the Baltimore Museum of Art
through Jan. 3 (410-396-7100), focuses on the French
Impressionist's most significant theme, the little dancer, with 45
paintings, prints, and sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, ``Jackson Pollock,'' the first US
retrospective since 1967 of the most influential American painter
of the 20th century, is on view through Feb. 2 at the Museum of
Modern Art (212-708-9400).
</P>
<P>
   ``The mythic image of Jackson Pollock as a troubled,
hard-drinking figure of rebellion has sometimes come to obscure the
work itself,'' said Kirk Varnedoe, the museum's chief curator.
``Pollock's astonishing range and the full richness of his
remarkable achievement can only truly be perceived first-hand.''
For information on hotel and Amtrak packages, call 212-708-9403.
</P>
<P>
   At the Studio Museum in Harlem (212-864-4500), ``Selections from
the Permanent Collection,'' showcasing the works of four major
American artists, will be on view through Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney Museum is showcasing the work of figurative
expressionist painter Bob Thompson through Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 paintings and drawings, many of which have never
before been seen by a large audience, will be on view.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings span the years 1959-'65, when Thompson's narrative
abstract expressionist compositions were celebrated for their
artistry and originality.
</P>
<P>
   The first major exhibition dedicated to the vibrant folk culture
of Spain and its pervasive influence of life and art in Latin
American and the United States, ``El Alma del Pueblo: Spanish Folk
Art and Its Transformation in the Americas'' is on view through
Dec. 31 at the Spanish Institute in New York City (212-628-0420).
More than 250 objects from 30 museums are included in the exhibit,
which will later be seen in Chicago, Sacramento, and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Picasso's experimentation with ceramics, which he began
late in his career, produced a series of expressive figures,
vessels, and tiles that have rarely been seen in public. The Tacoma
Art Museum is making 60 of these playful works accessible in the
only American showing of ``Ceramics from the Marina Picasso
Collection,'' through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish Museum (212-423-3271) is featuring ``Common Man,
Mythic Vision: The Painting of Ben Shahn,'' through March 7. The
exhibit, which features 52 of the finest paintings created by
Shahn, is the first major museum exhibition of his works in the
United States since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   At the Metropolitan Museum of Art, ``Van Eyck to Bruegel: Early
Netherlandish Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art'' brings
together more than 100 works from the museum's collection,
illuminating a critical period in the history of Western art. The
exhibit continues through Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view Dec. 15 through March 21 is ``Anselm Kiefer: Works
on Paper, 1969-1993,'' featuring 54 of the artist's unique works on
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the fascinating aspects of Kiefer's works on paper is
the way he manipulates a variety of mark-making techniques or plays
with compositions to fortify the subject matter,'' said Nan
Rosenthal, curator of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   More art exhibits will be mentioned in future columns.

 By RICHARD ROEPER  
 c.1998 The Chicago Sun-Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The former gateway to hell is on the fourth floor of a
cavernous building at 23rd and Rockwell, on the city's near
Southwest Side. Ripped from its original location, this entranceway
is wedged into a narrow corridor, leaning against metal shelves
which are groaning under the weight of old files and records.
</P>
<P>
   In and of itself, there's nothing unusual about this
square-shaped piece of lumber. It could have been the hatchway to
anyone's attic or basement.
</P>
<P>
   What gives you the chills as you rap your knuckles against the
frame is the knowledge that this was once the doorway to John Wayne
Gacy's crawlspace.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors placed this entranceway in the courtroom for Gacy's
trial. During his closing statement, William Kunkle gathered up
photos of the known victims and theatrically flung them through the
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years later, the hatchway sits in this musty evidence
room. You are here because Gacy's venom has seeped from his grave
and he is in the headlines again. This week, investigators
commenced digging for more Gacy victims near an apartment building
where Gacy's mother once lived.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening because a private investigator told an
Illinois group called the Better Government Association he
remembered seeing Gacy in an alley near the apartment building,
holding a shovel at 3 a.m. The BGA used a radar device to sweep the
parking lot, resulting in photos of shadowy images that could be
skeletal remains.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes another dig, another search for bones, as national
attention is once against focused on the serial killer who was
executed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The morbid media circus is back in Chicago, courtesy of the
killer clown.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was at best a longshot, but you thought there might be
something in the old Gacy evidence that would connect him to that
parking lot. A notation in his appointment book, a reference to the
lot in the notes from his conversations with investigators,
something.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sobun, project coordinator of the archives department,
unlocks a bolted metal door and slides it open, and leads you to
the Gacy materials, which include the crawlspace and two oversized
boxes brimming with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to properly prepare yourself to view the photos
of the bodies, and the body parts, as they were found. You know
they're going to be unspeakably grisly _ but they're worse than you
could have possibly imagined.
</P>
<P>
   You flip through photos of bones and skulls. Dental X-rays.
Envelopes containing high school class rings, boards with hairs
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more mundane police photos are terrible. Like the
black-and-white shots of Gacy's bedroom _ the messy bed unmade, a
few crummy shirts hanging the closet, and a very creepy clown
painting on the wall. Next to the bed, a TV and a clock radio _
both of which belonged to one of Gacy's victims, John Scyz.
</P>
<P>
   You extract a piece of rope from one envelope, and Sobun says,
``That was taken from the neck of one of the skeletal remains.''
(Gacy strangled his victims by using a stick to twist the ropes
around their necks.)
</P>
<P>
   In another envelope: Heavy metal handcuffs and keys. Gacy would
put handcuffs on his victims, in the guise of showing them a magic
trick. Once they were restrained, he'd explain the trick was
``having the key.''
</P>
<P>
   A brown suede jacket with fringe trimming is tucked into one
box. It belonged to John Mowery, a 19-year-old who was the 13th of
Gacy's victims to be identified. Also in the box is Mowery's
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   You come across another jacket, this one worn by Rob Piest,
Gacy's final victim. A photo receipt from the Nisson Pharmacy in
the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines, where Piest worked, was found by
police in Gacy's home. It was a crucial piece of evidence linking
Gacy to Piest's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Next you open Gacy's appointment book for 1978-79. The early
days of December are filled with names and numbers and scheduled
meetings, but there's not a single entry after Dec. 21.
Investigators tailed Gacy for more than a week before he was
arrested; perhaps he knew the end was near.
</P>
<P>
   A notation for Dec. 16 reads, ``X-Mas Dinner Party at House.'' A
house that stood above more than two dozen bodies. (For some
reason, maybe the party was canceled. Gacy went out drinking that
night, hitting several bars and not calling it a night until 6 a.m.
Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   Your hands are coated with dust as you sift through the
20-year-old evidence. You'll scrub them like a surgeon once you're
away from this place.
</P>
<P>
   As you reach the bottom of the second box, you realize there's
nothing here connected to the parking lot where they'll begin
digging Monday (Nov. 23). Gacy once wrote a message on the back of
one of his prison-created paintings: ``Find the bodies if you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was just jerking everybody around. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   You come across one last piece of evidence _ Gacy's hand-drawn
diagram of the crawlspace, indicating where some of the bodies were
buried.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough. You thank Sobun for his time, and he leads you
outside, sliding the big metal door closed and locking it tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope we don't have to go in there for another 20
years,'' he says.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ The former gateway to hell is on the fourth floor of a
cavernous building at 23rd and Rockwell, on the city's near
Southwest Side. Ripped from its original location, this entranceway
is wedged into a narrow corridor, leaning against metal shelves
which are groaning under the weight of old files and records.
</P>
<P>
   In and of itself, there's nothing unusual about this
square-shaped piece of lumber. It could have been the hatchway to
anyone's attic or basement.
</P>
<P>
   What gives you the chills as you rap your knuckles against the
frame is the knowledge that this was once the doorway to John Wayne
Gacy's crawlspace.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors placed this entranceway in the courtroom for Gacy's
trial. During his closing statement, William Kunkle gathered up
photos of the known victims and theatrically flung them through the
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years later, the hatchway sits in this musty evidence
room. You are here because Gacy's venom has seeped from his grave
and he is in the headlines again. This week, investigators
commenced digging for more Gacy victims near an apartment building
where Gacy's mother once lived.
</P>
<P>
   This is happening because a private investigator told an
Illinois group called the Better Government Association he
remembered seeing Gacy in an alley near the apartment building,
holding a shovel at 3 a.m. The BGA used a radar device to sweep the
parking lot, resulting in photos of shadowy images that could be
skeletal remains.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes another dig, another search for bones, as national
attention is once against focused on the serial killer who was
executed four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The morbid media circus is back in Chicago, courtesy of the
killer clown.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was at best a longshot, but you thought there might be
something in the old Gacy evidence that would connect him to that
parking lot. A notation in his appointment book, a reference to the
lot in the notes from his conversations with investigators,
something.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sobun, project coordinator of the archives department,
unlocks a bolted metal door and slides it open, and leads you to
the Gacy materials, which include the crawlspace and two oversized
boxes brimming with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to properly prepare yourself to view the photos
of the bodies, and the body parts, as they were found. You know
they're going to be unspeakably grisly _ but they're worse than you
could have possibly imagined.
</P>
<P>
   You flip through photos of bones and skulls. Dental X-rays.
Envelopes containing high school class rings, boards with hairs
attached.
</P>
<P>
   Even the more mundane police photos are terrible. Like the
black-and-white shots of Gacy's bedroom _ the messy bed unmade, a
few crummy shirts hanging the closet, and a very creepy clown
painting on the wall. Next to the bed, a TV and a clock radio _
both of which belonged to one of Gacy's victims, John Scyz.
</P>
<P>
   You extract a piece of rope from one envelope, and Sobun says,
``That was taken from the neck of one of the skeletal remains.''
(Gacy strangled his victims by using a stick to twist the ropes
around their necks.)
</P>
<P>
   In another envelope: Heavy metal handcuffs and keys. Gacy would
put handcuffs on his victims, in the guise of showing them a magic
trick. Once they were restrained, he'd explain the trick was
``having the key.''
</P>
<P>
   A brown suede jacket with fringe trimming is tucked into one
box. It belonged to John Mowery, a 19-year-old who was the 13th of
Gacy's victims to be identified. Also in the box is Mowery's
driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   You come across another jacket, this one worn by Rob Piest,
Gacy's final victim. A photo receipt from the Nisson Pharmacy in
the Chicago suburb of Des Plaines, where Piest worked, was found by
police in Gacy's home. It was a crucial piece of evidence linking
Gacy to Piest's disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Next you open Gacy's appointment book for 1978-79. The early
days of December are filled with names and numbers and scheduled
meetings, but there's not a single entry after Dec. 21.
Investigators tailed Gacy for more than a week before he was
arrested; perhaps he knew the end was near.
</P>
<P>
   A notation for Dec. 16 reads, ``X-Mas Dinner Party at House.'' A
house that stood above more than two dozen bodies. (For some
reason, maybe the party was canceled. Gacy went out drinking that
night, hitting several bars and not calling it a night until 6 a.m.
Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   Your hands are coated with dust as you sift through the
20-year-old evidence. You'll scrub them like a surgeon once you're
away from this place.
</P>
<P>
   As you reach the bottom of the second box, you realize there's
nothing here connected to the parking lot where they'll begin
digging Monday (Nov. 23). Gacy once wrote a message on the back of
one of his prison-created paintings: ``Find the bodies if you
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was just jerking everybody around. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   You come across one last piece of evidence _ Gacy's hand-drawn
diagram of the crawlspace, indicating where some of the bodies were
buried.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough. You thank Sobun for his time, and he leads you
outside, sliding the big metal door closed and locking it tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope we don't have to go in there for another 20
years,'' he says.

   &UR; FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PECANS (Perry, Ga.) _ A fresh pecan is a revelation, a far
different thing from the brown, often wizened nut that you find in
bags on supermarket shelves. At its best, no more than a month off
the tree, a pecan is golden, plump and tender, with a mellow,
buttery flavor and hardly any of the bitter tannins found in the
walnut, a distant relative. By Florence Fabricant. (1750 words)
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   With photo and graphic map.
</P>
<P>
   PECAN-PIE (Undated) _ It's classic. It's irresistible. And it's
a killer. Two bites into the standard pecan pie, and even the most
dessert-toughened Yankees, veterans of chocolate decadence cake,
tiramisu and creme brulee, know that they're in deep trouble. Like
Rhine maidens draped seductively on jagged rocks, those luscious
pecans sit atop a thick, tremulous layer of filling so sweet that
it can make grown men cry. More than a century after the Civil War,
pecan pie remains the last holdout against Reconstruction, but wily
carpetbaggers, assisted by a few Southern scalawags, have been
tinkering with the pecan-pie formula and coming up with ways to
make it a little less sweet. By William Grimes.
</P>
<P>
   With recipe.

   THANKSGIVING (New York) _ In which our intrepid reporter
triumphs over adversity to produce roast turkey that tasted exactly
like her mother's. By Alex Witchel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLUMNS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The column: He was the Peter Pan and Ariel
of wine; a man who described one of his own commentaries as ``a
critique of pure riesling,'' and who advised on a label that ``this
wine will accommodate all manner of game and wild beasts, including
the sloth.'' No, Randall Grahm _ for who else could it be _ has not
left us. But he has gone, as they say in the land of carrot juice
and the flapping sandal, to another plane. By Frank J. Prial.

<P>
   SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: On Thursday, with an
entire Thanksgiving meal marshaled and ready, countless cooks will
quake over the last detail: the gravy. When it's a once-a-year
thing, there are no guarantees that the gravy will come out
perfectly smooth, deeply flavored and nicely browned. There is an
alternative, though. And, unlike the various concoctions that come
out of a jar, it requires no apologies. It is a deglaze sauce, and
it is the most easy and malleable sauces a cook can make. By Mark
Bittman.

   POLICE-NOTICKETS _ ATLANTA _ Fed up with the prospect of yet

as well as loss of other benefits, Atlanta officers are threatening
a one-day work action that could leave the city $100,000 short.

   PBP-OFFICER-ARRESTED (20 inches) _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
Veteran West Palm Beach Police Officer Louis Berry was arrested by
his own department Tuesday on charges he systematically abused a
court program that pays witnesses for testifying.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest, which came after a `Palm Beach Post' investigation
revealed irregularities in payments made to Berry, highlights the
lack of a dependable system of checks and balances in how the
payments are made to certain types of witnesses and inefficiencies
in other areas of witness payment. Berry, 41, was charged with
official misconduct and grand theft Tuesday after a meeting with
criminal and internal investigators. (Gonzalez, Palm Beach Post)

<P>
   The McMurdo Dry Valleys OF Antarctica, 800 miles from the South
Pole, are among the harshest places on Earth. The temperature never
climbs more than 4 degrees above freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this frigid desert, biologists have found a remarkable
community of microbes clumped into temporary pockets of water
several feet beneath the surface. Researchers believe that these
organisms, which survive where no one had expected to find any
living things, provide a model for what life might be like on other
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   During the austral summer, beginning in December, the sun shines
24 hours a day on the valleys. Although the air temperature never
rises much above freezing, that steady solar heating provides
enough energy to melt some surface ice.
</P>
<P>
   As the ice melts, its top layer of gravel and sediment _ blown
in from across the continent by the strong Antarctic winds _
filters down through the ice until it settles into a layer some six
feet below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Within that buried sediment a complex community of organisms was
discovered by microbial ecologist John Priscu of Montana State
University and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Priscu and his team found the microbes after years of drilling
through the sediment layer. They had been studying one of
Antarctica's mysterious ice-covered lakes. To reach the lake, they
had to penetrate about 20 feet of ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In drilling through the ice over the past 15 years, we'd
always hit a gravel layer,'' Priscu says. ``It slowed us down and
dulled our bits.''
</P>
<P>
   At first the researchers regarded the layer as a nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, starting in 1993, I began studying gases produced by
bacteria, to see what their flux was from the lake up through the
ice. When I did a profile of nitrous oxide _ an important gas for
global warming _ I saw a big peak associated with the sediment
layer,'' Priscu says.
</P>
<P>
   Other measurements of bacterial activity _ chlorophyll levels,
for example _ also peaked in the layer. Clearly, the sediment
housed more than bit-chewing gravel.
</P>
<P>
   When Priscu took cores from several other McMurdo lakes, he
identified in similar sediment layers numerous species of
cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), including a filamentous species
that helps bind the gravel particles into a matrix.
</P>
<P>
   He also found nitrogen-fixing bacteria and other bacteria,
called heterotrophs, that decompose dead algae. The organisms
aren't lake species but are instead related to terrestrial
microbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When material is blown onto the surface of the ice, it must
carry spores and attached organisms,'' Priscu says.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of species, Priscu thinks, is necessary to keep the
entire community alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a consortium of organisms,'' he says, ``with
different metabolic traits that complement each other for the good
of the whole system. You have cyanobacteria, which photosynthesize
and so bring carbon dioxide. Then they leak some of that out, and
the heterotrophic bacteria eat up the carbon. The hererotrophs then
respire and recycle C02 and nutrients back to the cyanobacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   During the summer the temperature in the sediment layer is about
34 degrees, just warm enough to prevent the water from freezing.
Priscu believes that the organisms secrete some sort of cellular
antifreeze into the water.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny pools, he estimates, last for 150 days, from November
to February. For the rest of the year the layer is frozen and the
organisms exist in a suspended state.
</P>
<P>
   The microbes have some unique characteristics that aid their
survival. Their cell membranes, for example, are less elaborate
than those found in most microbes and are not as easily damaged by
regular cycles of freezing and thawing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organisms don't grow quickly at those temperatures but
they do eke by. It is really life at the edge,'' Priscu says. ``I
think that if you are looking for life on other worlds _ Mars or
Europa, for example _ then the kind that we are seeing in the ice
is what you are going to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Priscu, like many other scientists, believes that 4.5 billion
years ago Mars was a warm, wet world, with oceans and perhaps life.
Much of Mars' ancient water may lie frozen beneath its surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now we have shown that you can have life and liquid water
under ice, so we might have an environment on Mars where similar
organisms could still exist.''

   In 1946, when my father was in his formative years, he purchased
500 shares of stock in a company then known as Haloid.
</P>
<P>
   As my father remembers it, the stock cost $9 a share, which
meant my father was out $4,500, a significant sum at the time. He
held the shares for two years while the stock climbed slowly to
$16.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1948, Haloid announced the existence of a
photocopying process that would later become known colloquially as
Xeroxing after Haloid changed its name to Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to all reasonable expectations (including my father's)
the announcement did not send the price of Haloid stock skyward.
Indeed, by January 1949 it had dropped to $14 a share and my father
sold out. He made a tidy profit of $2,500, but had he held those
500 shares until, say, 1969, they would have been worth about $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   My father's failure to predict the behavior of the market, or
even of a single stock, cannot be held against him, however I might
feel about now having to work for a living. Indeed, the question of
whether the prices of stocks, bonds and other financial commodities
can ever be predicted is one of the great scientific controversies
of our time.
</P>
<P>
   According to orthodox wisdom, financial markets go up and down
with no more predictability than a coin toss, and no amount of
historical knowledge, intuition, tips or analysis will tell you
with any certainty what will happen today, next month or next year.
</P>
<P>
   This paradigm goes by the name of the Efficient Market
Hypothesis (EMH) or the Random Walk Hypothesis, a name derived from
the suggestion that the price of a stock stumbles around a given
value like a drunk around a lamppost.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy rages because of the unavoidable implication of
the hypothesis: if it's true, then traders who make money
speculating in stock movements _ George Soros, for instance, or
Warren Buffett _ are neither brilliant nor intuitively gifted, but
only lucky.
</P>
<P>
   While researchers have collected scientific evidence supporting
the hypothesis, there is also copious evidence to the contrary _ in
particular, everyone who has ever made money in the market.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the last decade has seen a wave of scientists
migrating to Wall Street and applying powerful computers and
sophisticated mathematical tools to the stream of data pouring out
of the world's financial markets. And they have founded a handful
of companies _ Renaissance Technologies, for instance, run by
mathematician Jim Simons, or D. E. Shaw &AMP; Company, run by computer
scientist David Shaw _ that are doing remarkably well placing
wagers on the behavior of financial commodities.
</P>
<P>
   But why? According to the Efficient Market Hypothesis, the
activity of countless traders competing to buy and sell stocks at
what they think are their proper values forces the market to
instantaneously adjust the price of each stock to what it's really
worth.
</P>
<P>
   When the market moves in response to any relevant news or
information, so the theory goes, it will move so quickly that no
one will be able to make money reliably.
</P>
<P>
   ``What (the EMH) says is that the more people who try to
forecast markets, the less forecastable markets tend to be,''
explains Andrew Lo, a professor of finance at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the Efficient Market Hypothesis, says Lo, comes with the
kind of paradox that offers scientists an opportunity to find a new
truth: If the market is truly efficient, then it leaves no
incentive for anyone to learn new information because they can't
possibly profit from it. But if no one is out there learning it,
then the information will never make it into the market to be
instantaneously absorbed. ``Clearly that's an absurd premise,''
says Lo.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, says Lo, is that the market is efficient, but not
instantaneously so. Small inefficiencies can exist long enough for
traders to take advantage of them, at which point they will be
competed away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine out of ten times, the guy who says he can beat the market
is probably wrong, because he doesn't have anything new,'' Lo says.
``All he's observed is a statistical fluctuation, pure luck. But
every once in awhile somebody comes up with a genuinely new idea
for either forecasting the market or assessing information better,
or being able to put all the pieces together in a more
cost-efficient manner. He will make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Because every new technology also makes the market more
efficient, Lo explains, traders must continuously adapt to stay
ahead. They do it by developing or enlisting new technologies, most
of which come from various fields of scientific research: financial
engineering, mathematics, statistics, computer science.
</P>
<P>
   That's what David Shaw and Jim Simons have done. Both figured
out how to mathematically model the behavior of financial markets
so that a computer can predict the direction of stocks, currencies
or other financial commodities, at least for long enough that they
can bet on the knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But those predictions have to be thoroughly tested to make sure
they're based on reality and not luck. The advantage scientists
bring to the game, says Simons, is less their mathematical or
computational skills than their ability to think scientifically.
They are less likely to accept an apparent winning strategy that
might be a mere statistical fluke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't just take a bunch of data and grind through it and
find patterns,'' Shaw says. ``Rather, we formulate hypotheses and
build up models of a lot of mechanisms that we believe are
operating out there. And then we validate those models in the same
way any scientist would. We will do experiments looking at
historical data, and in some cases we actually have to move large
amounts of money through the system and see what happens. In a
given experiment we might pump billions of dollars through the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But this business of scientific trading, says Shaw, is not the
future of finance, because the efficient market will eventually
triumph. If everybody gets into the game, the game vanishes. Both
Shaw and Simons say that it's harder to find profitable
inefficiencies now than it was when they started.
</P>
<P>
   So when Shaw talks about the future of his business he sounds
less like a scientist and more like a Wall Street sage. The most
important people in finance are still those who make money the
old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the people who can analyze companies,'' he says, ``who
understand what products the companies make: whether the chief
executive officer seems to be a good chief executive officer;
whether their business plan makes sense; whether it's a growth
industry or a shrinking industry; and so forth. Those are the kinds
of things we do not believe are amenable to mathematical or
computational analysis.''

   When leaf-peeping northeasterners begin retiring their
binoculars for the year, Hawaii residents start dusting theirs off.
November opens the unofficial season of rubbernecking, a time when
migrating whales and big-wave riders turn the ocean into the site
of the islands' favorite spectator sports.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the economy and the weather, the humpback whales can be
counted on. They return in late November and stay until April or
May, breaching, spouting, mating and calving spectacularly in the
island waters that serve as their refuge from the icy ones they
have left behind in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   As for surfing, winter is its zenith, a time when ``pray for
surf'' is the prevailing mantra and waves aren't big unless they're
15 feet or higher. On the north shore of Oahu, the coastline
becomes theater: no wave is too large for the world's most daring
and accomplished surfers, who look like specks in the winter swell.
</P>
<P>
   These attractions are free, a considerable plus in a state
reeling with economic woes. The disappearance of Japanese
investment and the decline in tourism have come on the heels of
widespread plantation shutdowns, calling upon the adaptive spirit
of Hawaii's people.
</P>
<P>
   Attractive rates in hotel, air fare and travel packages can be
found in November and the first three weeks of December. In this
shoulder season (high season begins around Christmas and lasts
until mid-April), the islands are less crowded and the weather, as
in late spring, is at its best, averaging in the mid-70s _ although
several degrees warmer on the Kona-Kohala coast.
</P>
<P>
   With events from ``The Nutcracker'' to the Hawaii International
Film Festival, culture addicts, like surfers and luau aficionados,
have a full plate in the weeks to come.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Josef Albers, Sol Lewitt, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Frank
Stella, Richard Diebenkorn, Roy Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg
are among the 40 artists represented in ``First Decade: Highlights
from the Contemporary Museum's Collection,'' which runs through
Jan. 3 at the Contemporary Museum, 2411 Makiki Heights Drive,
Honolulu. Robert Motherwell's ``Elegy With Rice Paper and Blue,''
from his series ``Elegies to the Spanish Republic,'' is among the
works not previously shown here.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is set in a garden in the hills overlooking the city.
Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission: $5. (808)
526-0232.
</P>
<P>
   A storm in the Aleutians would be great news for big-wave riders
and spectators hoping for epic El Nino-generated surf at this
year's Vans G-Shock Triple Crown of Surfing Series, from Nov. 5
through Dec. 20 at Haleiwa Beach, Sunset, and Pipeline on Oahu's
North Shore. Top professional surfers will compete for $1 million
in men's and women's events. Free admission; (808) 637-6376 for
daily recorded information.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet Hawaii will present ``The Nutcracker'' Dec. 18 to 20 at
the Blaisdell Concert Hall, 777 Ward Ave., with guest artists from
the American Ballet Theater. Admission: $15 to $35; (808) 591-2211.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good timing, powerful binoculars and quick reflexes (to pull
over if you're driving, or to drop whatever you're doing if you're
not) are useful when humpbacks appear, most reliably along the west
and south Maui shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable vantage points along the west shore include Pap awai
Point, McGregor Point scenic overlook, Launiupoko State Wayside and
Wahikuli State Wayside; on the south shore, Wailea Beach Park and
the dining rooms of the deluxe Wailea resorts. On Oahu, Makapuu
Point, Waikiki and the Kaena Point Trail on the leeward coastline
can be center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Whale Foundation, 101 North Kihei Road, supports its
research with daily whale-watching cruises beginning Dec. 1 on
Maui, $22 to $31; (800) 942-5311.
</P>
<P>
   At the Maui Ocean Center, a new five-acre marine park at 192
Maalaea Road, life-size whale models are part of the 60 exhibits.
Jaws drop during shark feeding and in the 54-foot walk-through
tunnel aquarium. Admission: $17.50, $12 for children; open daily 9
a.m. to 5 p.m., (808) 270-7000.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of a 22.5-mile network of ditches, flumes and tunnels
built in 1906 to irrigate sugar plantations have been transformed
into an easy, meandering waterway for kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   Guides with the Kohala Mountain Kayak Cruise explain the
region's history while gliding in the narrow outdoor flumes that
traverse rain forest and stands of wild ginger. Headquarters are in
Hawi, at the junction of Highways 270 and 250. Cost for the
75-minute paddle: $75, $55 ages 5 to 18; (808) 889-6922.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Lahaina Luau on Maui _ in moving to a larger oceanfront
site, 1251 Front St. in Lahaina six months ago _ has reinvented
itself authentically in a genre rife with cliche.
</P>
<P>
   At sunset, guests sit at tables or on lauhala fiber mats on the
ground in front of a grass-mound stage. The program offers
intelligent narration and excellent ancient hula (the absence of
fire dancing is noted but not lamented). There are no watered-down
mai tais and, like the atmosphere, the food is authentic Hawaiian,
and delicious. Admission: $65, $30 for children; (808) 667-1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Oahu, Pearl Harbor's newest resident, the 887-foot Missouri,
where Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender, is being
scrubbed, buffed and prepared for its opening in January as a
national memorial and museum. It is moored near the Arizona, sunk
during the Pearl Harbor attack. Guided tours will be $14; (808)
545-2263.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new Waimea Brewing Company, at Waimea Plantation Cottages,
9400 Kaumualii Highway, Waimea, may seem out of character in a
retro-historic plantation village, but in the dusty, dry plains of
this west Kauai town, there's something to be said for cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   The 48 authentic plantation cottages from the early 1900s were
moved from a nearby plantation and faithfully restored and equipped
with verandas and full kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   For those heading for the Waimea Canyon and Kokee State Park,
this is the last hostelry before the 4,000-foot ascent. Rates: $170
to $500; (808) 338-1625, fax (808) 338-2338.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hana coast in east Maui, a three-hour drive from Kahului
Airport, the once musty Heavenly Hana Inn, 4155 Hana Highway,
reopened in June behind its signature bamboo gate as a sleek,
stunning Japanese-style hostelry of three suites under one roof but
each with separate entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Lush gardens surround the studio and suites and the grand dining
room, featuring exotic woods and impressive craftsmanship. Rates:
$100 to $235; (808) 248-8442.
</P>
<P>
   Shipman House Bed and Breakfast Inn, 131 Kaiulani St., Hilo, on
the Big Island, won the 1998 Historic Preservation Award from the
Historic Hawaii Foundation. It recently completed the renovation of
its conservatory, which will serve as the meeting room in this
100-year-old Victorian mansion. Rates in the three rooms and a
guest cottage with two units are $130 to $150; (800) 627-8447, fax
(808) 934-8002.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Scarcely a year old, the Old Wailuku Inn at Ulupono,
2199 Kahookele Street, Wailuku, helps make central Maui a viable
destination on this shoreline-crazy island. Situated near Iao
Valley, the Hawaii Nature Center, a block of antiques shops, and
mom-and-pop restaurants, this two-story, seven-room inn, built in

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When leaf-peeping northeasterners begin retiring their
binoculars for the year, Hawaii residents start dusting theirs off.
November opens the unofficial season of rubbernecking, a time when
migrating whales and big-wave riders turn the ocean into the site
of the islands' favorite spectator sports.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the economy and the weather, the humpback whales can be
counted on. They return in late November and stay until April or
May, breaching, spouting, mating and calving spectacularly in the
island waters that serve as their refuge from the icy ones they
have left behind in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   As for surfing, winter is its zenith, a time when ``pray for
surf'' is the prevailing mantra and waves aren't big unless they're
15 feet or higher. On the north shore of Oahu, the coastline
becomes theater: no wave is too large for the world's most daring
and accomplished surfers, who look like specks in the winter swell.
</P>
<P>
   These attractions are free, a considerable plus in a state
reeling with economic woes. The disappearance of Japanese
investment and the decline in tourism have come on the heels of
widespread plantation shutdowns, calling upon the adaptive spirit
of Hawaii's people.
</P>
<P>
   Attractive rates in hotel, air fare and travel packages can be
found in November and the first three weeks of December. In this
shoulder season (high season begins around Christmas and lasts
until mid-April), the islands are less crowded and the weather, as
in late spring, is at its best, averaging in the mid-70s _ although
several degrees warmer on the Kona-Kohala coast.
</P>
<P>
   With events from ``The Nutcracker'' to the Hawaii International
Film Festival, culture addicts, like surfers and luau aficionados,
have a full plate in the weeks to come.
 &UR; EVENTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Josef Albers, Sol Lewitt, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Frank
Stella, Richard Diebenkorn, Roy Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg
are among the 40 artists represented in ``First Decade: Highlights
from the Contemporary Museum's Collection,'' which runs through
Jan. 3 at the Contemporary Museum, 2411 Makiki Heights Drive,
Honolulu. Robert Motherwell's ``Elegy With Rice Paper and Blue,''
from his series ``Elegies to the Spanish Republic,'' is among the
works not previously shown here.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is set in a garden in the hills overlooking the city.
Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission: $5. (808)
526-0232.
</P>
<P>
   A storm in the Aleutians would be great news for big-wave riders
and spectators hoping for epic El Nino-generated surf at this
year's Vans G-Shock Triple Crown of Surfing Series, from Nov. 5
through Dec. 20 at Haleiwa Beach, Sunset, and Pipeline on Oahu's
North Shore. Top professional surfers will compete for $1 million
in men's and women's events. Free admission; (808) 637-6376 for
daily recorded information.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet Hawaii will present ``The Nutcracker'' Dec. 18 to 20 at
the Blaisdell Concert Hall, 777 Ward Ave., with guest artists from
the American Ballet Theater. Admission: $15 to $35; (808) 591-2211.
 &UR; SIGHTSEEING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good timing, powerful binoculars and quick reflexes (to pull
over if you're driving, or to drop whatever you're doing if you're
not) are useful when humpbacks appear, most reliably along the west
and south Maui shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Favorable vantage points along the west shore include Pap awai
Point, McGregor Point scenic overlook, Launiupoko State Wayside and
Wahikuli State Wayside; on the south shore, Wailea Beach Park and
the dining rooms of the deluxe Wailea resorts. On Oahu, Makapuu
Point, Waikiki and the Kaena Point Trail on the leeward coastline
can be center stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Whale Foundation, 101 North Kihei Road, supports its
research with daily whale-watching cruises beginning Dec. 1 on
Maui, $22 to $31; (800) 942-5311.
</P>
<P>
   At the Maui Ocean Center, a new five-acre marine park at 192
Maalaea Road, life-size whale models are part of the 60 exhibits.
Jaws drop during shark feeding and in the 54-foot walk-through
tunnel aquarium. Admission: $17.50, $12 for children; open daily 9
a.m. to 5 p.m., (808) 270-7000.
</P>
<P>
   Sections of a 22.5-mile network of ditches, flumes and tunnels
built in 1906 to irrigate sugar plantations have been transformed
into an easy, meandering waterway for kayaking.
</P>
<P>
   Guides with the Kohala Mountain Kayak Cruise explain the
region's history while gliding in the narrow outdoor flumes that
traverse rain forest and stands of wild ginger. Headquarters are in
Hawi, at the junction of Highways 270 and 250. Cost for the
75-minute paddle: $75, $55 ages 5 to 18; (808) 889-6922.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Lahaina Luau on Maui _ in moving to a larger oceanfront
site, 1251 Front St. in Lahaina six months ago _ has reinvented
itself authentically in a genre rife with cliche.
</P>
<P>
   At sunset, guests sit at tables or on lauhala fiber mats on the
ground in front of a grass-mound stage. The program offers
intelligent narration and excellent ancient hula (the absence of
fire dancing is noted but not lamented). There are no watered-down
mai tais and, like the atmosphere, the food is authentic Hawaiian,
and delicious. Admission: $65, $30 for children; (808) 667-1998.
</P>
<P>
   On Oahu, Pearl Harbor's newest resident, the 887-foot Missouri,
where Gen. Douglas MacArthur accepted Japan's surrender, is being
scrubbed, buffed and prepared for its opening in January as a
national memorial and museum. It is moored near the Arizona, sunk
during the Pearl Harbor attack. Guided tours will be $14; (808)
545-2263.
 &UR; WHERE TO STAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new Waimea Brewing Company, at Waimea Plantation Cottages,
9400 Kaumualii Highway, Waimea, may seem out of character in a
retro-historic plantation village, but in the dusty, dry plains of
this west Kauai town, there's something to be said for cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   The 48 authentic plantation cottages from the early 1900s were
moved from a nearby plantation and faithfully restored and equipped
with verandas and full kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   For those heading for the Waimea Canyon and Kokee State Park,
this is the last hostelry before the 4,000-foot ascent. Rates: $170
to $500; (808) 338-1625, fax (808) 338-2338.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hana coast in east Maui, a three-hour drive from Kahului
Airport, the once musty Heavenly Hana Inn, 4155 Hana Highway,
reopened in June behind its signature bamboo gate as a sleek,
stunning Japanese-style hostelry of three suites under one roof but
each with separate entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Lush gardens surround the studio and suites and the grand dining
room, featuring exotic woods and impressive craftsmanship. Rates:
$100 to $235; (808) 248-8442.
</P>
<P>
   Shipman House Bed and Breakfast Inn, 131 Kaiulani St., Hilo, on
the Big Island, won the 1998 Historic Preservation Award from the
Historic Hawaii Foundation. It recently completed the renovation of
its conservatory, which will serve as the meeting room in this
100-year-old Victorian mansion. Rates in the three rooms and a
guest cottage with two units are $130 to $150; (800) 627-8447, fax
(808) 934-8002.
</P>
<P>
   Budget: Scarcely a year old, the Old Wailuku Inn at Ulupono,
2199 Kahookele Street, Wailuku, helps make central Maui a viable
destination on this shoreline-crazy island. Situated near Iao
Valley, the Hawaii Nature Center, a block of antiques shops, and
mom-and-pop restaurants, this two-story, seven-room inn, built in
1924, is filled with vintage Hawaiiana. Notable features include
the original ohia and eucalyptus floors. Rates: $120 to $180; (808)
244-5897, fax (808) 242-9600.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury: With lava from an 1801 flow as its foundation, it was no
surprise that Hualalai Resort, Kaahumanu Highway, Kaupulehu, Kona,
on the Big Island, which contains the 243-room Four Seasons Resort
Hualalai, has added hot stone therapy to its spa offerings. Smooth
stream rocks are heated and placed on massage points.
</P>
<P>
   The low-rise, bungalow-style resort's educational programs for
guests, including celestial navigation, are firmly anchored in
Hawaiian culture. Room-car or room-breakfast packages are available
for $390 to $930; (808) 325-8000, fax (808) 325-8100.

<P>
   &UR; By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Santa Claus, the most famous of all mature travelers, is getting
ready to load his sleigh for his annual jaunt. He's asked us to
help out by answering the one question he hears so often at this
time of year: What would be the perfect holiday present for my Mom
and Dad, who love to travel?
</P>
<P>
   Consider these gift suggestions for mature travelers in your
household _ not only for Christmas but for all those other
gift-giving occasions throughout the year, from birthdays to
anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The gift of a trip is special in itself, but you can always
enhance any excursion that your mature travelers will be taking by
adding thoughtful extras. If they're on a cruise, consider buying
them wine each night to go with dinner. Or pop for a wedding-vow
renewal package for up to $400, depending on the amenities you
select.
</P>
<P>
   If Hawaii or Alaska is their chosen destination, just as it is
for so many mature travelers, underwrite the cost of a helicopter
flight over the volcanoes in Hawaii or to the Mendenhall Glacier in
Juneau, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground you can see the creeping lava on the Big Island of
Hawaii, but from the air you can see INTO the crater. And you can
actually touch down atop the Mendenhall Glacier and walk around on
5,000-year-old ice. Such helicopter trips usually cost $120 to $150
per person.
</P>
<P>
   If your travelers are headed for England, give them a day-trip
on the historic Venice-Simplon Orient Express, (800) 524-2420, from
Victoria Station to Folkestone and back for $250.
</P>
<P>
   They will experience the true meaning of elegant, Old World
travel as they board the restored Orient Express, enjoy lunch or
afternoon tea and watch the British countryside roll by.
</P>
<P>
   You can always cater to your travelers' special interests _ and
there is a host of special interests that go well with travel.
Golf, scuba or ski lessons at their vacation destinations would be
highly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Golf lessons from John Jacobs' Golf Clinics, (800) 472-5007,
include a 10 percent senior discount at many of the branches. How
about tickets to a senior golf tournament? The Senior Skins Game is
held at the end of each January at the Mauna Lani Resort, (808)
885-6655, on the island of Hawaii. A three-day ticket purchased
before Jan. 1 costs around $80, or $100 if bought closer to the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to theatrical performances where the marquees gleam _
like Dublin, London, New York or Toronto _ will enhance anyone's
visit to a big city.
</P>
<P>
   City passes are another way to make sure your travelers can see
as much as they want for one small price. City passes in Boston
($20.50), New York ($18), San Francisco ($19.95) and Seattle
($19.25) include senior discounts in their pricing and can be
purchased at visitor centers, leading museums, attractions or
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   If pampering your parents tops your agenda, think about gifts
from a spa. With spas now an integral part of many cruise ships and
resort destinations, it's easy to get a gift certificate for a
massage, wrap, aroma therapy or facial.
</P>
<P>
   To shop for these kinds of extras, a call to the cruse line, spa
or travel agent handling the traveler's arrangements takes minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to indulge a loved one is to give the gift
of peace of mind by purchasing travel insurance for their next trip
to cover trip cancellation and, more importantly, medical
emergencies. Prices will vary, depending on the price of the trip
being insured, but the average is around 5 percent of the tour
price.
</P>
<P>
   Discounts that make travel dollars go farther come in all
shapes, sizes and prices. Entertainment Publications, (800)
445-4137, publishes directories of hotel/restaurant discounts that
range from 20 percent to 50 percent off regular rates for specific
regions and areas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the National Hotel and Dining Directory ($44.95)
lists 2,000 restaurants and 3,500 lodging establishments that offer
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   A membership in Hilton Hotels' Senior HHonors Club, (800)
432-3600, costs $55 a year or $290 for a lifetime, supplies
discounts of up to 50 percent at all Hiltons and includes perks
such as car rentals and restaurant discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Do Mom and Dad like to ski? Place a call to the Over The Hill
Gang, (719) 389-0022, a group that specializes in hunting down
discounts for skiers ages 50 and older at both ski and non-ski
destinations. A one-year membership costs $65 per couple, $40 per
individual.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines' special coupon books for airfare discounts that range
in price from $548 to $596 can be purchased through a travel agent
or from the airline with the best service from your mature
traveler's home airport.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in United's Silver Wings Plus Travel Club, (800)
720-1765, costs $75 for two years and $225 for a lifetime
membership that results in great value travel packages and member
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If your mature travelers like to take treks in their RV,
consider buying them a KOA Value Card, (406) 248-7444, that costs
just $10 and provides 10 percent discounts for stays at KOA
Kampgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   A gift certificate for a travel package at a national park
enables your travelers to see the beauty of America's rugged
landscape while enjoying the comforts of some romantic extras. For
example, the Romance Package at Grand Canyon National Park combines
one night at the El Tovar Hotel (a Grand Canyon crown jewel) with a
bottle of El Tovar wine, a fruit basket and a champagne dinner for
two for $249 plus tax.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations for this or other packages to national parks can be
made by calling (303) 297-2757, the Amfac reservations number. You
can do some on-line shopping at www.amfac.com.
</P>
<P>
   And being mature travelers ourselves, we feel comfortable saying
your Mom and Dad's eyesight probably ain't what it used to be:
Think about stuffing their Christmas stockings with an atlas that
has reasonably easy-to-read type _ both on the maps and in the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   One such atlas that is better than most is ``Rand McNally's
Easy-to-Read Travel Atlas'' ($9.95 in most bookstores), which
features maps that are about 40 percent larger than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is that the map's index is right beside the map so
you don't have to flip back and forth in the book. There are fewer
listings per state to make up the space, but it's so easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for other stocking stuffers, consider a
telephone card in any denomination that matches your pocketbook.
They are wonderful to use in overseas phone booths and hotels.

   One of our favorite travel accessories is an inflatable pillow
that fits around the neck. The Cloud-Soft inflatable pillow from
Magellan's, (800) 962-4943, provides an extra measure of comfort on
a plane or motorcoach and costs only $9.85 plus shipping.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to books for travelers, we always recommend those
that set the scenes they'll be visiting. For example, ``Undaunted
Courage'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1996), by Stephen Ambrose, about the
Lewis &AMP; Clark expedition, is an easy read, yet it provides historic
insights into areas that visitors now explore as they follow the
famous paths of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Other good tomes: ``A Year in Provence'' (Knopf, 1990) by Peter
Mayle, or ``Midnight In The Garden of Good and Evil'' (Random
House, 1994) by John Berendt. Any of Tony Hillerman's works give a
new appreciation for New Mexico and its culture.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for a guidebook, check the copyright date to make
sure it's reasonably current. One of our favorite series is the
``Eyewitness Travel Guides,'' which feature many helpful graphics,
from charts and maps to photos and cutaways.

   Santa Claus, the most famous of all mature travelers, is getting
ready to load his sleigh for his annual jaunt. He's asked us to
help out by answering the one question he hears so often at this
time of year: What would be the perfect holiday present for my Mom
and Dad, who love to travel?
</P>
<P>
   Consider these gift suggestions for mature travelers in your
household _ not only for Christmas but for all those other
gift-giving occasions throughout the year, from birthdays to
anniversaries.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The gift of a trip is special in itself, but you can always
enhance any excursion that your mature travelers will be taking by
adding thoughtful extras. If they're on a cruise, consider buying
them wine each night to go with dinner. Or pop for a wedding-vow
renewal package for up to $400, depending on the amenities you
select.
</P>
<P>
   If Hawaii or Alaska is their chosen destination, just as it is
for so many mature travelers, underwrite the cost of a helicopter
flight over the volcanoes in Hawaii or to the Mendenhall Glacier in
Juneau, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground you can see the creeping lava on the Big Island of
Hawaii, but from the air you can see INTO the crater. And you can
actually touch down atop the Mendenhall Glacier and walk around on
5,000-year-old ice. Such helicopter trips usually cost $120 to $150
per person.
</P>
<P>
   If your travelers are headed for England, give them a day-trip
on the historic Venice-Simplon Orient Express, (800) 524-2420, from
Victoria Station to Folkestone and back for $250.
</P>
<P>
   They will experience the true meaning of elegant, Old World
travel as they board the restored Orient Express, enjoy lunch or
afternoon tea and watch the British countryside roll by.
</P>
<P>
   You can always cater to your travelers' special interests _ and
there is a host of special interests that go well with travel.
Golf, scuba or ski lessons at their vacation destinations would be
highly welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Golf lessons from John Jacobs' Golf Clinics, (800) 472-5007,
include a 10 percent senior discount at many of the branches. How
about tickets to a senior golf tournament? The Senior Skins Game is
held at the end of each January at the Mauna Lani Resort, (808)
885-6655, on the island of Hawaii. A three-day ticket purchased
before Jan. 1 costs around $80, or $100 if bought closer to the
event.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to theatrical performances where the marquees gleam _
like Dublin, London, New York or Toronto _ will enhance anyone's
visit to a big city.
</P>
<P>
   City passes are another way to make sure your travelers can see
as much as they want for one small price. City passes in Boston
($20.50), New York ($18), San Francisco ($19.95) and Seattle
($19.25) include senior discounts in their pricing and can be
purchased at visitor centers, leading museums, attractions or
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   If pampering your parents tops your agenda, think about gifts
from a spa. With spas now an integral part of many cruise ships and
resort destinations, it's easy to get a gift certificate for a
massage, wrap, aroma therapy or facial.
</P>
<P>
   To shop for these kinds of extras, a call to the cruse line, spa
or travel agent handling the traveler's arrangements takes minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to indulge a loved one is to give the gift
of peace of mind by purchasing travel insurance for their next trip
to cover trip cancellation and, more importantly, medical
emergencies. Prices will vary, depending on the price of the trip
being insured, but the average is around 5 percent of the tour
price.
</P>
<P>
   Discounts that make travel dollars go farther come in all
shapes, sizes and prices. Entertainment Publications, (800)
445-4137, publishes directories of hotel/restaurant discounts that
range from 20 percent to 50 percent off regular rates for specific
regions and areas.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the National Hotel and Dining Directory ($44.95)
lists 2,000 restaurants and 3,500 lodging establishments that offer
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   A membership in Hilton Hotels' Senior HHonors Club, (800)
432-3600, costs $55 a year or $290 for a lifetime, supplies
discounts of up to 50 percent at all Hiltons and includes perks
such as car rentals and restaurant discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Do Mom and Dad like to ski? Place a call to the Over The Hill
Gang, (719) 389-0022, a group that specializes in hunting down
discounts for skiers ages 50 and older at both ski and non-ski
destinations. A one-year membership costs $65 per couple, $40 per
individual.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines' special coupon books for airfare discounts that range
in price from $548 to $596 can be purchased through a travel agent
or from the airline with the best service from your mature
traveler's home airport.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in United's Silver Wings Plus Travel Club, (800)
720-1765, costs $75 for two years and $225 for a lifetime
membership that results in great value travel packages and member
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   If your mature travelers like to take treks in their RV,
consider buying them a KOA Value Card, (406) 248-7444, that costs
just $10 and provides 10 percent discounts for stays at KOA
Kampgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   A gift certificate for a travel package at a national park
enables your travelers to see the beauty of America's rugged
landscape while enjoying the comforts of some romantic extras. For
example, the Romance Package at Grand Canyon National Park combines
one night at the El Tovar Hotel (a Grand Canyon crown jewel) with a
bottle of El Tovar wine, a fruit basket and a champagne dinner for
two for $249 plus tax.
</P>
<P>
   Reservations for this or other packages to national parks can be
made by calling (303) 297-2757, the Amfac reservations number. You
can do some on-line shopping at www.amfac.com.
</P>
<P>
   And being mature travelers ourselves, we feel comfortable saying
your Mom and Dad's eyesight probably ain't what it used to be:
Think about stuffing their Christmas stockings with an atlas that
has reasonably easy-to-read type _ both on the maps and in the
indexes.
</P>
<P>
   One such atlas that is better than most is ``Rand McNally's
Easy-to-Read Travel Atlas'' ($9.95 in most bookstores), which
features maps that are about 40 percent larger than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus is that the map's index is right beside the map so
you don't have to flip back and forth in the book. There are fewer
listings per state to make up the space, but it's so easy to read.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for other stocking stuffers, consider a
telephone card in any denomination that matches your pocketbook.
They are wonderful to use in overseas phone booths and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   One of our favorite travel accessories is an inflatable pillow
that fits around the neck. The Cloud-Soft inflatable pillow from
Magellan's, (800) 962-4943, provides an extra measure of comfort on
a plane or motorcoach and costs only $9.85 plus shipping.

DR. ANTHONY FAUCI REMAINS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE WAR ON AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: PHOTOS slugged AIDS-RESEARCHER are available on the Wieck
database)  
 (For release Thursday, Nov. 26, or thereafter)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The prized photos in the office of Dr. Anthony
Fauci, one of the nation's top scientific warriors against AIDS,
highlight a small irony.
</P>
<P>
   There he is _ the director of the federal agency that oversees
about half of the government's AIDS research in framed snapshots
with such famous battlers against the deadly disease as Elizabeth
Taylor and Mother Teresa.
</P>
<P>
   But for a long time Fauci was public enemy No. 1 to the
activists in gay health groups and the outspoken AIDS Coalition to
Unleash Power (ACT-UP).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in 1988 Larry Kramer, a New York playwright and ACT-UP
founding member, called Fauci ``an incompetent idiot'' and a
``monster.'' Kramer even wrote a play in which someone labeled the
Fauci character a ``scientific fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   How Fauci _ one of the first government scientists to launch an
all-out federal attack on HIV, the virus that causes AIDS _ turned
around the irate activists and made them his allies is the story of
a man with infinite patience and consummate political skills.
</P>
<P>
   When the disease first erupted in America in 1981, he was
directing a lab dealing with the immune system at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is part of the
huge National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the Washington suburb
of Bethesda, Md. In 1984 Fauci became head of the infectious
diseases institute.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of AIDS victims grew and the death toll rose,
ACT-UP and other groups complained that the Ronald Reagan
administration in general and Fauci in particular weren't
responsive to the terrible plague.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled Dr. Fauci down to the wire,'' said Barbara Hughes,
president of the Treatment Action Group, a New York-based AIDS
advocacy organization. ``He started out as one of our chief
adversaries.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was under attack, Fauci was trying to unlock the
cellular mysteries of the immune system and the deadly virus. For
instance, researchers originally thought that after the virus
enters the body, it lies dormant for years. But Fauci and others
discovered that instead, it is quietly invading disease-fighting
cells and turning them into virus-making factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony was among the first to show that HIV continued to be
actively replicating during what was believed to be a dormant
phase,'' explains Dr. William Paul, an immunologist and a former
director of NIH's Office of AIDS Research. And Dr. R. Scott Hitt,
chairman of President Clinton's advisory council on HIV and AIDS,
calls the researcher ``a brilliant scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fauci, as a federal administrator, began to see that the
government and the AIDS activists had to work together if the
raging disease was ever going to be brought under control.
</P>
<P>
   When protesters held a demonstration at the NIH in 1988, he
invited several of them to his office for discussions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, at a Montreal AIDS conference, he unexpectedly ran into
Kramer, and the two discussed their differences. Soon afterward,
Fauci aggressively sought the advice of activists. He was the first
high-ranking government health official to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony came to community groups and asked, `What do you guys
think we ought to do?''' recalls Spencer Cox, a New York AIDS
activist. ``It seems like a small thing now, but it was a huge deal
then.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fauci says the activists ``were off base on a few
things but, son of gun, a lot of what they were saying made
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fauci agreed with complaints that the sluggish
government was not equipped to deal with the spiraling epidemic and
that bureaucrats had stymied drug development by pharmaceutical
companies with excessive regulations. He agreed that the
bureaucratic red tape was discouraging AIDS patients from taking
part in trials of possible new treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Based on input from the activists and prodding from Fauci, the
NIH instituted a plan in 1989 to speed the introduction of new AIDS
treatments. The strategy, now standard practice, is called
``parallel track,'' and it lets researchers conduct a clinical
trial of a new treatment while at the same time allowing sick
people to receive it.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Fauci's ties to AIDS groups have remained strong,
and he regularly appoints activists to advisory committees that
shape research efforts.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a top adviser to presidents and lawmakers on AIDS
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton relied on his expertise last year when the
administration laid out an ambitious goal of discovering within the
next decade a vaccine to prevent the virus from attacking the body.
On another front, Fauci's laboratory published a new study earlier
this month showing that Interleukin-2, a drug that stimulates the
immune system, may, along with other drugs, help the body fight the
HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his scientific duties, Fauci makes rounds twice a week
to see AIDS patients, conducts laboratory meetings and manages an
annual budget of $1.57 billion, $810 million of which is dedicated
to AIDS research.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a lobbyist for AIDS research, an administrator, and he
keeps an active lab going _ I don't think he gets much sleep,''
says Dr. Jay Levy, an AIDS expert and virologist at the University
of California at San Francisco medical school.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about his busy schedule, Fauci, an athletic 57-year-old,
admits that ``in this job, you have to accept that your working
hours are going to be different from most people's.'' He regularly
puts in 15-hour days and works most Saturdays, a routine that cuts
into time spent with his wife Christine Grady, an expert in medical
ethics, and their three young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   But there are psychic rewards. One is a sense of accomplishment
in being part of an effort that has seen death rates from AIDS
plummet with the advent of new treatments. Another is the
friendship he has developed with people who a decade ago were
denouncing him as a ``murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer, who is HIV-positive, regularly calls Fauci for advice on
treatments. And when the playwright is in the Washington area,
Fauci usually springs for dinner at an Italian restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer says Fauci's willingness to let the cajoling of activists
help transform the federal AIDS bureaucracy has made it possible
for AIDS to be contained. ``In my estimation, that puts him in the
encyclopedia as a great man,'' Kramer marvels, adding, ``He's my
hero.''

CRAWL-SPACE VENTS MAY HAVE LOUVERS THAT CAN BE CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Thursday, Nov. 26, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My newly-bought old summer house in the Berkshires has a 3
1/2-foot crawl space with a concrete-block foundation and three
vents. The vent closures are on the inside, and I am loathe to
crawl in there to close them. Can I cover them on the outside? They
seem to have several steel louvers behind the cast iron grille.
</P>
<P>
   KAY KILPATRICK, Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Look at those grilles a little more carefully; there should
be a handle at one side or the other or in the middle that you can
move to close the louvers. They may be rusted open, which will make
them virtually impossible to close. Actually, you should be able to
unscrew the grilles and pull the whole unit out in order to get the
louvers to move again. To do so, spray the louver connections and
all mechanical parts with WD40, then try to work them closed and
open.
</P>
<P>
   But you can also cover them from the outside: Tape a piece of
polyethylene plastic over them, or secure a pressure-treated board;
any thin board will do; an insulated cover is not necessary; the
cover is needed only to stop the flow of cold air through the
space. The vents should be covered in cold weather, say from
October to April.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I like the idea of using hard-faced ceiling tiles for my
bathroom; I can keep them clean and paint them when I feel like it.
But where can I find them? Home Depot was no help.
</P>
<P>
   C.T., Reading, mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I did mention such tiles, and had several inquiries from
callers who could not find them. I assumed they still existed
because I put them in my own bathroom several years ago. If the are
no longer made, it's a pity; they did yeoman service. So, your best
bet is to call Armstrong to determine if they exist and where you
can buy them. Call 717-397-0611.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The original white ceramic title in my 70-year old house is
in good shape, except it is crackled in the glaze. The crackle
lines are black, and no bleach or anything else will work for me. I
tried Tilex, straight bleach and acid, on separate occasions (I
never combnine these materials), all without success. What will
clean those crackle marks?
</P>
<P>
   JANE WEISS, Dedham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Those crackle marks are called crazing, and you may have to
live with them. But as a final try, wash the floor with Soft Scrub
or Simple Green. Flow on either material and let it sit on the
floor for 15 minutes or even longer. Then scrub and rinse. If this
improves things, fine; if not, you can try KRC-7 Porcelain Cleaner,
sold in plumbing supply stores. Good for dirty grout, too.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. All my doors are flush and pretty plain. Where can I get
paneled doors?
</P>
<P>
   WALT ABRAMS, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Home Depot has a huge selection of all styles. So does
Brockway-Smith of Andover, Mass., a distributor of lots of wood
items. For the latter provider, you have to order them through a
lumber dealer. The lumber store will have a Brockway-Smith (Brosco)
catalog that will list dozens of styles.
</P>
<P>
   Paneled doors not only come in different styles, but different
construction. The popular and least expensive paneled door is a
formed hardboard that looks paneled. The real paneled door is a
solid frame with solid panels, and is more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something you might try without buying a new door,
and it will cost very little. Buy wood or plastic molding and mount
it on the face of the flush door in the shape of a penel. Molding
comes in many shapes and sizes; just make a choice. Such ``panels''
will be raised from the face of the door rather than indented as in
a regular paneled door, but they will add to the style of the door
and give the feeling of panels. You can make the panels any shape,
size or form; you are limited only by your imagination and the
shape of the molding. You can nail or glue the molding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My dining room ceiling is scrolled, and is peeling. I was
advised to apply a coat of BIN after scraping off the peeling
paint. But tht BIN is now peeling. What an I do to prevent peeling?
</P>
<P>
   ANNE HILTON, South Weymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. BIN is a good stain killer where needed but not much of
primer or sealer. Now you have to try to scrape and brush off the
peeling paint with a medium-stiff bristle brush. Those scrolled
ceilinsg are a pain when the paint peels because removing the paint
is difficult. With paint scraped, brushed or sanded off, wash the
ceiling with a strong solution of detergent and water, let dry.
</P>
<P>
   Apply a thin coat of a latex enamel undercoater; normally this
is not needed on plaster, but because of previous peeling, it is a
good idea, because such undercoaters stick to a lot of surfaces.
Then apply two thin coats of latex ceiling paint. Notice I suggest
thin coats; thick coats are much more likely to peel.
</P>
<P>

KEEPING THE FAMILY IN BALANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Thursday, Nov. 26, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever Gary Slate of Stoughton, Mass. comes home from school
and sees yet another thick envelope in the mail for his sister, he
writes off dinner that night. Conversation is bound to focus again
on the pros and cons of yet another college that Rachel is
considering. Boring, boring, boring.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, 14, tries to be stoic. Nonetheless, he says, ``It starts
to make you feel bad.'' Bad as in jealous, left out, and worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts things in my mind that I wish weren't there and that
makes me feel weird,'' says Gary. ``Like, even though college is
far away for me, I wonder, `Am I gonna make it?''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Gary has felt that special events in
his sister's life are unfairly setting the agenda for the family.
Take her bat mitzvah. ``Nobody had time to do regular family
things, like throw a ball around,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   What Gary is experiencing is a disequilibrium in the family, a
natural occurrence when one child gets more than a normal share of
parental attention. It doesn't have to be monthslong preparations
for a bar mitzvah; for some children, attention that comes and goes
even in a week in the wake of a one-time award is too much to
handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family balance is out of whack,'' says psychologist Mark
L. Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   That it's out of whack for something exciting, something worthy
of pride and joy, is a nuance lost on them. A child can only bring
a child's perspective to bear, after all, and it can best be summed
up in three words: What about me?
</P>
<P>
   The sooner parents realize and accept that, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any child who feels left out is going to be hurt. That's human
nature,'' says Michigan clinical psychologist Daniel Blake, who
specializes in sibling relationships.
</P>
<P>
   How the hurt manifests itself varies by developmental stage:
</P>
<P>
   _A 3- to 5-year-old typically blames herself: ``It's my fault
I'm left out because I had bad thoughts about Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   _A 6- to 8-year-old sees things as right or wrong, thus he's
angry at you for being ``unfair'' and allowing the balance of
attention in the family to shift.
</P>
<P>
   _A child 9 or older knows he should be happy for a sibling but
he can't help his jealous feelings. ``That makes him feel bad: `I
must be a bad person if I can't be more generous and loving to my
sister,''' says pediatric psychologist Peter Goldenthal, director
of child and family therapy at Children's Seashore House of
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   At any age, the behavior you see can run a gamut, from lashing
out to withdrawing. The young child, for instance, could be angry
with Daddy for making her have the bad thoughts to begin with or
she could refuse to get caught up in the event because she reasons
she's too bad to share in it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest mistake we make is insisting a sibling be
happy for the sister. When you force a child to act other than the
way he feels, it creates dissonance, says Blake: ``It makes you
question your feelings _ `Are they real?' _ and makes you think
there is something wrong with you for having them.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting aggravated at what looks like a selfish attitude doesn't
help either. ``Asking, `Can't you be happy for your sister?' or
telling her that her turn will come doesn't compute for her,'' says
Goldstein, a Northbrook, Ill., therapist who specializes in family
relations. Children under 12 are generally too egocentric to take
another person's perspective, he says. They also have a hard time
looking into the future.
</P>
<P>
   While it's true many children look at a brother's presents or
praise and whine, ``I want some, too,'' Goldenthal tells parents
not to assume a child is only feeling petty jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very anxiety-provoking to see your older sibling go
through something you know you, too, will have to go through,
especially if the sib is struggling,'' he says. ``There's a lot of
anticipatory anxiety: `I don't want to go through that. It'll be
even harder for me!'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fran Slate says that for her daughter's bat mitzvah,
Gary was more nervous than Rachel. It wasn't out of empathy,
however. Not only was he nervous for himself, says Fran, but he
worried his parents would run out of money by the time it was his
turn. ``He wanted the same benefits as Rachel,'' says their mother.
``When it was time to plan his bar mitzvah, he wanted the exact
celebration she had.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisely, Fran and husband Arthur never tried to disavow Gary's
jealous feelings and engaged him in conversations about his fears.
Goldenthal urges all parents to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can almost be certain that every child worries about his
turn,'' he says. In families where there is only one child, the
comparison could be made to an older cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Bring up the issue even if a child doesn't: ``I know you've
noticed how hard this is/how much work this is. When it's your
turn, we'll get you all the help you need.'' This simple statement
of support, especially for a child who feels less capable, is
surprisingly calming, Goldenthal says.
</P>
<P>
   He also tells parents to let a child know that you know the
balance is out of whack. For instance: ``This college stuff is
taking more time than I expected and it may seem unfair to you. If
you notice I'm going overboard with it, tell me, as long as you are
polite about it.'' Then, says Goldenthal, ``When he says at dinner,
`Dad, you asked me to remind you,' thank him and switch gears.
Don't say, `Yeah, but this is important.'''
</P>
<P>
   While some siblings' anger will be directed toward the older
sibling, some may be directed toward you. ``It's as if she's
saying, `You're not taking good care of me!''' says Blake.
</P>
<P>
   Don't compromise your limit-setting, even if you feel guilty for
neglecting a child. Instead of making him feel special, it feels
like you aren't paying attention or don't care enough to set the
limits. In addition, you push him to seek negative attention:
``What will make Mom pay attention to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Not all children look at a big event in an older sibling's life
and dread it. Some can't wait for their turn, especially for
graduation or a driver's license. Validate that these are
reasonable feelings to have, suggests Blake: ```It does seem like
it will be forever, doesn't it,''' rather than, ```Stop griping,
it'll be your turn soon enough.' That puts you on his side,'' says
Blake: ```You aren't going through it alone.'''
</P>
<P>
   On occassion, the table gets turned and it's an older sibling
who is jealous of a younger's achievement. Just because he's older
and developmentally more capable of understanding how these things
can happen, the hurt is no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents have no tolerance for comments like, `She doesn't
deserve it,''' says Blake. He says a good response is to
acknowledge the reality in a gentle way: `There are some painful
moments in life and this may be one of them for you, to see your
sister do something better than you did. It hurts.''' Find a time
later to talk about his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Slate wishes there was a way for parents to protect younger
siblings from all the plans and discussions. ``Maybe the
conversations can be when the younger person isn't around, or after
he's gone to bed,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that parents have to forget about the college
applications, or whatever,'' adds Gary. ``I know it's a big deal in
a family, but the rest of us still have our life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Look for ways to include younger siblings in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Siblings who exhibit no signs of jealousy or anger may or may
not be fine. Try to draw them out by talking about yourself or a
third party: ``I remember when my sister ...''
</P>
<P>
   It's better to help a child work through feelings of resentment
than to buy the feelings away with a gift; when the gift's novelty
wears off, the feelings will still be there. On the other hand,
it's OK to talk about his upcoming birthday and what he wants as a
way to remind him that he, too, is worthy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're spending less time with a younger child, be pointed in
your adjustment: ``I've been so busy with Jen's recital that you
and I haven't had any time together. How about if we shut ourselves
in your bedroom Saturday morning to play?''
</P>
<P>
   If you can't afford to do the same thing you did for your
first-born, or your values have changed, say so: ``We gave your
brother a car when he got his license. It was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Give credit to a sibling for his help, even if the help is
simply not complaining: ``I know it must be hard to listen to all
these conversations. Thanks for being such a good sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal with brattiness between siblings as you always would, but
afterwards look for an opening to get feelings out: ``I bet it's
hard to see your brother getting so much attention ...''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFTERTHOUGHT _ Before a new baby and just after, two good books:
For a preschooler, ``Waiting for Baby'' by Harriet Ziefert; for 4-
to 7-year-olds, ``frog face, my little sister &AMP; me'' by John
Schindel (both Henry Holt).

OIL FUTURES GAME ISN'T FOR AMATEURS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turkey and fruitcake aren't the only things you can expect at
this time of the year.
</P>
<P>
   There are the sales pitches on the radio and TV to invest in
heating oil futures. They go something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be long before cold weather is here. Heating oil
inventories are down and demand is up. There are warnings about
shortages already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the facts on how $5,000 properly positioned can return
$20,000 or more with just a 10-cent move in heating oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   What you're hearing in the sales pitches is a deceptive
description of these risky markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that you can rush into the heating oil futures
market and make a fortune is a come-on,'' said Larry Norton,
associate enforcement director at the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, which regulates the trading of commodity futures and
options. ``Making a claim that you can profit based on well-known
events is fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
WARM SPELL CAN COST YOU &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this pitch? Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   First off, the professionals trading futures contacts that
promise delivery of fuel oil during the coldest months of the year
know the price goes up. If the winter is warmer than expected,
you're going to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the ad makes profiting from futures contracts seem like
a sure thing. The reality is, the value of these contracts swings
wildly up and down, sometimes for reasons that seem to have little
to do with the real-world demand for the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   That matters a lot to an investor because the typical futures
contract allows the buyer to put down a relatively small amount of
money to buy a huge amount of fuel oil for future delivery. Every
penny change in fuel oil price has a much larger impact on the
value of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with the pitches is that they suggest that the
person with the knowledge of the (oncoming) season has an
informational advantage over other people,'' said Dan Nathan,
deputy enforcement director at the CFTC. ``The problem is, we're
talking about instruments _ futures and options _ that are traded
in high volume on exchanges where everybody who trades them is
aware of the same information.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TRADERS TRACK MARKET CLOSELY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the case of fuel oil, the futures markets are in New York and
London, but the players include experts from around the world,
including many oil company traders in Houston with the best
information on supply and demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about professionals that basically follow the
commodities market, who play it daily,'' said Ray Seegmiller,
president and chief executive officer of Cabot Oil &AMP; Gas in
Houston. ``You have to know what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   They are all buying contracts giving them the right to buy or
sell a set amount during a certain time period. For instance, today
you could buy a contract giving you the right to buy 42,000 gallons
of fuel oil for around 35 cents a gallon. If the price rises, you
could profit from this trade by buying another contract to sell
42,000 gallons of fuel oil at a higher price. Your profit or loss
is the difference between the two prices, minus the commissions,
which can be steep.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are commissions and fees built into these
transactions,'' Nathan said. ``You start out with a little less
money upfront.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the risk of having the leverage of a futures
contract work against you. If the price of a commodity dips
sharply, you may be called on to put up more cash to comply with
rules that require people holding futures contracts to have cash
equal to a certain percentage of the value of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The sales pitch would make you think that a seasonal rise in
heating oil prices is a sure thing. The problem with that thinking
is that there's currently a huge glut of crude oil right now and
the price of fuel oil is depressed during a season where prices
normally are peaking.
</P>
<P>
   Profiting on a futures trade often means being able to follow
the market constantly because futures are about twice as volatile
as the benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of large stocks.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to beat the market, but for oil prices to run up
this year, it would likely need to be much colder than expected.

ORDERLY HOUSE, ORDERLY MIND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Thursday, Nov. 26, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A friend returned a book I'd lent her three years ago. It was
``The Messies Manual,'' one of a series Sandra Felton does so well,
the verbal equivalent of a week in boot camp for bad housekeepers.
I tried to stick it back on the shelf, but it clung to my fingers
for dear life and was grunting, ``Read me, read me,'' as it
wrestled me onto the couch.
</P>
<P>
   I'd already completed my entire fall cleaning. I'd finally
gotten rid of the pantry moths that spent an entire summer in my
house. I'd moved my winter clothes into my closet and organized the
upstairs hall closet. I was ready to move on with my life, when
that darn book started whispering, ``little minutes, little
minutes,'' like I really cared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little minutes'' is Felton's technique for breaking the habit
of making messes. It sounds simple. Placing something in a cabinet?
Wipe off the fingerprints. Brushing your teeth? Clean off the
counter. Putting away the laundry? Take a few ``little minutes'' to
straighten the drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Voila! No need for a cleaning marathon. None of this
it's-such-a-mess-I-don't-know-where-to-start. Everything that was
once neat and clean stays that way. No more lost checkbooks or
jumbled papers, dirty dishes in the sink, or clothes on the floor.
You just tidy up as you go along and before you know it, your house
is manageable and, even better, your life is in order at last.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe that, I have a bridge in Brooklyn I'd like to
sell you ...
</P>
<P>
   But I did believe Sandra Felton, who confesses to having once
been a major messie herself. I loved how orderly my house felt and
I wanted to reform. I didn't want to wake up in a day or two and
find that Hurricane Linda had struck again, dirtied things and
failed to clean them, taken things out and not put them back, used
things and left them where they didn't belong and couldn't be
found. Could my housekeeping actually be turned around in just a
few ``little minutes'' a day?
</P>
<P>
   A week later: The house is still neat, but I'm a wreck. Constant
straightening does the trick, but I'm finding that Felton's little
minutes stretch out like hours for someone who's used to leaping
ahead to the next thing on her mind. I'm usually ready to head off
to aerobics class right after breakfast, but like a fly in
molasses, now I'm stuck. I can't leave until the dishes are in the
dishwasher, the milk is in the refrigerator, and the oatmeal and
brown sugar are back on the shelf. Clean-up feels endless when I'm
raring to go and there are still a few malicious crumbs on the
counter, thumbing their nose at me.
</P>
<P>
   There are moments I doubt I'll ever get out the door again.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem. One little minute leads to a myriad
others, at least at the beginning. For example, for most of my life
I've simply gotten out of my car, taking a few things with me.
Inside the house I usually drop them on the counter in the hall and
tend to whatever task is before me. Now I carefully clean out the
car and when I get inside, I concentrate on putting everything
away.
</P>
<P>
   This is what happened one day. First I put the Scotch tape I'd
bought up in my office. I took a few little minutes to organize the
basket that holds Scotch tape and stuff. Then I filed the papers
I'd photocopied, taking more little minutes to straighten out the
papers in that one file. When I went to put away a shirt I'd
purchased, I took quite a few little minutes to hang all my
turtlenecks next to each other. I was putting away groceries, using
up more precious minutes wiping refrigerator shelves, when my
husband showed up, expecting to eat dinner.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't believe his nerve.
</P>
<P>
   Felton says it gets easier. I believe her, even though she's
never set foot in our attic or Jack's workroom, two domestic black
holes that have been accepting everything and disgorging nothing
for 30 years. When I have organized the life out of every drawer,
every closet, every shelf, and every cabinet in this house, she
promises my little minutes will shrink to almost nothing, my
extraordinary capacity to create a mess a minute will diminish, and
beauty, dignity, and harmony will reign in my home and in my soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere. Sometime,'' as Maria sings in ``West Side Story.''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe that, I have some waterfront property to sell you
in Bangladesh ...

WISTERIA FROM SEED PROVES LENGTHY TASK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By Kathy Huber 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: On a trip to Dallas there were pods hanging all over my
daughter's beautiful wisteria. Inside the pods were beans, much
like pinto beans, only larger. I snapped some of the pods off the
plant and put them in the freezer several days later. Can I use
these beans to start a wisteria of my own?
</P>
<P>
   A: The problem is that wisteria grown from seed can take 10 to
15 years to bloom. You might try cuttings, instead, or propagation
by simple layering.
</P>
<P>
   To propagate by softwood cuttings: Cut 6-inch lengths from
young, green stems. Make the cuts just above leaf nodes. Remove the
leaves from the bottom portion of each cutting. Dip the bottoms
into rooting hormone, tap excess and insert each into a
well-draining soil mix. Moisten with a fine spray. Place the pots
with cuttings in clear plastic bags. Fill the bags with air so that
the sides don't touch the cuttings. You also can prop the plastic
with sticks. Keep a close eye on the soil moisture and keep the
cuttings in good light. The cuttings may root in one to two months.
</P>
<P>
   If you take cuttings in late spring, the cuttings may be ready
to plant in the fall. If you take them later, don't plant outside
until after the danger of frost.
</P>
<P>
   To propagate by layering: Choose a young, low-growing shoot on
the mother plant. Trim the leaves so that there is a good length of
stem without foliage behind the tip. Make an angled cut on the
underside of the shoot. Dust the cut with a rooting hormone. Peg
the shoot into the soil. Use a piece of wire or a stone. When roots
have formed, sever the layered shoot close to the mother plant.
Plant in a pot or permanent place.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have more than 50 amaryllis I planted from seeds. They are
2 years old and have outgrown their pots. Please tell me how to
transplant these.
</P>
<P>
   A: You can transplant each bulb to a slightly larger pot if you
wish to keep them as container plants. I don't know the size of
your plants, but it could be that a 2 or 3-inch clay or plastic pot
would be adequate. Plant high in a rich, well-draining potting
mixture with a pH between 6.0 and 6.8. Protect against freezes.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Prasek, president of both local amaryllis societies,
says you also can transplant the amaryllis in the garden now,
preferrably to a sheltered area where the seedlings will receive
morning sun. Space the plants, Prasek again advises, about 4 inches
apart. You will need to space them further apart when the plants
are larger. A well-draining, sandy and slightly acidic soil is
best. Avoid a heavy soil. Mulch against freezes.
</P>
<P>
   Build garden seedlings, Prasek says, from below ground by using
a potassium product, preferrably one that is organic. Use one that
contains little or no nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Amaryllis grown from seed may bloom within three to four years.
Your new plants may not resemble parent plants if the latter are
hybrids, but it can be fun to just see what you get. Garden
amaryllis flower in the spring or early summer. Container amaryllis
can flower earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I planted spuria iris last fall, and this spring had lots of
green foliage but only one flower. They get identical culture as my
Louisiana iris (except they're in well-draining soil) _ and my
Louisianas are outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Four o'clocks are beautiful in my neighborhood, and I would like
to transplant them into containers. Can I do it this fall, and can
I prune them without inflicting too much trauma?
</P>
<P>
   A: Give your spurias another spring or so to come around. I have
had to wait on various irises to flower. Spuria iris like sun, a
moist, neutral soil and excellent drainage. Fertilize in early fall
and again in late winter.
</P>
<P>
   Established four o'clocks (Mirabilis jalapa) can have huge
tuberous roots, so I'd look for smaller plants. Generally, these
plants are tough as stumps, and I wouldn't worry about trauma. I'd
think deep pots would be best.

GIVING THANKS FOR THE MEANING OF LIFE AND OTHER THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Thanksgiving is upon us.
</P>
<P>
   So Thursday, Americans will gather around their tables and
re-create the historic scene played out so many years ago between
pilgrims and Native Americans in Plymouth, Mass., when . . . or was
that a bunch of Englishmen along the shores of the James River in
Virginia? Or somebody in Florida? Texas? Maine, maybe?
</P>
<P>
   Depends upon whom you ask. According to a recent newspaper
story, the site of the first Thanksgiving is the subject of some
dispute, with several states vying for the honor. The competition
is so heated you'd think federal funds were involved.
</P>
<P>
   As a native Virginian, I'm of course tempted to go with that
state's claim. (Snooty Virginia joke: How many native Virginians
does it take to change a light bulb? One hundred. One to change it
and 99 to tell you how important the original, historic one was.)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the meaning of the holiday remains as strong
today as it did at the first Thanksgiving, lo those many years ago
back there in . . . wherever.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us have much to be grateful for. So when you are
spilling cranberry sauce on the good tablecloth Thursday, don't
forget to give thanks for:
</P>
<P>
   - Time limits on congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   - College basketball.
</P>
<P>
   - Ahmad Rashad's forced vacation.
</P>
<P>
   - Snooze bars on alarm clocks. &QL; 
- The day in late September when the Arizona heat finally breaks
and the breeze blows and it doesn't feel like it's coming from an
oven. That sound you hear is an audible sigh of relief from the
entire Valley of the Sun.
</P>
<P>
   - The mute button on the TV remote during games called by Dick
Vitale, Matt Millen or Joe Thiesmann.
</P>
<P>
   - ``MASH'' reruns (Henry Blake episodes only).
</P>
<P>
   - ``Gadfly,'' ``Outside'' and ``Oxford American.''
</P>
<P>
   - The first five R.E.M. records.
</P>
<P>
   - Heartfelt compliments.
</P>
<P>
   - Allowing yourself to cry during ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   - A baby's first smile that isn't caused by gas pains.
</P>
<P>
   - Sammy Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   - Nike's NBA lock-out commercials.
</P>
<P>
   - Getting invited to Thanksgiving dinner at the home of someone
who can actually cook, saving you the depression of a fast-food
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   - Salt-and-vinegar potato chips.
</P>
<P>
   - Finding someone else who read and loved ``The Object of My
Affection.''
</P>
<P>
   - Homer J. Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   - A good, solid burp _ from your baby.
</P>
<P>
   - David Sedaris' ``Naked.'' &QL; 
- Watching the roof open on opening night at Bank One Ballpark in
Phoenix. Made everyone forget, for a moment, what all the fuss over
taxes was about. Very cool.
</P>
<P>
   - Epidurals.
</P>
<P>
   - No more campaign ads _ at least for a few months.
</P>
<P>
   - Episodes of the ``X-Files'' that make sense.
</P>
<P>
   - All-you-can-eat breakfast buffets.
</P>
<P>
   - Programming your CD player to play tracks 1, 10 and 3 _ in
that order _ from Crowded House's ``Temple of Low Men'' on a first
date.
</P>
<P>
   - The one decent golf shot in an afternoon of shanks that keeps
you coming back.
</P>
<P>
   - ``A Charlie Brown Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   - www.lileks.com.
</P>
<P>
   - Tom Wolfe's clothes. Wait, that's something (begin ital) not
(end ital) to be thankful for. Tom Wolfe's books, rather.
</P>
<P>
   - Guilty pleasures. (``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' is mine;
reflect upon your own.)
</P>
<P>
   - The moment of clarity achieved only at 3 a.m. when you are up
with your newborn and everyone else in the house _ heck, the
neighborhood, or maybe the entire city _ is asleep and the silence
is tactile and you suddenly realize just what your life is about.
You forget by morning, of course, but that doesn't matter. Be
thankful you at least knew once. &QL;

MONEYBOX: WHAT'S IN NETSCAPE FOR AOL 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   News that AOL is in the market to acquire Netscape for $4
billion had investors bidding up the stocks of both companies
Monday and reporters singing the praises of what they termed a
substantial challenge to Microsoft. But although the Internet
economy often appears to operate by its own strange set of rules,
in the case of mergers and acquisitions the offline and online rule
is exactly the same: In general, acquisitions are bad news for
everyone except the acquired company's shareholders. And while AOL
has done a great job of turning unpredictable moves into unexpected
successes, the economics of this deal seem questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The question to ask about this deal is the same question you
have to ask about any merger: ``What does buying a company let AOL
do that it couldn't do otherwise?'' And the answer to that question
remains somewhat unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Even if AOL were to replace Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its
default browser with Netscape's Navigator (something it says it
won't do), it doesn't have to acquire Netscape to do so. Netscape's
Web site, Netcenter, is supposedly on its way to becoming a portal,
and generates a lot of business traffic. But if AOL wants to build
its brand name on the Web, it could invest heavily in www.aol.com,
which is already one of the most heavily trafficked sites.
</P>
<P>
   Netcenter does have the great advantage of being the site to
which Navigator automatically directs users. But that hardly seems
like a long-term competitive advantage, especially since Microsoft
is bundling (or whatever you call it) Explorer with every copy of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, AOL is itself a portal to the Internet, and
spending $4 billion to establish itself on the Web seems somewhat
at odds with its basic business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Consolidation in the portal industry is probably in the cards.
But the portal strategy, built as it is on advertising, is hardly a
surefire success, and the minuscule profits being earned by even
the most popular sites are a healthy reminder of how up-in-the-air
all this remains.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the best Internet company in existence because it has a
steady stream of revenues from its users and because it's figured
out a way to leverage those users into income from advertisers,
content providers and retailers. But both sides of that equation
are essential to its success. With Netcenter, the first part of the
equation--the subscription fees--will disappear. Will what's left
be enough to justify the price tag?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. Things are fluid enough on the Net to make every judgment
provisional. But we know that companies tend to overpay for
acquisitions, that they underestimate the difficulty of fitting
companies together, and that they overestimate the synergistic
benefits. AOL President Bob Pittman has done a brilliant job
turning AOL into a dominant business. But is this really the best
way AOL has of spending $4 billion?

DISPATCH, NOV. 23: THE MICROSOFT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although I may be the only Microsoft employee who
also worked for the Department of Justice, I have so far refrained
from commenting on the Microsoft antitrust trial. I knew that my
broad (dare I say vast?) expertise--nine whole months as a
paralegal in the DOJ's Environmental Defense Section, two full
years covering noncomputer issues for Slate--could intimidate my
fellow reporters and might even sway the judge.
</P>
<P>
   To preserve the integrity of the justice system, I have stayed
silent. Today, the silence ends.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it just seems like an excellent day for a courtroom
visit. The morning papers announce that America Online is close to
striking a deal to purchase Netscape for $4 billion and to form an
alliance with Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   This merger is bad for Microsoft as a business, but since
anything that's bad for Microsoft as a business should be good for
Microsoft as an antitrust defendant, the news seems to have put a
spring in the step of the Microsofties at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The news of the merger intrudes on the courtroom, though not
till late in the morning. The day's business is the
cross-examination of government witness Frederick Warren-Boulton,
an economist testifying to Microsoft's monopoly status. The
interaction between Warren-Boulton and Microsoft lawyer Michael
Lacovara is painful. Warren-Boulton is petulant and
passive-aggressive: Every word must be dragged out of him. ``Yes''
has three syllables. Lacovara, young and hair-gelled, counters with
as much condescension as seems humanly possible (though my seatmate
assures me that Lacovara is by far the politest of the Microsoft
lawyers).
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton is defending a chart that shows Microsoft's share
of the browser market rising to 70 percent of homes and 60 percent
of businesses by 2001. Lacovara asks him if he read the newspaper
this morning. Warren-Boulton replies that he did. AOL currently
uses Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its default browser.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara pushes the witness to concede that 1) the merger makes
it likely that AOL will drop Internet Explorer and adopt Netscape
Navigator and 2) that switch will cut Microsoft's browser share.
The intention of the questioning seems to be to show that AOL holds
the power and Microsoft is the supplicant.
</P>
<P>
   But it is during these questions that it becomes clear that
Microsoft is not going to win this spin battle after all.
Warren-Boulton rejects the notion that AOL will drop Internet
Explorer for Netscape's browser. And when Lacovara tries to get him
to admit that the AOL-Netscape merger proves that the software
industry is competitive, Warren-Boulton responds, ``It is
unfortunate to see the disappearance of Netscape, one of the
brightest stars (in the industry). I regret that this has come to
pass, that Netscape has been forced to the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say two words at the end of that answer, and he didn't
need to. Everyone knew they were there: ``by Microsoft''--''forced
to the wall by Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   At the lunch break, which should be known as the midday spin,
lead DOJ lawyer David Boies tells reporters that according to
today's Washington Post, AOL will probably keep Internet Explorer
as its default browser. ``If AOL feels compelled to use Internet
Explorer, even after it owns Netscape Navigator, that is an
indication of Microsoft's power.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wanted the day's message to be: Microsoft is
weak--look at the mighty AOL-Netscape-Sun triumvirate. Instead,
Warren-Boulton and Boies have made Microsoft look powerful: the
bully who keeps control of AOL's browser.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon session, after all this spinning, is a comedown.
Lacovara spends most of it trying to show that Warren-Boulton is 1)
a technical ignoramus and 2) hence unqualified to make intelligent
judgments about the economics of the software industry.

   By the time I split at 4 p.m., Lacovara has--in three-plus days
of examination--covered only 11 pages of Warren-Boulton's 89 pages
of written testimony. Microsoft's lawyers, who want to make sure
the record is as thorough as possible for an appeal, are
cross-examining their witnesses line by excruciating line. Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, though he looks like he'd rather be
anywhere else, must sit there and (pretend to?) listen to this. No
one else has to, not even most of the reporters. By midafternoon,
the courtroom press section is emptying out. My colleagues, I
surmise, are ducking out to report the AOL story.

THE SEMI-CONDUCTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many fields, growing old means cutting back on your
professional responsibilities. But for orchestra conductors,
figures of mythic virility and longevity, advancing age seems only
to entail taking on more obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Kurt Masur, the 71-year-old music director of the New
York Philharmonic. Last week, it was announced that, beginning in
2000, Masur would become the principal conductor of the London
Philharmonic. In London, The Guardian reported that the German
maestro would, naturally, be resigning his New York position, which
pays him $1.3 million a year. But the paper was forced to print a
correction: Masur is not leaving New York. He will be conducting in
both cities until at least 2002, when his New York contract
expires.
</P>
<P>
   With just two big jobs, Masur is far from the busiest of the big
guns. The title probably belongs to Placido Domingo, the
globetrotting tenor. In 1996, he was appointed artistic director of
the Washington Opera. Nov. 1 it was announced that he would also be
replacing the retiring director of the Los Angeles Opera. Domingo
intends to run both institutions without cutting back on his
performance schedule at the Metropolitan Opera and elsewhere, his
``Three Tenors'' concerts with Luciano Pavarotti and Jos Carreras,
his recording calendar, or his bookings as a guest symphony
conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo's helicopter-to-rehearsal lifestyle is now the model for
conductors whose salaries often match those of star athletes and
CEOs. Norman Lebrecht of the London Daily Telegraph, perhaps the
only music critic with much of an instinct for sleuthing, has
unearthed some of the closely guarded salaries. In 1996, the
conductor Lorin Maazel earned $4.5 million, including $1 million as
the chief conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony and an additional
$2.7 million from the Bavarian State Radio Orchestra. The
pianist-conductor Daniel Barenboim earns $3 million or more as
music director in Chicago, artistic director and general music
director of the Deutsche Staatsoper Berlin, and as a touring
conductor with both the Berlin and the Vienna philharmonics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most amazing is Charles Dutoit, who serves as artistic
director of the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, musical director of
the Orchestra National de France, and the artistic director and
principal conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra's summer season
in Saratoga. In his spare time, Dutoit likes to ... guest conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The great American orchestras were built by conductors who by
today's standards would be hopeless homebodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Symphony was honed and polished by the Russian exile
Serge Koussevitsky, who conducted 100 concerts a year for 25 years
until 1949 and was midwife to the creation of great works by
Stravinsky, Schoenberg and Copland.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra was led by Leopold Stokowski, who
reigned supreme for 26 years until 1938, when Eugene Ormandy
succeeded him--and stayed for 42. George Szell had a similar role
in shaping Cleveland into a great musical city, as did Fritz Reiner
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   These men might travel to Europe for the summer festival season,
but they lived in the cities in which they played. They auditioned
musicians personally and knew them well. If a guest conductor
visited Philadelphia, you would probably find Ormandy backstage or
in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Today, by contrast, conductors tend to have a much more tenuous
relationship with their home cities. Rather than live in some
backwater, they jet in and out for rehearsals and conduct 30
performances a year there instead of 100. For nine months at a
stretch, they are somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few honorable exceptions to the orchestra-collecting
trend. Perhaps the most admirable is Simon Rattle, who took the
insignificant Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and, over a period of
16 years, developed it into a distinguished ensemble. Despite many
lucrative offers, Rattle has been loath to even spend much time
visiting elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rattle has now stepped down from the podium at Birmingham and is
weighing offers. It is expected that he will again choose to work
with one orchestra rather than several.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tilson Thomas, who in 1995 became the music director of
the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, draws praise for doing more
than hanging his hat there. Finland-born Esa-Pekka Salonen gets
high marks for his commitment to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, as
does Leonard Slatkin at Washington's National Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Why would an orchestra prefer an overpaid, absentee landlord
like Muti or Abbado to a dedicated resident, especially given that
the latter is likely to come much cheaper? Partly, it's the battle
for prestige. A provincial orchestra with an off-brand conductor
seems doubly provincial.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger issue is finance. Orchestra boards believe that a
star like Muti sells tickets, even to the majority of concerts he
doesn't conduct. And even the occasional presence of a musical
superstar makes it much easier to raise money. At a recent
fund-raiser, the Washington Opera took in an extraordinary $2.6
million, thanks to the charming presence of Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more orchestras than there used to be and
arguably fewer great conductors. The result has been a bidding war
for top talent and an opportunity to make money that few can
resist. The recent transformation of the conductor's career
parallels what has happened elsewhere in the economy. As the income
of top performers of all kinds has risen exponentially, the old
patterns of indenture have fallen away. The ability of a Zubin
Mehta ($6 million plus per year) or a Charles Barkley ($4.6
million) to make really big money has led to a system of free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   In basketball, where teams are constituted by the season, each
player looking out for his own career doesn't appear to harm the
overall quality of the game. But in symphonic music, where great
achievement comes from teamwork over a much longer time frame, the
moonlighting maestro is playing too fast.

NOTHING REDEEMING IN SPRINGER'S FILM DEBUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A disclaimer in the credits states ``Ringmaster'' is not
affiliated with Jerry Springer's successful afternoon talk show.
But ``Ringmaster,'' which is Springer's big screen grab at bigger
stardom, is about a TV host named Jerry Farrelly, who invites
``ordinary Americans'' to come on ``The Jerry Show,'' air their
dirty family laundry, engage in brawls and sit through penance as
Jerry (who has no qualifications as a therapist) analyzes their
actions. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   It may not be affiliated, but it sure is based upon the
phenomenon that's recently challenged Oprah in the ratings. Jerry
is TV's new cultural wonder and now he's out to tackle the movies.
So what does that say about us?
</P>
<P>
   If ``Ringmaster'' is a marker, not much. This Jerry is a bland,
befuddled guy who is content to sit back and let things happen all
around him. He sits in on a lot of meetings, sleeps with an
unidentified babe with whom he's not in love (Rebecca Broussard),
and wanders through the station halls, seemingly in a stupor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his passiveness, Jerry moderates a major TV show. One
episode features 19-year-old sex bomb Angel (Jaime Pressly), her
mom Connie (Molly Hagan), stepdad Rusty (Michael Dudikoff), and
Angel's doormat of a fiance, Willie (Ashley Holbrook). Angel is
sleeping with Rusty, so Connie seduces Willie for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Other guests include Demond (Michael Jai White), his feisty
girlfriend Starletta (Wendy Raquel Robinson) and her two best
friends. It seems Demond has been sleeping with her pals and
Starletta wants to clear the air. When all parties meet in L.A. to
tape the show, Demond and Angel begin flirting. Rusty walks out and
Willie gets drunk. Secrets are revealed and sparks fly.
</P>
<P>
   It may momentarily (and guiltily) entertain as a curiosity
piece, but ``Ringmaster'' is a mess. When an audience member jumps
up and lambasts the lot for having trashy values, Jerry emerges
from his coma and springs to life. He defends his guests, calling
them ``great, decent, kind _ and poor.'' And suddenly
``Ringmaster'' becomes politically motivated, making a mission
statement about the show and its class appeal. But what it doesn't
say is though these folks believe they're finding their 15-minutes
of fame, they're really Jerry's pawns.
</P>
<P>
   The script makes stereotypes out of everyone it purports to
dignify and ultimately it reeks of double standards. Worse, it's
mean, sleazy and a self-promoting ego piece that only wants to fool
viewers into spending eight bucks at the box office. My advice is
save your dough and watch the TV show for free.
</P>
<P>
   Ringmaster. Directed by Neil Abramson. Written by Jon Bernstein.
Cast: Jerry Springer, Jamie Pressly, Molly Hagan, Michael Jai
White. Artisan Entertainment. 90 minutes. Rated R for language,
sexual content, nudity.

   UNDATED _ Come Thanksgiving, Fox Sports knows it's going to be
hearing from animal rights activists. Seems they have a problem
with the six-legged turkey that John Maddden, NFL color analyst for
Fox, uses as a prop for Thanksgiving Day football games. Joe Pat
Fieseler, who owns a hideaway barbeque place in south Irving, is
the man behind the creation and he'll be cooking up another
multi-legged bird this week for Madden, who in turn will carve it
up and hand out ``turkey leg awards'' to the most valuable players
of the game between Dallas and Minnesota. By GORDON DICKSON. Story

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people has Dr. Jack Kevorkian been accused of
assiting in their deaths?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kevorkian, back in the news after CBS' ``60 Minutes''
broadcast a videotape of a killing in which the famed
right-to-death advocate said he injected a terminally ill patient
with lethal drugs, has acknowledged helping about 120 people take
their own lives. Since 1990, when he began his assisted suicide
campaign, Kevorkian has been acquitted of assisted suicide charges
in three trials, and a fourth ended in a mistrial. The latest
incident, in which Kevorkian was shown apparently injecting former
accountant Thomas Youk, 52, on Sept. 17, differs from past cases
because Kevorkian had said before that his clients voluntarily
activated his homemade devices that delivered the carbon monoxide
or intravenous chemicals that caused their death. Michigan's new
assisted suicide law, which took effect Sept. 1, makes the practice
a felony subject to five years' imprisonment. Kevorkian said he
took the tape to ``60 Minutes'' so a national audience could see
it, and to challenge prosecutors to settle the debate over assisted
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was there a female pilot aboard the ValuJet plane that
crashed in the Everglades?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported after the May 11, 1996, crash of ValuJet Airlines
Flight 592, the aircraft was captained by Candalyn Kubeck and
co-piloted by Richard Hazen. Kubeck, who turned 35 the day before
the crash, was one of three female captains who flew for the young
airline. She had logged close to 9,000 hours of flight time,
including 2,073 hours with ValuJet. Friends said Kubeck, who was
born in California, developed her love of flying as a youngster.
All 110 people aboard died in the crash, which was caused by a fire
in the cargo hold that started when improperly stored oxygen
cannisters taken from another plane ignited. ValuJet shut down
after the crash, but later merged with Orlando-based AirTran to
form a new company operating under the AirTran name. Company
headquarters were moved from Atlanta to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the address for political strategist James Carville?
I want to write him.
</P>
<P>
   A: After the Democratic political guru helped organize Zell
Miller's successful bid for Georgia governor in 1989, Carville
moved on to the presidential campaign of Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton. Carville, who remains a chief defender of the president,
helped Democrats hone the issue of lotteries for education, which
Miller has used to gain national praise and two challengers used
Nov. 3 to unseat incumbent Republican governors in Alabama and
South Carolina. Carville runs his consulting business at 112 5th
Street S.E., Washington, D.C., 20003. The phone number there is
202-543-1196.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently watched ``Fatal Vision'' on TV, the story of Army
Capt. Jeffrey MacDonald, who was found guilty of murdering his
family. Whatever happened to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: MacDonald is still imprisoned in Oregon. He was found guilty
in 1979 and sentenced to three consecutive life terms for killing
his pregnant wife and two young daughters in 1970. Since his
conviction, the former Army surgeon has steadfastly maintained his
innocence, alleging that the murders in the family's Fort Bragg,
N.C., apartment were committed by a band of drugged-out intruders.
He was stationed at Bragg with a Green Beret unit. MacDonald was
convicted on the basis of a fiber-and-blood reconstruction of the
crime, because there were no witnesses and no definite motive could
be established. ``Fatal Vision'' was a best-selling book
subsequently dramatized on television. MacDonald has made three
bids for a new trial, but each has failed. At last report, his
attorneys were pursuing a new strategy, seeking government evidence
for DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the year 2000 considered a leap year? I've read that some
years divisible by four are leap years, but some are not.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, 2000 will be a leap year, and will have a Feb. 29. A
leap year occurs in every year that can be evenly divided by four,
except the years that mark the even hundreds, such as 1500. The
only century years that are leap years are those that can be
divided by 400, such as 1600 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper article said race car driver Jeff Gordon earned
$6.1 million in 1998. Is that for him individually, or for his
team?
</P>
<P>
   A: His team. What Gordon receives out of the $6.1 million
depends on the contracts between him and the owner of his car, a
NASCAR spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recently reported discovery of evidence of a fish-eating
dinosaur, Suchomimus tenerensis, was exciting news. I know
tenerensis must pertain to the Tenere Desert in Niger, where the
fossil was found, but what does Suchomimus come from? Also, how is
it pronounced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both words taken together mean ``crocodile mimic from the
Tenere'' region of Niger in West Africa. ``Sucho'' is Greek for
crocodile, said Mark Norell, dinosaur specialist at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York, and ``mimus'' is the Latin
root word for mimic. The word is pronounced sook-oh-my-mus.
</P>
<P>
   The crocodile aspect was particularly fascinating to the
international team digging in the remote part of the Sahara. ``It
was a dinosaur trying hard to be a crocodile,'' University of
Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno, who led the expedition, told
The New York Times. The ``crocodile mimic'' reference comes from
the peculiar reptile's most distinctive characteristic: its
4-foot-long skull. The snout was particularly long and narrow, much
like a crocodile's.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists emphasized, however, that the appearance of the
Suchomimus snout shouldn't be interpreted as evidence of a close
evolutionary relationship between crocodiles and these dinosaurs.
University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz Jr. suggested in
the journal Science that the crocodilian aspects of the skull may
have arisen ``as adaptions'' toward a diet that included fish as
well as other animals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's reported that Britain has become the first European
Union country to ban the use of animals for testing in cosmetic
products. Is there a way for people in the United States to get a
list of all companies that use animals to test their cosmetics?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best source for such information is the organization
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. PETA's Susan Rayfield
says you can request a list of companies that say they don't test
on animals by writing to PETA, 501 Front St., Norfolk, VA 23510; or
calling 757-622-7382 and asking for the literature department,
which will mail a free guide. Internet users can check PETA's home
page _ http://www.peta-online.org _ and, under Action Alerts, click
on Consumer Products Companies That Do and Don't Test on Animals _
for additional information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of the B-2 bomber? It's never mentioned in
news reports about all the different types of armament used when
the U.S. military is deployed overseas, such as B-52 bombers and
Stealth fighters.
</P>
<P>
   A: Training missions for the B-2 Spirit were suspended
temporarily in August because of problems with the aircraft's crew
ejection system, but the planes now are ``combat ready, able and
willing'' to be deployed when required, Air Force spokesman Maj.
Tyrone Woodyard told Q&AMP;A. Although they're ``active'' at Whiteman
Air Force Base in Missouri, he said the bombers aren't involved in
combat operations at present ``because the United States hasn't had
a need for such combat operations since the Gulf War.'' The B-2
Spirits were deployed recently in Guam as part of a ``global power
mission,'' Woodyard added, to show their ability to deliver
long-range conventional bombs. Internet users can find current
information about B-2s at http://www.af.mil _ the Air Force's home
page.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have several questions relating to the NBA strike. What is
the average player salary? How does it compare with the average
salary 10 or 20 years ago? Do players get a fixed extra amount when
away from home for hotel accommodations and meals? In a nonstrike
year, how long is the season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last season's average salary was $2.6 million. In 1977-78 it
was $139,000, according to the NBA, and in 1987-88 it was $510,000.
When they're traveling, the players receive a per-diem allowance
for meals and other expenses, with the amount varying from player
to player. An NBA spokesman said he had no information on specific
dollar amounts or averages. The players don't pay for their hotel
rooms, he added. The regular season usually begins in early
November and runs through mid-to-late April. The playoffs extend
into June.

   Q: Whatever happened to the plan for the stock market to switch
from fractions to decimals in price quotations?
</P>
<P>
   A: The New York Stock Exchange announced in June 1997 that it
planned to switch to decimal pricing as soon as the securities
industry was ready. According to a report released by the General
Accounting Office, the industry will be prepared in the year 2000.
The NYSE's operations advisory committee has recommended that the
conversion take place in September 2000, as have all national
securities markets and the Securities Industry Association. The
NYSE, meanwhile, says it has been preparing its systems for the
conversion and will be decimal-ready by the end of 1998. The reason
the industrywide switch is being delayed, according to the GAO, is
that most available information-technology resources are being
dedicated to the year 2000 problem and the switch to a single
European currency in 1999.

   Q: Big Game advertisements indicate there are eight ways to win.
Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: A $1 play actually offers nine ways to win the Big Game, says
Parquita Nassau of the Georgia Lottery Corp.: (1) the
multimillion-dollar jackpot, for matching five of five white balls
and the Big Money ball; (2) $150,000, five white balls without the
Big Money ball; (3) $5,000, four white balls with the Big Money
ball; (4) $150, four white balls without the Big Money ball; (5)
$100, three white balls with the Big Money ball; (6) $5, three
white balls without the Big Money ball; (7) $5, two white balls
with the Big Money ball; (8) $2, one white ball with the Big Money
ball; and (9) $1, only the Big Money ball.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will Paula Jones have to pay tax on the $850,000 settlement
she is receiving from President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: The IRS declined to respond to this specific case, citing
instead its regulations governing court awards and damages in
general, and damages received for nonphysical injuries and
sickness. Taxable income would include, among other things, amounts
received as punitive damages; damages for nonphysical injuries or
sickness; and interest on any award. Compensatory damages not
considered taxable income would include, among other things, awards
for personal physical injury, alientation of affection and ``damage
to your character.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently watched several football games on TV sponsored by
the U.S. Postal Service. And now the new rate-increase stamps have
gone on sale. Is that sponsorship of sports events on TV what we're
paying for with the higher rates?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Postal Service defends its advertising during televised
football games and in various other events and media as a way to
keep customers informed about their choices in a highly competitive
business. Advertising is ``one of the techniques any business uses
to promote its products and to ensure the kind of volume we need to
be effective,'' said Postal Service spokesman Norman Scherstrom in
Washington. Advertising helps customers make the best buying
decisions possible, he added, saying that people wouldn't know all
the options available to them without it.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase, scheduled to take effect Jan. 10, is the
first in more than four years, Scherstrom emphasized, and
represents only a 2.9 percent increase during a period when
cumulative inflation has been more than 7 percent. He also pointed
out that advertising maximizes the use of the mail, and the more
volume there is, the lower the cost per item delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much does Earth weigh?
</P>
<P>
   A: This is one of those questions that physics experts and
mathematicians love to debate, because weight has an implied
meaning of pounds or tons with respect to Earth. Weight is related
to both mass and gravity. As a scientist explained, the ``weight''
of Earth with respect to Earth is zero, since the vector sums of
all the particles of Earth would cancel each other out. This
probably isn't what you mean, however. If you mean the Earth's
mass, it's 6 sextillion, 588 quintillion short tons (about 6
sextillion metric tons).

   Q: While vacationing in Orlando, I bought two Florida lottery
tickets. I tried calling 1-900-737-7777 to get the winning numbers,
but couldn't get through. Is there any other way to find out?
</P>
<P>
   A. The information is available online at the Florida Lottery's
home page

</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the last name of England's royal family?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was changed officially in 1917 from Saxe-Coburg Gotha to
Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it known how President Clinton is going to pay the
recently announced $850,000 settlement to Paula Jones, on top of
his other legal expenses?
</P>
<P>
   A: White House advisers said they hoped the $850,000 would be
covered by the president's personal insurance policies, according
to a report in The New York Times. But if the two companies that
have insured the president decline to pay, the money would come
from the president's legal defense fund. That fund reportedly has a
balance of more than $2 million. Hillary Rodham Clinton had been
worried that a settlement in the Jones case might make too big a
dent in the defense fund, according to the Times, but the Clintons'
fund-raisers assured her that they could easily replenish any money
used toward a Jones settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative watchdog organization Judicial Watch,
meanwhile, is challenging the legality of the Jones settlement,
saying it would be implemented using ``illegally obtained monies.''
According to Judicial Watch, it's illegal for any federal official
``to solicit, accept or benefit from monies from private
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: When does the rate hike for postage stamps go into effect?
</P>
<P>
   A: The basic 32-cent rate goes up by a penny Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that President Clinton has again exercised his authority
in Iraq as commander in chief of the military, can't he be charged
with adultery under the Code of Military Justice?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. As previously reported, this issue was addressed in
September by Defense Secretary William Cohen, who said that even
though the president is commander in chief, he's a civilian, and
therefore doesn't have to follow military rules prohibiting
adultery. Cohen was explaining how the president's case differs
from that of Kelly Flinn, the nation's first female B-52 pilot and
a first lieutenant, who resigned from the Air Force last year
rather than face a court-martial on charges of adultery, lying and
disobeying an order. So the latest Iraq situation, or any future
one involving Clinton's role in the military, won't change that.

<P>
   Q: What is Robert Novak's professional background?
</P>
<P>
   A: The newspaper columnist and TV commentator, who was born in
1931 in Joliet, Ill., worked first as a reporter for the Joliet

</P>
<P>
   After that, these have been his career moves: Champaign-Urbana

<P>
   Q: How many people has Dr. Jack Kevorkian been accused of
assiting in their deaths?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kevorkian, back in the news after CBS' ``60 Minutes''
broadcast a videotape of a killing in which the famed
right-to-death advocate said he injected a terminally ill patient
with lethal drugs, has acknowledged helping about 120 people take
their own lives. Since 1990, when he began his assisted suicide
campaign, Kevorkian has been acquitted of assisted suicide charges
in three trials, and a fourth ended in a mistrial. The latest
incident, in which Kevorkian was shown apparently injecting former
accountant Thomas Youk, 52, on Sept. 17, differs from past cases
because Kevorkian had said before that his clients voluntarily
activated his homemade devices that delivered the carbon monoxide
or intravenous chemicals that caused their death. Michigan's new
assisted suicide law, which took effect Sept. 1, makes the practice
a felony subject to five years' imprisonment. Kevorkian said he
took the tape to ``60 Minutes'' so a national audience could see
it, and to challenge prosecutors to settle the debate over assisted
suicide.

<P>
   Q: Was there a female pilot aboard the ValuJet plane that
crashed in the Everglades?
</P>
<P>
   A: As reported after the May 11, 1996, crash of ValuJet Airlines
Flight 592, the aircraft was captained by Candalyn Kubeck and
co-piloted by Richard Hazen. Kubeck, who turned 35 the day before
the crash, was one of three female captains who flew for the young
airline. She had logged close to 9,000 hours of flight time,
including 2,073 hours with ValuJet. Friends said Kubeck, who was
born in California, developed her love of flying as a youngster.
All 110 people aboard died in the crash, which was caused by a fire
in the cargo hold that started when improperly stored oxygen
cannisters taken from another plane ignited. ValuJet shut down
after the crash, but later merged with Orlando-based AirTran to
form a new company operating under the AirTran name. Company
headquarters were moved from Atlanta to Orlando.

   Q: What is the address for political strategist James Carville?
I want to write him.
</P>
<P>
   A: After the Democratic political guru helped organize Zell
Miller's successful bid for Georgia governor in 1989, Carville
moved on to the presidential campaign of Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton. Carville, who remains a chief defender of the president,
helped Democrats hone the issue of lotteries for education, which
Miller has used to gain national praise and two challengers used
Nov. 3 to unseat incumbent Republican governors in Alabama and
South Carolina. Carville runs his consulting business at 112 5th
Street S.E., Washington, D.C., 20003. The phone number there is
202-543-1196.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently watched ``Fatal Vision'' on TV, the story of Army
Capt. Jeffrey MacDonald, who was found guilty of murdering his
family. Whatever happened to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: MacDonald is still imprisoned in Oregon. He was found guilty
in 1979 and sentenced to three consecutive life terms for killing
his pregnant wife and two young daughters in 1970. Since his
conviction, the former Army surgeon has steadfastly maintained his
innocence, alleging that the murders in the family's Fort Bragg,
N.C., apartment were committed by a band of drugged-out intruders.
He was stationed at Bragg with a Green Beret unit. MacDonald was
convicted on the basis of a fiber-and-blood reconstruction of the
crime, because there were no witnesses and no definite motive could
be established. ``Fatal Vision'' was a best-selling book
subsequently dramatized on television. MacDonald has made three
bids for a new trial, but each has failed. At last report, his
attorneys were pursuing a new strategy, seeking government evidence
for DNA testing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the year 2000 considered a leap year? I've read that some
years divisible by four are leap years, but some are not.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, 2000 will be a leap year, and will have a Feb. 29. A
leap year occurs in every year that can be evenly divided by four,
except the years that mark the even hundreds, such as 1500. The
only century years that are leap years are those that can be
divided by 400, such as 1600 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper article said race car driver Jeff Gordon earned
$6.1 million in 1998. Is that for him individually, or for his
team?
</P>
<P>
   A: His team. What Gordon receives out of the $6.1 million
depends on the contracts between him and the owner of his car, a
NASCAR spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The recently reported discovery of evidence of a fish-eating
dinosaur, Suchomimus tenerensis, was exciting news. I know
tenerensis must pertain to the Tenere Desert in Niger, where the
fossil was found, but what does Suchomimus come from? Also, how is
it pronounced?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both words taken together mean ``crocodile mimic from the
Tenere'' region of Niger in West Africa. ``Sucho'' is Greek for
crocodile, said Mark Norell, dinosaur specialist at the American
Museum of Natural History in New York, and ``mimus'' is the Latin
root word for mimic. The word is pronounced sook-oh-my-mus.
</P>
<P>
   The crocodile aspect was particularly fascinating to the
international team digging in the remote part of the Sahara. ``It
was a dinosaur trying hard to be a crocodile,'' University of
Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno, who led the expedition, told
The New York Times. The ``crocodile mimic'' reference comes from
the peculiar reptile's most distinctive characteristic: its
4-foot-long skull. The snout was particularly long and narrow, much
like a crocodile's.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists emphasized, however, that the appearance of the
Suchomimus snout shouldn't be interpreted as evidence of a close
evolutionary relationship between crocodiles and these dinosaurs.
University of Maryland paleontologist Thomas Holtz Jr. suggested in
the journal Science that the crocodilian aspects of the skull may
have arisen ``as adaptions'' toward a diet that included fish as
well as other animals.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's reported that Britain has become the first European
Union country to ban the use of animals for testing in cosmetic
products. Is there a way for people in the United States to get a
list of all companies that use animals to test their cosmetics?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best source for such information is the organization
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. PETA's Susan Rayfield
says you can request a list of companies that say they don't test
on animals by writing to PETA, 501 Front St., Norfolk, VA 23510; or
calling 757-622-7382 and asking for the literature department,
which will mail a free guide. Internet users can check PETA's home
page _ http://www.peta-online.org _ and, under Action Alerts, click
on Consumer Products Companies That Do and Don't Test on Animals _
for additional information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of the B-2 bomber? It's never mentioned in
news reports about all the different types of armament used when
the U.S. military is deployed overseas, such as B-52 bombers and
Stealth fighters.
</P>
<P>
   A: Training missions for the B-2 Spirit were suspended
temporarily in August because of problems with the aircraft's crew
ejection system, but the planes now are ``combat ready, able and
willing'' to be deployed when required, Air Force spokesman Maj.
Tyrone Woodyard told Q&AMP;A. Although they're ``active'' at Whiteman
Air Force Base in Missouri, he said the bombers aren't involved in
combat operations at present ``because the United States hasn't had
a need for such combat operations since the Gulf War.'' The B-2
Spirits were deployed recently in Guam as part of a ``global power
mission,'' Woodyard added, to show their ability to deliver
long-range conventional bombs. Internet users can find current
information about B-2s at http://www.af.mil _ the Air Force's home
page.

<P>
   Q: I have several questions relating to the NBA strike. What is
the average player salary? How does it compare with the average
salary 10 or 20 years ago? Do players get a fixed extra amount when
away from home for hotel accommodations and meals? In a nonstrike
year, how long is the season?
</P>
<P>
   A: Last season's average salary was $2.6 million. In 1977-78 it
was $139,000, according to the NBA, and in 1987-88 it was $510,000.
When they're traveling, the players receive a per-diem allowance
for meals and other expenses, with the amount varying from player
to player. An NBA spokesman said he had no information on specific
dollar amounts or averages. The players don't pay for their hotel
rooms, he added. The regular season usually begins in early
November and runs through mid-to-late April. The playoffs extend
into June.

   CALIFORNIA -- CONGO. Rep. Tom Campbell is visiting Africa this
week, traveling to some of the poorest countries on the continent.
But he will not be going to the six nations that are in the deepest
peril in Africa, the Democratic Republic of Congo and other Great
Lakes-region countries, which are embroiled in a ferocious,
possibly genocidal war. A look at American foreign policy toward
that strife-torn region. Stricherz
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA -- RELIEF. Florida was hit hardest by natural disasters
this year, according to the American Red Cross, which responded 21
times to hurricanes, floods, tornadoes and wildfires across the
state. (Working.) Williams
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA -- RELIEF. The Red Cross has conducted 14 major relief
operations in Georgia this year, making it the third-busiest state
in the nation for America's premier private disaster aid
organization. (Working.) Williams
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS -- COMPUTERS. Ten schools in Central Massachusetts
will receive discounted Internet access and other telecommunication
services through a federal funding program, Vice President Al Gore
announced. Preston
</P>
<P>
   -- EUROPE. Europe is Massachusetts' number one export market,
and European companies are the number one international investors
in the state, according to a study released by an international
business group. Preston
</P>
<P>
   NEVADA -- EUROPE. Europe is Nevada's number one export market,
and European companies are responsible for $3.1 billion Silver
State investments, according to a new study released by an
international business group. Preston
</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- OHIO-CLOUT. (For THANKSGIVING WEEKEND.) Between the
105th Congress, which just ended, and the 106th Congress, which
begins in January, the state of Ohio is losing a lot of clout in
Washington. A 24-year senator (John Glenn) is being replaced by a
rookie; a 30-year congressman who served on the powerful
Appropriations Committee (Louis Stokes) will be succeeded by a
freshman in the minority party; and the state's highest-ranking
member of GOP leadership (John Boehner) lost his post. What does
this mean and what will be done about it. Eckstein
</P>
<P>
   -- STEEL. (SENT TODAY For THANKSGIVING WEEKEND.) Russell
Williams was caught completely by surprise two months ago when he
came in to begin his shift at WCI Steel in Warren and found he had
been laid off. But James Frazier, another of roughly 200 steel
workers laid off at WCI, said he had heard rumors that something
like this was coming. Both men blame the dumping of cheap foreign
steel in the domestic market for endangering their jobs. (Working
-- project.) Gorman
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS -- IMMIGRATION. Immigration advocacy groups called on the
Department of Justice to reconsider their guidelines on a law
allowing El Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants to apply for
citizenship. They stressed that the millions of dollars these
immigrants send back to their country is a crucial part of that
region's recovery from the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch.
Will also include information on policy suspending the deportation
of illegal aliens from Central America to stay in the U.S. until
January 1999. Brown
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIN ISLANDS -- RELIEF. The American Red Cross has spent an
estimated $104 million on aid to victims of Hurricane Georges,
making it the costliest disaster-relief operation in the
organization's history. Williams
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- BALDWIN-GAY. Although the media has given
Rep.-elect Tammy Baldwin, D-Madison, special attention as the first
openly gay woman in Congress, it probably won't make a difference
to her legislative career, according to the other gay members of
Congress. With responses from former Wisconsin Rep. Steve Gunderson
and Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., and possibly Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass. Hurt
</P>
<P>
   -- CENSUS. The House subcommittee on the census held a briefing
Tuesday condemning the method of statistical sampling for the 2000
census, which could result in the loss of a congressional seat for
Wisconsin. Butler

<TEXT>
<P>
   PERRY, Ga. _ This year, say those who tend the stately groves of
pecan trees here in central Georgia _ or ``middle Georgia,'' in
local parlance _ the pecans ``did not show up for work.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an exaggeration, of course. The inexperienced eye sees
great heaps of the nuts on the ground beneath the huge, spreading
trees, before they spill in a golden rush from shelling machines.
And there will be no shortage of pecan pie on the nation's
Thanksgiving tables Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the rigs that are still weaving their way among
Georgia's pecan trees will shake loose only an estimated 50 million
pounds of the sweet, tender, meaty nuts, about half the normal
harvest for the state, which leads the nation in pecan production.
</P>
<P>
   No, this was not a normal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather did not cooperate,'' said Al Pearson, an owner of
Big Six Farms in Fort Valley, near Perry, where patches of raw
earth are the color of yams and where fields of cotton sugar the
flat landscape that has not been planted with peach or pecan trees.
The rains, and then the heat, came at the wrong times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping we can get enough of the crop in before the
leaves fall,'' Pearson said two weeks ago during a tour of his
land. Given the proper conditions in the fall _ a nip in the air
doesn't hurt _ the round, lime-size husks begin to split, releasing
the nuts inside.
</P>
<P>
   In a good year, a tree will produce 100 pounds of pecans, which
works out to about 1,000 pounds an acre. Farmers here still speak
wistfully of 1978, when the state produced 135 million pounds. This
year's shortfall is forcing prices up to $7 or more a pound for
pecan halves, about a $1 more than they were last year.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest, which began about a month ago, is now going full
bore and is likely to continue well into December. You start to see
roadside stands that advertise ``new crop pecans'' along the flat
highways that radiate south from Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago in Atlanta, about an hour's drive north of Macon,
there were no pecans for sale at Harry's Markets, a chain of huge
food stores that specialize in fancy produce. ``We're waiting for
this year's crop,'' a clerk said.
</P>
<P>
   A fresh pecan is a revelation, a far different thing from the
brown, often wizened nut that you find in bags on supermarket
shelves. At its best, no more than a month off the tree, a pecan is
golden, plump and tender, with a mellow, buttery flavor and hardly
any of the bitter tannins found in the walnut, a distant relative.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers always hope for an early harvest, starting in
mid-October and finishing fast. Later in the season, when the
tree's slender, gray-green leaves begin to drop, they slow the
complex sorting and grading process. And in an off year especially,
it becomes a burdensome expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``One good day of harvest in October is worth a week in
December,'' Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pearson, a gray-haired man who manages to avoid the farmer's
weather-beaten look, is into pecan production for keeps, as
temperamental as it may be. Constantly fishing the smooth-shelled
oval nuts from his pocket, cracking them in his palms and
absent-mindedly munching them, he explained that his
great-grandfather came to the region from a town near the Alabama
border more than 100 years ago for logging and farming. There were
few pecan trees at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Pecans are native to the lower Mississippi Valley but not to
Georgia. The 16th-century Spanish explorer Hernando De Soto, who
discovered the Mississippi River, wrote about these nuts. They are
a relative of the hickory, and their name comes from a Cree word
meaning ``bone shell'' or ``hard shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Their botanical name, Carya illinoinensis, or Illinois hickory,
may be a misnomer, since you won't find many pecans growing there.
Texas follows Georgia in production, with an average of 60 million
pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson planted Mississippi Valley pecans at Monticello
and gave a few trees to George Washington. Three of them still
flourish at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, stands of wild pecan trees took root in Georgia,
but in the late 1800s there were only about 100 acres planted for
commercial purposes. They thrived, and by the 1920s nearly 100,000
acres were under cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal pecan tree _ one that is easy to grow, has a straight
trunk that is not vulnerable to storms and matures early with high
yields of large, high-quality paper-shell nuts _ has not been
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are more than 500 growers in Georgia but no single
major brand to promote them, the way Diamond Walnut Growers has
established a market for California walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson's grandfather John Winlock Pearson, who was the oldest
of six boys and six girls _ a number that gives Big Six Farms its
name _ grew mostly peaches.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Valley is in Peach County. Pearson's father, Lawton
Pearson, began planting pecans on a large scale after World War II,
finding that the two crops complemented each other: they require
the same soil and can be harvested at different times. Pearson now
runs the farm's 1,100 acres of pecans and 1,200 acres of peaches
with his brother-in-law Bill McGehee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it could be all pecans,'' Pearson said. ``They're less
labor-intensive, and they don't have a lot of competition, the way
the peaches do from California. I think there's a real future for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   By future, Pearson is looking beyond Thursday's pies, or even
the few weeks following Thanksgiving when bags of the nuts are
added to cookies and gift baskets. And perhaps he is also looking
beyond our shores.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other indigenous American foods _ corn, beans and
potatoes, for example _ pecans have never been embraced by
Europeans and are still relatively unknown in Europe or other parts
of the world. Hardly any of the American crop is exported. Only
recently have pecans been grown outside the United States, notably
in Australia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is to be future growth in the pecan market, there
must also be an appreciation for pecans that goes beyond the pie
and a few other confections.
</P>
<P>
   Pecan pie is on every Georgian menu, of course. It's usually
made with nut pieces, not halves, and often has a gooey, pale
filling, because many Georgian cooks use granulated sugar and light
corn syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Terry, an owner of Elizabeth on 37th, a restaurant in
Savannah, said that the more delicate flavor is needed to offset
the pecan taste. It's the same at the venerable New Perry Hotel in
Perry. But Pearson's wife, Mary, who bakes the pies that the
Pearsons sell in their cafe and store, Pearson Farms, also in
Perry, uses light brown sugar for a little more intensity. When it
comes to pecan pie in Georgia, everyone is an expert.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to be in Georgia to understand that pecans are also
there for breakfast, lunch and dinner year-round, in pancakes,
muffins, salads, chicken dishes, fish breading, casserole toppings
and desserts. And also for nibbling plain, an easy habit to acquire
when the nuts are so good and so fresh.
</P>
<P>
   And freshness is at the heart of the matter. They know how to
handle pecans in Georgia. When the season is over, Georgians
maintain the quality of the nuts by keeping them refrigerated,
which will preserve them for a month or so, or better still, by
freezing them, which holds them in top condition for six months or
longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people came down into a grove and tasted a fresh pecan,
they might never buy one from a store,'' said Buddy Leger, who
grows pecans at L &AMP; M Enterprises in nearby Cordele, and who is
also the chairman of the state's Pecan Commission. ``We can't get
supermarkets to put them in the cooler with the produce.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Because pecans have such a high fat content _ more than 70
percent, compared to 64 percent for walnuts _ they easily turn
rancid and acrid. But freshness is only the first thing to
understand about Georgia's pecans.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 100 or so varieties, about 30 have been developed for
commercial production, and several of them are important in
Georgia. Stuarts _ medium to large flattened ovals _ are the most
likely to be on store shelves outside the state. The Schley _
pronounced SLY and more spade-shaped than the Stuart _ has the
thinnest shell, making it the easiest to crack; it is often sold in
the shell.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of the lot is the Desirable, which is often called
``mammoth'' in mail-order catalogs. It is fat and meaty but
slightly rumpled-looking. And who would not be intrigued by
medium-size ones called Cape Fear?
</P>
<P>
   But local connoisseurs tend to prefer the plump but small,
rounded Elliotts. ``Why does anyone need a nut larger than the
Elliott, especially when it tastes so good?'' Pearson asked. It
isn't hard to be won over; they are deliciously sweet and
beautiful, in flawless halves.
</P>
<P>
   At Ellis Brothers, a grower and sheller in Vienna (pronounced
vye-AN-nuh), the owners love the Elliott because the neat, perfect
halves are easily popped from the shells. ``It doesn't make pieces,
and in our business, we want 85 percent of the nuts in halves,''
said Elliot Ellis, who is an owner of the company, which was
founded by his father in 1944, and whose first name is a
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Once the nuts have been harvested and separated from debris like
leaves, twigs and stones, they are polished mechanically to remove
the natural black streaks that sometimes mark the shells, a process
that is strictly cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Then the shells are washed in a chlorine solution to sanitize
them before they are fed into a bank of crackers, where each nut is
grabbed in a little vise and hit by a plunger to break the shell,
at the rate of one nut a second. At Ellis Brothers, a relatively
small company, 10,000 pounds are processed a day during harvest
time.
</P>
<P>
   The nuts pass through a series of contraptions with galvanized
metal arms and chutes covered in pecan dust. In the chutes,
extraneous bits of shell are removed, as the nuts are sorted and
graded before reaching conveyors, where women do a final inspection
and sort the pecans by hand. Then the nuts are bagged. Some go
directly into the country store in the front of the plant, where
they sail off the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we know we can sell everything we shell,'' Ellis
said. So, it may pay to stock up on shelled pecans. Now. Just
remember to put them in the freezer. &QL;

REWRITING THAT PIE, THE SOUL OF SWEETNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ga., Texas, S.C.)   (af)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's classic. It's irresistible. And it's a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Two bites into the standard pecan pie, and even
dessert-toughened Yankees raised on chocolate decadence cake,
tiramisu and creme brulee know that they're in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   This pie is sweeter than a Shirley Temple film festival, more
cloying than a Barbara Walters interview. Like Rhine maidens draped
seductively on jagged rocks, those luscious pecans sit atop a thick
tremulous layer of filling so sweet that it can make grown men cry,
so gooey that it can stop a speeding locomotive dead in its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   More than a century after the Civil War, pecan pie remains the
last holdout against Reconstruction, but wily carpetbaggers,
assisted by a few Southern scalawags, have been tinkering with the
pecan-pie formula and coming up with ways to make it a little less
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The filling is the soft underbelly that's vulnerable to attack.
In traditional recipes, it is what pastry chefs call a clear
custard _ that is, a sweet, almost jellylike ooze made without milk
or cream. Karo corn syrup, sugar and eggs are the three main
ingredients, but some chefs use dark Karo or dark sugar to bring
down the treble notes, so to speak, and create at least the
impression of less sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   In ``As Easy as Pie'' (Collier Books, 1990), Susan G. Purdy
calls for a teaspoon of lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Brachman, the pastry chef at Mesa City and Bolo in
Manhattan, says the problem is architectural. Pecan pie should be a
tart. ``Pie is the wrong shape for it,'' he said. ``If you use a
tart dough, you solve the sweetness problem, because it's less
sweet; it's shallower, so you use less filling, and it adds crunch,
which is a great foil for sweetness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Greenwood, of Greenwoods on Green Street in Roswell, Ga.,
grinds pecans into a meal and uses it to thicken the filling, which
he makes with dark Karo syrup and dark brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It binds with the sugar granules and cuts the sweetness,'' he
said. ``It almost acts as a flour, so when you bite into the pie
you get an unbelievable pecan flavor and a firmer texture _ it
doesn't ooze and goo on you.'' Greenwood also sneaks in a little
Wild Turkey _ not the bourbon, but the leaner, dryer rye whisky.
</P>
<P>
   At Grace's Trattoria on the Upper East Side, an unlikely pecan
spot, Joseph Trama has fiddled around with a dessert he used to
make at the Quilted Giraffe and come up with a pecan square that
cleverly rewrites the traditional roles assigned to crust, filling
and nuts.
</P>
<P>
   In this compromise between pie and tart, a dense layer of pecans
sits on a pate brisee, or short crust, held in place by a lightly
applied syrup of butter, honey, white sugar, brown sugar and cream.
Because the crust and the pecans do most of the talking, the
dessert is rich but not cloying. It's the dry martini of pecan
pies.
</P>
<P>
   When pecan pie sheds its sweetness, though, does it lose its
soul? Some Southerners think so. ``It should be so sweet it makes
your teeth ache,'' said Bruce Lane, who, with Scott Wyatt, wrote
``New York's 50 Best Places to Eat Southern'' (City &AMP; Company,
1998). ``A lot of the Northern recipes we encountered simply aren't
sweet enough. We found pies that used all Karo syrup and no sugar,
and some that even used salted nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane may or may not be standing on firm historical ground.
Although attempts to trace the origin of pecan pie have ended in
frustration, it is closely related to the semi-sweet cheesecakes of
18th-century England, which, with a little linguistic mangling,
evolved into chess pie and treacle tart.
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly enough, the first printed recipes for pecan pie
did not appear until the 1930s, but in no time, ``The Joy of
Cooking'' and the Fannie Farmer cookbooks brought pecan pie to a
national audience, and it has remained a classic ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sweetness is a fairly late development,'' said Stephen
Schmidt, the author of ``Master Recipes'' (Clear Light, 1998). ``In
the 1950s, all the butter and milk came out of the pie. The 1936
Fannie Farmer Cookbook, for example, calls for one-half cup butter
and one-half cup milk in its pecan pie recipe. That butter and milk
cut the sweetness by about a third.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does pecan pie have to be so sweet? ``Absolutely not,'' said
James Villas, who recently wrote ``My Mother's Southern Desserts''
(William Morrow) with Martha Pearl Villas. ``You call Mama. She'll
tell you all about it. She just got her big order of pecans, and
between now and Christmas she'll be going berserk.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Villas, you need to call home more often. ``Of course it's going
to be sweet _ it's made with sugar and corn syrup,'' Mrs. Villas
said, sweetly. Her pie does include two instructions that keep the
sugar rush within bounds, however. She uses a lot of pecans, to
shift the pecan-filling ratio, and she uses a crust with no sugar.
``Another thing I do, I dry my pastry a little bit before I put the
filling in, which helps keep it from being soggy.''
</P>
<P>
   At Baby Routh in Dallas, Stephan Pyle cuts into the sweetness of
pecan pie by putting it on a bittersweet chocolate base and serving
it with whisky-flavored whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers looking for the real thing will have a tough time.
``There's too much cheating in this town, and it starts with the
pecans,'' Villas said. ``People don't realize that nothing turns
rancid faster than a pecan.''
</P>
<P>
   Rancid pecans are the least of it. Forlorn Southerners stand a
better chance of hearing Rudy Giuliani say ``that dog won't hunt''
than they do of finding an acceptable piece of pecan pie in New
York, where the crusts are sodden, the nuts are desiccated and the
fillings look like spackle. Of course, they run into the same
problem down South.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope. Lane and Wyatt, who hail from South Carolina and
Texas respectively, did manage to find good, classic pecan pies at
Acme Bar and Grill in Greenwich Village, the Hog Pit in the
meatpacking district and Carolina Country Kitchen in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   They also give the Southern seal of approval to the sweet-potato
pecan pie at Acadia Parish Cajun Cafe in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. The
sweet potato takes the sugar and the syrup right out of the recipe,
but the pie earns a high rating even so.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, you can always have it with a Dr Pepper. Or, you can
heed the advice of Alon Balshan, the owner of Alon's Bakery in
Atlanta: ``If you don't want something sweet, you shouldn't eat
pecan pie.''

   PECAN SQUARES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Joseph Trama, Grace's Trattoria &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus cooling time &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7{ sticks unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   3 cups all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated white sugar
</P>
<P>
   2\ teaspoons salt
</P>
<P>
   2\ cups firmly packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   } cup honey
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds pecan pieces
</P>
<P>
   { cup plus 1 tablespoon heavy cream. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut 3 sticks of the butter into small pieces, and place in
the freezer to chill thoroughly; set aside the remainder of the
butter at room temperature. Set aside a measuring cup filled with a
mixture of water and ice. Spray a 12-by-17-inch jelly roll pan with
nonstick spray, and set aside. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the flour, { cup
white sugar and } teaspoon salt. Pulse briefly to blend. Add the
chilled butter pieces, and pulse until the mixture resembles grated
cheese. With the motor running, pour a thin stream of ice water
through the feed tube, just until the dough is cohesive; one-third
to { cup may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured board, and roll out to
a 13-by-18-inch rectangle. Transfer the dough to the jelly roll
pan, fitting it into the corners and slightly over the edges of the
pan. Trim off excess dough. Bake just until the dough loses its
shine and is very lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from
oven and set aside; leave the oven at 325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a large saucepan over medium heat, combine the remaining
4{ sticks of butter, { cup white sugar, the light brown sugar, the
honey and 1{ teaspoons salt. Bring to a boil, and continue to boil
for 4 minutes. Add the nuts, and mix well. Remove from the heat,
and stir in the cream.
</P>
<P>
   5. Stir the pecan mixture to blend thoroughly, then pour the
mixture on top of the baked pastry. Spread evenly with a spatula.
Bake until the pecan mixture is thickened and lightly set, about 22
minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool; the filling will
continue to firm as it cools. To serve, trim the crust from around
the edge of the pan. Cut into 3-by-4-inch rectangles, and serve at
room temperature.

   Yield: 16 servings.

 MAURICE, OR THE FISHER'S COT
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Mary Shelley.
</P>

 &UR; HAPPILY EVER AFTER? &QL; 
 &UR; By MARINA WARNER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   After Rousseau decreed in ``Emile'' that fantasy and fairy tales
were dangerous, pedagogic reformers and children's publishers tried
to provide, instead of ``bloods'' and ``romances,'' rational
instruction in history, nature and geography. Mary Shelley's
father, William Godwin, pioneered this gentling of traditional
material with his Juvenile Library, and her 1820 story, ``Maurice,
or The Fisher's Cot,'' resembles his progressive nursery fare: it's
a classic fairy tale about a foundling restored to family and high
social status. But in Godwinian mode, Shelley updates it to
contemporary England, adding reformist social color and improving
touches.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice hasn't been stolen from his cradle by fairies but has
been snatched from his nanny by a desperate woman whose husband
beat her for her childlessness. When Maurice, a beautiful, delicate
child in the image of the young Percy Bysshe Shelley, grows up
sickly and frail, he too falls victim to his usurping stepfather's
violence. No maltreatment damages his radiant nature, however. He
leaves home and is taken in by an upstanding, poverty-stricken
fisherman and his wife. The couple embody rustic virtue; she
teaches children to read from the Bible and refuses payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice'' was written for Laurette, a girl of 10, and the
story's way of telling reveals that Mary Shelley was aware that her
reader was an English child who had never been ``home'' and whose
natal tongue was Italian: it's plainly written, and contains scenes
of the southern English coast and customs and the kinds of lichen,
moss and damp-loving plants that grow there. But the success story
lacks energy, its impact dulled by the melancholy that, as Claire
Tomalin observes in her introduction, undoes its Panglossian
optimism. It opens with the fisherman's funeral and ``finishes with
the crumbling away'' of his seaside cottage (the ``cot''). In a
Wordsworthian mood, Shelley seems to be lamenting that this kind of
probity will not be seen in modern times again.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Maurice'' echoes Godwin's own genial pedantry, he
turned it down, writing that it was too short. This was probably
diplomatic on his part. Although interest in Mary Shelley warrants
publication, it's clear that when news came of a lost manuscript,
stored in the Tuscan house of direct descendants of a family with
close links to the Shelleys, something rather more was hoped for.
``Maurice'' is a slight piece; it contains little of the seething
originality, moral complexity or sinister Gothic speculativeness of
``Frankenstein,'' written only four years before, and Tomalin, as
if in tacit acknowledgment of the story's shortcomings, digs deep
into the social background, where many fascinating specters gather.
</P>
<P>
   Laurette was the illegitimate daughter of Margaret, Countess
Mountcashell, and an Anglo-Irish gentleman-adventurer, George
Tighe. This household of adulterous expatriates presented in many
ways a mirror image of the Shelleys: after the poet's first wife,
Harriet, killed herself, he was denied access to their two
children; Lady Mountcashell had also been parted from her eight
previous, legitimate offspring. Meanwhile, three of Mary's infants
had died. Against this terrible background of severance and loss,
Mary Shelley's optimistic story becomes much more than a family
romance; when she imagines a boy who resists illness, cruelty and
poverty so well that he actually succeeds in growing up, she may be
uttering a wistful charm against the fate that dogged her.
</P>
<P>
   Claire Tomalin, whose main interest here lies in the biographies
of the tangled background cast, has unearthed much new material
about Laurette, her sister, Nerina, and their mother, whose lives
offer a rich and unfamiliar tapestry of women's troubles and
achievements in the turbulence of 19th-century Italy. But she can't
quite conceal her disappointment that Laurette, later a
professional, much-published author, never wrote anything worth
reading.
</P>
<P>
   When she was 10, Mary Shelley had adapted a jaunty vaudeville
song into a children's rhyme, ``Mounseer Nongtongpaw,'' which makes
spirited fun of English bigotry and greed. Godwin published it, the
first work of his prodigious child. The patient, gloomy ``Maurice''
confirms that the visionary writer of ``Frankenstein,'' the
brilliant daughter and wife of notorious firebrands, dreamed of a
quiet and simple existence. Maurice's mysterious benefactor, who
turns out to be his long-lost father, holds out ``the pleasure of
living in the country, of seeing the pretty flowers grow in the
hedges . . . and in the evening to read entertaining books.'' Like
the monster who looks in the window of the blind man's cottage at
the ideal scene round a peaceful hearth, Mary Shelley in
``Maurice'' communicates how much she hankered after an ordinary
life in England, how her elopement sentenced her to a perpetual
homesickness.

 &UR; TANKS AND PLANES. CHEAP. BARELY USED. &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES B. STEWART &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This book doesn't read like a polemic, but the sheer weight of
its facts makes it one: we are spending $250 billion a year on
defense, we don't know why and it's not enough. It is the kind of
book that leaves a reader agitated and indignant, and should by all
rights ignite an urgent national debate. Why, to cite one recent
example, did Congress have a knockdown battle over $1 billion in
Federal funding for more teachers, yet add more than $9 billion in
``emergency'' defense spending with hardly a peep of public
discussion?
</P>
<P>
   William Greider, best known as the journalist to whom David A.
Stockman, the first Reagan Administration's budget director, bared
his soul, and the author of books on the Federal Reserve and global
capitalism, begins ``Fortress America'' by wondering what happened
to the ``peace dividend'' -- capital freed from military spending
by the collapse of the Soviet threat. After touring our military
establishment, he concludes not only that there hasn't been one,
but that our ``vast arsenal will become increasingly incoherent and
hollow -- mismatched against the new global realities.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems, if anything, an understatement. Take the B-1 bomber,
designed for intercontinental nuclear strikes deep inside the
Soviet Union; the United States spent hundreds of billions to build
100 of them. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the bombers
were outfitted for conventional weapons, at unspecified additional
cost. Yet none were deployed in the Persian Gulf war. They are so
expensive to maintain and operate that 27 of them have been
mothballed, and the others perform what the Air Force describes as
``global power missions,'' apparently a public relations function.
Has this sorry experience killed off the new B-2 bomber, another
financial black hole? Even when the B-2's will make the B-1 fleet
redundant? When they cost $2 billion each? And when five studies
concluded that the Air Force doesn't need them? No.
</P>
<P>
   Greider describes the headlong development of sophisticated new
weaponry designed for a nonexistent enemy as a form of cannibalism:
new weapons not only cost a fortune to develop, build and,
especially, maintain; they render existing, generally
state-of-the-art weaponry obsolete. We sell the old weapons for
pennies on the dollar, if that, to ``friendly'' countries that we
hope won't let them fall into the hands of guerrillas based in
places like Afghanistan, where we may have to send in our newer
high-tech weapons and destroy them. Or, in the case of hundreds of
old tanks, we sink them in the ocean to create reefs that, we hope,
will attract tropical fish.
</P>
<P>
   And what vital interest is all of this supposed to protect? It's
all too clear that it was and still is meant to contain the old
Soviet Union. Sounding almost nostalgic, Col. Bill Rake of the Air
Force tells Greider: ``We knew it was the bear, and we had a
purpose. We did the training for the bear. Now the bear might not
be there. But somebody might just jump up from behind the door.
Iran, Iraq? We don't know.'' This seems insane, yet is weirdly
logical in a military establishment where no one, including the
President and Commander in Chief, articulates a comprehensive
strategy. ``The juggernaut,'' Greider concludes, ``lumbers on,
doing what it knows how to do best. It is unwilling to rethink its
future, unable to let go of the past. Like the shark, it must keep
feeding, only now it is feeding on itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this would be so leads Greider to the old
military-industrial complex, which he prefers to call the ``iron
triangle,'' of the defense industry, the military and Congress.
What's new here is the swift consolidation of the defense industry
since the end of the cold war into what amounts to three large
behemoths. What's not new is the complex's interest in promoting
jobs and revenues in the home districts of powerful legislators.
But in the wake of the industry mergers, defense jobs in the
private sector have dropped from 3.6 million to about 2 million,
and in a trade-off of jobs for profit, the companies are operating
at higher efficiencies and with lower costs. Greider argues that
the ``Clinton Administration did indeed bless the process and
encourage it'' even though the Government hasn't realized much in
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Greider seems to concede that the problem lies not so much with
private industry, which is simply and predictably exploiting a
policy vacuum to maximize profits for shareholders. The problem is
a failure to confront the implications of the end of the cold war.
It is accepted doctrine, for example, that we should be prepared to
fight two simultaneous full-scale wars. But why? Why two and not
three or one? No one seems to know. What about those pesky
peacekeeping missions -- Somalia, Bosnia? How many of those should
we be prepared for, and under what circumstances should we
intervene?
</P>
<P>
   That the United States, as the only superpower, needs to provide
global military leadership seems irrefutable, yet we have failed to
articulate any principled basis for doing so. The result is what
appears to others as ad hoc exercises of our power that, Greider
argues, will inevitably lead to perceptions of American empire
building, resentment and, as with the British in the 19th century,
hubris and erosion of our strength.
</P>
<P>
   While Greider's case seems persuasive, his prescriptions seem
fuzzy; he readily acknowledges that he lacks (as do I) ``the
expertise to be able to describe the correct size and design of the
force structure.'' He argues that the ``armed forces ought to be
realigned in purpose and greatly reduced in size,'' but this kind
of vagueness led us into the morass he describes. He finds the
armaments industry even more irrational then the military itself,
but proposes no alternatives. And he will lose conservatives -- who
probably most need to digest the implications of this book -- with
his hand wringing over alleged American imperialism, his
digressions into environmentalism and his selective use of polling
data to proclaim what the American people want.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's clear that what Greider wants is to prompt a
vigorous debate. Surely someone in the next Presidential campaign
will return national defense and military spending to center stage,
and if this book helps him (or her) do it, Greider will have
rendered an immense public service.

   A Biography of Oona O'Neill Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   By Jane Scovell.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated. 354 pp. New York: Warner Books. $25.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; THE LADY AND THE TRAMP &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMES SPADA &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a century after Lytton Strachey's ``Eminent Victorians''
redefined the art of telling lives, the biographer's lot is not a
happy one. Since the 1970s there has been such a tidal wave of
biographies and memoirs that there is nary a celebrated life left
unrecorded. Worried authors have begun to seek out less well-known
but interesting subjects whose lives, once brought to print, might
capture the public's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Scovell has chosen Oona O'Neill Chaplin, and indeed, the
daughter of Eugene O'Neill and child bride of Charlie Chaplin would
seem to be the ideal biographical second-stringer. Born in Bermuda
in 1925, she was a beautiful, vivacious, intelligent girl who
palled around New York with Gloria Vanderbilt, dated J. D. Salinger
and Orson Welles, and was named debutante of the year. She was
given a Hollywood screen test but gave up the promise of movie
stardom at the age of 18 to become the fourth wife of Chaplin, who
was 36 years her senior. She bore him eight children and remained
married to him until his death 34 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Her story, one will have surmised by now, is memorable mainly
because of its two male leads. Her father deserted her mother, the
writer Agnes Boulton, when Oona was 2. She rarely saw O'Neill after
that; six years once elapsed between strained, awkward visits. The
little girl kept a scrapbook of pictures of him clipped from
newspapers so she would know what he looked like.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 17, Oona was a Manhattan prep school student and a
young lady about town, making the social columns on the arms of
older squires, who escorted her to sophisticated watering holes
like the Stork Club. She told The Daily News that ``a girl ought to
earn her own living,'' and so she planned to forgo a Vassar
education to become an actress. Aghast, her father promptly
disinherited her, put the word out to his theater associates that
she was not to be given work and called his daughter, whom he
scarcely knew, ``a spoiled, lazy, vain little brat.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that she fell into the fatherly arms of
Chaplin, a man who hadn't always waited for his earlier paramours
to turn 18 before he married them? Observers questioned her motives
as much as his, and most gave the marriage six months at best.
Salinger, a spurned beau, was so upset with Oona, Scovell tells us,
that he wrote her ``a scathing, scatological letter describing in
disgusting detail his version of the Chaplins' wedding night.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the psychological forces that drove them, and despite
the astronomical odds against the success of their marriage, Oona
and Charlie Chaplin found lasting happiness. He made her feel
worthwhile, and she provided him with the unwavering attention and
adoration his overweening ego demanded. The actress Joan Collins
observed that Oona ``catered to him with an almost geishalike
deference,'' but it is also clear that Chaplin greatly valued her
opinion. On the sets of his later, largely unsuccessful films, he
would look to Oona, sitting off to the side, for a nod of approval
after every take.
</P>
<P>
   They spent the bulk of their marriage living in a manor in
Vevey, Switzerland, where they moved after Chaplin's leftist
leanings made him a target of the House Un-American Activities
Committee. Oona cared for him like a duty nurse until his death, at
88, on Christmas morning, 1977.
</P>
<P>
   The widowed Lady Chaplin was only 52, a wealthy and famous
woman. She might have been expected to blossom, to write the book
several publishers had sought from her or at least to found a
philanthropic organization and give a star-studded fund-raising
event every year.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she grieved ceaselessly for Chaplin, and -- like her
parents, brother and uncle before her -- declined into alcoholism.
When she failed to appear at a party she gave in her Manhattan
penthouse years after her husband's death, a friend went into her
bedroom, found her lying in total darkness and asked what was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it must be where Charlie is,'' she replied. She
died from pancreatic cancer in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Scovell tells this story gracefully and with intelligence, but
her subject ultimately defeats her. No members of the O'Neill or
Chaplin families agreed to interviews, and again and again we read
of Eugene and Charlie and Oona destroying personal papers in order
to thwart an effort like this one. Based almost entirely on
secondary sources, ``Oona'' reads like a college thesis on Eugene
O'Neill and Charlie Chaplin. The reader longs for more details
about Oona's activities, Oona's thoughts, Oona's reactions.
</P>
<P>
   To make compelling a subject whose life was ``lived in the
shadows'' of two geniuses, an author must draw the reader so deeply
into her mind and the details of her life that she becomes as vivid
as a fictional heroine and thus takes on -- at least within the
pages of the book -- a stature equal to those casting the shadows.
Scovell was not able to do this with Oona O'Neill Chaplin, mainly
because the woman herself preferred to remain a mystery. Her
success at doing so despite Scovell's admirable effort is our loss,
because a biography that does not reveal its subject, like a
mystery that does not reveal its solution, makes for a frustrating
and unsatisfying book.

 WHERE THE VOICE CAME FROM 
 By JAMES OLNEY 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the strangest experience,'' Eudora Welty told Anne
Tyler after reading back over her short stories in preparation for
their collected publication in 1980. ``It was like watching a
negative develop, slowly coming clear before your eyes. It was like
recovering a memory.
</P>
<P>
   With the appearance of the two Welty volumes in the Library of
America series -- comprising not only the short fiction but also a
handful of acute essays, the superb ``One Writer's Beginnings'' and
five books designated ``novels'' (``The Robber Bridegroom,''
``Delta Wedding,'' ``The Ponder Heart,'' ``Losing Battles'' and
``The Optimist's Daughter'') -- Welty's admirers have the
opportunity to watch with her as the body of her work gradually
emerges, indeed like a developing photographic image, a richly
varied yet single living entity, something always there, always
coming into being but wholly perceptible only now, when it can be
viewed through the lens of memory. I specify admirers (and who is
not one? her popularity no doubt accounts in part for Welty being
the first living author included in the Library of America) for, as
she describes the process, it requires a previous knowledge of the
work and a double doubling back. Memory is a first-stage recovery
of the past; recovering a memory is akin to remembering
remembering. Welty has always been prodigious in her remarks on
memory: ``Of course the greatest confluence of all is that which
makes up the individual human memory,'' she says in ``One Writer's
Beginnings.'' ``My own is the treasure most dearly regarded by me,
in my life and in my work as a writer. Here time, also, is subject
to confluence. The memory is a living thing -- it too is in
transit. But during its moment, all that is remembered joins, and
lives -- the old and the young, the past and the present, the
living and the dead.'' Joined and living, too, one might add, in
our reading are Welty's past achievement and our present
recollection, savoring, reconstruction and re-creation of it.
</P>
<P>
   What is at issue both for Welty and for the reader of ``Eudora
Welty: Complete Novels'' and ``Eudora Welty: Stories, Essays, &AMP;
Memoir,'' edited and annotated unobtrusively but meticulously by
Richard Ford and Michael Kreyling, is a memory of things written,
of things made, which locates the life of greatest interest firmly
and first and last in the writing. Focusing there, one shares
Welty's sense of wonder yet of inevitability at how it's all come
about: no one could have predicted it would be so, but in
retrospect it could not have been otherwise. Asked in 1989 how she
would describe the vision that has sustained and impelled her
throughout a career of more than 50 years, Welty responded that
such a vision ``lies only in the work. . . . It's what the work
shows, comprises altogether.'' What she desires, she continued, is
for ``the work to exist as the thing that answers every question
about its doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the body of her work, in its parts and its entirety, contains
the story of its writing, then this renders a biography of the
``writer's life'' (in the phrase that supplies the subtitle to Ann
Waldron's biography, ``Eudora'') not only nugatory but an
impertinence. The word impertinence is intended in the double sense
of irrelevance and of rudeness (which one can find most tellingly
in Waldron's aggrieved tone at not being allowed every confidence
of Welty's private life and in her frantic search for explanations
of the fiction in what Waldron takes to be Welty's sexual
frustration and her despair at having had no dates -- no dates at
all! -- in high school).
</P>
<P>
   To ``explain'' the fiction, as Waldron does, as compensation or
sublimation, with unfounded speculation and reckless surmise as her
principal tools -- Welty seems to have been depressed at this time,
which was likely caused by (what else?) an unhappy love attachment,
and the depression (which Waldron takes for an established fact) is
the cause of such and such a scene in ``The Robber Bridegroom'' or
a character in ``June Recital'' -- consigns Welty's work to a
presumed starting point in the ``foul rag-and-bone shop of the
heart.'' It shackles her imagination to the detritus of a life when
the desire of that life has been to create a new world not on the
basis of day-to-day grievances but in the likeness of the visible
and audible phantasmagoria surrounding her and her readers.
Everything one needs to know biographically about Welty can be
gleaned from the Library of America chronology. Her autobiography
-- the story of a writer -- is written across the whole body of her
work.
</P>
<P>
   That story, as against the one retailed in Waldron's book, is of
a pervasive and inexplicable mystery at the heart of human
existence and relationships. It is also an account, by way of the
writing, of techniques for rendering that mystery a living presence
in fiction. The tale begins with the imaginative explosion of ``A
Curtain of Green,'' a collection of 17 stories that seem
individually like so many experiments in voice, perspective,
texture.
</P>
<P>
   The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber
``Death of a Traveling Salesman'' to the hallucinatory ``Flowers
for Marjorie,'' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces
of ``Clytie'' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece,
from the jazzy ``Powerhouse'' to the satiric ``Petrified Man,''
from the wildly comic ``Why I Live at the P.O.'' to the dignified
``A Worn Path'' (the ``grave, persistent, meditative'' sound of old
Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the
tone at the outset).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-WELTY-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: the outset).) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``A Curtain of Green,'' with marvelous success, Welty tests
voice after voice, as if the lesson learned in one story were to be
put aside, perhaps for future use, while another lesson is worked
through. ``The source of the short story is usually lyrical,'' she
says in ``Writing and Analyzing a Story.'' But she immediately goes
on to assert that, however much the lyrical impetus, and therefore
the tone and mood, may change from story to story, each story
carries the author's ``signature because of the one impulse
characteristic of his own gift -- to praise, to love, to call up
into view.'' Welty seems to offer these impulses as separate, but I
should say that to call up into view, to praise, to love -- taken
in whatever order -- are ultimately a single desire driving her
work from the first published story (``Death of a Traveling
Salesman'') right through ``One Writer's Beginnings.''
</P>
<P>
   The short story is the medium in which Welty has always shown to
greatest advantage, and this is true both of the relatively brief
pieces of ``A Curtain of Green'' (1941) and of the more expansive,
slower-paced stories of ``The Wide Net and Other Stories'' (1943),
``The Golden Apples'' (1949) and ``The Bride of Innisfallen and
Other Stories'' (1955). When she moved on to the novel, as she was
urged -- against her instincts -- to do by publishers, Welty
recognized that she was taking on a form markedly different in its
demands and capabilities. Few enough writers have been brilliantly
successful at both modes, and though Welty's novels have much to
recommend them, the truth is that she never quite divested herself
of the ways of seeing and saying most appropriate to the writing of
short fiction. The novel can be and has been many things, but one
doubts it has ever been quite what we get in ``The Robber
Bridegroom'' (1942): a gallimaufry thrown together out of frontier
brags, Yeatsian folk fantasy and shape-changers, fairy-tale love
and adventure, the mock heroic and heroic mockery and high spirits,
blended with comic undercutting at every turn. There are a thousand
events in the book, but of plot hardly a hint. Much the same could
be said of plot in ``Delta Wedding'' (1946) and ``Losing Battles''
(1970) -- that there is not much more of it in those novels than in
``A Visit of Charity'' or ``Keela, the Outcast Indian Maiden'' or
``The Wide Net,'' wonderful stories all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Optimist's Daughter'' (1972) shows a fairly conventional
plot, but this is unique in Welty and achieved at the cost of being
drawn in large measure from details of her biography. And then
there is ``The Ponder Heart'' (1954), really a short story spun out
to something between novella and novel length, a pure exercise in
voice, nothing more, but a virtuoso performance and great triumph
as such (and very funny). Welty opens ``One Writer's Beginnings''
with a chapter called ``Listening'' and concludes with ``Finding a
Voice''; ``The Ponder Heart'' could be a textbook illustration --
but full of life and humor -- of how to listen to Edna Earl's voice
and reproduce it on the page.
</P>
<P>
   Edna Earl's is but one of Welty's hundreds of voices, all
different but all issuing from the artistry of one listener. In
this regard they are like the faces Clytie studies in the story
that bears her name. There were not more than 150 people in Farr's
Ginn, but ``the number of faces seemed to Clytie almost infinite. .
. . When she began to look at people's actual countenances there
was no more familiarity in the world for her. The most profound,
the most moving sight in the whole world must be a face. Was it
possible to comprehend the eyes and the mouths of other people,
which concealed she knew not what, and secretly asked for still
another unknown thing?'' That Clytie's maker shares an abiding
fascination with the infinite variety of nature, human and other,
is clear on every page of her work.
</P>
<P>
   The need to capture the otherness and the sameness in a voice,
in a face, is what accounts for the proliferation of similes and
metaphors in Welty. Such figures of speech are a reaching out to
bring that which is not us, yet is also us, within the ambit of our
emotional capacities. They are a way of bringing home the world's
mysteries without depriving them of any jot of their strangeness.
The words mystery and mysterious echo like mantras in Welty's
fiction, essays and memoir, referring to the endless oddity of the
world and of relationship (``relationship is a pervading and
changing mystery''). When, in ``Place in Fiction,'' Welty declares:
``Life is strange. Stories hardly make it more so; with all they
are able to tell and surmise, they make it more believably, more
inevitably so,'' we are reminded that there is an archaic meaning
for mystery, which is craft or trade. There has been in our time no
more assiduous practitioner of fiction than Eudora Welty, and for
the mystery that pervades her work and is her artistry there can be
no explanation (a la Waldron), only gratitude.

   &UR; FREEDOM TO DIE
</P>
<P>
   People, Politics and
</P>
<P>
   the Right-to-Die Movement.
</P>
<P>
   By Derek Humphry and Mary Clement.
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's, $24.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, my friend Lynne chose to die. She was losing
her battle with Lou Gehrig's disease and did not want to spend what
was left of her life hooked up to a respirator. She told her family
and her doctors: ``I would rather have a gentle, dignified death
than this unbearable, humiliating life. I want you to help me
die.'' According to Derek Humphry, co-author with Mary Clement of
``Freedom to Die,'' polls show that 63 percent to 78 percent of
Americans share Lynne's sentiments -- that people who are
terminally ill, and experiencing unbearable pain and suffering,
should be permitted to end their lives with the help of their
physicians. However, physician-assisted suicide and voluntary
euthanasia are issues that force uneasy confrontation with
religious beliefs, ethics, economic realities and medical
responsibility. ``Freedom to Die'' chronicles the right-to-die
movement from the first, unsuccessful euthanasia bill drafted in
Ohio in 1906 to the first two people who received their physicians'
help to die in 1998 as a result of the Oregon Death With Dignity
Act. To their credit, the authors -- Humphry is the founder of the
Hemlock Society; Clement is president of something called Gentle
Closure, ``an organization that assists people in addressing all
end-of-life concerns'' -- reach for balance. They demonstrate
effectively, albeit with frustrating repetition, what happens when
the sentiments of the public collide with religious, medical or
governmental institutions. They present trenchant arguments on both
sides of the debate and examine the influence of Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, the pivotal role of Karen Ann Quinlan, the impact of
high-tech miracles of science that keep people alive but
nonfunctional and the fear that family members will not give their
dying relatives a ``duty-to-die'' message. This book challenges our
thinking about a subject that is far more complex than simply
granting someone his ``ultimate civil liberty.'' _ GLORIA HOCHMAN

   &UR; THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

<P>
   Edited by Clayborne Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, $25. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One of the tragedies of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life is that he
did not live to write an autobiography. That sad truth diminishes
the value of ``The Autobiography of Martin Luther King, Jr.,''
Clayborne Carson's mistitled but otherwise worthy compilation of
King's autobiographical writings and statements. Carson has done a
good job of selecting letters, news interviews, an ``Autobiography
of Religious Development'' in manuscript and other documents
scattered in various archives and in the 14 volumes of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Papers Project, which Carson directs. For example,
a chapter on King's arrest at an Atlanta lunch counter
demonstration during the 1960 Presidential campaign combines King's
taped interview for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library with
his statement to a judge rejecting release on bail, a letter to his
wife, Coretta, describing his incarceration at Georgia's Reidsville
Prison and a three-paragraph box ``On Richard Nixon'' from a letter
written in 1958. Each chapter includes a helpful chronology of the
events covered, and an opening sentence or two of King's that
defines the principle or significance of what follows. What is
missing, of course, is the cohesive narrative and balanced
perspective of a true autobiography. But this book is a valuable
reminder that on those subjects and occasions when he could not
have borrowed his words, King was consistently eloquent and
polished, a master of word and effect, possessed of a voice that
was unmistakable and true. _ DAVID WALTON

   Historians began debating Eleanor Roosevelt's sexual orientation
in 1978, 16 years after her death, when her husband's Presidential
library opened the correspondence deeded it by Lorena Hickok, Mrs.
Roosevelt's unofficial adviser, vacation companion and ``first
friend.'' The two women became close in 1932 when Hickok, a
reporter for The Associated Press, began covering Franklin D.
Roosevelt's Presidential campaign. Soon thereafter, the new First
Lady procured her a job as chief investigator of the nation's
relief programs. It was then, while Hickok traveled for months at a
time, that the women engaged in an intense correspondence that
continued for 29 years. In ``Empty Without You,'' Rodger
Streitmatter, a journalism professor at American University,
presents the first collection of that correspondence, reproducing
more than 300 of the 3,500 letters that were preserved. While many
of the selections describe each woman's physical and emotional
longing for the other, the reader expecting a titillating chronicle
of a forbidden lesbian love affair will be disappointed; what
evidence there is that one took place is relatively restrained in
tone. Streitmatter's frequent editorial comments are hit-or-miss:
those that highlight Hickok's critical role in encouraging the
reluctant Eleanor Roosevelt to use the press to advance her own
social and political agenda are well placed, while those that
merely highlight the sensual passages add little that cannot be
gleaned from the text. Although this collection does not
definitively answer the question of whether Roosevelt and Hickok
had an affair, it does document the American landscape as seen by
two intelligent, influential women who loved their country, and
each other, with a passion that is rare. _ JOHANNA BERKMAN

   Michael Jordan, the ultimate corporate sports star, has taken a
page from Dennis Rodman, the ultimate renegade sports star. In his
lavish picture-book autobiography, Jordan borrows the visual tics
Rodman employed in his books: garish graphics, disconnected text
with POINTLESS CAPITALIZATIONS, narcissistic self-absorption
(though Jordan lacks Rodman's saving sense of self-mockery). In
``For the Love of the Game,'' Jordan settles scores with former
teammates, coaches and franchise officials of the Chicago Bulls,
and explains why the most transcendent presence ever to grace a
basketball court happened to have the initials M.J. His legions of
fans will doubtless be grateful for this chance to share in
Jordan's early Christmas present to himself. _ MICHAEL ANDERSON

   &UR; EROTIC LIVES OF WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   By Linda Troeller and Marion Schneider
</P>
<P>
   Scalo, $45 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Female sexual passion is often portrayed as sophomoric romance
or as the ecstasy following a high-end shopping spree. The Erotic
Lives of Women is different, and should be honored as one of the
most gutsy and imaginative erotic books of the decade. Linda
Troeller, an American photographer, and Marion Schneider, a German
writer, photographed and interviewed 30 women from the Americas,
Europe, the Middle East and Northern Africa. They include a
Brazilian singer, a Japanese-American flower designer, a black
American legal secretary, Islamic housewives and Moroccan belly
dancers. None of these women are model look-alikes, but each is
irrefutably seductive in her story and image. The honesty in the
interviews is extraordinary. The kinds of excuses, politically
correct slogans and gauzy fuzz that frequently suffocate erotic
candor are simply not here. The women tell their stories straight
out, and leave it to you to be aroused, disturbed or enlightened.
The photographs and the interviews were done at the same time, to
create a match between image and text, and the experiment proves to
be unexpected and moving. One woman, Nadia, a 36-year-old cigarette
vendor in Morocco, answered: ``Living by myself, earning my own
money, that is most erotic for me. . . . Being able to smoke
cigarettes wherever I like to and to smoke hashish when I feel like
it gives me such a strong feeling.'' She is depicted spreading
apart her djellaba like a pair of wings. _ SUSIE BRIGHT

   &UR; TOWARD THE SUN
</P>
<P>
   By Kent Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Breakaway, $20. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   When Kent Nelson writes about sports, that's really the last
thing on his mind. In this collection of stories, each pegged to a
particular sport, Nelson is writing about struggles that take place
not so much on courts, playing fields, ice rinks or ski trails as
in the mind. And he makes us recall that even team sports can be
lonely endeavors, with each participant competing against himself
as well as opponents -- and occasionally taking time out to clarify
just who and what that self is. This is a central concern in the
story called ``The Actress,'' when Andrea Sykes, a paralegal on a
ski vacation, is introduced by her mysterious host to fellow guests
as an actress. A similar exercise in reinvention takes place in ``A
False Encounter,'' in which a son, taught how to box by his father
(himself a collegiate pugilist), seeks to solve the mystery of why
his father committed suicide -- and, along the way, is able to
discover principles that will give his own life direction. These
stories are also about the obstacles inherent in relationships
between men and women. In ``Every Day a Promise,'' Nelson describes
the warm-up routine of a high jumper who is finding it difficult to
commit himself to a deeper relationship with the young single
mother he's been dating: ``He stayed apart from the others, checked
and rechecked his steps. He felt loose, as strong as he had ever
felt. But he knew he was in his own world, the fate of everyone who
tried to realize dreams.'' And these words by Renner, an unorthodox
college professor, to Solomon, the star quarterback who's been
having problems not only on the field but in class, sum up the
dominant theme that runs through all these stories: ``What we seek
is our true selves, uncorrupted by images, unmeasured by numbers.
We seek the invisible within us. That's what we've been trying to
get at.'' _ CHARLES SALZBERG

</P>
<P>
   By Walter Keady.

<P>
   MacMurry &AMP; Beck, $24. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You have to love the title character of Walter Keady's second
novel, who suffuses the whole book with her graceful charm and
feisty humor. It is 1950 and Sister Mary Thomas' father has died;
after leaving the convent to settle his affairs, she decides not to
return -- and in the remote Irish village of Kildawree such an
abandonment of her vows creates a scandal. But that's not the half
of it: very soon, Mary becomes pregnant and refuses to reveal the
name of the man who is responsible. Of course, the nosier villagers
pay careful attention to Mary's most regular visitors, creating a
kind of paternal whodunit. Is the father an old pre-convent flame,
rakish Kevin Kelly? Or the solid schoolmaster, Tom Tarragh, newly
married to troublesome Kitty Malone? Shy Jack Banaghan is a
possibility, and then there's Mick Burke, off to England -- a sure
sign of trouble. Some parishioners are even suspicious of their
good and gentle priest, John Mulroe. Keady, who grew up on a farm
in the west of Ireland, clearly knows the territory. Both his plot
and his prose are as down-to-earth as the parish he creates. _

   &UR; PURPLE DOTS
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $23.95. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lehrer's 11th novel, ``Purple Dots,'' is less a gripping
thriller than a high-spirited Washington Beltway romp, kept light
by insider gossip, very fine dinners and a good deal of picturesque
rural scenery. Whether this novel does for the West Virginia
panhandle what, say, Peter Mayle's equally frothy suspense novels
have done for Provence remains to be seen, but ``Purple Dots''
certainly provides comic relief in a turbulent political season. It
also probes deftly, if not too deeply, into such abiding issues of
governance as the corruption of idealists and the triumph of
hypocrisy. At the same time, Lehrer lets his wily heroes -- a band
of semi-retired CIA spooks scheming to outwit some shady
Congressional attempts to derail a friend's nomination as the
agency's new director -- have a very merry time. In fact, the old
goats dance rings around the self-important young lawyer who serves
as chief minority counsel of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Part of the fun is wondering whether Lehrer, the veteran PBS
journalist, is telling tales out of school. Do wounded CIA agents
actually receive ``blue hearts''? Do the anecdotes about missions
gone horribly wrong lie somewhere near historical truth? Presumably
our spymasters do not manufacture a truth serum from fish oil, but
who knows? In the end, we learn that a flawed human being will be
confirmed in his post. We also learn how to behave on C-Span and
how to get unexpected political mileage out of a tuxedo. But the
title may be Lehrer's wittiest gibe -- suggesting that the supreme
perk of power in Washington is a purple dot that permits the owner
unlimited free parking. _ CHARLES FLOWERS

   &UR; CEREUS BLOOMS AT NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   By Shani Mootoo.
</P>
<P>
   Grove, $23. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Shani Mootoo's impressive first novel mixes elements of magic
realism and Gothic horror in a style that is by turns lyrical and
lurid. The town of Paradise, on the imaginary Caribbean island of
Lantanacamara, provides a lushly landscaped backdrop for the
troubled and finally tragic history of Mala Ramchandin and her
family. As a boy, Mala's impoverished father, Chandin, was
considered fortunate when he was adopted by a white Christian
missionary, Mr. Thoroughly. It becomes apparent that his luck is
also his misfortune when Mr. Thoroughly rejects him as a suitor for
his daughter, Lavinia, leading Chandin to the bitter realization
that he is valued only for his usefulness in converting other
islanders. In reaction, Chandin impetuously marries Lavinia's best
friend, Sarah, an islander who feels as displaced as Chandin by her
education at the missionary school. The marriage results in two
daughters, Mala and Asha, and sparks an explosive chain of events,
ranging from adultery and incest to madness and murder. Mala's sad
tale is gradually revealed to Tyler, the only male nurse in the
Paradise poorhouse and the sole employee willing to minister to a
patient the others fear as a violent old loon. Their kinship is
based on the shared knowledge of what it means to live as someone
stigmatized for being different: Tyler by virtue of his sexual
orientation and his penchant for cross-dressing, and Mala as a
result of her history of abandonment, abuse and madness.
Ultimately, these two outcasts are shown to be truer to themselves
-- and more accepting of nature's seeming misfits -- than
conformists who, in their eagerness to appear normal, deny the
individual characteristics that define each of us as human. Mootoo,
who grew up in Trinidad and now lives in Canada and New York City,
has an impeccable ear and gives Tyler, the novel's narrator, a
mellifluous voice. At times her writing tends to be overly
elaborate, and the plot takes a few too many twists and turns. But
the plea for tolerance that lies at the heart of this novel is both
authentic and powerful. _ DIANE COLE

   &UR; RUBY
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Hood
</P>
<P>
   Picador USA, $22 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a few giddy months, Olivia Bertolucci, a
stylish 37-year-old milliner living in Manhattan's East Village,
falls in love with and marries a charming industrial designer,
David Henderson. ``A person doesn't have a right to so much
happiness,'' Olivia tells herself one day while they're talking
about buying a beachfront vacation cottage in Rhode Island.
Naturally, soon after they take up residence, David goes out
jogging and is killed by a reckless driver. At first, ``Ruby''
resembles one of those stories in which a tragedy-beset heroine is
portrayed as bravely picking up the pieces. But Ann Hood's sly,
incisive novel soon breaks free from this familiar ground, deftly
exploring the strange rhythms of mourning, the unpredictable and
unavoidable demands of sorrow. Months after David's funeral, a
grief-numbed Olivia returns to the beach house, intending to tidy
the place up before selling it -- only to discover that a pregnant
teen-age runaway has taken up residence. Clever and voluble, Ruby
quickly explains that she has been shunned both by her mother and
stepfather and by the baby's frat-boy father. Olivia formulates a
plan that feels to her like fate: She will take Ruby in, care for
her and pay her medical bills -- if Ruby will let Olivia adopt the
baby. While lies, betrayals and manipulations give the plot its
undeniable page-turning pull, Hood's caustic wit, brightly detailed
prose and thoughtful delineations of two women struggling with
private, powerful regrets supply ``Ruby'' with rich and surprising
emotional depths. _ MEGAN HARLAN

 THE UNKNOWN MATISSE

   A Life of Henri Matisse: The Early Years, 1869-1908.

 &UR; A LOVE AFFAIR WITH COLOR &QL; 
 &UR; By JULIAN BARNES &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The French rather despise biography: for them it is a low form,
the roundup of such factoids and gossip as the law permits. The
British, on the other hand, treat it as a major literary genre:
monumental in Victorian times, svelte and waspish in Strachey's
reinvention, and now, post-Holroyd, getting vast again. This
difference is partly a matter of temperament. The French are more
bourgeois, more liable to circle the wagons round the memory of a
great French man or woman. The British are more prurient and more
afflicted by tall-poppy syndrome (Larkin was a wanker, Durrell may
have committed incest, Koestler was a rapist -- that's cut them
down to size). But there is also a divergence of intellectual
tradition. The French treat a work of art as a prompt to wider,
more abstract reflection; the British as a segment of coded life,
whether give-away self-expression or unconvincing cover-up. The
French tend to be centripetal; the British reductive.
</P>
<P>
   So setting a British biographer on to the life of a great
Frenchman is a deft piece of cross-casting. ``The Unknown Matisse''
is a work of deep research and intense concentration, full of
archive-sweat, legwork and looking. Securing the trust of the
Matisse family was central to Hilary Spurling's enterprise, but her
tenacity in hunting down obscure documentation and forgotten
dramatis personae is most impressive. Camille Joblaud, Matisse's
early mistress and model, died at Concarneau in 1954; Spurling
tracked down the nun who nursed her on her deathbed. Her sense of
time, place and social texture is admirable. Above and beyond this
there is her attitude to Matisse and his genius. ``When you write
the biography of a friend,'' Flaubert told Ernest Feydeau (at a
time when Matisse was 3), ``you must do it as if you were taking
revenge for him.'' Spurling is such a biographer, and such a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of a famous life is usually more interesting, and
more tantalizing, then the second. Once the artist has become
celebrated, there tends to be only one of two plots: artist carries
on hacking it, or artist loses it. Moreover, the account of a life
that has become successful somehow assumes that it could not have
been otherwise: that the obstacles overcome were always bound to
have been overcome. Whereas the first part of a life is full of
implicit narrative risk. Logically, we know that our hero is going
to make it; but at the same time rival possibilities -- which seem
like probabilities to our hero -- loiter like footpads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unknown Matisse'' is haunted at various points by the
presence of such parallel, unfulfilled lives. When the 21-year-old
painter first reached Paris in 1891, he was accompanied by two
other young artistic renegades from French Flanders, two other
versions of himself: Louis van Cutsem and Jules Petit. The first
dropped out after a few years and became a sugar broker; the second
stuck to his dreams and was broken. Disillusioned and ill, Petit
died at the age of 26. Why them and not him, we wonder. Later in
the decade, Matisse formed part of another artistic -- and again
northern -- trio, with two other Henris: Evenepoel and Huklenbrok.
Of the three, Huklenbrok was the most successful, and Evenepoel at
least as promising as Matisse. Evenepoel died of typhoid fever in
1899, just as he was about to paint Clemenceau; Huklenbrok had a
breakdown, and though he lived on until 1942, his family destroyed
all his work ``for fear of seeing their name dishonored.'' The
three Henris had seemed to have equal shares of northern
determination, family disapproval, indifferent health (Matisse was
dogged by insomnia, nervous tension and intestinal troubles) -- and
talent. Again, why them and not him?
</P>
<P>
   Matisse has the good luck to keep serious (as opposed to
temporarily incapacitating) ill health at bay; the greater luck to
find in his wife, Amelie, a support system to replace that of his
grudging family; and the mysterious something -- beyond luck,
beyond hard work -- that turns talent into genius. Again and again,
the reader fears for Matisse, as in a good novel: how will he get
out of this hole, who will buy this work, what if he gives up?
Spurling is at her most skillful in evoking the French art scene of
those changing years: the old teachers, the Young Turks, the
controlling authorities, the free spirits, the rivalrous
camaraderie of student and debutant, neo-Impressionist and Fauve.
And she is also centrally attentive to what matters most: the man
before the canvas, and the fretful, intimate, public transaction
that took place as Matisse worked his way toward what we now,
still, call Modernism.
</P>
<P>
   One of the pauses on that path has been labeled by some critics
Matisse's ``dark period'': a two-year stretch, starting in 1902,
when he retrenched as an artist, drawing back from experimentalism
and explosive color. The ``dark'' has previously referred only to
pigment: Spurling now relates it to a wider gloom. It was in 1902
that the Humbert Affair broke -- a typically French, decades-long
financial swindle beginning with an invented inheritance and ending
with murder, suicide and corruption at the heart of the Republican
establishment. The parents of Matisse's wife were close associates
of the principals in the case, and endured much vilification before
being cleared. Matisse (whose studio was searched by police when
the scandal broke) became involved, and the strain led to one of
his periodic nervous collapses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MATISSE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: nervous collapses.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Humbert Affair is familiar to historians; but the Matisse
connection had not previously been noticed by art critics. At first
Spurling merely lays out the scandal in lush detail, with not much
more than an implicit Q.E.D. A hundred pages later, in one of those
moments of biographical sleight of hand, she behaves as if her case
were proved, referring to ``the fiercely experimental phase cut
short by the Humbert scandal.'' There is, however, a certain
problem of evidence. No one in the painter's wide circle ever
mentioned the affair in print (or, presumably, in subsequently
reported conversation); while Matisse's only reference to it -- or
the only one Spurling quotes -- is a lighthearted aside. Seeing his
parents-in-law give evidence in court for three days was, he
quipped, ``a waste of time'' compared to a session with his
favorite model. Not much sign of anguish there.
</P>
<P>
   The only real evidence is that of the paintings themselves, of
Matisse's previous career and his known artistic priorities.
Spurling's excitement over her discovery is understandable, but
ironically the strongest argument against her theory lies in her
own earlier characterization of the painter. If Flaubert was
l'homme-plume, the pen-man, then Matisse was the brush-man,
austerely committed to finding his way regardless of sales (the
``dark'' pictures in any case went as unsold as the pre-dark ones);
he was an artist for whom having nothing to lose was actually a
spur to creativity, and a man who told his future wife that much as
he loved her, he would always love painting more. Does this sound
like someone who would lose his nerve and paint safe because of his
in-laws' embarrassment? Isn't the reason for the ``dark period''
always more likely to be painterly rather than biographical?
</P>
<P>
   This is an untypical outburst of reductivism on Hilary
Spurling's part. There are also moments of uncertainty in her
translation from the French; and this must be the only biography of
the last 30 years to have nothing to say about its subject's sex
life. But it is still a splendid work. Near its end, Spurling
quotes a story of two young American women applying to study under
Matisse and giving their reason as such: ``We want your color.''
Matisse replied, ``If you haven't brought your own color, you will
never get mine.'' Hilary Spurling is a doughty transmitter and
fierce defender of that color, and of all that it represents. Her
second volume cannot arrive too soon.

   Vintage Contemporaries, $13. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In detailing the narcissistic foibles of a hippie family in the
1970s, this novel strives to capture the era's hypersincerity and
inflated sense of destiny. The result is ``a satirical elegy for
the age of dime-store Zen,'' Walter Kirn said here last year. ``The
book is as light and swirly and eccentric as its Marin County

   Judging from this lively journal undertaken at the age of 80,
the versatile and idiosyncratic actor still has plenty to say. He
holds forth in charming and humorous fashion on everything from the
English weather to politics to his warm friendships with pets and
humans, not to mention the performances of other actors. Through it
all, ``Guinness remains pungently human, warts and all,'' John
Simon wrote in the Book Review in 1997. ``Sir Alec is an
accomplished writer, both in extended passages and in finely
etched, memory-hugging one-liners.''

   This novel focuses on the effects of compulsive gambling on a
family that wagers its comfortable life style on a chance to escape
the banality of middle-class existence. ``It is Barthelme's
peculiar post-modern gift to be able to invert the easy ironies of
contemporary life and reveal the truths beneath them,'' A. O. Scott

   A journalist punctures the postwar myth of a single-minded Japan
Inc., content with conformity and dependency on the West, and
instead finds a troubled society struggling to reinvent itself in
the absence of any meaningful democracy. Last year our reviewer,
Frank Gibney, called this ``a stimulating, provocative book.''
 &UR; GEISHA, by Liza Crihfield Dalby (University of California,
$17.95) &LR; , tells of an American doctoral candidate who traveled to
Japan in the mid-1970s to study the female entertainers known as
geisha and wound up working as one. Her account, which has been
reissued with a new preface, is marked by ``delicate observation
and subtle common sense,'' Donald Rich wrote here in 1984.

<P>
   These three novellas cover a lot of ground -- from Canada to
Mississippi -- but they share a precise observation of nature that
is both unsentimental and ecstatic. ``Reading this book has made me
glad . . . that there are still writers who can bring the
wilderness back alive and pin it to the page,'' Michael Gorra said
here last year.

   This large, philosophically complex Hungarian novel transposes
two elaborately linked Proustian narratives of consciousness to the
universe of Communist East Berlin and Budapest. ``The terrain of
Eastern European experience . . . gains an amplitude and an
illumination from the painstaking attentiveness, the penetration
with which it is imagined and contemplated,'' Eva Hoffman wrote
here last year.  &UR; THE LAND OF GREEN PLUMS, by Herta Muller,
translated from the German by Michael Hofmann (Hydra
Books/Northwestern University, $14.95) &LR; , is a grim novel about a
group of young Romanians persecuted as dissidents during the
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu. ``Muller's vision . . . reads
like a kind of fairy tale on the mingled evils of gluttony,
stupidity and brutality,'' Larry Wolff wrote here in 1996.

   The creator of ``Oh! Susanna,'' ``Camptown Races'' and other

   In tracing the evolution of public relations, the author shows

   As the biographer of a famous wit, prankster and social
butterfly, and of a supreme master of light verse, William McBrien,
a professor of English at Hofstra University, is disappointingly
plodding. The writer and his subject don't seem like kindred
spirits at all, more like inhabitants of different planets.
Nonetheless, McBrien's achievement is substantial. No previous
biography of Cole Porter has been so painstakingly researched, and
this one may well survive as the definitive account of his life, at
least for the wealth of information it provides.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was possibly the greatest popular song writer of the 20th
century. Of the more than 800 songs he produced during his life,
dozens have become standards and are still constantly being
rerecorded today. Shortly before his death, McBrien says in ``Cole
Porter: A Biography,'' he told a friend, ``I don't know how I did
it,'' and, for once, he was telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his songs are so full of references to passing fads and
forgotten celebrities that they seem almost to have been designed
to go out of fashion. But one of these, ``You're the Top,'' is
hardly less popular now than when it was written in 1934, even
though it includes rhymes like this: ``You're the boy who dares /
Challenge Mrs. Baer's son Max, / You're a Russian ballet, / You're
Rudy Vallee, / You're Phenolax!''
</P>
<P>
   John Updike has written that each time we hear the words of
``You're the Top,'' ``something tender, solemn, nonsensical and
absolute seems to be being said,'' and he is right. While Cole
Porter's life was riddled with hypocrisy and deceit, his songs have
the ring of truth about them. According to McBrien, Porter once
said that he couldn't analyze his own work but that he could
characterize others': ``The word for Dick Rodgers's melodies, I
think, is holy. For Jerome Kern, sentimental. For Irving Berlin,
simplicity. For my own, I don't know.'' But we know. For all his
breezy cosmopolitanism, insistent name-dropping and devilishly
clever rhymes, his songs come from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Irving Berlin proposed to Jack Warner that a film
should be made of Porter's life, arguing that his heroism after
both his legs were crushed in a riding accident in 1937 would be an
inspiration to wounded American servicemen. But the various
screenwriters commissioned to produce a script complained about the
lack of ``struggle'' in his life. ``What will they use for a
climax?'' Orson Welles wondered. ``The only suspense is -- will he
or won't he accumulate $10 million?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the case that Porter's life had produced little drama
except in his obsessive romances with other men. But his
homosexuality was obviously a taboo subject. When he approved the
final script, Porter said contentedly, ``None of it's true.'' The
beautiful Linda Lee Porter, with whom he shared an affectionate
marriage of convenience for 35 years, was no doubt pleased that the
script was misleading, for she had always been desperately keen
that his homosexuality remain hidden.
</P>
<P>
   The film ``Night and Day,'' starring Alexis Smith as Linda and
(absurdly) Cary Grant as Cole, was completed in November 1945; and,
as the reviewers did not hesitate to point out, it was
exceptionally false even by ``biopic'' standards. But it reflected
a trait that its real-life heroes had in common -- an urge to
subordinate truth to their joint purpose of presenting a smooth and
glossy front to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cole had already started playing around with the truth when, at
the age of 14, he went from his home in Peru, Ind., to boarding
school at Worcester Academy in Massachusetts. With the connivance
of his mother, Katie Cole Porter, he registered himself as two
years younger than he actually was. He had shown musical talent as
a child -- on the piano and the violin and at composing tunes --
and his mother, who was very ambitious for him, probably wanted him
to be thought a prodigy. On three of his passports in later life he
gave different years of birth -- 1891, 1892 and 1893 (1891 being
the correct one).
</P>
<P>
   He went east against the express wishes of his maternal
grandfather, J. O. Cole, who had amassed a great fortune in
California during the gold rush and planned for his grandson to
stay in Indiana and train to take over his various businesses. The
old tyrant was so angry with his daughter, Katie, for sending Cole
to Worcester that he didn't speak to her for two years. As for
Cole's father, Sam Porter, he was a remarkably passive man who ran
a successful drugstore in Peru and seems to have played no part in
the argument at all. Cole was later to dismiss him snobbishly as
``a parvenu druggist.''
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, where he owed his social success largely to his gift
for writing and performing amusing songs, Cole was sometimes
regarded as a bit of a parvenu himself. A friend there, Gerald
Murphy, heir to the Mark Cross fortune, later described him as ``a
little boy from Peru, Ind., in a checkered suit and a salmon tie,
with his hair parted in the middle and slicked down, looking just
like a Westerner dressed up for the East.''
</P>
<P>
   After Yale and a subsequent unsuccessful spell at Harvard Law
School, where he shared a residence with Dean Acheson, he abandoned
all other ambitions to become a songwriter. In 1915, with his Yale
friend T. Lawrason Riggs, he wrote his first professional musical,
``See America First,'' which opened in New York in March 1916 to
rotten notices and closed after 15 performances. It was patriotic
in a slightly mocking way and included a song advising against
travel to ``European lands effete.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortified by the show's failure, Porter left the following year
for Paris, claiming later to have joined the French Foreign Legion
there, though the precise nature of his war service remains
mysterious. But he was to stay in ``European lands effete'' for
many years, enthusiastically assimilating their effeteness. In
1919, he married Linda Lee Thomas, a wealthy Southern belle and
divorcee who was 15 years older than he. Together in Paris, Venice
and the French Riviera, they shone in smart expatriate society,
until he moved to New York in the 1930s and finally achieved the
recognition he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-COLE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: he deserved.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   McBrien fails to find a merry way of describing the Porters'
hectic but repetitious social life, and one can take only so many
accounts of glittering openings and after-theater parties; but he
is good at conveying Porter's underlying gloom -- his fear of
boredom and his cultivation of aristocratic languor as a cover for
frustrated ambition. It was largely Porter's fault that he was
always being described as ``sophisticated,'' but he hated it all
the same.
</P>
<P>
   The real feeling in so many Porter songs is too often overlooked
because of his efforts always to appear urbane. The last major
biography of Porter, by Charles Schwartz, which was published 21
years ago, portrayed him as a man with a ferocious sexual appetite
that he sought to satisfy purely in casual encounters with sailors,
truck drivers and male prostitutes. But McBrien reveals him as
having also formed passionate, enduring attachments that inspired
some of his most poignant songs about the fragility of love.
``You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To,'' which so touched Americans in
the war that it knocked Irving Berlin's ``White Christmas'' off the
hit parade in 1942, was referred to by the choreographer Nelson
Barclift as ``our song.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter once claimed to Richard Rodgers that his most successful
songs, with their constant shifting from the major to the minor
key, were ``Jewish tunes.'' Rodgers agreed, and wrote in his
autobiography that the melodies of ``Night and Day,'' ``Begin the
Beguine'' and ``Love for Sale,'' among others, were all ``Jewish.''
He added, ``It is surely one of the ironies of the musical theater
that despite the abundance of Jewish composers, the one who has
written the most enduring 'Jewish' music should be an Episcopalian
millionaire who was born on a farm in Peru, Ind.''
</P>
<P>
   Porter's end was terrible. Following the deaths of the two most
important people in his life, his mother and his wife, and the
amputation in 1958 of his right leg, all within the space of a few
years, he stopped writing songs completely and died in California
in October 1964, a morose and lonely millionaire of 73, beset by
irrational worries about money. The head of the local mortuary
telephoned his counterpart in Peru, Ind., with the words: ``We
congratulate you. You are receiving the body of Cole Porter.''

   Martha Grimes doesn't write them fast enough for me, so you'll
excuse me while I savor for a minute the quirky charms of her new
Richard Jury mystery, THE STARGAZEY (Holt, $25). There's the
authentic English pub, of course, that gives the novel its title
and a hint of its mood. This time, it's a spiffy neighborhood
hangout in Fulham, a once seedy area newly gentrified by ``the
chattering classes'' where Jury first catches sight of an elegant
blond woman in a sable coat who disappears (perhaps to be murdered)
on the grounds of Fulham Palace. Then there are the wondrously
eccentric characters, including one grand old dame (the former
owner of the sable coat) and a supremely self-centered little girl
named Pansy. Finally, there are all the witty particulars that
surface at the oddest times. ``Most people don't notice little
things like this,'' a barmaid says to Jury about a curious postcard
of a fish pie. ``You miss a lot in life if you don't notice little
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, you want a plot, too? This one is strange beyond
belief, strained in the telling (Assassins! Aristocrats!
Doppelgangers! Nonsense!) and garbled in its conclusion. But if the
big picture is absurd, the details are divine.
</P>
<P>
   Haunted since childhood by his eyewitness memory of his sister's
murder, Paul Graves has the kind of nightmares that would send most
of us screaming to a shrink. But instead of exorcising his demons,
the protagonist of Thomas H. Cook's eerie suspense story
INSTRUMENTS OF NIGHT (Bantam, $23.95) endlessly recycles the trauma
in the bleak stories he writes about a police detective and a
sadistic master criminal who battle it out in turn-of-the-century
New York. Although his novels earn Graves a living, they don't do
much for his mental health, and after 15 books, the author is no
better off than his hero, whose ``view of life had turned so
intensely grim that his character seemed poised on the brink of an
absolute despair.'' Salvation (or is it damnation?) presents itself
when the wealthy patron of a writers' colony in New York's Hudson
Valley asks Graves to train his morbid imagination on the
50-year-old mystery of her best friend's murder. He doesn't have to
solve the case, she tells him -- just dream up something credible
enough to soften the pain and banish the ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Cook does a lot better than that in this psychological horror
story. With his fondness for a twisted narrative line and his
appreciation of the nuances of terror, he devises a plot that
harnesses Graves's gloomy fantasies to a greater evil that should
shock him out of his obsessive brooding -- or shove him off his
mental cliff. Although it's easy to miss the very real clues that
Cook drops so artfully into the story, there's no ignoring his
savage imagery, or escaping the airless chambers of his disturbing
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   You're not a real New Yorker if you don't want to kill somebody,
sometime: the umpire who blows a call; the crazy guy at the deli;
your swine of a husband; even the mayor when he's on some dumb
rant. Mike McAlary, who regularly sounds off in a column for The
Daily News, gives raucous voice to that invigorating rage in his
first novel, SORE LOSER (Morrow, $24), which he aims and points
like a loaded gun at some of our favorite public targets.
</P>
<P>
   A ladylike tennis pro named Ginny Glade gets to go first, when
she takes a tire iron to the umpire whose lousy line call costs her
a shot at being seeded at the United States Open. ``Murder was
empowering,'' Ginny discovers. ``Murder, like winning, was
thrilling stuff.'' And when that thrill wears off, there's more
excitement to be had running around with Mickey Donovan, an
attractive, if preposterously idealized, supercop who travels in
the highest (and lowest) circles of power -- although always within
bellowing range of the egomaniacal mayor, a hilarious caricature of
Rudy Giuliani in all his volatile glory.
</P>
<P>
   In manic overdrive, the hyperkinetic style eventually sends the
story swerving off into total fantasy. But even then, McAlary is
fun to read. The cops are cute, everybody is a screamer and the
energy is pure New York.
</P>
<P>
   Crime marches on, even in wartime, and in the series of
melancholy police procedurals that J. Robert Janes sets in occupied
France, it falls to Inspector Jean-Louis St.-Cyr of the Surete
Nationale and Hermann Kohler, his softhearted Gestapo colleague, to
protect ordinary citizens from themselves. But, ``as always these
days,'' Janes reminds us in MANNEQUIN (Soho, $22), ``crime had to
be viewed through the occupation's prism, warped though that was.''
In the disjointed Parisian society of 1942, every local crime --
from a daring robbery of the Credit Lyonnais bank to the grisly
murders of a dozen or more would-be fashion models -- seems rooted
in the deeper moral chaos of these convulsive times. For all their
efforts to focus the search for a missing girl from St.-Cyr's
neighborhood, the detectives keep turning up sad or sinister
associations between the army of occupation and a conquered people
desperate to survive. Janes devises a shocking solution to the
brutal crimes at hand, but his larger point about the complexities
of human guilt isn't so easy to close the book on.
</P>
<P>
   Life in Toronto in 1895 was no glide across the ice, according
to Maureen Jennings in her horridly graphic period mystery UNDER
THE DRAGON'S TAIL (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's, $21.95). Even the
high and mighty were plagued by syphilis, birth defects and
loathsome skin conditions, and the lower classes were also
malnourished and crawling with worms, while any woman, rich or
poor, who needed an abortion or had to give up a child for adoption
was at the mercy of her midwife. When Dolly Merishaw, an unsavory
specimen of the profession, is smothered on her own hearth, the
police dispatch William Murdoch to determine which of Dolly's
shameful deeds drove one of her clients to murder. Despite certain
plot transparencies, the grim story is told in forthright detail
and put in a social context that elicits real sympathy for
characters bound by class and biology.

 AMERICAN BEACH
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Saga of Race, Wealth, and Memory.
</P>
<P>
   By Russ Rymer.
</P>
<P>
   Illustrated. 337 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $25. &QL; 
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; DISINTEGRATION &QL; 
 &UR; By EDDY L. HARRIS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the day I picked up ``American Beach,'' I was
stopped by a policeman who had no better reason than the few miles
an hour -- I think six -- by which I was exceeding Rhode Island's
highway speed limit. He was within his rights of course to stop me,
but he also wanted to search my car for drugs, and when I refused
him permission to look inside my trunk, he threatened to detain me
at the side of the road for a couple of hours while he sent for the
drug-sniffing dogs. It was, after all, as he made clear, his
highway and he could do anything he damn well pleased.
</P>
<P>
   And if I'd had a chip on my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   And if I had reacted with a misunderstood gesture instead of
with words.
</P>
<P>
   Or if I had tried to drive away.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen, and in his new book, ``American Beach,''
Russ Rymer tells the story -- among other stories involving race
and power and politics -- of just such an incident.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Wilson, on the eve of his 33rd birthday, was stopped by
the police not far from American Beach, a resort town in northern
Florida. He had not been speeding. He had been driving slowly and
had pulled off the road in order to let the police car that had
been following him pass. A little later on, he caught up with that
same police car, which now had pulled over to let him pass. The
policemen followed Wilson, waited for him to make a turn, then
switched on the blue lights of the police cruiser and nabbed him
because the left turn had not been textbook proper.
</P>
<P>
   The police dispatcher told one of the officers that there was a
warrant out for Wilson on a charge of resisting arrest with
violence, a felony. In fact, Wilson had answered a warrant a week
earlier -- for resisting arrest without violence -- but a clerk had
incorrectly entered the information into the police computer.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson had had problems with local authorities before; he had an
arrest record, and he was known even to his friends as
``hair-triggered.'' He had once been beaten severely by police
officers, and had won a lawsuit against them, earning a reputation
in the county as an agitator. And this was a county not known for
its kind treatment of blacks. He may have smelled a setup, and he
started to drive away.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson was unarmed, and he had not acted in a threatening
manner, but he bumped one of the policemen with his fender as he
pulled away and he refused to stop the car. The two officers fired
several shots as he fled. A man riding in Wilson's car was wounded.
Wilson was killed.
</P>
<P>
   When you enter Russ Rymer's ``American Beach,'' almost
immediately you fall into a world crackling with similar
experiences, a world where these things have happened and continue
to happen, a world that many if not most black people in America
inhabit, where they are mostly voiceless and mostly powerless and
almost always under suspicion. In the case of too many people like
Dennis Wilson, who lived in a small house just up the road from
American Beach, that suspicion leads very often to inexcusable
violence and needless death at the hands of uniformed authority.
</P>
<P>
   But Rymer is also concerned with another kind of powerlessness
-- the kind that wears the face of cultural erosion, political
impotence and disappearing historical landmarks. In ``American
Beach'' he tells three basic stories -- about Dennis Wilson and the
circumstances surrounding his death, about MaVynee Betsch, the
great-granddaughter of the founder of American Beach, and about
Eatonville, Fla., the oldest black incorporated town in the United
States, threatened by a highway project that would divide the town
in two.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these places, issues that are larger than life are
brought down to human scale by centering our attention on a few
lives and a few stories, rendering personal the tragedy that is
American racial history. These stories strike at the core of who we
are as a nation, caught as we are in the vise grip of race, and
between development and progress and our traditions and past.
</P>
<P>
   American Beach is so small and seemingly insignificant that it
doesn't even warrant a dot on most maps. But during the long
nightmare of Jim Crow, it was one of the only black beach resorts
in the country. Money and ownership of the culture stayed within
the community. MaVynee Betsch, speaking of how self-contained the
black community was, says, ``You could go from sunup to sundown and
never bother with white people.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the end of segregation came the end of that kind of
self-sufficiency. Black communities dispersed as the restrictions
on housing at least nominally ended, and a kind of decay set in and
with it a new kind of isolation. To a woman like Betsch, who had
witnessed at first hand the vague fluctuations of fortune and
history, it was more than distressing. Her great-grandfather, A. L.
Lewis, had founded Florida's first life insurance company and was
one of Florida's first black millionaires. She had seen the history
unfold, and that history was suddenly hard to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russ,'' she asks the author, ``what went wrong?'' But Rymer
tells us, ``From her tone of aching lament I knew she was speaking
to herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Russ Rymer is a seasoned journalist, precise, attentive,
thought-provoking. (His first book, ``Genie: A Scientific
Tragedy,'' was a nominee for the National Book Critics Circle
Award.) At the same time -- and this is not a complaint -- he gives
the lie to the myth of journalistic objectivity. He has a feeling
for the people he meets and tells about and for the lives they have
lived, and he nudges his reader to care for them too and to arrive
at his intended conclusions, which he does with great skill.
</P>
<P>
   All is not perfect, of course. The book drags in places and
could be shorter, as almost all books could be. There are numerous
places where Rymer repeats himself, sometimes idea for idea,
sometimes almost word for word -- though some of that fault lies
with his editors, and ought not to detract from the overall
sensation that this is a book well worth the time.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the individual stories that illuminate ``American
Beach,'' there is nothing here that hasn't been told again and
again. Rymer is clearly aware of this, and of the fact that it is
necessary that these stories and this history be told until we all
understand more than we do, until we all come to realize what
continues to go on in the shadowy reaches of this country where so
many are so badly perceived and treated, until we can honestly
attempt to answer MaVynee's lamenting question: What went wrong?

MOM'S TURKEY RECIPE: WRITTEN ONLY IN HER HEART 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When I asked my mother to give me all her recipes,
she was offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' she snapped. ``I'm not dead yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize that,'' I replied, ``but if I do this now, you'll be
here to answer my questions, right?''
</P>
<P>
   She growled something in assent. The only time she likes logic
is when she thinks of it first. So I made a list of 35 dishes and
she took a year (a year!) to write them down. She presented them to
me with a lovely note that contained the sentence, ``Try them,
adjust seasoning to taste, call me if these don't work.''
</P>
<P>
   I should have known.
</P>
<P>
   I started with the roast turkey, an old family recipe handed
down from our Brazilian hairdresser five years ago. I looked at
Mom's instructions. All I needed to do was get a turkey and
marinate it for 24 hours in red wine and a long list of seasonings,
none of which came with measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. I could figure that out. But a day later when I was ready
to cook, I looked at what else she had written. Wait a minute. I
called her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you usually put something inside the turkey?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes,'' she said. ``You can put onions in there, or
apples and prunes, or oranges.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, you have never once put anything in this turkey but
onions,'' I said. She started to laugh. ``Well, yes, but you
(italics)could(end italics) put in the other things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I get it,'' I said, annoyed. ``This is your
passive-aggressive protest to my presuming to take your mommy power
away, right?''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed even harder. ``Oh, and by the way,'' she said,
gasping for air, ``slice an onion or two and put it in the bottom
of the pan with some water, for when you baste it.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked at the recipe. The word onion never appeared once, much
less twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine,'' I said coldly. I could have strangled her.
</P>
<P>
   Her tone turned conciliatory. ``Listen, sweetheart,'' she said.
``I used to get upset with my mother, too, whenever I would ask for
her recipes, because she never measured anything. She would tell me
what I always told you: `Watch me.' You do it so many times you
don't pay attention to how much you use, whatever it is. You see
how it smells, how it looks. It's not always the same.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want it to be the same,'' I said. ``I want my house to
smell the way yours does on holidays where everything's delicious
and everyone feels warm and protected and lucky to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be fine,'' she said, losing interest as her own guests
rang her bell. ``If you have trouble call me.'' She hung up.
</P>
<P>
   I followed her instructions and put the turkey in to roast. In
the meantime, I made mashed potatoes. I've always felt deprived
when it came to mashed potatoes. Growing up as I did in a kosher
home, the only time you could make them for real was to eat with
fish, since butter, cream or milk cannot be mixed with meat.
</P>
<P>
   In our house, mashed potatoes meant salt and margarine. So, over
the years, I have studied different recipes and finally come up
with a version I like. In any case, I focused on the turkey, which
cooked faster than Mom said it would.
</P>
<P>
   I called my husband and 14-year-old stepson, Simon, to the
table. Simon was impressed. ``You made a turkey for no reason?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I wanted to practice,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool,'' he answered while his father carved.
</P>
<P>
   It tasted exactly like my mother's. I couldn't believe it! Maybe
all those times I watched her really did pay off. I filled our
plates, and the three of us talked and ate and Simon told a story
and we laughed, and then he told jokes and we laughed some more and
then we all had seconds. The light seemed golden somehow, and if
there was no wind or rain pounding the windows, there could have
been, we were so cozy inside.
</P>
<P>
   Simon turned to me, his face aglow. I glowed back. I had done
it, replicated the turkey, made it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the (italics)best(end italics) mashed potatoes I've
ever had,'' he rhapsodized. Oh. I was taken aback. ``I'm glad,'' I
said. He kept his eyes on me. ``How do you make them?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   I went blank, but his gaze never wavered. ``Butter,'' I started.
``Cream.'' He nodded. Our plates were emptied, the magic moment had
passed. He went to watch television.
</P>
<P>
   I walked back into the kitchen, the turkey forgotten. The last
thing I had ever suspected was having mystical powers of my own.
</P>
<P>
   I glanced at the remnants of butter and cream. How much had I
used? I couldn't remember. I thought of Simon's face, looking at
me, eyes wide. And I realized why writing these recipes had been so
hard for my mother. And for her mother. Because it's not about
butter or cream or onions. The ingredient you can't write down is
how much you love your family _ how you relish feeding them, caring
for them, watching a child's face transform in an instant, looking
up at you with a mouthful of food and safety and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was the turkey?'' Mom asked when she called the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' I said. ``A big success.''
</P>
<P>
   She was pleased. ``What did you make with it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   I hesitated. ``Mashed potatoes,'' I answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' she replied. ``Do you have a good recipe?''
</P>
<P>
   I smiled. ``Actually,'' I said, ``I do.''

 A Dream Deferred 
 The Second Betrayal of Black Freedom in America 
 By Shelby Steele 
 185 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $24  By MICHAEL ANDERSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the subject is race, this land of free speech is deathly
afraid of plain talk. A legacy of rebellion and resentment,
complacency and commiseration has us tongue-tied; afraid to speak
our minds, we mystify ourselves with a bedazzling lexicon of code
words, euphemism and soothing gobbledygook.
</P>
<P>
   Consider ``diversity,'' for example. ``No two people define it
the same way,'' Shelby Steele writes in ``A Dream Deferred,'' his
second collection of essays. ``It is a word that is useful for the
very specific thing that it does not mean, which is racial
prejudice.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the rest of the current cliches -- ``inclusion,''
``pluralism,'' even the ubiquitous ``multiculturalism.'' For
Steele, each is a word with no meaning except that it disassociates
people ``from the stigma of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele argues that the never-ending discussion of race relations
is, far too often, a sham battle of empty rhetoric. ``American
racial policy,'' he writes, has ``a decidedly 'post-modern' feel.
Its subtext is more important than its text.'' What is unspeakable,
Steele contended in his first book, ``The Content of Our
Character'' (1990), is white guilt and black fear -- the need of
white people for redemption from a history of oppression, the needs
of blacks to confront ``integration shock . . . the shock of being
suddenly accountable on strictly personal terms.'' And so black and
white Americans have entered into a powerful and unspoken collusion
to elude the sacrifices and risks that true racial harmony demands.
``This fear,'' he added, ``is the measure of our racial chasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, we live in a brave new world in which the cure for
discrimination is more discrimination, in which a quota mentality
is commonplace, in which good intentions form new cobblestones on
the pathway to perdition. Steele's tone has accordingly hardened.
His new essays take polemical relish in their finger-pointing at an
emperor wearing no kinte cloth. ``The president of a public
university could simply say the word 'diversity' and be justified
in excluding people from his university solely because of their
race,'' he writes. (``After all, diversity has no darkness or evil.
Thus people who serve it can do no wrong.'') In one of his sharpest
passages, Steele imagines the fate of a young Charlie Parker
subjected to a contemporary tutoring program taught by a white
college student:
</P>
<P>
   ``The tutor learns that Parker's father drank too much and
abandoned the family, and that his mother has had an affair with a
married man. Young Charlie is often late to his tutorial sessions.
Secretly the tutor comes to feel that probably his real purpose is
therapeutic, since the terrible circumstances of Charlie's life
make it highly unlikely that he will ever be focused enough to
master the complex keying system of the saxophone or learn to read
music competently.'' Charlie, having ``heard from many that the
saxophone -- a European instrument -- really has little to do with
who he is,'' gives up. The tutor is sympathetic. '' 'Can you
imagine,' he says, shaking his head in disbelief at himself,
'teaching saxophone to a poor black kid from Kansas City?' ''
</P>
<P>
   This sassy satire illustrates Steele's central thesis: What
white people really want is not to reform an unjust society but to
restore their own sense of virtue. Expunging that shame has been
the silent agenda of American social policy for a generation.
Indeed, Steele contends, much so-called reform is a continuation of
white supremacy by other means. ``The liberal looks at black
difficulties -- high crime rates, weak academic performance,
illegitimacy rates and so on -- and presumes them to be the result
of victimizing forces beyond the control of blacks.'' By this
``specific act of imagination,'' to ``always imagine blacks outside
the framework of individual responsibility,'' Steele writes, ``is
also to imagine them as inherently inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Double standards, preferential treatment, provisions for
'cultural difference' and various kinds of entitlement all
constitute a pattern of exceptionalism that keeps blacks (and other
minorities) down by tolerating weakness at every juncture where
strength is expected of others,'' Steele writes. ``Then, after
black weakness has been massaged, accepted, understood and felt
for, people wonder why the infamous gap between blacks and whites
on tests and other performance measures won't close. The answer, of
course, is that nobody seriously asks that it be closed.'' He is
particularly incisive on how good intentions have become an end in
themselves (``President Clinton gets credit for supporting
affirmative action, not for making it work''). Both races have
allowed themselves to be seduced by the siren song of
victimization: ``Whites agree to stay on this hook for an illusion
of redemption, and blacks agree to keep them there for an illusion
of power.'' But, as Steele wisely concludes, ``Victimhood lasts
only as long as it is accepted, and to exploit it for an empty
sovereignty is to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For America to survive its struggle with racial shame, it will
have to stop cringing before it,'' Steele writes. ``We are no
longer trying to redeem the United States or resolve our tortuous
racial history; we are dealing with poor reading skills or a lack
of preparedness for employment or too many pregnant teen-age girls
made that way by too many young men.'' His book would benefit from
more attention to such social realities. History, like biology, is
destiny, and more attention to its patterns could only serve to
clarify the present. (For example, perhaps the different styles of
discrimination in the North and South evoked distinct
counterstrategies: a legal challenge to de jure segregation, social
engineering to the de facto version.) And Steele's agonizing over
principles too often takes on the tone of a scolding schoolmarm;
like many conservative critics, he seems all too quick to impute a
deliberate moral delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Steele assuredly is correct when he declares that
integration is 20th-century America's ``elaboration of democracy.''
Too often confused with assimilation -- that (somehow) all of us
would wind up bleached blond -- integration is a dynamic process;
in little more than a generation, American society has transformed
itself. In our rather stumbling way, we continue this process. As
Steele reminds us, ``the profoundness of our relationship to
democratic principles despite our many failings and duplicities''
is what constitutes our national identity. ``The United States has
to accept its past as proof of its need for principles today.''

   Essays and Criticism From a Lifelong Love Affair With the
Movies.
</P>
<P>
   By Phillip Lopate.
</P>
<P>
   384 pp. New York: Anchor Books/Doubleday. Paper, $12.95.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; WAITING FOR GODARD &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANE JACOBS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   FALLING in love with movies has proved a fruitful occupation for
intellectuals who might feel silly going wild over paintings or
books. ``John Wayne rode through my childhood,'' Joan Didion
rhapsodized in her memorable ``John Wayne: A Love Song''; David
Thomson announced that he could not be objective about anything to
do with Angie Dickinson. Now Phillip Lopate entitles a collection
of his writing on cinema ``Totally, Tenderly, Tragically'' and
starts off by confessing, ``All my life I have been movie-mad.''
Lopate, who takes Montaigne as his mentor, is known for bold,
cosmopolitan, complaint-driven (but never whiny) essays gathered in
impressive collections like ``Bachelorhood'' (1981) and,
especially, ``Against Joie de Vivre'' (1989). ``Totally, Tenderly,
Tragically'' is something of a departure. For where topics in the
earlier books ranged widely, from the machinations of a Manhattan
dinner party to an examination of Lopate's own body, here he rivets
his attention on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Lopate considers himself ``both an outsider and an insider'' in
the movie world, since he never held a regular film beat or
professorship, but has spent four terms selecting entries for the
New York Film Festival, written lots of articles and ``put in my
50,000 hours in the dark.'' What's more, he was a precocious child
with plenty to escape from.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most movie-mad youngsters, Lopate discovered film through
literature (``I bought Arthur Knight's survey, 'The Liveliest Art,'
and went about in my thorough, solemn way trying to see every movie
listed in the index'') and merely endured genre directors like
Hawks and Hitchcock while embracing the masters of high art, like
Murnau, Kurosawa and Bresson. In his teens, Lopate pursued cinema
across the bridge from his working-class Brooklyn family -- in the
wobbly seats of the Thalia, at makeshift screenings in Chelsea
church basements and finally in college at Columbia, where he
discovered Andrew Sarris and the auteur theory and formed a movie
club of his own. In ``Anticipation of 'La Notte' '' (an essay also
included in ``Against Joie de Vivre''), we meet Lopate's fellow
film buffs -- the temperate humanist James Stoller, a lover of
Satyajit Ray and Jean Renoir, and the ``mischievous'' Nicholas
Zill, a psychology major, who relishes the beggars' orgy in
``Viridiana'' and cutting up rats in the lab. Both men greatly
influence Lopate, who -- ``unable to break through to women'' --
spends his free time browsing through movie magazines, savoring ``a
mood of sweet latency'' and dreaming of the films he will see.
</P>
<P>
   It was the early 1960's, a high point for the French New Wave.
``Our man was Godard,'' Lopate recalls, and proceeds to interweave
his highly charged reactions to films like ``Breathless'' with
cursory remarks about his virginity and other aspects of college
life off screen. Discussing his suicidal depression, for instance,
Lopate nonchalantly observes, ``Between screenings of Vigo's
'L'Atalante' and 'Zero de Conduite' at West 106th Street, I told my
older brother that I was thinking of killing myself.'' And two
weeks after he has vomited up the 20 sleeping pills he swallowed:
``My brother met me at the hospital and we went straight downtown
to see a double bill at the Bleecker Street Cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Totally, Tenderly, Tragically'' comprises 27 essays divided
into three sections: ``Memories,'' ``Films and Filmmakers'' and
``Can Movies Think?'' Roughly chronological, it jumps from short
reviews to leisurely career studies, film festival reports, close
considerations of individual movies (memorably, Bresson's ``Trial
of Joan of Arc'') and interviews with the likes of the critic
Pauline Kael. These pieces are culled from a variety of
publications; and while Lopate makes an effort to link them by
tacking on explanatory notes at the end of most articles, they
never do cohere. ``The First New York Film Festival -- 1963,''
written for The Columbia Daily Spectator, is predictably solemn and
erudite, while ``The Gallant Andrew Sarris,'' contributed to a book
honoring Sarris's 70th birthday, is chatty and wry. Still, Lopate's
language is consistently engaging, and the high points include a
deftly argued defense of Jerry Lewis's ``Three on a Couch,'' a
trenchant interview with the Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami and
a brief but moving rumination on Chris Marker's magisterial oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   Notable too are Lopate's profile of Luchino Visconti and his
long, informative homage to the Japanese director Mikio Naruse.
Less successful are the more ambitious, convoluted essays.
``Fassbinder's 'Despair,' '' for instance, sets out to merge
analysis of a failed movie with the story of Lopate's own botched
infatuation, but it does not build interest about either. And
Lopate's musings on the possibility of an essay in film (``In
Search of the Centaur: The Essay-Film'') prove pedantic, even
plodding at times, though he clearly intends to delight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no faith that my discriminations in taste are anything
but the picky awareness of what will keep me stimulated, based on
the peculiar family and class circumstances that formed me. The
knowledge that my discriminations are skewed and not always
universally desirable doesn't stop me in the least from making
them,'' Lopate announced in ``Against Joie de Vivre.'' And a
swaggering individualism informs his film judgments, too. This can
be satisfying, as when Lopate nails ``Letter to Jane'' as ``a
closely reasoned, if nasty, provocation by two male-bonded
ingrates, Godard and Jean-Pierre Gorin, against the female movie
star who so generously collaborated with them on their otherwise
unbudgetable feature, 'Tout Va Bien.' '' At other times Lopate's
thrusts seem merely peevish -- when, during the 60's, for instance,
he deplores Ingmar Bergman as ``the darling of the suburbs,'' or in
the 90's damns Woody Allen's (sad and hilarious) ``Bullets Over
Broadway'' as ``impersonal,'' ``anti-intellectual'' and ``glib.''
</P>
<P>
   But if ``Totally, Tenderly, Tragically'' is an uneven volume,
never as fluent or strikingly original as ``Against Joie de
Vivre,'' it is always and unwaveringly intelligent. Fortunately,
its tendentious moments are outweighed by a wealth of thoughtful
analysis conveyed in lively, often eloquent prose. ``I approach
moviegoing seriously,'' Lopate announces in his introduction. And
serious he is. But he is also curious, wise and frequently amusing,
a sharp observer of his own quest for ``sublimity on screen.''

 THE RUM DIARY:
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Long Lost Novel.

 &UR; FEAR AND LOATHING IN SAN JUAN &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KELLY &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Drugs must have done wonders for Hunter S. Thompson, if we can
go by his first novel, ``The Rum Diary.'' There are no narcotics in
this early work, and there is also none of the maniacal wit and
deranged exuberance that roared through the ``Fear and Loathing''
books. The publisher says the novel, which is set mainly in Puerto
Rico in the late 1950s, was begun in 1959, when the future Dr. Duke
was only 22 years old, but doesn't say when Thompson put the
finishing touches on this piece of juvenilia (perhaps last month?).
</P>
<P>
   His narrator, Paul Kemp, leaves New York and the White Horse
Tavern behind for a job with The San Juan Daily News, an
English-language publication modeled on one that Thompson himself
worked for. The fictional paper is known for its colorful
journalists, who ``ran the whole gamut from genuine talents and
honest men to degenerates and hopeless losers who could barely
write a postcard.'' The editor is an ex-Communist from Florida
named Lotterman, who says things like ``You're damn tootin''' and
at other times sounds as if he were auditioning for ``The
McLaughlin Group'':
</P>
<P>
   ``'We have a responsibility! A free press is vital! If a pack of
deadbeats get hold of this newspaper it's the beginning of the end.
First they'll get this one, then they'll get a few more, and one
day they'll get The Times -- can you imagine it?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   '' 'They'll get us all!'''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who gets to drink rum all day and have sex on the
beach (the real thing, not the cocktail) all night, Kemp is pretty
morose. At 30, he finds himself caught between ``a restless
idealism on one hand and a sense of impending doom on the other.''
Part of his problem is San Juan itself, which yanqui carpetbaggers
have now discovered and which Thompson evokes with some flair:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a strange and unreal air about the whole world I'd
come into. It was amusing and vaguely depressing at the same time.
Here I was, living in a luxury hotel, racing around a half-Latin
city in a toy car that looked like a cockroach and sounded like a
jet fighter, sneaking down alleys and . . . scavenging for food in
shark-infested waters, hounded by mobs yelling in a foreign tongue
-- and the whole thing was taking place in quaint old Spanish
Puerto Rico, where everybody spent American dollars and drove
American cars and sat around roulette wheels pretending they were
in Casablanca. One part of the city looked like Tampa and the other
part looked like a medieval asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, not a lot happens in the novel. But trouble looms.
First, Kemp and two colleagues, Yeamon and Sala, are beaten up by
the cops. Then real disaster strikes on St. Thomas, where a
carnival has lured Kemp, Yeamon and Yeamon's sexy blond girlfriend,
Chenault, whom our hero has lusted after since Chapter 1. On the
island, the signs are ominous: people are looting a liquor store
and chanting ``Busha boomba, balla wa! Busha boomba, balla wa!''
Before long, Chenault is dancing suggestively for the locals;
nothing good can come of that. She disappears, or is disappeared.
Will the hard-bitten reporters leave her behind? Will she find her
way back to Puerto Rico? Will she and Kemp finally play house?
You're damn tootin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week in Vegas,'' Hunter Thompson once wrote, ``is like
stumbling into a Time Warp, a regression to the late 50's.'' The
same goes for ``The Rum Diary.'' If you're looking for the
birthplace of gonzo, you won't find it here.

 ISAIAH BERLIN
<TEXT>
<P>

 &UR; BOTH FOX AND HEDGEHOG &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN MARCUS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When Isaiah Berlin died last year, obituary notices on both
sides of the Atlantic were long, appreciative and respectful. Not
all of them, however. Snipings from the ideological left and right
made it clear that this philosopher and historian of ideas, who was
also the chief voice of liberalism in the second half of the 20th
century, would not depart unscathed. They were a reminder, too,
that the middle ground on which classical modern liberalism stands
is narrower now than most of us suppose, that it has shrunk as it
has been contested, and that liberalism is indeed an embattled
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Such an observation would have come as no surprise to Berlin. As
he conceived of it, this view of the world included philosophical
doctrines, political convictions and social theories about what
constituted being human. He also referred to it as pluralism, and
he never tired of setting it forth. In essay after essay, he
delineated it as a minority view, standing outside of, and
resisting and confronting, the mainstream of the Western tradition
of philosophical beliefs. That tradition was, according to Berlin's
spirited accounts and summaries, formed in two heroic episodes: the
first embodied by Plato and the classical Greeks; the second, the
grand modern resumptions of the mathematical and scientific
revolutions of the 17th century, played through in the
philosophical and social theories of the Enlightenment. A number of
interconnected presuppositions are organized into this mighty
intellectual fabric. First, as in the natural sciences, ``all
genuine questions must have one true answer''; in Berlin's amiable
formulation, the answers must be true for everyone, everywhere, all
the time. Second, a reproducible path toward the discovery of these
truths must be in principle accessible to everyone. Third, ``the
true answers, when found, must necessarily be compatible with one
another and form a single whole.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, opinions differed dramatically on how to find the
right way: some found it in churches, others in laboratories; some
trusted in intuition, others in experiment; some invested in
visions, others in mathematics. All shared the fundamental belief
that there is a system that weaves everything together. As Berlin
remarked in a characteristic passage of galloping hyperbole: ``The
answers must be known to someone: perhaps Adam in Paradise knew;
perhaps we shall only reach them at the end of days; if men cannot
know them, perhaps the angels know; and if not the angels, then God
knows. These timeless truths must in principle be knowable.''
Ultimately the grand narrative of culture and history would
progress to the best of all possible worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin himself was trained in one prominent configuration of
this perennial philosophy. At Oxford, he internalized the British
empirical tradition and at first associated himself with the early
formation of modern analytic and linguistic philosophy. A. J. Ayer,
J. L. Austin and Stuart Hampshire were among colleagues and
friends. But even before then, his cultural identity prepared him
for the radical liberation that Enlightenment thought has regularly
effected. Born in Riga, Latvia, in 1909 to a Jewish bourgeois
family that moved first to St. Petersburg and then in 1921 to
London, where it had business interests, this champion of
philosophical minorities and oddballs knew the tradition intimately
from the inside.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's life as we read it in ``Isaiah Berlin,'' Michael
Ignatieff's authorized biography, was an uninterrupted story of
success. It was furnished not only with a happy ending; it was
happy all the way through, from Riga to Oxford (the scholarship
winner to Corpus Christi became the first Jew to be elected to a
fellowship at All Souls) and points west. Although he considered
the present era ``the most terrible century in Western history,''
he suffered no personal hardships and led a charmed life. The three
strands of his existence -- Jewish, Russian and British -- were
braided richly together, and he gave full expression to each in his
Zionism, in his career as a spokeman for intellectual integrity and
moral decency and in his adherence to clarity, empirical reality
and liberal democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Other circumstances contributed to Berlin's deviation from the
principal genealogy of rationalistic methods and doctrines. When it
came to technical matters of logic and language, he discovered, he
was not in the same class as his Oxford analytic colleagues nor,
sensibly, did his more urgent interests lie in formal inquiry. His
first book was an introduction to Marx for the general reader,
which entailed intensive study of Hegel and other 19th-century
thinkers. From them Berlin learned that there might be ``no
timeless truths. . . . Human horizons altered with each new step in
the evolutionary ladder; history was a drama with many acts; it was
moved by conflicts of forces in the realms of both ideas and
reality.'' And from here his reading took him back to figures like
Machiavelli, Vico and Herder, each of whom represents a departure
from the main rationalist tradition. He emerged with a position, or
rather a counterposition: ``Not all the supreme values pursued by
mankind now and in the past were necessarily compatible.''
Individuals and entire cultures both pursued and were shaped by
``values, not means to ends but ultimate ends'' that can and do
differ and are not ``combinable in any final synthesis.''

   This view, he stoutly affirmed, was not relativism but
pluralism: fundamental values can intractably clash, and yet ``it
does not follow that, if they do, some must be true and others
false.'' Liberty and equality, freedom and order, justice and mercy
will not be commensurable with one another. The desirable ends that
we pursue are not one but many. These ``collisions of values are of
the essence of what they are and what we are. . . . The notion of
the perfect whole, the ultimate solution, in which all good things
coexist, seems to me to be not merely unattainable -- that is a
truism -- but conceptually incoherent. . . . We are doomed to
choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss.'' Berlin's
liberal pluralism contained this indwelling bitter and stoic, if
not tragic, element. It was formed reactively, as a mediated,
reflexive response both to the enormous force of monistic
rationalism in philosophical and social thinking and to the
monstrous excesses committed in the name of rational plans in our
time. John Stuart Mill, Berlin's greatest predecessor among
philosophical liberals, modified the sovereign rationalist
principles that he inherited from his father and Jeremy Bentham
with what he learned from Coleridge and Continental romantic
thinkers. Berlin repaired to similar sources in his efforts to undo
the fallacies entailed in the projects for realizing, both
intellectually and in society, ``ultimate harmony.'' Such celestial
music was for angels, not men.
</P>
<P>
   His memorable essays from the three decades of 1950 to 1980 all
tend to focus on this cluster of considerations. In ``Historical
Inevitability'' he mounted a telling assault on positivism in both
new and old forms, along with the whole range of doctrines that are
grouped around belief that all human experience is determined. In
the famous ``Two Concepts of Liberty'' he set forth his notions of
negative liberty, which the individual must be allowed to enjoy
without interference, and positive liberty, which is an expression
of some idea of what is good for both oneself and others. And in
his dramatic expositions of the thinking of Hamann and Herder, of
Vico and Herzen, de Maistre and Mill, Montesquieu and Sorel, in
``The Pursuit of the Ideal'' and ``The Sense of Reality'' and in
his essays on nationalism he worked up, worked out and reworked
again his leading conceptions. He did not scruple to repeat
himself. Starting out as a fox, he became a monumental hedgehog.
The one big thing that, like the hedgehog, he knew was that the
human world answered to the nature of foxes -- that one must know
many things even if all that one knows is that this is what one has
to know.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin was a legendary talker, as a rule in continuous full
spate. Words, phrases, sentences, paragraphs came pouring forth at
phenomenal speed, an unintermitting flood, often impossible to
follow, but nonetheless coherent, sequential, compelling,
illuminated with drama and humor. This astonishing gift brought him
wide notice as an undergraduate. It was instrumental to his
acceptance in and privileged place among the upper echelons in the
social and cultural hierarchies of Britain and America, a series of
worlds that he spent most of his life exploring and enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   His immense powers of spoken expression seem to have been
connected with the difficulties in writing that he claimed always
to have suffered, and with his apparently indifferent estimation of
his own written work. Much of the substance of his published
writings remained scattered about in periodicals and ephemera until
a faithful editor, Henry Hardy, gathered together important volumes
of his essays; Berlin's delivery from this dismembered condition
secured his final singular status as a late 20th-century Victorian
sage. Since his talk and conversation were manifestly touched with
genius, his friends persuaded him, during his retirement, to allow
himself to be taped. In 1987, Michael Ignatieff, whose latest
previous book is ``The Warrior's Honor: Ethnic War and the Modern
Conscience,'' began interviewing him. After several years, a
biography was agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a touching portrait and a labor of love. It is
gracefully written, moves along at a comfortable pace and is not
without its shortcomings. It is a compact undertaking, with almost
two-thirds devoted to the years before Berlin composed his major
works. Too much space is allocated, at least for my sense of
proportion, to Berlin's hobnobbing among the influential and the
celebrated. To be sure, Berlin socialized to the point of addiction
and was a tremendous charmer, a nonstop conversational act that was
hard to follow and a marvelous gossip. Still, there is something
dubious about allotting two short paragraphs to Berlin's book about
Marx while going on at length with an amusing story about how
Winston Churchill mistook all through lunch a bewildered Irving
Berlin for Isaiah B. The biography also takes Berlin at his word
and is written on the same level of analysis as his own reflections
about himself. That is to say, as in many authorized biographies,
what we mostly get is the subject's version of both himself and his
personal world. Hence there are, in singular contrast to Berlin's
written views and convictions, no tragic conflicts, no insuperable
difficulties or irreclaimable losses, no troubling inner
contradictions, no neurosis, no incoherence, self-delusion,
shameful episodes or lifelong regrets. Berlin habitually quoted
Bishop Butler to the effect that ``things and actions are what they
are''; such matter-of-factness may be the rule for certain
philosophical idioms. But it is not the rule for biographies, for
narratives of lives in which things regularly turn out to be what
they are not, or at least fail to be what they were once purported
to be.
</P>
<P>
   More regrettable is the fact that very little is made of deeper
connections between the life and the work. Part of the inner
meaning of important writings is to be traced in how they emerge
obliquely from ostensibly distant or remote personal experiences.
There is a similar avoidance of the contemporary biographical
assumption that our understanding of the structure of even an
abstruse argument can be augmented by an informed sense of personal
urgings, impulses that are bound up through indirect and often
unacknowledged means to larger events in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``Isaiah Berlin'' is an undertaking of
considerable merit. It gives us a rounded view of an
extraordinarily distinguished mind and prepares the ground for
future studies of Berlin's work and the place of his life and
experience in it. In this uncertain universe there are few matters
that one can count on with assurance; one of them is the continuing
salience, vitality and interest of the writings of Isaiah Berlin.

   Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.
</P>
<P>
   314 pp. Washington: Counterpoint. $25.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; PASSAGE TO AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; By DEBORAH MASON &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Should one want to try to become something other than what one
is?'' This is the question Ruth Prawer Jhabvala asked in the
introduction to her previous story collection, ``Out of India,'' in
which she reveals a deeply ambivalent love for her adopted country.
There she lives each day in the thick of its languid communality,
``a central European with an English education and a deplorable
tendency to constant self-analysis'' who is fated to feel like an
eternally displaced person.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is precisely this sense of dislocation that has provided
Jhabvala with the cross-cultural eye to create, over the past 40
years, the sumptuous emotional geography of her short stories, her
screenplays for Merchant-Ivory Productions and her dozen novels,
including the Booker Prize-winning ``Heat and Dust.'' Jhabvala is a
connoisseur of divided souls, conceiving characters whose inner
longings are at odds with their outer protective coloration --
Indians who covet and achieve more tidy, ``modernized'' existences,
then feel as if someone had stolen their life force; Westerners who
eagerly hand themselves over to India's chaotic bliss, then find it
too rigorous to endure.
</P>
<P>
   In her most recent works, Jhabvala's rich depictions of New York
City's extinguished lives -- melancholy German intellectuals
arguing in dusty West Side apartments, madmen pawing through trash
cans on Broadway -- have come to rival her signature descriptions
of India's intricate seductions. This new collection of stories,
``East Into Upper East: Plain Tales From New York and New Delhi,''
written over the last 20 years, reaffirms her as a spellbinding
urban fabulist.
</P>
<P>
   Set, for the most part, in the gilded co-ops of New York's Upper
East Side and the expensive villas of the ``new New Delhi,''
Jhabvala's stories lay open the rootless, chameleon existences that
thrive in habitats requiring no firm commitments, just a bundle of
money and a great address. Much further adrift than the dislocated
souls of her previous works, many of these characters have passed
over into permanent spiritual exile. Choked off from religious
moorings and family origins, they find their hungers resurfacing in
a desperate voraciousness. Sensuality is reduced to clownish sexual
preening, family loyalties to the language of real estate parcels
and advantageous marriages. These people can be unexpectedly
amusing -- or terrifying in their dumb soullessness. From time to
time, they manage to find salvation through the work of spiritual
shamans who may or may not be charlatans -- not that it matters.
Both the louts and the potentially redeemable are portrayed with
wry, bristling irony.
</P>
<P>
   Each story reveals Jhabvala's mastery of the form: the sleek
economy of words, free of heavy symbolism or easy judgments, that
allows her to home in on small, telling details. Often, a story
starts as if she were simply picking up a conversation in
midstream. ``Farid couldn't believe what he heard about Farida,''
one story begins. ``She was his wife, and he would have thought
that no one had known her more deeply, in every way, than he had.''
Jhabvala's plots unfold just as crisply, delivering sly humor and
sudden, startling turns into tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York stories, her characters routinely seal
themselves up in willed, anonymous isolation, as if warding off the
messy truths of the city might help them avoid unsettling changes
in their own lives. Behind their double-bolted doors, many are
locked into crushing emotional dependencies.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Fidelity,'' a middle-aged woman named Sophie spends most of
her time in her dark Park Avenue apartment, hiding behind her
family money and the constantly drawn drapes that prevent the sun
from fading her grandparents' Biedermeier furniture. Sophie's
ravenous wheeler-dealer husband, Dave, has left her yet again --
this time to live around the corner with a new young girlfriend who
``wasn't worth, he said, to kiss Sophie's shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   He still visits his wife regularly and just as regularly bursts
into tears over his infidelities, both romantic and financial --
tears so cleansing that they give him fresh strength to walk out on
her once again. ``Dave's relation to his wife was an affair of the
utmost delicacy to him,'' Jhabvala writes. ``He considered his love
for her as the only pure and selfless part of him, which he was
reluctant to tarnish with a request for money to keep him out of
jail.'' Sophie's accession to Dave turns out to be far more tragic:
she is so grateful for his visits that she will not interrupt his
monologues to tell him she is dying.
</P>
<P>
   Jhabvala's New Yorkers can be fiendish or funny, and they can
also can be pitiable -- like Pauline, the lonely real estate agent
in ``Great Expectations,'' who hands over her apartment and her
life to a parasitic family she has just met. The Indians in
Jhabvala's stories, on the other hand, seem somewhat wiser, less
cut off from their ancestral culture. But although they live in
daily intimacy with India's fervent spirituality, only a few
partake of it genuinely. The most haunting of these is Prakash in
``Husband and Son,'' a once amorous, Cambridge-educated Cabinet
minister who is now a toothless old holy man living on the roof of
his Delhi house, singing Vedic hymns to greet each dawn. Otherwise,
there are few saints among the Indian characters -- far from it.
</P>
<P>
   Farid and Farida, in the story of the same name, are a chic
young Delhi couple who move to London to hustle India's full line
of enchantments, from handcrafts to cocktail delicacies. When their
schemes collapse, so does their marriage. Twenty years later,
Farid, his waistline and his drinking problem increasing, tracks
down his wife to the Himalayas, only to find her sitting under a
banyan tree with her own fleet of handmaidens and a line of
pilgrims waiting to touch her feet: she has transformed herself
into an even more marketable product, a holy woman. ``Her skin was
clear,'' Farid notes, ``and shone with a radiance that could only
be the result of the best cosmetics, applied, he knew, with
consummate skill.'' He has arrived just in time to see her lose
what little remains of her soul.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-EAST-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: her soul.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other Indian characters engage in the same social climbing and
power playing as the New Yorkers. Harry (born Hari), the
disaffected husband in ``Independence,'' amuses himself with
English detective novels, Urdu poetry and vodka. Meanwhile, his
wife, Sumitra, the Pamela Harriman of post-independence New Delhi,
is out every night ministering to the newly elected politicos
streaming in from the provinces -- teaching them to use the right
fork at the French Ambassador's dinner and sometimes romancing them
afterward. As Sumitra's career ascends, Harry reverts to wearing
Indian clothes and staging embarrassing scenes at his wife's
soirees. Gradually, he drinks himself into darkness, becoming a sad
relic of the graceful, old, outworn India.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ma in ``The Temptress,'' an ``ordinary Indian housewife
with extraordinary powers,'' who is the cheeky queen of this
collection. A fat, chatty sorceress in her 60's, Ma is imported to
New York by a wealthy collector of gurus, one of the many young
people in these stories starved for the spiritual grounding their
parents have discarded. But after sharing Ma with her friends, the
woman abruptly abandons her. Ma doesn't mind: she is a specialist
in self-renovation, having retooled herself into a glittering woman
of the world who shifts cities, countries, even New York apartments
with playful ease. Besides, ``Ma wasn't ready to go home. She felt
she was still needed here, also that she hadn't yet had her fill of
shopping and nice restaurants and all the lights coming on in the
theater district and the advertisements flashing and the many
different cable channels and flavors of ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma is also busy coaxing out of hiding the city's vast,
suppressed spiritual yearnings. Her tony neighbors unlatch their
doors and pour out their hearts to her; salesgirls from the local
discount store consult her between customers. Even doormen, that
most hardened of urban breeds, walk away from their jobs to join
her chanting, lentil-cooking commune. There Ma soothes them by
dealing ``with everyone in the manner of one used to hearing
strange and even terrible things without letting herself be
overwhelmed by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ma comes the closest to sainthood of anyone in the book. She may
even be Jhabvala's earthy, late 90's incarnation of the Indian
Mother Goddess herself, who changes her own form at will, while
urging humankind to embrace -- not hide from -- the chaos,
contradiction and changeability of existence. Reconciling East and
West with one jingle of her bangle bracelets, Ma shows how a
benevolent acceptance of our frailties and longings can bind
disparate cultures -- and even a few divided souls.

 THE CRISIS OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM
<TEXT>
<P>
   Open Society Endangered.
</P>
<P>
   By George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   245 pp. New York: Public Affairs. $26.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; BE AFRAID! &QL; 
 &UR; By FLOYD NORRIS &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The world's economy has seldom seemed as imperiled -- at least
in the past half-century -- as it did this summer in the aftermath
of Russia's default on its debt. ``The Crisis of Global
Capitalism'' was rushed into print by one of the best money
managers, and most generous philanthropists, to come along this
half-century. Its financial analysis is brilliant and persuasive,
its remedies less so. And its extraordinary pessimism may prove to
be overdone.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros has been known on Wall Street for decades, but it
was not until 1992 that he became an international celebrity. That
was when the hedge funds he managed bet huge amounts that Britain
would not be able to maintain the value of the pound against other
European currencies. His funds made billions, and he felt a little
guilty. ``The Bank of England was on the other side of my
transactions and I was taking money out of the pockets of British
taxpayers,'' he writes. He doesn't think that should have deterred
him -- somebody else would have made the money anyway, he figures
-- but it does provide an argument for better international
regulation of markets.
</P>
<P>
   Soros thinks that argument is more valid today than ever. He
traces the way Thailand's financial collapse in 1997 led to
problems in other Asian countries, and then to Russia, and finally
to Latin America. It is a process he thinks will continue, arguing
that we are in the early stages of a global bear market.
``Eventually the markets should go much lower, leading to a global
recession,'' he forecasts. ``The disintegration of the global
capitalist system will prevent a recovery, turning the recession
into a depression.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his argument are two beliefs: First, that the
financial markets have grown so large and powerful that they can
destroy countries, and second, that those same markets have now
become so frightened that they will withdraw capital from most
countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   It is certainly true that some players in the markets, Soros
among them, have amassed huge amounts of money for investment, and
that those resources can, at times, overwhelm the forces against
them. That is particularly true when countries are seeking to
defend overvalued currencies. Soros's funds were among the first
speculators to bet against Asian currencies last year, although he
denies that he caused the meltdown of those currencies.
</P>
<P>
   One reason those currencies grew to be overvalued was a huge,
and in retrospect irrational, flood of capital into emerging Asian
economies. Asia was seen as a region of extraordinary growth, and,
as Soros notes, experiences like the Mexican bailout had dulled
investor fears about risk. Indeed, the Asian bailouts of 1997
tended to do a better job of protecting international investors
than they did of aiding the economies involved.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that atmosphere that the Russian economic collapse
came as such a shock. The Russian Government was in desperate shape
last spring, and everyone knew it. It was running a huge budget
deficit, not because it was spending so much money but because so
little was coming in. Few paid taxes, and some of the taxes that
were paid stayed with regional authorities. The Government was
determined to protect the international value of the ruble, since
stabilizing it had brought down inflation and was one of the few
economic successes to which the Government could point. So it was
unwilling simply to print rubles, and had to borrow money to pay
its bills.
</P>
<P>
   But who would lend money to such a basket case of a government?
Russians who owned rubles were reluctant to do so, demanding
interest rates of more than 50 percent. Even at those rates, the
Government could not borrow enough rubles. So it borrowed dollars
instead. In June, Goldman Sachs managed to sell $1.25 billion of
bonds denominated in dollars. Russia was to pay more than 12
percent interest, or more than double what the United States
Treasury was then paying, and many investors thought they had a
sure thing. After all, the Western world would surely not let
Russia, with all those nuclear weapons, default.
</P>
<P>
   But it did. Soros was a player in that crisis, talking to
Russian and American officials and, when the Aug. 17 collapse was
near, proposing his own solution, which would have involved further
international aid and a fairly modest devaluation of the ruble. The
major Western nations were unwilling, and international investors
lost billions. Soros's funds were among the losers.
</P>
<P>
   That collapse shocked international investors, and in the
aftermath many of them fled from risky investments. It was not only
doubtful foreign countries that were affected, but also European
and American companies whose credit was less than top notch. Soros
is furious that more was not done to salvage Russia. He thinks the
continued decline of financial markets is inevitable, albeit with a
rally or two along the way, and is harshly critical of the lack of
effective international action to ease the financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Since this book went to press, however, there have been efforts
to arrange coordinated international action to fight financial
decay, and Congress has at long last provided the $18 billion in
American money needed to expand the International Monetary Fund.
Markets have rebounded, reflecting optimism that the fixes will
work.
</P>
<P>
   Soros wants more international regulation of markets. He would
love to see an international central bank, or at least an agency to
guarantee some international loans. It is unfair to dismiss those
ideas, as some have, as being ill-disguised plans to bail out
investors like Soros, since he wants to force investors to take
hits when things go wrong. But he is not persuasive in arguing that
such changes could be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   This book is sometimes hard sledding, particularly in the first
section, where Soros explains his theory of reflexivity, which
essentially argues that reality affects perceptions and in turn is
affected by those perceptions. It is an idea that seems obvious,
and readers may be tempted to skip over much of that. But when
Soros gets down to financial market business, and explains how we
got to where we are now, he does an excellent job. ``The Crisis of
Global Capitalism'' will be worth reading even if its dire
forecasts prove to be wrong.

 MASTER GEORGIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   By Beryl Bainbridge.
</P>
<P>
   190 pp. New York:
</P>
<P>
   Carroll &AMP; Graf Publishers. $21.
 &UR; ------- &QL; 
 &UR; EXPIRATION DATES &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANCINE PROSE &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   BERYL BAINBRIDGE'S novels are like elegant teacups that contain
a strong, dark, possibly sinister but remarkable brew. Models of
compression, they show us how much (character, plot, subplot,
psychology, wit and depth) can be poured into a thin, deceptively
delicate vessel. For over 30 years, her best books -- from
``Harriet Said'' and ``The Bottle Factory Outing'' to ``An Awfully
Big Adventure'' -- have resisted the tide that has caused so much
modern fiction to bobble, inflated and bloated, in increasingly
murky waters. Indeed, Bainbridge's writing is so unlike anyone
else's that it may be more instructive to find analogues in the
visual arts. Her fiction is reminiscent of medieval woodcuts --
their spare, authoritative line deployed to render some grisly
scene (martyrs burning at the stake, victims felled by a plague)
with antic, animated high spirits. Or perhaps the art it most
nearly evokes is Hogarth's engravings, those richly detailed
snapshots of mass depravity and mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   A number of her books are set in the past. ``Young Adolf''
deals, nervily, with an imaginary sojourn in England by the
youthful Hitler; ``The Birthday Boys'' considers the ill-fated
Scott expedition to Antarctica; ``Watson's Apology'' exhumes a
Victorian murder. Yet these are not the sort of historical fictions
that serve up warmed-over ``Masterpiece Theater'' plots, larded
with period costumes, periwigs and bared bosoms. Rather,
Bainbridge's concerns -- the heartbreaking, nuanced transactions
between the strong and the weak, the perceptual differences
dividing men and women, the roles of chance and character in
determining our fates, the eager glee with which Nemesis undoes our
careful plans, the influence that social class exerts on sexual
morality -- remind us of how much about human behavior and destiny
is timeless and universal.
</P>
<P>
   Bainbridge's new novel, ``Master Georgie,'' is organized,
thematically and structurally, around a succession of upsetting
photographs; several of them, as was not uncommon in the 19th
century, picture the newly deceased. At the novel's center is
George Hardy, an amateur photographer and (more or less)
professional physician, whom we first glimpse (as always, from a
distance) in 1846, racing through the streets of Liverpool toward
the brothel in which his father has suddenly and inconveniently
died. By the time the elder Mr. Hardy has been brought home and his
body arranged to create the impression that he has expired in his
own bed, a large and varied cast of characters has been efficiently
assembled. In addition to the bisexual, seductive and mysterious
George, there are (among others) Dr. Potter, the libidinous
geologist who marries George's sister, Beatrice; Pompey Jones, the
wily street urchin who becomes George's assistant and lover; and,
most important, Myrtle, a foundling whose blindly obsessive passion
for the man she calls Master Georgie is the luminous thread that
holds the novel together. Narrated by the simultaneously
starry-eyed and down-to-earth orphan, the vertiginous first chapter
begins and ends with George photographing her beside his dead
father, a grimly comic event that the enamored Myrtle experiences
as an occasion of romantic transcendence:
</P>
<P>
   ``I fixed my gaze on the dead man and told myself God would
strike me blind if my eyelids quivered. So intense was my
concentration, it was only Master Georgie who breathed in that
sun-dappled room. Outside, the birds continued to twitter. All my
life, I thought, I will stand at your side; and then I did blink,
for the grandness of such a notion welled up tears in my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the novel's drama -- marriages, births, miscarriages and
deaths -- takes place during such blinks, in the months or years
that elapse between chapters. The book has a rare, rather
flattering faith in the reader's ability to extrapolate crucial
information from what is -- or, more frequently, what is not --
said. This characteristic spareness, dryness and pared-down
intensity can, I suppose, be confused with a certain surface chill
and may explain why Bainbridge's novels have failed to achieve in
this country the popularity earned by some of her windier
countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   When George volunteers to serve as an army medical officer and
the others follow to be near him, the action moves to
Constantinople and on to the cholera-infested camps and gory
battlefields of the Crimean War. Throughout, the characters take
turns telling their harrowing stories and offering their
conflicting versions of reality -- interpretations shaped by how
much they can (or can bear to) comprehend about their situation and
one another.
</P>
<P>
   EVERYTHING is refracted and refocused, as if by a series of
lenses, as Myrtle, Pompey Jones and Dr. Potter alternately assume
the task of advancing the plot. Myrtle's adoring view of Georgie
(``Of average height, stout of build, he walked with his feet
turned out and back straight as a ramrod. I watched the way he
swung his arms. How strange it is that even a mode of walking can
inspire love'') refuses to recognize his polymorphous sexuality and
so bears little resemblance to that of Pompey Jones, who sees his
master and lover as a privileged, petulant drunk. Likewise, our
sense of the minor characters is subject to major revision. Mr.
Hardy, whose embarrassing death has set events in motion, is
remembered by Myrtle as ``cheerful and lacking in malice,'' fond of
entertaining party guests with bellowed renditions of maudlin
ditties; in contrast, Dr. Potter recalls him as ``a bully and a
fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what's most striking about the book -- and about Beryl
Bainbridge's work as a whole -- is its companionable alliance
between wry, deadpan humor and nightmarish horror. Everywhere the
characters look, there's something grotesque to see -- if only
they're willing or able to see it. Meanwhile, the cumulative effect
of such an abundance of disconcerting incidents, described so
dispassionately and flatly and with such understatement, is that
they begin to seem at once awful and oddly funny.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-GEORGIE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: oddly funny.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Myrtle's life has got off to an unpromising start (``I'd been
found . . . in a cellar in Seel Street, sat beside the body of a
woman whose throat had been nibbled by rats''), and though the
plucky, unshockable and sympathetic girl is educated and ``made
into a lady,'' she never sheds her intimacy with hideous
misadventure. In the Crimea, a brief pleasure excursion with an
officer's garrulous mistress involves an ominous encounter with a
three-legged black dog, an invitation to accept a farmer's
hospitality that ends with a goat messily giving birth in the
middle of a table and, finally, the sight of a dead soldier,
propped against a tree: ``The pink had quite gone from his cheeks
and his skin was mottled, like meat lain too long on the slab. . .
. Flies crawled along his fingers and buzzed at his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Scattered throughout the novel are many similarly horrific
moments, so that the narrative comes to resemble a cord stretched
tightly, connecting these glittery dark jewels. One of Pompey
Jones's photographic assignments is to assist Georgie in
documenting cataract surgery on a captive ape. An evening of opera
erupts in an outburst of jealousy and aggression. A child's puppy
is torn apart by feral dogs. When a Punch-and-Judy show is
interrupted by a collision between a horse and a van, the accident
is explained with Bainbridge's typically dry, ironic, goofy logic:
</P>
<P>
   ``A vegetable cart had spilled cabbages on the road, all of
which, save one, had been recovered or run off with. The
gentleman's horse, who had seen service with a cavalry regiment,
mistaking it for a puff adder, had reared up and crashed down
sideways, striking the van with its flank. The animal had recently
returned from Africa, where puff adders were quite common. They
hadn't any teeth but if they bit you their tongues imparted a
poison that could turn your blood to treacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the level of violence and chaos escalates as the book
nears its conclusion, and the sort of disaster that we anticipate
and dread in all of Bainbridge's fiction inevitably occurs. A final
photograph is taken, and the book ends with a searing image of
grief and loss.
</P>
<P>
   Beryl Bainbridge's novels are not exactly testaments to their
author's faith in redemption; she places little stock in the
ability of good intentions and common sense to dampen our natural
appetite for duplicity, cruelty and violence, or to defeat the
threatening, ``disruptive force of haphazard actions.'' For these
reasons, ``Master Georgie'' is hardly a feel-good book -- unless
you're a reader whose spirits are lifted by the prospect of a
writer so original and so firmly in control of her art.

 THURGOOD MARSHALL: AMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY.
<TEXT>

   By Juan Williams.

 &UR; THE MARSHALL PLAN &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID K. SHIPLER &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Reading a biography of the great civil rights lawyer Thurgood
Marshall (1908-93) is good treatment for the disease of complacency
about race relations. Progress does not look inevitable when you
watch the powerful resistance that confronted Marshall's every step
to gain rights for blacks. Nor do all the advances seem
irreversible when you witness the backsliding that embittered his
later years as the first black Justice on the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his towering victories, he retired from the Court in
1991 not in a victorious spirit but in anguish over a task that
remained woefully incomplete. As an NAACP Legal Defense and
Educational Fund attorney, he had won landmark Supreme Court
decisions overturning segregation and discrimination in elections,
housing, transportation and education. Yet as a justice he saw his
influence wane as the Court swung to the right, leaving him
isolated and angry -- and unappreciated by a generation of blacks
no longer enamored of integration and too young to remember the
struggles he had waged since the 1930's. Some regard him as having
been a better lawyer than judge.
</P>
<P>
   The story of his extraordinary life contains a measure of our
history, so his exhilaration and melancholy reflect more than a
man's moods. They represent our national experience, which takes us
to the heights of decency one moment and to the depths of bigotry
the next. That larger landscape, illuminated as Marshall passes
through, is deftly sketched by Juan Williams in ``Thurgood
Marshall: American Revolutionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``revolutionary'' might seem exaggerated for a man who
worked wholly within the judicial system, albeit using the
Constitution as a weapon of liberation. But on the first page
Williams labels Marshall ``one of America's leading radicals,''
places him in a triumvirate with Malcolm X and Martin Luther King
Jr. and argues that it was Thurgood Marshall who ``stood as the one
with the biggest impact on American race relations.'' The ranking
is debatable, but it would surely have pleased Marshall, who
detested the separatism of Malcolm X; ``I think we called each
other sons of bitches'' at a chance meeting on a Harlem street,
Marshall told Williams. In private, Marshall also disparaged King
and opposed most demonstrations -- even the Montgomery bus boycott
and the lunch counter sit-ins -- as senseless invitations to
violence. He initially resisted defending black students arrested
at a sit-in, because he thought they had violated private property
rights at a Woolworth's in Greensboro, N.C. He gives no sign, in
Williams's portrait, of recognizing how King's movement mobilized
the conscience of the country, creating the climate in which
courtroom triumphs could be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is an accomplished reporter with The Washington Post
who wrote ``Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years,
1954-1965,'' the companion volume to the public television series.
His skills at digging out facts have been tested here, for although
he did a dozen interviews with Justice Marshall over six months in
1989, he was unable to gain access to the Legal Defense Fund's
files, and Marshall's children and second wife, Cissy, declined to
cooperate. Still, Williams interviewed widely, assembled accounts
of debates and maneuvers within the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People and obtained documents revealing
Marshall's sporadic cooperation with J. Edgar Hoover. The book is a
strong piece of journalism crammed with fascinating detail, done in
an unassuming style driven by the factual narrative.
</P>
<P>
   It portrays Marshall as a curious mixture of stubbornness and
accommodation, a gruff wit who chased women and drank heavily and a
dedicated lawyer who repeatedly ventured into the dangers of the
South to defend blacks being railroaded on murder, rape and other
charges. In 1946, he was nearly lynched with the help of the local
police in Columbia, Tenn., after he got an all-white jury to acquit
23 of 25 blacks charged in riots started by whites. ``One local
paper said the trial was packed with spectators who came to town to
see 'those niggers up there wearing coats and ties and talking back
to the judge just like they were white men,' '' Williams writes.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Baltimore, Marshall knew how to avoid provoking
whites' resentment over an ``uppity'' black, and so he adopted a
charming deference in his arguments before the Supreme Court. ``His
light humor made the young black lawyer a fast favorite among the
older white justices,'' Williams observes. ``Marshall always took a
moment to thank the justices, whisper some confidence and make each
of them feel as if he were relying on their superior knowledge to
help him through the maze of laws.'' Near the end of his Court
career 45 years later, though, he issued rare public criticisms of
his conservative colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   As a reporter's book and not a legal history, this biography
offers little from Marshall's briefs, opinions and dissents --
perhaps a reasonable choice, since these documents are available
elsewhere. But we never quite see Marshall's legal mind at work.
Williams tells of his powerful orations, but rarely shows us more
than fragmentary quotations, even as Marshall argues the famous
school desegregation case, Brown v. Board of Education, before the
Supreme Court. A more serious flaw
</P>
<P>
   lies in Williams's uncritical use of McCarthy-era innuendo to
describe certain civil rights activists as ``Communist-backed'' or
having ``Communist ties.'' As a pre-emptive defense of the
N.A.A.C.P., Marshall exchanged information on such people and
groups with Hoover, who was obsessed by Communists, both actual and
phantom. But Williams treats the paranoia unquestioningly. His
reporting stops far short of defining the boundary between reality
and fantasy, leaving his readers unsure about Marshall's role in
this other crucial test of American democracy, which raised issues
of free speech and free association. It is the book's largest
defect.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-MARSHALL-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: largest defect.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the book offers a valuable picture of the odd
Marshall-Hoover liaison. The F.B.I. Director placed Marshall under
surveillance and resented his complaints that F.B.I. agents were
covering up for white sheriffs' departments sympathetic to mob
violence against blacks. But when the two met in 1947, Marshall
``won Hoover over with his charming, good-ol'-boy, 'I'm a little
ol' Baltimore lawyer' persona,'' Williams writes. The Director
offered a collaborative relationship, and Marshall suggested that
the N.A.A.C.P. could defuse accusations of racism in the F.B.I. if
the F.B.I. would investigate attacks on blacks. Both men got a
little of what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   This volume captures the sweep of Marshall's impact beyond the
civil rights movement, for as lawyer and judge and justice, he
expanded the rights of all Americans. Williams shows him
influencing fellow justices in rulings that recognized the right to
abortions, indigent defendants' right to state-paid psychiatrists,
protections against double jeopardy in state courts and the right
of defendants not to have jurors excluded on racial grounds. He
helped shape the narrow decision to abolish the death penalty in
1972, but saw it reinstated by the Court several years later.
</P>
<P>
   The power of his presence was formidable. ``Marshall could be a
persuasive force by just sitting there,'' the conservative Justice
Antonin Scalia told Williams. ``Anyone who spoke in conference on
one of these race issues had to be looking at Thurgood. . . . He
wouldn't have had to open his mouth to affect the nature of the
conference and how seriously the conference would take matters of
race.'' The vacuum now is enormous.

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I found a bag of cookies in my kitchen today. Old, stale
cookies. They were in a lower cabinet, behind the crockpot I never
use. The bag was open, but only three of the chocolate chip treats
had been eaten.
</P>
<P>
   How did a bag of cookies live and die in a household with two
rapidly growing males and one snack-happy dad? Well, I ate the
three cookies and hid the bag from them, that's how. I just forgot
where I hid them until now. Wait, let me explain. I am not crazy.
</P>
<P>
   It all starts with that simple question, ``Are you going to eat
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, not often, but sometimes I only eat half of my
sandwich and then I gingerly wrap the other half in plastic wrap
intent on finishing it off at a later date. Or perhaps, I decide
that life will go on if I don't actually eat my way through the
entire pint of chocolate ice cream in one sitting. It might be any
morsel of food or drink left over from my meal. Invariably, before
it reaches the temperature of the refrigerator, one of the boys
wants to know if I'm going to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I say. ``Yes, I'm going to eat MY leftovers. It's good
food and I plan to finish it when I become hungry again. I don't
mean to be greedy but we each had an individual serving and you
have already eaten yours. This is mine. In the unlikely event that
I change my mind, you will have the right of first refusal.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I look in the refrigerator, my food is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ate the biscuit and half of a cocktail wiener that I was
saving for lunch?'' I query.
</P>
<P>
   My husband responds, ``Oh, did you want that? It's been in there
forever. It was going to spoil like that turkey last
Thanksgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just ate breakfast an hour ago. I don't even think that
biscuits can spoil. Why did you eat my food without asking me
first?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that my soft drink next to you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. It's flat anyway. Do you want it back?''
</P>
<P>
   Geez.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I bought these dried-out, awful-tasting, dehydrated banana
slices. I didn't even like them but I figured that no one else
would either, so at least when I got ready for a snack, they would
still be in the cabinet. Wrong. A week later, I went to grab a
handful and the bag was in the pantry completely empty.
</P>
<P>
   I was livid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to my bananas!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Mom, those were awful. We ate them for you but we could
barely swallow them. We had to drink some of your diet tea to get
them down. Don't ever buy those again.''
</P>
<P>
   After I ranted and raved about that for a week, they devised
this method of making sure that I get a sample of everything. Last
week, they left me a slice of chocolate cake that was so thin I
could see through it. I didn't even have to chew it, I just mashed
it up a bit with my tongue and swallowed. I couldn't even taste it,
but at least they thought of me.
</P>
<P>
   So now if I get a really special treat, I hide it from them. The
only problem is sometimes I forget where I hid it and by the time I
find it, it really is spoiled. Then I have to throw it away.
</P>
<P>
   You know, that is a little loony isn't it? Oh well.

WHAT'S THE TRUTH ABOUT DARYL HANNAH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I saw a special on Daryl Hannah that said something was wrong
with one of her hands. My husband swears otherwise. Who was right?
Say me, me, me. _ D.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Hannah has a shortened fingertip on one hand. Her publicist,
Alan Nierob, denied a recent report by Jeannette Walls of MSNBC
that the actress wears a prosthetic for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something you would notice,'' Nierob said. ``I think
that it's a congenital condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Walls reported on Nov. 9 that the prosthetic came off on the set
of the ABC movie ``Rear Window'' and production stopped until it
could be located.
</P>
<P>
   Hannah, who turns 38 on Dec. 3, is currently filming
``Diplomatic Siege'' in Romania with Peter Weller and director
Gustavo Graef Marino. Fans can write to her in care of Chuck
Binder, 1465 Linda Crest Drive, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90210.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was in the Navy with Lance LeGault. Lately he has been the
narrator of a few TNN productions and had roles on ``Magnum P.I.''
and ``The A-Team.'' How can I write to him? _ R.G., via the
Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to LeGault in care of the Tisherman Agency, 6767 Forest
Lawn Drive, Suite 101, Los Angeles, Calif. 90068.
</P>
<P>
   LeGault, a one-time movie stand-in for Elvis Presley, has
appeared in more than 50 films and TV shows. He most recently
portrayed ``Elder God of Fire'' in the film ``Mortal Kombat:
Annihilation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop the Movement,'' a collection of country songs by LeGault,
is available by mail order from Shock Records, 16105-8H Victory
Blvd., Suite 382, Van Nuys, Calif. 91406. The price is $10 plus $2
shipping and handling, and checks should be payable to ``Lance
LeGault Inc.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did the term ``hard-wired'' come into use? _ R.J.,
Houston
</P>
<P>
   A: The term was coined in the late 1960s, shortly after
``hardware'' and ``software'' were adopted as references to
computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Hardware dates to the 16th century as a way to describe the
mechanical equipment required to perform an activity.
``Hard-wired'' originally referred to an element of an electronic
circuit that was determined by the wiring and could not be changed,
according to the Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing.
</P>
<P>
   It has been extended to refer to ``anything that is not
modifiable.'' The On-Line Dictionary is available on the World Wide
Web at nightflight.com/foldoc.  &QL;

ALICE WHO? IT'S TIME WE ALL KNEW HER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Book Awards have a 60-year history without having
gained much attention. They were initiated as a reaction against
the literary Pulitzer Prizes, most pointedly the fiction award so
constrained by terms of Joseph Pulitzer's last will and testament.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzers remain America's literary awards of highest
visibility, but even the National Book Critics Circle's annual
awards _ dating only to 1975 _ had surpassed the National Book
Awards in general interest until ...
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, when Charles Frazier's ``Cold Mountain'' took
the fiction award in what was loudly reported as an upset, because
Don DeLillo's ``Underworld'' was the prefigured favorite. Yet I was
delighted, overjoyed that Frazier won for his very first novel.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's another upset.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1998 National Book Award winners were announced on
Wednesday, it seemed the whole world was anticipating victory for
Tom Wolfe, whose ``A Man in Full,'' published only this month,
approximates the most hyped literary event of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   I would have been disappointed if Wolfe had taken the prize. For
all its felicities, his corpulent novel has some liabilities that
are being articulated in a second wave of criticism after the
initial raves. I would not have been disappointed if the
also-nominated Robert Stone, a previous winner, had triumphed again
with ``Damascus Gate,'' a masterwork more seriously constituted
than Wolfe's opus.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't have known what to think if either of two other
fiction nominees had won the judges' endorsement _ Allegra Goodman
for ``Kaaterskill Falls,'' Gayl Jones for ``The Healing'' _ but I
certainly would have been surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning that the new ``upset'' winner is Alice McDermott
for ``Charming Billy,'' I was somewhat surprised but more elated. I
really wanted McDermott to win, for the needed recognition it can
bring her, and because ``Charming Billy'' is as strong in its own
way as the quite different ``Damascus Gate,'' if no higher on the
qualitative scale.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Frazier was a phenomenon from out of nowhere, but Alice
McDermott has been around. She is one of those authors deservedly
adored by critics, who compare her (favorably) with the great
William Trevor. But critics have not succeeded in winning for her
the constituency that still sniffs after great novels.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott isn't one to crank them out. She devotes several years
to each project; and her score, if I have it right, is four runs,
four hits, no errors. I missed her well-praised apprentice work,
``A Bigamist's Daughter'' (1982), but caught up with her next, the
beautifully crafted ``That Night'' (1987). Anyone mistaking
McDermott for a newcomer should be advised that she was a National
Book Award nominee 11 years ago, and a tattling juror revealed that
she almost won for ``That Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Her entry for 1992 _ ``At Weddings and Wakes,'' which I reviewed
_ is every bit as prize-worthy. And with that novel, it became
apparent that McDermott has her own literary preserve. She is the
prose poet of Irish-Americans living in and around New York but
still tied spiritually to the Auld Sod.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't have thought McDermott could improve either on ``That
Night'' or ``At Weddings and Wakes,'' but ``Charming Billy''
somehow transcends both. It is her richest work in character,
incident and action, and it emits an even stronger Irish aroma than
do its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Billy indeed is a charmer when sober, but that isn't often
enough, and thwarted love has knocked him off the wagon. It isn't
revealing too much that Billy has drunk himself to death, too
young, and that the fabric of the novel concerns the efforts of his
bereaved family and friends to come to terms with his tragic life.
Yet the novel itself is affirmative and triumphant in its loving
embrace of raffish humanity.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations, Alice McDermott. You're here to stay.

MOM SAYS BYE-BYE LEFTOVERS, HELLO BAD MOOD

<TEXT>
<P>
   I found a bag of cookies in my kitchen today. Old, stale
cookies. They were in a lower cabinet, behind the crockpot I never
use. The bag was open, but only three of the chocolate chip treats
had been eaten.
</P>
<P>
   How did a bag of cookies live and die in a household with two
rapidly growing males and one snack-happy dad? Well, I ate the
three cookies and hid the bag from them, that's how. I just forgot
where I hid them until now. Wait, let me explain. I am not crazy.
</P>
<P>
   It all starts with that simple question, ``Are you going to eat
that?''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, not often, but sometimes I only eat half of my
sandwich and then I gingerly wrap the other half in plastic wrap
intent on finishing it off at a later date. Or perhaps, I decide
that life will go on if I don't actually eat my way through the
entire pint of chocolate ice cream in one sitting. It might be any
morsel of food or drink left over from my meal. Invariably, before
it reaches the temperature of the refrigerator, one of the boys
wants to know if I'm going to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I say. ``Yes, I'm going to eat MY leftovers. It's good
food and I plan to finish it when I become hungry again. I don't
mean to be greedy but we each had an individual serving and you
have already eaten yours. This is mine. In the unlikely event that
I change my mind, you will have the right of first refusal.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when I look in the refrigerator, my food is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who ate the biscuit and half of a cocktail wiener that I was
saving for lunch?'' I query.
</P>
<P>
   My husband responds, ``Oh, did you want that? It's been in there
forever. It was going to spoil like that turkey last
Thanksgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just ate breakfast an hour ago. I don't even think that
biscuits can spoil. Why did you eat my food without asking me
first?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that my soft drink next to you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. It's flat anyway. Do you want it back?''
</P>
<P>
   Geez.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I bought these dried-out, awful-tasting, dehydrated banana
slices. I didn't even like them but I figured that no one else
would either, so at least when I got ready for a snack, they would
still be in the cabinet. Wrong. A week later, I went to grab a
handful and the bag was in the pantry completely empty.
</P>
<P>
   I was livid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to my bananas!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Mom, those were awful. We ate them for you but we could
barely swallow them. We had to drink some of your diet tea to get
them down. Don't ever buy those again.''
</P>
<P>
   After I ranted and raved about that for a week, they devised
this method of making sure that I get a sample of everything. Last
week, they left me a slice of chocolate cake that was so thin I
could see through it. I didn't even have to chew it, I just mashed
it up a bit with my tongue and swallowed. I couldn't even taste it,
but at least they thought of me.
</P>
<P>
   So now if I get a really special treat, I hide it from them. The
only problem is sometimes I forget where I hid it and by the time I
find it, it really is spoiled. Then I have to throw it away.
</P>
<P>
   You know, that is a little loony isn't it? Oh well.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. _ Maria Elena Buszek, self-described nerdy
graduate student who reads comic books, recalls having a drink in a
Chicago bar when her eyes were drawn to a pinup girl tattooed on
the arm of the bartender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He slammed my bourbon down in front of me, and I grabbed his
wrist and said, `That's a gorgeous Petty Girl.' He said, `Everybody
thinks it's a Varga,' and I said, `No, there's a difference.'''
</P>
<P>
   That difference has been a consuming interest since 1994,
shortly after Ms. Buszek arrived at the University of Kansas on a
graduate fellowship in art history and learned that the
university's Spencer Museum of Art was the repository of a
matchless collection of the original airbrushed watercolors of
pinup art published by Esquire magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The impossibly perfect females created by Alberto Vargas
(editors at Esquire made him drop the ``s'' when signing his work
because they thought it sounded like a possessive), George Petty
and others accompanied American men through the depths of the
Depression and to the battlefronts of World War II and Korea. Bob
Hope was once quoted as saying, ``Our American troops are ready to
fight at the drop of an Esquire.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of how to handle a collection that has the potential
to embarrass a serious art museum but is admired by some people as
magnificent art produces consternation and a touch of defensiveness
among Ms. Buszek's elders at the helm of the Spencer, people with a
little gray in their hair and sensibilities shaped by the 1960s and
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   The question has come up off and on in the 18 years since
Esquire donated its archives to the university, but it has acquired
more currency with the rising prices such art brings at auctions
and in galleries. Rough estimates indicate that the approximately
300 pinup pieces at the Spencer _ about half of them by Vargas _
may be worth $10 million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials ask themselves whether to seek grants for a
major exhibition of the material with scholarly analyses and a
hundred color reproductions. Should they lend it to commercial
galleries or let a Japanese aficionado mount a touring exhibition
and _ Heaven forbid _ make a profit for both himself and the
museum? Or should they keep it tucked away in its temperature- and
light-controlled vault, available only for scholarly study?
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Goddard, senior curator of prints and drawings, who has
primary responsibility for the collection, has maintained a policy
of making it available not only to scholars but also to those who
make pilgrimages to this campus atop the steep bluffs of the Kaw
River.
</P>
<P>
   ``One family that came from California was in fashion design,''
he said. ``They were interested in Varga art from the standpoint of
shoes and apparel. A number of people are interested in the art for
design reasons. Some embroider it on leather jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, he noted, are into nostalgia and admire the Esquire
Collection as the inspiration for pinups painted on the noses of
aircraft in World War II. They are especially thrilled by the
original of Petty's ``Memphis Belle,'' which adorned the noses of
many bombers. One of the few times the Spencer lent its pinup art
was for the opening of a new hangar at the Memphis Belle Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people see it as great art,'' Goddard said. ``One man
said, `You want to tell me that Michelangelo was a great artist,
but for me this is better.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Esquire pinups are also a major source of inspiration for
tattoo artists and those who wear tattoos, like Simon Worman, a
Lawrence man with a red-haired January 1946 Varga Girl tattooed on
his left arm and another on his back. Worman, who plans to manage a
new tattoo parlor in Lawrence, said he first went to the museum to
look at some of the Varga Girls after buying a calendar with a
reproduction of the January 1946 pinup and noticing that the
Spencer Museum, just a block from his house, was credited as the
source.
</P>
<P>
   What he and other visitors see are watercolors on paper varying
in size from 15 by 20 inches to 26 by 39 inches, sometimes with
traces of rubber cement and other elements used to prepare them for
reproduction and printing. The first pinup Vargas did for Esquire,
in 1940, depicts a woman with blond hair stretched out in bed in a
short black nightgown talking on the telephone. Others show
curvaceous young women in Navy blues or other kinds of military
dress, including one as George Washington in flowing cape.
Skin-tight short shorts and negligees are favored. A cowgirl in
bright blue shorts brandishes two six-shooters.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists drew pinups for Esquire after it began publication
in 1933 as a magazine aimed at affluent men with a taste for
stylish clothes and beautiful women, but George Petty emerged from
the pack early. By 1940, Esquire thought he was demanding too much
money, so it brought in Alberto Vargas, a Peruvian-born artist who
had already made a name drawing the stars of Florenz Ziegfeld's
shows. Vargas left Esquire in 1946, put the ``s'' back on his last
name, and did illustrations for other media, including Playboy in
the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Meisel, who owns the New York gallery bearing his name and
who is co-author of ``The Great American Pinup,'' said the works by
Vargas are probably worth from $10,000 to $75,000 each, those by
Petty from $10,000 to $20,000, and the others $5,000 to $10,000
each. ``This is a very, very hot and strong sector of American
art,'' said Meisel, whose gallery (at 141 Prince Street) is having
an exhibition of works by five pinup artists, including Vargas and
Petty. (The show closes Saturday.)
</P>
<P>
   To the 27-year-old Ms. Buszek, Varga Girls _ she prefers them
over the work of Petty _ are nothing short of feminist icons. In
her ``third-wave feminist'' view, pinups are ``an all-purpose icon
for the sassy, tough, punk-rock, sexy woman.'' The pinup, she
argues, was a major weapon in World War II, a ``modern war
goddess.'' Although she originally intended to do her doctoral
dissertation on a ``dead European guy'' (the 19th-century Spanish
artist Mariano Fortuny y Carbo), she now intends to analyze and
defend pinup art from a feminist perspective.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But Andrea Norris, the director of the Spencer Museum and a
generation older, revealed something about the gap in thinking on
the subject as she walked back and forth in front of a selection of
the works that Goddard had hung on the walls of a prints study
room. ``To think,'' she said with a tone of disbelief, ``these are
the sort of figures that when I was 10 years old we aspired to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   The pinup art arrived at the University of Kansas in about 9
tons of material from the archives of Esquire, most of it
camera-ready art for production use, all donated in 1980 after the
magazine changed hands. Lee Young, a retired journalism professor
who represented the university in dealings with the magazine, said
Esquire executives selected the University of Kansas because of the
journalism school's first-issue magazine collection and its
designation as official repository for the Magazine Publishers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Young said that of the 40,000 pieces in the gift, probably
38,000 were ``little bits of editorial art'' that are stored on
campus. The other 2,000 or so pieces, including the pinup art, were
turned over to the Spencer, which stores and maintains them and
provides scholars the opportunity to peruse a card catalog of all
of the material.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pinup art, the collection includes 31
photographs by Diane Arbus from the 1960s, among them shots of
Blaze Starr in her living room; the aging Mae West in her frilly,
pink bedroom, and Jayne Mansfield with her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time,'' Young recalled, ``one of the people at Esquire
said he hoped pieces of the famous art wouldn't show up hanging in
deans' offices. I assured him that that would not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason very little of the pinup art has even been
seen hanging in the museum, Ms. Norris and Goddard said, is that
there is no curator on staff who feels competent to deal with it.
Ms. Norris specialized in Italian Renaissance sculpture when she
earned her doctorate at New York University; Goddard's specialty is
the Northern Renaissance and 16th-century history of prints. ``I
could be the facilitator of a show based on the Esquire
Collection,'' he said, ``but not the main essayist.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, both seem willing to try to reach across the generational
and cultural divides that separate them from the true fans of the
Esquire Collection, including the two long-haired undergraduate men
who confronted Ms. Norris at a recent reception and asked why a
show was not being done about ``an important cultural figure like
Vargas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason not to be comprehensive about what we permit
ourselves to consider as art,'' Ms. Norris said. ``If you include
illustration and design in art, then this falls in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Goddard said: ``It's art. There's no question about that. It's
simply a matter of how one perceives it and wishes to interpret it.
This work captures, in a maybe naive way, some of the
preoccupations of mid-century America and allows us to revisit that
time. It is much tamer than most people would imagine.''

   The idealized image of Thanksgiving is of generations of family
crowded around an 18-foot-long table laden with the fruits of our
combined labor: Cousin Liz's sweet potatoes, Aunt Mary's Jell-O
salad and Grandma's rich pumpkin pies.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of us, the family is a close-knit group of three or
four, or even two. There's no need for us to cook enough food to
feed the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. And there, indeed, lies another
reason to be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   With just a couple of hours in the kitchen, a feast (with plenty
of leftovers for the mandatory post-ballgame sandwiches) can
beautifully grace your table. Thanksgiving becomes an intimate,
more thoughtful affair.

<P>
   _ 1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 medium sweet onions, such as Maui or Vidalia, peeled, cut in
half from end to end, sliced
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   _ 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

   _ Sauteed fresh mushrooms; see note, optional
</P>
<P>
   _ Mashed potatoes; see note, optional
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 teaspoons chopped chives, optional for garnish
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: If desired, saute 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms (button,
shiitake or cremini) in 1 tablespoon butter and 1 teaspoon olive
oil on medium-high heat. Cook until mushrooms are softened and
lightly browned and liquid has evaporated. Season to taste with
garlic salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   This dish is great served on mashed potatoes. Make them your
favorite way, but use less butter. Instead, add some prepared
horseradish, about 2 teaspoons per 3 pounds of potatoes.

   Heat oil in a large, nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Add
onions and brown, stirring occasionally, about 5-7 minutes. Add
thyme, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar and pepper. Stir to
combine. Place turkey, skin side up, in a 9-inch square baking pan.
Pour onion mixture on top, so that some stays on top of turkey and
some falls into the pan. Pour broth around turkey. Cover loosely
with aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake 30-45 more minutes, or
until an instant-read thermometer reads 170 degrees when inserted
into the thickest part of the turkey breast. Allow turkey to rest
10 minutes. Cut into slices.
</P>
<P>
   PRESENTATION: If using, spoon potatoes on platter. Place sliced
turkey on top, overlapping slightly like a fan. Spoon sauce on top.
If desired, top with sauteed mushrooms and sprinkle with chives.

EATING WELL: BUT WITHOUT BUTTER OR CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: recipe and sidebar in 2nd take)  
 (bl)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Drew Nieporent's original concept for the menu at the
restaurant he is planning to open on East 49th Street was true
fat-free food. The chef he hired to create the menu, Michel
Nischan, tried to please. Eventually, he conceded defeat. Thank
goodness.
</P>
<P>
   With some exceptions, food needs a little fat. And Nischan _ who
was well known throughout Connecticut for his own restaurant, Miche
Mache, in South Norwalk _ has finally created a menu that lies
somewhere between spa cuisine and contemporary cooking, which is
finished off with more than a dab of butter. His food calls for a
little oil and uses inventive means of flavoring that are
alternatives to butter and cream.
</P>
<P>
   The development of this food, from idea to menu, has been an
interesting journey, one in which I participated from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Nieporent has named the restaurant Heartbeat _ as in what you
can expect on a regular basis if your arteries remain unclogged.
Heartbeat, in a new ``spa'' hotel, W New York, is to open Dec. 7 at
149 E. 49th St. Nieporent has to hope the restaurant's name does
not suggest the butter substitute. Or spa cooking.
</P>
<P>
   My first visit to Nischan's laboratory _ the kitchen at Tribeca
Bakery _ took place at the beginning of June, when he was up to his
elbows in vegetable juices and raw vegetable tartares. The
discussion at that point was less about taste and enjoyment than
about his search for organic products and the nutrient content of
rutabaga syrup.
</P>
<P>
   The food that I sampled certainly had miles to go. In place of
fat-laden sauces, there were combinations of juices from corn and
peas, carrots and beets, artichokes and, yes, those rutabagas.
Sometimes the resulting melange took on a muddy color; sometimes
there were just too many ingredients; at other times it just tasted
thin and bland. Think bad spa food.
</P>
<P>
   Nischan was not shy about his failures. But by the third visit,
in the middle of September, a new cooking philosophy was beginning
to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest for a kitchen without the usual cornstarch, potato
starch or roux for thickening, Nischan had carried Jean-Georges
Vongerichten's pioneering work with vegetable broths several steps
further. Sweet potatoes, corn, beets, rutabagas and sugar snap and
English peas are juiced and then allowed to sit so that the starch
separates from the liquid and sinks to the bottom. The amount of
time the juices rest depends on the level of starch the chef wants
the liquid to retain. Tree fruits like quinces, Granny Smith apples
and pears are similarly treated.
</P>
<P>
   When some of these vegetable and fruit liquids are cooked, they
thicken naturally. Some are further reduced, depending on how they
will be used, and others are used without thickening. Usually the
liquids are combined with other ingredients to make a sauce: the
apple and pear juices, for instance, are mixed with chicken stock,
caramelized shallots and a shaving of ginger to sauce seared
chicken. The result is as smooth as anything finished with butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become very comfortable with the cuisine,'' Nischan said.
``I feel strongly about no butter, no cream. It's been tough, but
if you mount a dish with butter, you take away from it, you round
it out too much.'' The leftover pulp is added to breakfast breads
and muffins for the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Nischan has come up with some delicious inventions _ light but
suffused with flavor. This is clean, bright cooking: you feel
satisfied but not stuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm taking a risk because I know there are people who
are going to come gunning for us,'' Nischan said. ``People like
Julia Child and Jacques Pepin hate the health police. And I hate
the health police, too. They get carried away. A lot of people have
called and said, `Oh, you are going to be a health-food
restaurant,' and that's scary. This is a restaurant where you can
go and feel comfortable that you are indulging but you are not
paying as high a price.''
</P>
<P>
   So the butter and cream, the saturated fats, are gone, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not where desserts are concerned. Although half of the dessert
menu is Nischan's new Heartbeat fare, the other half is as decadent
as chocolate mousse with a center of creme brulee.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBARS FOLLOW in 2nd TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Using juices in place of flour, butter or other thickeners takes
lots of culinary skill. But if you want to experiment, here are a
few basics:
</P>
<P>
   _ Juices can be bought at natural food stores. And juicers for
home use can be had for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   _ When buying vegetables to juice, be sure they are extremely
fresh; if your vegetables have a wax coating, peel them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The vegetables Michel Nischan uses can be divided into three
categories: those that have starch, like corn, sweet and white
potatoes, parsnips and English peas; root vegetables like
rutabagas, golden beets, turnips and carrots, and those that
produce a clear liquid, like celery, asparagus and sugar snap peas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The starchy and root vegetables are best suited for use as
thickeners. Clear juices will brighten broths that are used in
place of sauces.
</P>
<P>
   The pulp of the root vegetables can replace 15 to 25 percent of
the flour in muffins or flat breads.

   SANTA CRUZ, Calif. _ He was the Peter Pan and Ariel of wine; a
man who described one of his own commentaries as ``a critique of
pure riesling,'' and who advised on a label that ``this wine will
accommodate all manner of game and wild beasts, including the
sloth.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Randall Grahm _ for who else could it be _ has not left us.
But he has gone, as they say here in the land of carrot juice and
the flapping sandal, to another plane.
</P>
<P>
   Grahm, if you have just tuned in, is the winemaker and wordsmith
who in 1993 founded Bonny Doon Vineyard in the hills just north of
Santa Cruz. In the years since, he has garnered a reputation as one
of the country's more imaginative winemakers, a tireless innovator
in the cellar and vineyard, and one of the cleverest wine writers.
</P>
<P>
   With Le Cigare Volant, his now famous wine, he set the style for
the Rhone Rangers, a group of young winemakers dedicated to the
principle that the California wine country resembles the Rhone
Valley more than it does Bordeaux and that its wines should reflect
this.
</P>
<P>
   Le Cigare Volant, or flying cigar, pays homage to
Chateauneuf-du-Pape, in the southern Rhone, where in 1954, the town
council passed a law forbidding flying saucers, or cigars as they
called them, from landing there. Since then, Grahm points out, none
has.
</P>
<P>
   But put all this on hold: there is a new Randall Grahm. Or so it
would seem. Gone, for the moment, at least, is the insouciance, the
lightness of being, the outrageous puns, as in: ``This brandy to be
taken eternally,'' ``One hundred years of Soledad,'' ``Lafite do
your stuff'' and ``Absinthe makes the Art Garfunkel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, are the long parodies in his newsletter of Baudelaire
(``Les Fleurs du Malvasia'') and T.S. Eliot (``The Love Song of J.
Alfred Rootstock'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bureaus of Florid Prose and Adjectiveorhea have both been
indefinitely closed for renovation,'' is how Grahm put it.
</P>
<P>
   What now seems evident about him is not self-doubt, but a great
deal of introspection and perhaps a slight sulfurous whiff, not of
the vinous type but of burnout.
</P>
<P>
   An objective observer would have to say, ``with good reason.''
First, there was the loss of his vineyard. Most Bonny Doon fans _
and they are legion _are unaware that Pierce's disease, an
insect-borne killer, wiped out the main vineyard in 1995. ``By the
time we realized it was there, it was too late,'' Grahm said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other Bonny Doon vineyards near Soledad in Monterey
County, southeast of Santa Cruz, where the vines are healthy, and
there are grapes that can be bought from vineyards everywhere.
There have to be such other routes when you are experimenting with
30 varieties and selling some three dozen different wines.
</P>
<P>
   But the original barn-like winery is shuttered most of the time,
except for Grahm's office upstairs, where he often works perched on
a large rubber ball (``Good for the spine,'' he said). But the soul
of the venture, the vineyard in the redwoods, is no more.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the problem with a planned third winery. (His
second winery, in downtown Santa Cruz, is in a seedy industrial
park populated principally by matt-haired dudes making surfboards.)
A year ago, Grahm announced that he would purchase an old winery
and vineyard in the Livermore Valley, east of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Then doubts set in. At one point, he hired a feng shui master,
Dr. Wu, from Los Angeles to check out the suitability of the
Livermore site. Dr. Wu said the site was ``very good for a
graveyard.''
</P>
<P>
   But his opinion wasn't the problem. ``I fear I may have been
done in by my eternal archnemesis, that old committment thing,''
Grahm reflected. To bolster his own hypothesis, he noted that at
45, he is still not married even though he would like to be, or
thinks he would like to be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   With the old vineyard and the putative new winery both history,
it was inevitable that Grahm turn his inner light to his _ and
everyone else's _ wines. He has become an almost fanatical exponent
of the European principle of terroir, the idea that a great wine is
the product of soil, climate and weather, and that the winemaker's
duty is to let nature take its course and not foul things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Old World,'' he said, ``winegrowing is the process of
uncovering the expressiveness of the vineyard and the varietal.''
In this country, he believes, the process has barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wine gestalt is an interplay between surface and depth,''
he said. ``We in this country can polish the surface, but it's a
facade; we haven't got the depth. Fortunately, most people like the
surface. The marketing people tell us the wines are selling well,
but don't we in the small hours have the feeling that we are really
putting one over on tout le monde?''
</P>
<P>
   To find the depth he feels American wines lack, Grahm
experiments with obscure grape varieties. He long ago abandoned the
accepted standards _ cabernet sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay.
``We live in a chard- and cabocentric world,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has been a pioneer in working with the Rhone
varieties like syrah, grenache, mourvedre, marsanne and roussanne.
More recently, he has worked with Italian and Spanish varieties,
the Portuguese grapes used in port, and less familiar French grapes
like pinot meunier.
</P>
<P>
   Currently he is intrigued by tannat, the grape of Madiran, a
wine of Southwest France. ``It makes a hard wine in France,'' he
said, ``but a rich, soft wine in Uruguay.'' There is already a
Bonny Doon Madiran, but it isn't easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   Grahm's own future is unclear. Bonny Doon goes on, possibly in a
new Santa Cruz winery. He is thinking about a sabbatical of sorts,
possibly at the feet of Nicolas Joly at Savennieres in the Loire
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Joly, who makes the s white wine known as Coulee de Serrant, is
the leading proponent of biodynamics, a system of holistic
agriculture developed by the Austrian philosopher Rudolph Steiner.
Biodynamism takes organic farming to its extreme. Planting and
pruning are timed to the position of the planets, harvest time is
determined by the phases of the moon, and vines get homeopathic
treatments rather than fertilizer and insecticides. More and more
of France's and Italy's best winemakers use some or all of
biodynamic methods.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for us, Grahm takes enough time out from wrestling
with his muse to make good wine. Though his Le Cigare Volante is
his best known, his zinfandel, which he named Cardinal Zin, is, in
his words, ``pure sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   In his line of Italian-style wines, Ca' del Solo, one of them,
``Il Pescatore,'' is a delicious white. His Pacific Rim riesling
actually includes about 20 percent of wine from Germany. As Grahm
notes, ``The heart has its rieslings.''
</P>
<P>
   Domaine des Blagueurs is a syrah from France. Then there are the
eaux de vie in a variety of flavors, several vins glaciers, or
California ice wines, and a couple of dynamite grappas.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that good things emanate from Bonny Doon and
when Grahm is back in the groove, there'll be more: wines to match
or surpass a 1994 pinot noir he called ``a bridge over truffled
waters,'' a 1995 sauvignon blanc virtually guaranteed to ``enhance
your capacity to wonder'' and a nonvintage Clos de Gilroy
(grenache) ``wonderful with grilled n'importe quoi.''

A FRESH BEAUJOLAIS NOUVEAU SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Beaujolais Nouveau 1998, Georges Duboeuf. About $9, by
air delivery; $7 beginning Dec. 1, delivered by ship.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ On the eve of the release of the 1998 Beaujolais
Nouveau, some Americans were in the Caves Esteve, one of this
city's better wine shops, pleading with the owner, Jean-Christophe
Esteve, for a taste of the new wine.
</P>
<P>
   The Beaujolais Nouveau is always released on the third Thursday
of November. ``Come back at midnight,'' he told them, smiling.
``Maybe I can do something for you then.''
</P>
<P>
   To sell the wine before its official release date can cost the
seller almost $250 a bottle in fines. Parties welcoming the wine
began at midnight, but most Parisians had their first nouveau
sighting last Thursday morning on their way to work: every cafe and
supermarket had the sign, ``The Nouveau has arrived.'' Prices were
about $3 to $6.
</P>
<P>
   The wine, as always, is fresh, fruity and easy to drink. The
1998 season was not a great one in Beaujolais; there was plenty of
rain, which means lots of chaptalization, or adding sugar to the
fermentation to boost alcohol content.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the color is good _ purplish-red _ and the bouquet is
more that of juice than of wine, with the touch of banana that the
winemakers insist isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   George Duboeuf's version is perennially good and easy to find.
Among others that should be available in the United States, I
enjoyed one by Louis Tete and another by Jaffelin. If you don't buy
your Thanksgiving wine until the last minute, you might try new
``Bojo.'' Or a good 1997 Beaujolais, like Duboeuf's Julienas, at
about the same price.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Alfredo Aldaco is writing a novel that
he believes all of his native Argentina should read. But the book
by the former director of Argentina's Banco de la Nacion is not
about his country's bold experiment with a currency board or his
experience at the helm of the nation's largest and most powerful
bank. With the working title I am not Innocent, it is a tale about
a bank director who illegally accepts millions of dollars to
approve a major computer contract with a powerful U.S. company that
breaks the rules when doing business abroad. Set against a backdrop
of impunity and corruption at the highest levels of government and
business, the main character confesses, only to incite the wrath of
the country's leading spin-doctors and top political operatives.
 &HT;    What makes Aldaco's book a must-read is that it is based on a
true story. His story.
 &HT;    In real life it's called the ``IBM/Banco de la Nacion affair,''
in which IBM Argentina, a subsidiary of the U.S. computing giant,
allegedly funneled US$21 million dollars in kickbacks to secure a
$249 million contract to network the sprawling branch operations of
Banco de la Nacisn, Argentina's largest state-run bank. So far, 30
people have been indicted, including the former president and
former chief financial officer of IBM Argentina. Earlier this year,
Aldaco and one other bank director admitted to accepting bribes
totaling $4.5 million, while investigators have uncovered more than
half a dozen bank accounts suspected to hold illicit funds.
Prosecutors say they believe the money trail leads to IBM's U.S.
corporate headquarters and they have issued arrest warrants for two
current and two former officials from U.S.-based IBM Latin America.
For its part, IBM vehemently denies that regional executives had
any part in the affair. ``IBM does not participate in bribery of
local officials or do business with companies that do that,'' says
official IBM Latin America spokesman Fred McNeese.
 &HT;    The murky rivers of corruption run deep in Argentina. The media
makes a near-daily meal of the latest erupting scandal and foreign
executives working in the country say that the only change in the
environment is that would-be extortionists have become more
shameless. The question facing any firm that decides to do business
here is how to confront the kickback culture. A multinational like
IBM-bound by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its status as
a founding member of the anti-corruption business group
Transparency International and its own corporate ethics code-faces
a deeper challenge: how to ensure that the entire organization is
playing by rules set at the top.
 &HT;    Recently, that has been a challenge for Big Blue. Aside from the
Banco de la Nacisn case, other IBM contracts are also under review
by the Argentine Congress and prosecutors. In Mexico, IBM recently
paid $11.5 million to settle charges of fraud in a contract to
install a system for the Mexico City District Attorney's office.
And in another incident, IBM's Russian subsidiary pleaded guilty to
17 felony charges of violating U.S. export-control laws. In each
case, IBM headquarters admitted to no wrongdoing and no evidence
has been traced back to executives at corporate headquarters.
 &HT;    A look at the events in the IBM/Banco de la Nacion scandal
raises questions of whether IBM is doing enough to ensure that the
rules on the books are the rules in force.
 &HT;    The Banco de la Nacion affair started in January, 1991, when the
bank's board of directors hired Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, the U.S.
consultants, to determine the best way to modernize the bank's
antiquated information systems. At the time, the bank had 500
branches, but only 50 were linked through a common computer
network. Another 150 had individual systems that forced each bank
to work as a separate entity, while 300 branches ran with manual
accounting systems. The bank was, and continues to be, Argentina's
largest.
 &HT;    By mid-1992, Booz, Allen produced a report that proposed to
overhaul communications by linking all branch offices on an
electronic network. U.S. accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche
supervised a public bidding for the mega-modernization plan, which
came to be known as the Century Project. Three firms submitted
proposals _ IBM Argentina, Impsat and TTI, all based in Argentina _
and, in February 1994, the project was awarded to IBM Argentina,
whose bid of $249 million included a central software system called
Hogan, named after a U.S. software developer, Hogan International.
 &HT;    In the months leading up to the bid, according to Aldaco, key
executives within Banco de la Nacion had engaged in a contentious
debate over whether the Hogan software system was the best for the
bank. At the beginning of 1993, bank officials visited foreign
banks in other countries, including Canada, Mexico, Portugal,
Spain, and the United States, to study various information systems.
Besides the Hogan solution championed by IBM, another option was on
the table. The alternative project called for separate bids for the
five major components of the system: central hardware, central
software, branch hardware, branch software and training. Based on
their findings, the board of directors agreed at a meeting held
June 11, 1993, that Hogan was not the system they wanted. Aldaco
now says he favored the alternative, which would have cost the bank
between $80-$90 million. He says the board rejected IBM's Hogan
system because some of the banks visited by directors had run into
serious complications with the installation and customization of
Hogan. Also, the directors had apparently not decided exactly how
they wanted to centralize the bank's data processing.
 &HT;    Then, according to Aldaco, less than a week after this decision,
Aldo Dadone, the president of the bank, called Aldaco into his
office and told him that Domingo Cavallo, then the powerful economy
minister and a close political ally to Dadone, had insisted that
the bank use the Hogan system. Dadone then sent Aldaco to Spain and
Portugal to reassess the use of Hogan in other banks. Aldaco
returned within a week, again with a negative report. Dadone
ignored the report, and a heated debate ensued between Carlos
Thomson, the head of systems, and Dadone, the bank president. The
Hogan system prevailed, and Thomson was transferred to another
section of the bank. ``We were told that we were showing a lack of
respect [toward Cavallo]. The reality was, if you didn't like
Cavallo's decision, you had to leave the bank,'' Aldaco says.
 &HT;    Cavallo vigorously denies Aldaco's version of the story [see
sidebar]. But in his book, El Peso de la Verdad (The Weight of the
Truth), Cavallo writes that he had seen the Hogan system in
operation at Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia and that he was
enthusiastic about the Century Project.
 &HT;    One month after IBM Argentina had been approved for the project,
another meeting took place, this time between Aldaco and Marcelo
Cattaneo, a ruling party insider and the president of Consad, an
Argentine information-technology consulting firm subcontracted by
IBM to provide components of the overall modernization project.
``[Cattaneo] said he knew I was bothered by the project and offered
me $3 million dollars, deposited directly into a Swiss bank account
to see that the project went smoothly,'' says Aldaco. ``And sadly,
I took the money.''
 &HT;    Apparently, Cattaneo was making the rounds. Genaro Contartese,
another former Banco de la Nacion director, also admitted to
receiving $1.5 million.
 &HT;    The directors' confessions came earlier this year, but the
entire case may have remained undiscovered had not a routine tax
audit revealed that an obscure local company called Capacitacion y
Computacion Rural (CCR) received $21 million dollars in checks from
IBM Argentina. CCR, in turn, had a dead man and a waitress on their
payroll. The revelation prompted an investigation.
 &HT;    CCR was a relatively new company on the Argentine technology
scene, spun off from Consad between 1992 and 1993. A year later
Consad sold CCR a management software program called SBL for $1
million, though at this point the company had no clients and no
work history.
 &HT;    Digging away at the relationship between IBM, Consad and CCR
became the main task of federal Judge Adolfo Bagnasco. The young,
loquacious, and, some charge, politically ambitious judge was
assigned to the case midway through 1994, one year after the $249
million contract was awarded to IBM Argentina.
 &HT;    He originally set out to discover how Banco de la Nacion and
Deloitte &AMP; Touche selected IBM's Hogan system. Two technical
experts were asked to evaluate the original contract; they
determined that it was overvalued by up to $100 million and that no
mention of CCR or installation of a backup computer system appeared
in the document.
 &HT;    However, further investigation showed that IBM's first
disbursement of funds, $21 million, went to CCR, supposedly to pay
for a backup computer system. ``When you purchase a car, you don't
first go purchase a backup car,'' says Aldaco. ``IBM did not buy
all the [principal] hardware and software first. The first payment
was for an alternative system. This was payment of the bribes.''
 &HT;    Indeed, the payment was the beginning of a financial labyrinth
for investigators, so complicated that the judge has to draw a flow
chart outlining a hazy web of offshore bank accounts and money
transfers. According to Bagnasco, IBM Argentina deposited two
checks, one for $8 million and one for $13 million, into CCR's
account at the Argentine branch of Banco General de Negocios. The
$8 million was paid in cash to CCR's suppliers. The other $13
million went to an offshore bank called Compania General de
Negocios. From those funds, CCR paid Consad $3 million, which,
according to Bagnasco, disappeared. The remaining $10 million went
to the United States, with $1 million being deposited in Citibank
and $9 million traveling on to Switzerland's Bruxelles Lambert.
Half the Swiss funds were split into four accounts. Two of these
accounts belong to Banco de la Nacion's Aldaco, one to Contartese
and the fourth, says Bagnasco, to a friend of Aldaco.
 &HT;    The other $4.5 million passed through Luxembourg, and then
dispersed into five accounts: two in Switzerland, one in Uruguay
and two in the United States. Bagnasco has asked Swiss authorities
to verify whether the accounts belongs to Mario Dadone, the brother
of Banco de la Nacion's ex-president, and Walter de Fortuna,
another close ally of Domingo Cavallo. Bagnasco says he believes
that the Uruguayan account will be tied to Contartese, while the
owners of the two U.S. accounts _ one in MTB New York and one in
Brown B. Harriman &AMP; Co. _ remain unknown.
 &HT;    The judge's report alleges that IBM Argentina's $21 million
payment to CCR for a backup software system was actually a cover
for funneling bribes. According to the indictment, CCR received
checks from IBM for services that were never rendered.
 &HT;    Based on his findings, Bagnasco won 30 indictments on a first
round of fraud charges in April, 1996. Cited were three former IBM
Argentina officials, the entire Banco de la Nacion board of
directors, including former president Aldo Dadone, and several
employees from the Argentine office of Deloitte and Touche.
Cattaneo was also indicted, but the charges were later dropped. A
year later, Bagnasco won 10 more indictments on charges of bribery,
but a federal appeals judge ruled that the accused were being
charged twice for the same crime and threw out the latter charges.
That decision is under appeal.
 &HT;    In June 1996, Banco de la Nacion cancelled the project and
demanded an $82 million refund from IBM. IBM Argentina filed a
breach-of-contract suit demanding payment and damages, while
claiming that Banco de la Nacion continually changed the technical
specifications of the job.
 &HT;    The confessions of former bank directors Aldaco and Contartese
to accepting a total of $4.5 million as a gratuity for approving
IBM for the project came earlier this year and they add weight to
the judge's accusations of bribery.
 &HT;    Also this year, Bagnasco issued arrest warrants for two current
and two former IBM executives that were based in the United States
at the time of the incident. Robeli de Librero was the former
general manager of the Latin America division. He retired in 1995
after 35 years with the company. Peter Rowley was in charge of
marketing for the region and now heads IBM's small business unit.
Steven Lew was IBM's technical advisor to the Banco de la Nacion
contract and still works for the company. Marcelo Kaiser left IBM
in 1995 and now works for U.S. database firm Oracle in Brazil.
Bagnasco says all four are formal suspects in the case and has
demanded under a bilateral treaty between the United States and
Argentina that they be sent to Buenos Aires for questioning. IBM,
which makes public statements for the four, says that they are
willing to meet with investigators on U.S. soil.
 &HT;    At the heart of Bagnasco's inquiry is whether top IBM officials
knew that CCR was receiving funds from IBM Argentina. And on that
count, IBM officials in the United States are adamant. ``It boils
down to the specific question of whether Latin America headquarters
knew any money was going to CCR,'' says IBM Latin America region
spokesman Fred McNeese. ``We have found no indication written, oral
or otherwise that anyone in the United States knew that money was
going to CCR. Regional headquarters was never told.''
 &HT;    McNeese says regional executives were aware of the Banco de la
Nacion project and had received a list of sub-contractors that had
been hired. He says Consad appeared on the list, but that CCR did
not, and that officials at IBM Argentina were primarily responsible
for the details. The company undertook its own investigation after
allegations became public and decided that IBM's internal policies
had not been properly followed. Argentine subsidiary general
manager Ricardo Martorana and the unit's CFO resigned, while
operations head Gustavo Soriani left the company in relation to the
incident. ``Internal business procedures were not followed. And the
three people responsible are no longer with the company,'' says
McNeese. But he adds: ``The procedures were adequate.''
 &HT;    Were they?
 &HT;    Observers scoff at the idea that regional executives would not
know where nearly a tenth of a $249 million contract was going. IBM
has repeatedly denied that any employee outside of IBM Argentina
knew of wrongdoing. No evidence has surfaced suggesting otherwise.
 &HT;    What else were IBM's regional executives unaware of? Other IBM
contracts in Argentina are being reviewed by officials, including
irregularities discovered in a $513 million contract awarded
without a public bidding to install a network to monitor tax
payments and pension-fund contributions. Other cases with state
banks in the provinces are pending and a Congressional Commission
established in 1996 to investigate the awarding of government
contracts to IBM is still at work.
 &HT;    IBM is a company that has long held a good reputation for
corporate ethics. Employees must sign on to the firm's code of
conduct each year. An internal department is currently responsible
for vetting employees and business partners, foreign companies,
usually technology service providers, that act as authorized
dealers for IBM products. The resumes of prospective hires are
verified, but the company does not have any additional procedures
for investigating executives that will hold top management posts or
be responsible for handling finances.
 &HT;    Business partners go through financial and technical qualifiers
to make sure they have the wherewithal to carry out contracts. IBM
also checks out the companies' reputations and ethical standards.
Business partners are subject to routine, regular checks of these
requirements.
 &HT;    According to McNeese, sub-contractors working on IBM projects
are not subject to the same extent of ethical background checks
before assisting on a project under IBM's supervision. Consad and
CCR were both sub-contractors working under IBM Argentina's
authority. McNeese defends that policy: ``Contractors are hired to
do a specific project. There is not a relationship.''
 &HT;    But more than legal wrangling is at stake when companies do
business overseas. Getting tangled in a scandal is time-consuming
and costly, even if corporate officers are judgd innocent. Security
experts say investing in preventive measures makes business sense.
As corporations do more and more business overseas, knowing exactly
who the company is doing business with and communicating ethics is
key to maintaining standards, especially in countries where
corruption has become endemic. The consultants recommend aggressive
ethics education and training for employees, coupled with
sufficient amounts of due diligence on companies that will be
working alongside multinationals. ``You have to manage the issue,''
says Bruce Goslin, managing director of Kroll Associates, a U.S.
corporate-security consultancy. ``You want to create the
environment where it is understood that illegal actions are not
tolerated.''
 &HT;    IBM has announced some changes in the way it bids for contracts,
forbidding subsidiaries from competing for work that is not open to
a competitive bid process. And in Argentina, government contracts
will not be sought by IBM's subsidiary, though McNeese says the
decision comes from the company's desire to concentrate its
resources on potential private-sector growth. The company refused
to comment on whether its own investigation of the Banco de la
Nacion contract lead to procedural changes at IBM.
 &HT;    Companies looking to learn from the Banco de la Nacion affair
will start by making sure that they have the checks and balances in
place to transmit corporate ethics to the farthest reaches of
business activity. To do otherwise is to risk legal snares and
publicity pitfalls. After all, reputations are much easier to
destroy than to rebuild. ``No one has to pay a bribe,'' says Luis
Moreno, the Argentine representative of Transparency International
and a former prosecutor. ``What we learn from the IBM case is that
to pay a bribe might mean winning business, but it is a dangerous
business.''

   Flours: The Hard and the Soft
</P>
<P>
   Q: Often, recipes specify ``cake flour'' or ``bread flour.''
What are they? If I don't have them, can I substitute all-purpose
flour? And what is ``hard'' flour, which is called for in some
recipes? Is there such a thing as ``soft'' flour?
</P>
<P>
   A: For all intents and purposes, bread flour and hard flour are
the same thing. Ditto for cake flour and soft flour.
</P>
<P>
   Before all-purpose flour became ubiquitous, recipes for baked
goods often called for one specific type of flour, but that happens
only occasionally now.
</P>
<P>
   White wheat flours are categorized by their protein content.
Bread flour is ground from wheat that is especially high in
proteins, including those that make up gluten.
</P>
<P>
   When bread dough is kneaded, the gluten in the flour forms an
elastic network, or web, which traps the carbon dioxide gas given
off by the yeast. That is what causes the dough to rise. The more
gluten, the greater the bread dough's tendency to rise (provided
there is sufficient yeast activity), and the lighter the finished
loaf.
</P>
<P>
   Flour milled from low-protein strains of wheat has less gluten.
It is called soft flour, and is often marketed as ``cake'' or
``pastry'' flour, since it is perfect for mixing into tender,
delicate cake batter and pastry dough.
</P>
<P>
   All-purpose flour _ a mixture of hard and soft wheat flours _
has become a standard compromise in contemporary recipes. While it
can be used for most baked goods, it excels in none. However, when
a recipe calls for all-purpose flour, it means that the recipe has
been developed _ or at least tested _ using all-purpose flour, and
it is best to follow the recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   But if a recipe calls for cake flour and all you have is
all-purpose, you can make a fine substitute by mixing \ cup
cornstarch with } cup all-purpose flour for each cup of cake flour.
</P>
<P>
   If a recipe calls for bread flour and you have only all-purpose,
adding a tablespoon of gluten powder for every cup will help the
dough rise; it will also make multigrain breads lighter. (Gluten
flour is available in health food stores.)
</P>
<P>
   Another tip: When a recipe calls for cake flour, don't use the
self-rising kind. The added salt and leavening will throw off the
proportions and bake up into a tough-crumb cake.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    BUENOS AIRES _ Alfredo Aldaco esta escribiendo una novela que,
segun el, todos los argentinos deben leer. Pero el libro del ex
director del Banco de la Nacion de Argentina no tiene que ver con
el audaz experimento de su pais con una junta monetaria ni con su
experiencia al timon del banco mayor y mas poderoso del pais. La
novela, titulada provisionalmente No soy inocente, es sobre un
director de banco que acepta ilegalmente millones de dolares para
aprobar un importante contrato de computadoras con una poderosa
empresa norteamericana que rompe sus normas cuando hace negocios en
el extranjero. Con un trasfondo de impunidad y corrupcion a los mas
altos niveles del gobierno y el sector empresarial, el protagonista
confiesa, lo que despierta la ira de altos funcionarios y asesores
politicos.
 &HT;    Lo que convierte al libro de Aldaco en lectura obligada es que
se basa en una historia real: su propia historia.
 &HT;    En la vida real se le llama el ``caso IBM/Banco de la Nacion,''
en el que IBM Argentina, filial del gigante norteamericano de la
informatica, presuntamente canalizo US$21 millones en sobornos para
garantizar un contrato de US$249 millones para equipar las vastas
operaciones de sucursales del Banco de la Nacion, el mayor banco
estatal de Argentina. Hasta ahora se han instruido de cargos a 30
personas, incluidos el ex presidente y el ex director de Finanzas
de IBM Argentina. Anteriormente este ano, Aldaco y otro director
del banco admitieron haber aceptado sobornos por un total de US$4,5
millones, mientras los investigadores han descubierto mas de media
docena de cuentas bancarias donde se sospecha que hay fondos
ilicitos. Los fiscales creen que el rastro del dinero llega hasta
las oficinas centrales de IBM en Estados Unidos y han emitido
ordenes de arresto contra dos ejecutivos y dos ex funcionarios de
IBM Latin America en Estados Unidos. Por su parte, IBM niega con
vehemencia que los ejecutivos regionales tengan algo que ver con el
asunto. ``IBM no participa en el soborno de funcionarios locales ni
hace negocios con companias que practican ese tipo de actividad,''
afirma Fred McNeese, portavoz oficial de IBM Latin America.
 &HT;    La corrupcion esta muy arraigada en Argentina. Los medios de
prensa publican practicamente todos los dias noticias de escandalos
y los ejecutivos extranjeros que trabajan en el pais dicen que el
unico cambio en el ambiente es que los extorsionistas tienen menos
verguenza. La cuestion que encara toda empresa que decide hacer
negocios en Argentina es como hacer frente a la cultura del
soborno. Una multinacional como IBM (atada por la Ley de Practicas
Corruptas en el Extranjero, de Estados Unidos, por su condicion de
miembro fundador del grupo de empresas contra la corrupcion
conocido como Transparencia Internacional y por su propio codigo de
etica empresarial) enfrenta un desafio aun mayor: garantizar que
toda la organizacion se rija por las reglas establecidas en las
esferas mas elevadas.
 &HT;    Este ha sido un reto para IBM en los ultimos tiempos. Ademas del
caso de Banco de la Nacion, el Congreso y los fiscales argentinos
tambien revisan otros contratos de IBM. En Mexico, la empresa pago
hace poco US$11,5 millones para solucionar en acuerdo extrajudicial
acusaciones de fraude en un contrato para instalar un sistema en la
Procuraduria General de Justicia del Distrito Federal. En otro
incidente, la filial rusa de IBM se declaro culpable de 17 cargos
de infracciones graves de las leyes de control de exportaciones de
Estados Unidos. En estos casos, la sede central de IBM nego haber
cometido infraccion alguna y no hay pruebas que conduzcan a los
ejecutivos de la oficina central.
 &HT;    Un vistazo a los sucesos en el escandalo de IBM/Banco de la
Nacion hace que uno se pregunte si IBM hace lo necesario para hacer
cumplir sus normas.
 &HT;    El caso del Banco de la Nacion se remonta a enero de 1991,
cuando la junta directiva de la entidad contrato a la empresa
estadounidense de asesoria Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton para determinar
la mejor forma de modernizar los anticuados sistemas informaticos
del banco. En ese momento, el banco tenia 500 sucursales, pero solo
50 estaban enlazadas por una red comun de computadoras. Otras 150
tenian sistemas individuales que obligaban a cada sucursal a
trabajar como una entidad separada, mientras 300 sucursales
funcionaban con sistemas manuales de contabilidad. El banco era, y
es todavia, el mayor de Argentina.
 &HT;    Para mediados de 1992, Booz, Allen presento un informe que
proponia enlazar todas las sucursales en una sola red electronica.
La firma norteamericana Deloitte &AMP; Touche superviso una subasta
publica del plan de megamodernizacion, que llego a conocerse como
el Proyecto del Siglo. Tres empresas presentaron propuestas: IBM
Argentina, Impsat y TTI, todas con sede en Argentina, y en febrero
de 1994 el proyecto se otorgo a IBM Argentina, cuya oferta de
US$249 millones incluia un sistema de software central llamado
Hogan, de la firma estadounidense Hogan International.
 &HT;    En los meses anteriores a la licitacion, segun Aldaco, altos
ejecutivos del Banco de la Nacion sostuvieron fuertes debates para
determinar si el software Hogan era el mejor para el banco. A
principios de 1993, ejecutivos del banco visitaron bancos de
Canada, Mexico, Portugal, Espana, Estados Unidos y otros paises
para estudiar diversos sistemas informaticos. Ademas de la solucion
de Hogan que ofrecia IBM, habia otra opcion. El otro proyecto
proponia licitaciones separadas por las cinco partes principales
del sistema: el hardware central, el software central, el hardware
de las sucursales, el software de las sucursales y la capacitacion.
Sobre la base de sus estudios, en una reunion el 11 de junio de
1993 la junta de directores acordo que Hogan no era el sistema que
necesitaban. Aldaco dice ahora que el estaba a favor de la
alternativa, que le habria costado al banco entre US$80 y US$90
millones. Aldaco agrega que la junta rechazo el sistema Hogan de
IBM porque en varios bancos visitados por los directores su
instalacion y adaptacion habia creado complicaciones graves.
Ademas, al parecer los directores no habian decidido exactamente
como querian centralizar el procesamiento de datos del banco.
 &HT;    Entonces, segun Aldaco, menos de una semana despues de esa
decision, Aldo Dadone, el presidente del banco, llamo a Aldaco a su
oficina y le dijo que Domingo Cavallo, el entonces poderoso
ministro de Economia y cercano aliado politico de Dadone, habia
insistido en que el banco usara el sistema Hogan. Dadone envio a
Aldaco a Espana y Portugal para reevaluar el uso de Hogan en otros
bancos. Aldaco regreso en una semana y presento un informe
negativo. Dadone paso por alto el informe, y a continuacion estallo
una encendida polemica entre Carlos Thomson, el jefe de sistemas
informaticos de Banco de la Nacion, y Dadone. A final de cuentas se
decidio usar el sistema Hogan, y Thomson fue transferido a otra
seccion del banco. ``Se nos dijo que le estabamos faltando el
respeto [a Cavallo]. La realidad era que si uno no estaba de
acuerdo con la decision de Cavallo, tenia que irse del banco,''
dice Aldaco.
 &HT;    Cavallo niega enfaticamente la version de Aldaco [ver articulo
complementario]. Pero en su libro El peso de la verdad, Cavallo
afirma que vio el sistema Hogan funcionando en el Bank of Nova
Scotia, de Canada, y que estaba entusiasmado con el Proyecto del
Siglo.
 &HT;    Un mes despues que IBM Argentina recibio luz verde para el
proyecto, tuvo lugar otra reunion, esta vez entre Aldaco y Marcelo
Cattaneo, vinculado al partido de gobierno y presidente de Consad,
una firma argentina de consultoria de informatica, subcontratada
por IBM para suministrar componentes para el proyecto general de
modernizacion. ''[Cattaneo] dijo que sabia que el proyecto me
molestaba y me ofrecio US$3 millones, depositados directamente en
una cuenta en un banco suizo, para que el proyecto se adelantara
sin contratiempos,'' dice Aldaco. ``Y por desgracia, tome el
dinero.''
 &HT;    Al parecer, Cattaneo estaba haciendo lo mismo con otras
personas. Genaro Contartese, otro ex director del Banco de la
Nacion, tambien confeso haber recibido US$1,5 millones.
 &HT;    Aunque los directores confesaron anteriormente este ano, una
auditoria fiscal de rutina revelo que una poco conocida compania
argentina llamada Capacitacion y Computacion Rural (CCR) recibio
US$21 millones en cheques de IBM Argentina. A su vez, CCR tenia un
en su nomina una camarera y a un individuo ya fallecido. La
revelacion dio pie a una investigacion.
 &HT;    CCR era una compania relativamente nueva en el panorama
tecnologico argentino, surgida de una escision de Consad entre 1992
y 1993. Un ano despues, Consad vendio a CCR en US$1 millon un
programa de administracion llamado SBL, aunque en ese momento la
empresa no tenia clientes ni historial de trabajo.
 &HT;    Determinar cual era la relacion entre IBM, Consad y CCR se
convirtio en la tarea principal del juez federal Adolfo Bagnasco.
El joven y locuaz juez, al que algunos acusan de tener ambiciones
politicas, fue asignado al caso a mediados de 1994. Al principio
Bagnasco se propuso descubrir como Banco de la Nacion y Deloitte &AMP;
Touche escogieon el sistema Hogan. Dos especialistas a quienes se
pidio evaluar el contrato original determinaron que estaba
sobrevalorado en un maximo de US$100 millones y que en el documento
no aparecia ninguna mencion de CCR ni de la instalacion de un
sistema computarizado de respaldo.
 &HT;    Investigaciones ulteriores mostraron que el primer desembolso de
IBM, de US$21 millones, se dirigio a CCR, supuestamente para pagar
un sistema computarizado de respaldo. ``Cuando uno compra un
automovil, no compra primero un automovil de repuesto,'' dice
Aldaco. ``IBM no compro primero todo el hardware y el software
[principales]. El primer pago fue por un sistema alternativo. Ese
fue el pago de los sobornos.''
 &HT;    De hecho, el pago fue el inicio de un laberinto financiero para
los investigadores. En su oficina, el juez tiene un grafico que
muestra una confusa red de cuentas bancarias en paraisos fiscales y
transferencias de dinero. Segun Bagnasco, IBM Argentina deposito
dos cheques, uno por US$8 millones y otro por US$13 millones, en la
cuenta de CCR en la sucursal argentina del Banco General de
Negocios. Los US$8 millones se pagaron en efectivo a
suministradores de CCR. Los otros US$13 millones fueron a un banco
en paraiso fiscal llamado Compania General de Negocios. De estos
fondos, CCR pago a Consad US$3 millones que, segun Bagnasco,
desaparecieron. Los US$10 millones restantes fueron a parar a
Estados Unidos: US$1 millon se deposito en Citibank y US$9 millones
en Bruxelles Lambert, de Suiza. La mitad de los fondos depositados
en Suiza se dividieron en cuatro cuentas. Dos de esas cuentas
pertenecen a Aldaco; una a Contartese, ex director de Banco de la
Nacion, y la cuarta, dice Bagnasco, a un amigo de Aldaco.
 &HT;    Los otros US$4,5 millones pasaron por Luxemburgo y luego se
dispersaron en cinco cuentas: dos en Suiza, una en Uruguay y dos en
Estados Unidos. Bagnasco ha pedido a las autoridades suizas que
verifiquen si las cuentas pertenecen a Mario Dadone, hermano del ex
presidente del Banco de la Nacion, y a Walter de Fortuna, otro
estrecho aliado de Domingo Cavallo. Bagnasco cree que la cuenta
uruguaya esta vinculada a Contartese, y aun se desconoce quienes
son los duenos de las dos cuentas en Estados Unidos, una en MTB New
York y la otra en Brown B. Harriman &AMP; Co.
 &HT;    El informe del juez alega que el pago de US$21 millones de IBM
Argentina a CCR por un sistema de software de respaldo fue en
realidad una pantalla para pagar sobornos. Segun la acusacion, CCR
recibio cheques de IBM por servicios que nunca se prestaron.
 &HT;    Bagnasco emitio 30 encausamientos en una primera ronda de
acusaciones por fraude en abril de 1996, entre ellos tres ex
ejecutivos de IBM Argentina; la junta directiva en pleno del Banco
de la Nacion, incluido el ex presidente Aldo Dadone; Marcelo
Cattaneo y varios empleados de la oficina argentina de Deloitte &AMP;
Touche. Un ano despues, Bagnasco emitio 10 encausamientos mas por
soborno, pero un juez federal de apelaciones fallo que a las
personas en cuestion se les estaba acusando dos veces del mismo
delito y desestimo las acusaciones mas recientes. Esa decision esta
en proceso de apelacion en este momento.
 &HT;    En junio de 1996, el Banco de la Nacion cancelo el proyecto y
exigio a IBM que le devolviera US$82 millones. IBM Argentina
presento una demanda por incumplimiento de contrato, exigio que se
le pagara lo que se le adeudaba mas una suma adicional por danos y
perjuicios y afirmo que el Banco de la Nacion cambiaba
continuamente las especificaciones tecnicas del trabajo.
 &HT;    Las confesiones de Aldaco y Contartese dieron mas peso a las
acusaciones del juez. Tambien este ano, Bagnasco ordeno el arresto
de dos ejecutivos y dos ex ejecutivos de IBM radicados en Estados
Unidos en el momento del incidente. Robeli de Librero era gerente
general de la division latinoamericana. Se jubilo en 1995 despues
de trabajar 35 anos en la compania. Peter Rowley estaba a cargo del
mercadeo en la region y ahora dirige la unidad de pequenos negocios
de IBM. Steven Lew era asesor tecnico de IBM en el contrato del
Banco de la Nacion y aun trabaja para la empresa. Marcelo Kaiser se
fue de IBM en 1995 y ahora trabaja en Brasil con la firma
norteamericana de bases de datos Oracle. Bagnasco afirma que los
cuatro son sospechosos en el caso y ha pedido que los envien a
Buenos Aires para interrogarlos, basandose en un tratado entre
Estados Unidos y Argentina. IBM, que se encarga de las
declaraciones publicas de los cuatro, dice que estan dispuestos a
reunirse con investigadores en territorio estadounidense.
 &HT;    El centro de la investigacion es si los altos ejecutivos de IBM
sabian que CCR recibia fondos de IBM Argentina. Los ejecutivos de
IBM en Estados Unidos se mantienen firmes. ``Todo se reduce a un
punto especifico: si en las oficinas centrales de America Latina
sabian que se le estaba dando dinero a CCR,'' dice Fred McNeese,
portavoz de IBM Latin America. ``No hemos encontrado ninguna
indicacion escrita, verbal o de otro tipo que alguien en Estados
Unidos sabia que se le daba dinero a CCR. Nunca se le dijo nada a
la oficina central regional.''
 &HT;    McNeese afirma que los ejecutivos regionales conocian el
proyecto del Banco de la Nacion y habian recibido una lista de
subcontratistas contratados. Agrega que Consad estaba en la lista,
pero no CCR, y que los ejecutivos de IBM Argentina eran los
responsables de los detalles. IBM inicio su investigacion cuando
las denuncias se hicieron publicas y decidio que no se habian
seguido debidamente sus normas internas. Ricardo Martorana, gerente
general de la filial argentina, y el director de Finanzas de la
misma oficina, renunciaron, mientras el director de Operaciones,
Gustavo Soriani, se marcho de la empresa debido al incidente. ``No
se siguieron los procedimientos internos. Y los tres responsables
ya no trabajan en la compania,'' dice McNeese. Pero agrega: ``Los
procedimientos eran adecuados.''
 &HT;    Lo eran?
 &HT;    Los observadores se mofan de la opinion de que los ejecutivos
regionales no sabian practicamente nada sobre la ejecucion de un
contrato de US$249 millones. IBM ha negado varias veces que algun
empleado fuera de IBM Argentina supiera de alguna infraccion. No
hay pruebas que indiquen otra cosa.
 &HT;    Que mas no sabian los ejecutivos regionales de IBM? Las
autoridades argentinas estan revisando otros contratos de IBM en el
pais y se han descubierto irregularidades en un contrato de US$513
millones otorgado sin licitacion publica para instalar una red de
supervision de pagos de impuestos y contribuciones a fondos de
pensiones. Tambien estan pendientes otros casos de bancos estatales
en las provincias y una Comision Parlamentaria creada en 1996 para
investigar la concesion de contratos gubernamentales a IBM prosigue
sus labores.
 &HT;    IBM tiene desde hace tiempo una reputacion de etica empresarial.
Los empleados deben firmar un codigo de conducta cada ano. Hay un
departamento interno responsable de estudiar el historial de los
empleados y socios comerciales y empresas extranjeras, que por lo
general son suministradores de servicios tecnologicos y vendedores
autorizados de productos de IBM. Se verifican las hojas de vida de
los aspirantes a trabajar en la empresa, pero la compania no tiene
ningun procedimiento adicional para investigar a ejecutivos que
ocupen altos puestos de gerencia o a los responsables de las
finanzas.
 &HT;    Los socios comerciales tienen que cumplir ciertos requisitos
financieros y tecnicos para asegurar que tienen los medios para
llevar a cabo los contratos. IBM tambien verifica la reputacion de
las companias y sus normas eticas. Periodicamente se estudia la
situacion de los socios de negocios para asegurar que cumplan esos
requisitos.
 &HT;    Segun McNeese, los subcontratistas que trabajan en proyectos de
IBM no estan sujetos a la misma verificacion de normas eticas antes
de entrar en un proyecto bajo la supervision de IBM. Consad y CCR
eran subcontratistas que trabajaban bajo la autoridad de IBM
Argentina. McNeese defiende esa norma: ``Los contratistas se
contratan para trabajar en un proyecto especifico. Eso no es una
relacion.''
 &HT;    Pero cuando las empresas hacen negocios en el extranjero, esta
en juego algo mas que el enredo legal. Complicarse en un escandalo
cuesta mucho tiempo y dinero, aunque a final de cuentas los
ejecutivos salgan libres de culpa. Los especialistas en seguridad
dicen que invertir en normas preventivas tiene sentido desde el
angulo empresarial. A medida que las empresas hacen mas negocios en
el extranjero, saber exactamente quien es quien y dar a conocer los
requisitos eticos es vital para mantener las normas, sobre todo en
paises donde la corrupcion es endemica. Los asesores recomiendan un
exigente plan de instruccion y capacitacion en cuestiones eticas
entre los empleados, complementado con una investigacion idonea de
las empresas que aspiren a trabajar con las multinacionales. ``Hay
que tener un control,'' dice Bruce Goslin, director gerente de
Kroll Associates, firma norteamericana de seguridad empresarial.
``Hay que crear un ambiente donde se entienda bien que no se
toleran acciones ilegales.''
 &HT;    IBM ha anunciado varios cambios en como participa en la
licitacion de contratos, como prohibir a las filiales que compitan
por proyectos que no se han sacado a licitacion. En Argentina, la
filial de IBM no aspirara a contratos gubernamentales, aunque
McNeese dice que la decision surge del deseo de la empresa de
concentrar sus recursos en el crecimiento potencial del sector
privado. La compania rehuso comentar si su propia investigacion del
contrato con Banco de la Nacion provocara cambios en sus normas
internas.
 &HT;    Las empresas que desean aprender la leccion del caso de Banco de
la Nacion deben comenzar por asegurar la solidez de su sistema de
supervision interna para transmitir la etica empresarial a los
confines mas remotos de la actividad comercial. Hacer otra cosa es
arriesgarse a caer en problemas juridicos y publicitarios. A fin de
cuentas, es mas facil destruir una reputacion que reconstruirla.
``Nadie tiene que pagar un soborno,'' dice Luis Moreno,
representante argentino de Transparencia Internacional y ex fiscal.
``Lo que hemos aprendido del caso de IBM es que pagar un soborno
significa ganar un negocio, pero un negocio peligroso.''

`RINGMASTER': JERRY SPRINGER IN A FILM BASED ON HIS TV SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerry Springer, playing himself in all but name in
``Ringmaster'' (here he is Jerry Farrelly), wants us to believe
that he is the great all-caring conduit for the voices of America's
oppressed common people. The only time he loses his temper in
``Ringmaster,'' a behind-the-scenes fictional comedy about two
groups of guests who collide on his television talk show, comes
when an outraged member of the studio audience stands up and
dismisses his feuding participants as wild animals.
</P>
<P>
   The host flushes, and his normally mild-mannered tone turns
oratorical. The folks on his show, he declares, are no different
from the celebrities who go on television to discuss their love
lives and drug abuse, except that they're not rich and famous.
``This is a slice of American life, and if you don't like it, bite
something else!'' he shouts. The audience cheers wildly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ringmaster'' wants to polish Springer's image the same way
that ``Private Parts'' presented Howard Stern as a cuddly populist
crusader. It puts the best possible face on a show that turns
brutal psychological combat into a combination of professional
wrestling match and circus act. The guests who appear on Springer's
show, the movie suggests, are a lot hardier than we might assume.
Far from dumb beasts goaded to violence and exploited without
realizing they are a laughingstock, these people have a good idea
of what they're doing, and they want to make the most of their 15
minutes of fame. Their confrontations can even be cathartic.
Backstage, their rages quickly subside, and the healing can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. Then again, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups of guests, one white, the other black, both come
from lower-income backgrounds. Connie (Molly Hagan) and Angel
(Jaime Pressly) are a sexy mother-daughter combo (``the Judds
without talent,'' Connie declares) from a Florida trailer park.
When Connie finds Angel in bed with her husband (Angel's
stepfather), Rusty (Michael Dudikoff), she promptly marches out of
the trailer and seduces Angel's boyfriend, Willie (Ashley
Holbrook). Three of the four end up on ``The Jerry Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Detroit, Starletta (Wendy Raquel Robinson) catches
her muscle-bound boyfriend, Demond (Michael Jai White), in bed with
her best friend, Vonda (Tangie Ambrose). Along with their pal
Leshawnette (Nicki Micheaux), they take their troubles to Papa
Jerry. More fireworks ensue when Angel and Demond find lust at
first sight during a warm-up session for the show. Jerry himself is
catnip to these freewheeling sexpots who coax him to do things like
autograph the fronts of their skin-tight T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ringmaster,'' directed by Neil Abramson, is acted with a
spitting, snarling gusto by a cast that is as uninhibited as the
guests on a typical ``Jerry Springer Show.'' Think of this as
guilty Thanksgiving pleasure.

`BABE, PIG IN THE CITY': GOODBYE GREEN ACRES, HELLO WILD SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end)  
(JT) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Babe the pig, he of the sweet voice and twitchy pink snout,
spends his second film in considerably more daunting surroundings
than those of the Hoggetts (James Cromwell and Magda Szubanski) and
their farm. In ``Babe: Pig in the City'' his new friends include
chimps and a pit bull, signaling the obviously less lighthearted
quality of this sequel.
</P>
<P>
   As directed once again by George Miller, Babe remains a cute
little porker, but his fanciful new backdrops are less beguiling.
Despite his mandate (from his dog mother, with the voice of Miriam
Margolyes) to demonstrate ``how a kind and steady heart can mend a
sorry world,'' Babe must contend here with many discouraging urban
woes. Chief among them is Mickey Rooney as a dissipated circus
clown, possibly cast here to show how much more refreshing Babe is
than many human beings.
</P>
<P>
   This film's occasional taste for dark moments and unappetizing
sights makes its G rating somewhat questionable for very young
children. The plot contrives to send Farmer Hoggett down a well in
a nasty accident. Then Babe and Esme Hoggett head for the city,
hoping to save the farm. Much fun is made of Ms. Szubanski's sturdy
Esme, who becomes the subject of endless fat jokes as well as a
police strip-search at the airport. It seems that a drug-sniffing
dog has detected contraband somewhere, and anyone eager to explain
that to tots should have no problem with the rest of the story. It
brings Babe and Esme to a fleabag _ the Flealands Hotel _ where
animals are officially outlawed but actually welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Here, at this menagerie-filled version of the Chelsea, Babe
finds the kind of urban demimonde he never saw on the farm. There
is an orangutan named Thelonius (get it?) and a family of
world-weary chimps (with Steven Wright providing the wise-guy
father's voice, and Glenne Headly as the pregnant, floozyish
mother). Continuing his walk on the wild side, Babe also meets a
pink poodle with Blanche DuBois tendencies and squads of cats and
dogs who behave like members of rival gangs. Sheepherding contests,
anyone? There's plenty to be said about the urban troubles seen
here, but it's not best heard out of the mouth of Babe.
</P>
<P>
   This visually ambitious film does concoct an elaborate
pan-metropolis including traces of New York, Hollywood, San
Francisco, Paris, Venice and so on. And the Flealands Hotel becomes
an enveloping setting, even if its gloom spoils some of the fun.
There's some good news in the fact that Babe's mouse friends come
along for the journey, and that their musical tastes (``Non, Je Ne
Regrette Rien,'' ``That's Amore,'' ``Are You Lonesome Tonight?'')
remain as adorably eclectic as ever. The cats who greet them with a
chorus of ``Three Blind Mice'' are also a nice touch.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Esme has wound up in the clown's purple suit and
is swinging from a chandelier across a ballroom, this ``Babe'' has
all but lost its bearings.
</P>
<P>
   It will work as a sequel only hard-core ``Babe'' fans willing to
follow this four-legged hero (or heroine, as Babe obviously is in
some scenes) anywhere. Had ``Pig in the City'' been made first, it
by no means could have prompted a sequel of its own.

 &HT;    Pixar's ants push limits of animation
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   See if this rings a bell: Here's a computer-animated movie about
an imperiled ant colony. Our hero is a worker ant who gets in
trouble for being a nonconformist. When his colony faces
annihilation, he braves the danger and wins the heart of the ant
princess in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, this sounds a lot like the fall's earlier release ``Antz.''
But there's a big difference. ``A Bug's Life'' is a visual wonder
that blows the DreamWorks release off the screen. Often as witty as
it is eye-popping, it recaptures some of the magic of the last
movie from Pixar Animation Studios, ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Flik (voiced by Dave Foley) is an inventor ant whose gadgets are
viewed with suspicion by his march-in-line colleagues, overseen by
the queen (Phyllis Diller) and her daughter Princess Atta (Julia
Louis-Dreyfus). It's Flik's indirect fault that his colony incurs
the wrath of a grasshopper gang led by Hopper (Kevin Spacey), who
extorts food from the ants in exchange for ``protection.''
</P>
<P>
   It's Flik's bright idea to search the countryside for some
``tough bugs'' who can fight the grasshoppers. Through a series of
misunderstandings, he thinks he's found them when he encounters a
flea circus. The troupe includes a genial black widow spider
(Bonnie Hunt), a gypsy moth (Madeline Kahn), a melodramatic
magician mantis (Jonathan Harris), a walking stick (David Hyde
Pierce) and a grumpy male ladybug named Francis (Denis Leary).
There are also a couple of language-challenged acrobatic pillbugs,
Tuck and Roll, who steal a bunch of scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Flik takes them all back to the anthill to wage war. The bugs
think it's just a new gig. Complications (and comedy) ensue.
</P>
<P>
   The circus bug setup provides a slew of show biz jokes adults
will appreciate. Kids will love the slapstick. Everyone will be
amazed by the animation.
</P>
<P>
   Presented in wide-screen ratio (compared to the boxier
proportions of ``Toy Story'') ``A Bug's Life'' is bursting with
extraordinary visual grace notes: Forests of clover. A dandelion
tuft used as a parachute. A rowdy grasshopper cantina hidden under
a sombrero. The flea circus alone is an eye-filling accumulation of
found objects, including a dog collar used as the main performance
ring and a Chinese takeout carton filling in as a magician's
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers' expertise doesn't end with the backgrounds. The
movie features action scenes that seem designed to test the limits
of computer animation, including a complex airborne chase through a
rainstorm. One sequence, involving the attack of a hungry bird, is
handled with spectacular skill and suspense. (A useful comparison
is to the shoelace rescue in ``Antz,'' which was slowed down until
it lost any sense of danger.)
</P>
<P>
   The script is full of quips almost as abundant as the movie's
eye candy. ``I only got 24 hours to live, and I ain't gonna waste
it here,'' grumbles one housefly, in the definitive put-down of the
flea circus. The film's version of a buggy big city includes a
homeless insect with the sign ``Kid Pulled My Wings Off'' and that
universal urban horror, a millipede mime. And thanks to Leary's
reliably grumpy vocals, the movie gets great mileage off Francis,
especially when the ladybug is adopted as ``den mother'' by Atta's
kid sister Dot and her fellow girl ants.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the film's riches tend to work against it. While
the characters of ``Toy Story'' were wittily well defined, the
large number of characters (and species) in ``Bug Life'' means that
we don't get to know all of them as well. Maybe that's what sequels
are made for. (``Toy Story 2'' hits theaters next year.)
</P>
<P>
   Parents, take note. The movie doesn't have explicit violence,
but Hopper attempts to squash an ant by stepping on his head, and
one bug gets eaten (offscreen). And remember: Stay for the credits,
which include some cleverly made ``outtakes'' from the movie.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    `Cruise' is quite a trip as long as it doesn't stop
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bennett Miller's low-budget documentary ``The Cruise,'' filmed
in gritty black-and-white, is something of a stunt, but it's an
appealing one. Especially if you ever did time on Manhattan Island.
</P>
<P>
   Miller focuses on Timothy ``Speed'' Levitch, a loquaciously
eccentric tour guide who works for Manhattan's Gray Line bus
company. Surveying New York City from the top of a double-decker
bus, Levitch likes to point out the less ``touristy'' aspects of
the Big Apple. The streets where H.L. Mencken, D.H. Lawrence, Edith
Wharton and Mark Twain lived; the Village's White Horse Tavern,
where Dylan Thomas died (his last words, according to Levitch,
were: ``I just had my 16th martini'').
</P>
<P>
   Levitch is a font of factoids. The World Trade Center has its
own ZIP code. Eleven people survived their suicide jump from the
Brooklyn Bridge. Twenty-seven thousand trees were originally
planted in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   As neurotically self-absorbed as Woody Allen and as
transparently attention-craving as Richard Simmons (whose voice and
mannerisms he brings to mind), Levitch is a sort of quintessential
New Yorker with a quintessential love/hate relationship with the
city. ``I felt this winter we were getting a divorce, that the city
was angry with me,'' he confides to the camera. But over the
summer, he admits, ``a reconciliation'' has taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch is a lot more intriguing on the bus than off.
Unfortunately, the film gives him a lot of time at street level
where we're forced to listen to his metaphysical musings on ``the
cruise'' as a way of life or to such get-over-it poetic utterances
as ``The city is a streamlined mermaid who sings to me at night.''
In these scenes, he's just another sad, lonely, frustrated guy
whose verbal audacity merely masks his repetitious mantra, ``I am
somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   But back on board his bus, mike in hand (``Can you hear me in
the back?''), Levitch is a kind of inspired performance artist. A
spiel about Manhattan and the end of civilization abruptly segues
into ``the new AnnTaylor store, on your left.'' And paeans to the
city don't get any better than his instructions to his captive
audience, ``The sun, ladies and gentlemen. Another great New York
landmark. Above you, to the left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cruise''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Timothy ``Speed'' Levitch. Directed by Bennett Miller.
Rated PG-13 for language.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 16 minutes.

 &HT;    `Babe' sequel offers up little to squeal about
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This little piggy has a sequel. But while most of the main
players are reunited in ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' some of the
magic has worn off.
</P>
<P>
   ``City'' quickly welcomes us back to the world of Babe and his
farmyard friends. It starts with a parade celebrating the piglet's
sheep-herding triumph at the end of the 1995 best picture Oscar
nominee. The deadpan narration is again by Roscoe Lee Browne, the
main animal voices are the same, and the farming couple the
Hoggetts are portrayed once more by James Cromwell and Magda
Szubanski.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, those three mice are still singing malicious intros to
the movie's multiple chapters.
</P>
<P>
   But the sequel _ directed by ``Babe'' producer and co-writer
George Miller, instead of Chris Noonan _ gets off on the wrong hoof
(sorry) with its main plot device. Farmer Hoggett is confined to
bed by an accident, and it's up to Mrs. Hoggett to save the
indebted farm by taking Babe (voiced by E.G. Daily) to a lucrative
personal appearance at a county fair.
</P>
<P>
   This not only turns Oscar nominee Cromwell into a cameo, but
does the same to Babe's surrogate parents, the Border collies Fly
and Rex (voiced by Miriam Margolyes and Hugo Weaving). Even those
dumb, annoying sheep only have one scene, baaaaing, ``Save the
farm, Babe!''
</P>
<P>
   When the farmer's wife and Babe are stranded in the city (a
witty blend of Paris, New York, San Francisco, Sydney and just
about every other metropolis), the movie buzzes along for a while
on Roger Ford's whimsical production design. Mrs. Hoggett and Babe
find shelter in a turreted hotel run by a twitchy landlady (Mary
Stein), whose neighbors are anxious to bust her for harboring
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The inn is home to every kind of animal: tough dogs, a roomful
of cats who sing choral versions of ``Three Blind Mice,'' and a
couple of street-smart chimps (voices by Glenne Headly and Steven
Wright) who work for a clown named Fugly Floom (Mickey Rooney, in a
tiny role). Babe's rude awakening in the city includes getting
recruited into Floom's act, which ends in disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Around this point, ``Pig in the City'' starts to lose its shape.
The first film had the clean, even moving story of Babe struggling
to prove himself (and save his own life) by herding sheep. In the
sequel, nothing replaces the emotional connections between Babe,
Fly and Farmer Hoggett. It disintegrates into a series of chases.
Babe has to escape some angry dogs. Babe has to escape some animal
control officials, etc. And lots of things are constantly crashing
down around the piglet.
</P>
<P>
   While the first film wittily reinterpreted a recognizable
reality (farm life) through the animals' eyes, the sequel offers a
far-fetched city overrun by animals. Instead of the suspenseful,
quiet finale of original, we get the rotund Szubanski
bungee-jumping through a chic fund-raiser trying to rescue her pig.
Why? It's never really clear. In its last half-hour the movie opts
for slapstick instead of clarity. In the process, Babe gets lost;
he's an ensemble member more than a lead character.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, kids will probably love the animals and the seamless FX
that make them seem to speak. The film reportedly had to be
revamped to get a G rating instead of a PG. But remember, the first
movie was quite dark: The main point for Babe and Francis the duck
was to keep off the butcher block. In the new film, we get a sick
old man being carried to the hospital and the near deaths of two
dogs and a goldfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pig in the City'' has its charmed, offhand moments: A kitten
whimpering, ``My tummy hurts.'' The mice singing ``Non, Je Ne
Regrette Rien.'' The fierce loyalty of a crippled Jack Russell
terrier named Flealick (voiced by Adam Goldberg) who wears training
wheels on his rear legs. And a late-night parade of animals through
a children's hospital ward that recalls the hushed magic of ``101
Dalmatians'' (the book, not the movies).
</P>
<P>
   The animals are beautifully trained, and Szubanski is a game
performer, though her role is little more than a drawn-out sight
gag. But too often, the action-mad ``Mad Max'' side of director
Miller seems to come out. While the first ``Babe'' inspired wonder,
the new sequel makes you wonder why anyone would create a sequel
that ignores most of the things that made the first movie so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Magda Szubanski, James Cromwell, Mickey Rooney.
Directed by George Miller. Rated G. 1 hour, 36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not as tasty as the first film.

 &HT;    `Home Fries' a half-baked attempt at romantic comedy
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the big-budget blunders of ``The Avengers,'' ``The
Postman'' and ``Batman and Robin,'' Warner Bros. seems to be going
in the opposite direction. Its new ``Home Fries'' looks like the
kind of edgy, low-budget independent flick that usually emerges
from the Sundance Film Festival. But the resemblance is only
skin-deep. It's a dumb Hollywood romantic comedy in a small-town
disguise.
</P>
<P>
   It starts off appealingly weird, like a country cousin of ``The
X-Files.'' (The script is by Vince Gilligan, an executive producer
of that show.) While ultra-pregnant Sally (Drew Barrymore) takes
orders at the drive-through of the BurgerMatic, she hears
disembodied voices chattering on her headset.
</P>
<P>
   They belong to a couple of pilots in a military helicopter,
chasing a middle-aged man through the woods. The man's name is
Henry (Chris Lever); he's the father of Sally's unborn child. And
the next day, he's found dead.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Sally can't go to the funeral because Henry has a wife
(Catherine O'Hara) and two grown stepsons, Dorian (Luke Wilson) and
Angus (Jake Busey, typecast again as a lunatic). These two are the
guys who were flying the copter, scaring their stepdad for his
cheatin' ways. It was Mom's idea. Now, Mom wants to find the hussy
who was sleeping with Henry. And kill her.
</P>
<P>
   That's the convoluted setup that results in Dorian finding work
at the BurgerMatic and falling in love with Sally . . . even while
the murderous Angus redoubles his efforts to find her. This could
be fun, if the movie knew what tone to take. Instead, it tries to
mix farce with romance, and the blend never gels.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's idea of character development is to mention Sally's
obsession with Dolly Parton, a joke that's at least a decade old.
Barrymore's role is pretty much defined by her fake belly and
floppy Orphan Annie wig; she's a sweet blank. Maybe it's fitting
that Dorian falls for her. He's not all there, either. (Though
Barrymore and Wilson are linked in real life, they have zero
chemistry on-screen.)
</P>
<P>
   That leaves it up to O'Hara to walk away with the movie. The
brilliant ``SCTV'' alumna turns in a performance that's Lady
Macbeth by way of a Tupperware party. You keep waiting for her big
confrontation with Shelley Duvall (underused as Sally's mom), but
it never happens.
</P>
<P>
   Stuck between Hollywood blandness and backwoods condescension,
the movie unfolds against melancholy shots of grain silos, railroad
tracks and fields of graying baled hay. You can almost hear
director Parisot exulting about the ``realness'' of the shots. That
verisimilitude only makes the script seem sillier.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's heavy-hitter list of producers includes directors
Barry Levinson and Lawrence Kasdan. Maybe they're pining for the
freedom of their younger, independent days. Movies like this won't
bring those days back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore, Luke Wilson, Catherine O'Hara. Directed
by Dean Parisot. Rated PG-13. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A small-town romantic comedy, scant on the romance,
and too broad on the comedy.

 &HT;    lHeadline idea: `Ringmaster' as real as Springer's TV show
(wink, wink)
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, first, Angel beats the crap out of Willie. Then Starletta
smacks around Angel. LeShawnette screams at Demond and Angel
screams at Connie. Then Angel attacks Demond, Starletta tries to
tear out Angel's hair and Angel returns to pounding on Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, now . . . Is that everything? It wouldn't do to
overlook any part of the climactic scene in ``Ringmaster,'' not
with rabid fans of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' worrying that the
movie might be different somehow. You know, not as good.
</P>
<P>
   Good _ we'll get back to that later. For now, let's just say
that if ``Ringmaster'' was any more like the TV show, you'd mistake
your popcorn for the remote. A few things are different about the
films's look at a wildly popular TV talk program called ``The Jerry
Show'' _ most notably, we watch as two different equally
dysfunctional groups gradually realize their dreams of having lives
awful enough for ``Jerry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet nearly everything else that's made the real (no cracks,
please) TV show such a hit is here:
</P>
<P>
   The whooping audience members. The hair-pulling, chair-throwing
``guests'' barely controlled by burly security guards. And of
course, Springer himself, marooned with his microphone somewhere in
the audience, looking shocked _ shocked! _ by everything
spontaneously (wink, wink) occurring all around him.
</P>
<P>
   It's his schtick and he's schticking to it. Or is that too harsh
an assessment? After all, ``Ringmaster'' would have us believe that
there's a real message to all this madness _ and it's certainlynot
that a particular large segment of America apparently can't get
enough of trash-talkin' people slapping each other upside the head.
On nationwide TV, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy, no. The real message here is that anybody who's not part
of that large segment is a snob. The kind of snob who looks down
his nose at real people's problems, who . . . Oh heck, why not let
the movie speak for itself?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you find poverty bleak and that depresses you, '' Mel
Riley (John Capodice), a high-level employee of ``The Jerry Show''
solemnly informs a downcast TV reporter who's spent a little too
much time on the set.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Jerry Farrelly (Springer)puts it in a ``closing thought''
, the Angels and Starlettas of the world may not be rich or ``speak
the King's English,'' but they have ``just as much right to be on
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as long as they're sleeping with their stepdaddy, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Ringmaster''I's barely begun (in a rundown Florida
trailer park, natch) and one realizes there's only four things
``poor people'' do in Jerry's world: Drink, swear, beat each other
up and have constant, indiscriminate sex.
</P>
<P>
   OK, sometimes it's discriminate _ for instance, Connie purposely
sleeps with daughter Angel's fiance after Angel sleeps with
Connie's husband _ but that hardly lessens our not-so-sneaking
suspicion that Jerry doesn't think much more of these people than
do the so-called snobs he's purportedly puncturing.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely none of which matters if you're a fan of Jerry
Springer. If you like his TV show (or if you claim not to like it,
even as you secretly watch those nightly reruns on Channel 5) then
doubtless you'll enjoy ``Ringmaster'' 's familiar
expletive-hurling, breast- baring tricks.
</P>
<P>
   If not, well, as Jerry snarls near the end, ``This is a slice of
real life. If you don't like it, bite something else!''
</P>
<P>
   Or in the King's English: Go see ``Babe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Springer: Ringmaster''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jerry Springer. Directed by Neil Abramson. Rated R. 1
hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A split decision. Either you'll love it _ or you'll
want to split mere minutes into it.

 &HT;    Dark comedy refuses to pull punches
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people may stumble out of ``Very Bad Things'' convinced
they've seen the best movie of the year. Others may feel they've
seen the very worst. The wild thing is, these polar responses
aren't incompatible. ``Very Bad Things'' is the kind of movie that
either works for you or doesn't. It's a nasty, mean-spirited, sick
piece of celluloid. If you consider that a recommendation, buy a
ticket. If not, steer clear.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Peter Berg, best known as an actor on
``Chicago Hope,'' ``Things'' takes a familiar situation (stag party
gone bad) and squeezes every possible drop of bile out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Slater, Daniel Stern, Jeremy Piven and Leland Orser
play buddies who take groom-to-be Jon Favreau away for one last
wild weekend. On their way out of town, the fellows fuss about cell
phones and foreign policy; they poke and prod each other like old
friends do.
</P>
<P>
   But once they've settled into their hotel, their party-hearty
blend of booze, drugs and a stripper results in an accidental
death, which leads to a second, which leads to . . . well, that
would be telling.
</P>
<P>
   The plot-driven flick plays on your fears of a split-second
accident that can ruin your life and destroy every personal
relationship you thought was indestructible. And it's played for
sick laughs. The movie gets its gags (pun intentional) with
excruciating, mundane detail. Example: If you need buckets,
shovels, suitcases and an electric saw to ditch a body, where do
you go? Answer: a 24-hour Target.
</P>
<P>
   The movie isn't as sharp as it could be, especially when it
comes to Slater's character. Taking on responsibility for the
cover-up of the killings, he becomes a dark prince of mayhem,
determined to keep the murders hidden at all costs. Even if that
means murdering more people. After a point, it's hard to believe
his pals would give him such power.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a shame that the women are so marginalized. As Stern's
wife, Jeanne Tripplehorn tries to inflate a negligible role.
Cameron Diaz as the bride-to-be spends most of the movie whining
about the wedding. But she delivers a sharp turn-around near the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath its tough-boy sneer, ``Very Bad Things'' is a
deceptively moral work. Unlike most movies, it insists that actions
have consequences. Not that it ever slows down to underscore such
an obvious message. It's too busy with its hit-and-runs, fatal
betrayals and geysers of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you like it or loathe it, ``Very Bad Things'' stays true
to itself. It maintains the courage of its pitch-black convictions
right to its final, cruel frame. Considering how most movies get
softened and compromised to appeal to the largest number of people,
that is a very good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Slater, Jon Favreau, Cameron Diaz. Written
and directed by Peter Berg. Rated R for simulated sex, nudity,
language, violence, gore. 1 hour, 41 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A black comedy you're likely to love or loathe.

 &HT;    A personal visit with the history of Sweet Apple
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It can't happen to many people since so many people
live in new houses nowadays, but a perfectly wonderful occasion for
me was having the descendants of the builders of my cabin drop by
and talk about their ancestors who cut and raised the very logs
that surrounded us.
</P>
<P>
   Two great-great-granddaughters of James Adams, the American
Revolution veteran who came to Georgia with his son and helped him
settle at Sweet Apple, came armed with pictures and records of the
transactions in what was then Milton County in 1830-40. They are
Ann Adams Wilt, who now lives in Charlotte, and her sister, Alecia
Adams Jameson, who lives in Buford. Their husbands, who have long
endured the searches of people like me who are interested in their
ancestors, accompanied them.
</P>
<P>
   And other special guests were my former neighbors Ralph and
Mildred Dangar, their daughter, Judy Walker, and a niece who came
bringing unbelievably precious documents of that day. One, creased
and worn, is the original deed to Sweet Apple and the land
surrounding it. It needs to be restored and framed, as does a fine
little journal of expenditures my predecessors at Sweet Apple kept.
One list contained two pairs of shoes made for $1.50. (I was
fascinated by that, since I just bought a pair of plain, everyday
shoes for $49 _ and that was a marked-down price.)
</P>
<P>
   We sat by the fireplace, which the women knew about from their
antecedents, who had warmed by it and cooked on it, and we
carefully unfolded yellowed documents that told us a little bit
about the people who had lived and worked in that place. Ann Wilt
did a charming thing. She assembled in a loose-leaf folder pictures
of the Adams family, Sweet Apple cabin and their eventual home, a
pretty white frame house in Buckhead, where her grandfather Dr.
Charles Adams lived and practiced medicine for many years. He was
one of the many children who were born in my cabin, and he was
apparently greatly beloved by people he took care of all the way
from Buckhead to Roswell. Their house was a block west of Peachtree
on West Paces _ maybe the first victim of so-called progress, since
it was torn down to make way for commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilt and her husband, Frank, did a wonderful thing for the
likes of us who are curious about early settlers. They had the
diary of a couple of Ann's ancestors, and when she realized it was
100 years old, she decided to transcribe the faded, spidery writing
and bring me a typewritten copy of it. Mrs. Wilt wrote a prologue
describing the lean days at Sweet Apple when Charlie Adams' daddy
told him that the ``only way out of poverty is an education.'' He
added: ``The local school could teach you enough to read the Bible
and figure out taxes, but to really learn a trade or profession you
had to go to the city.'' Charlie Adams hitched up the wagon and
came to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their life,'' wrote Ann, ``was one of voluntary simplicity. .
. . Survival was hard, but families and friends were close and
loving. They worked and prayed for a place to call home _
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann and Alecia were interested in the changes we had wrought at
Sweet Apple. I was apologetic for having installed lights and water
and bathrooms. I didn't like to admit that, instead of a black iron
pot out by the well house, I had a washing machine and dryer. But
they took another tack. I had preserved their ancestors' first home
in what was then Milton County, and they were grateful to me.
Imagine, when the pride and pleasure are all mine!

FOOD BITS AND BYTES: CULINARY-RELATED WEB SITES OF NOTE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

   A Noodle Theme Park and Bike Carts on Line
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who saw ``Tampopo,'' the offbeat 1986 movie directed by
Juzo Itami, knows about the Japanese passion for ramen, or noodles.
Those who would revisit the obsession or plunge in for the first
time can travel to the Shin-Yokohama Ramen Museum on the Tokyo Food
Page (www.twics.com/robbs/tokyofood.html), one of three stellar Web
sites that will take you on a culinary tour of Asia without
traveling farther than your mouse pad.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the museum, which is part historical theme park and
part mall, click on the Culinary Explorer. Pictures and text cover
the history of ramen eating in Japan. At the museum itself, you can
see it all in dioramas and interactive video panels. There are
pictures of the museum's reproduction of a bustling working-class
neighborhood, circa 1958, a golden age for ramen. At the museum,
there are eight noodle shops, each cooking its own variety of
classic ramen. (Sorry, no tastes: this is a virtual tour.)
</P>
<P>
   The Culinary Explorer also offers pictures of Osaka's
spectacular restaurant signs, including a 12-foot mechanical crab,
and a Tokyo Food Photo Gallery (the open-air Ohmicho fish market is
worth seeing).
</P>
<P>
   The site's Eating and Drinking in Tokyo section is a guide to a
mere 1,000 restaurants; Japanese Specialty Cuisines gives, among
other things, a sushi glossary and an essay on okonomiyaki
(literally ``cook what you like''), a pancake that may be Japan's
answer to pizza. There's a recipe collection. And don't ignore the
Resources and Web Links, with 90 more sites a click away and a page
of books on Japanese cooking and culture, in English and
immediately available through amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop is China, with a photo-essay on farmers' markets by
Ditty Deamer (www.saturdaymarket.com/chinaveg). Ms. Deamer
describes herself as a consultant with a small San Francisco
company that helps establish large joint-venture factories in
China. ``My work takes me to China many times a year, but cooking
is my real passion,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Her tireless survey shows the changes in China since the
government dismantled people's communes and decontrolled the growth
and sale of fresh produce. Street markets are flourishing, and
farmers sell directly to consumers. Middle men have sprung up, too.
</P>
<P>
   The tour also visits outdoor wholesale markets, indoor markets,
both government-run and private, and roving markets. Ms. Deamer
delves into subjects like the difference in design of the
bicycle-driven carts of Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou and Mudanjiang.
In the capital, the carts have a single wheel forward, with the
driver pedaling a two-wheel-supported load, which converts into a
market stand. In the beefier carts of Mudanjiang, near the Siberian
border, the load is in front and the driver behind, to carry more
over longer distances.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers try to avoid paying market fees by selling directly
from their carts, which is easier to do on the wide boulevards of
Beijing than in the mazy streets of Shanghai. In the new China,
police tend to be tolerant of these offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The shoppers, many of whom lack refrigeration at home, go to
local markets every day and buy small quantities. Weighing is often
still done on balance scales.
</P>

   Create a Cheese Board
</P>
<P>
   The French Web site that sells artisanal cheese made from
unpasteurized milk (www.fromages.com) has made it easier for buyers
to choose their own cheeses. Previously, it was necessary to select
from set packages _ for instance, Camembert, Selles-sur-Cher and
Comte. Now click on the Epicurean Cheese Shop, and you can pick
three or more cheeses to make up your own cheese board from 16
choices, including St.-Nectaire, Cantal, raw-milk Camembert,
Epoisses and St.-Marcellin.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulations require that any cheese sold in this country
must be made from pasteurized milk unless it has been aged at least
60 days. This site's cheeses are allowed in because they are
shipped to individuals, and not for resale.
</P>
<P>
   A good selection of cheeses available in this country is at
www.idealcheese.com, the Web site of Ideal Cheese Shop in New York
on the Upper East Side. The shop sells a completely goat-milk
gjetost, the chocolaty cheese that most people love or hate;
orange-hued mimolette; medium-aged Cantal, Beaufort and a good many
others from Europe, the British Isles and North America. The Web
site is only a display case. Orders are placed by calling (800)
382-0109; the shop ships throughout the United States.

   Antique Apples as Gifts
</P>
<P>
   Antique varieties of apples, like the Spitzenburgs that Thomas
Jefferson grew at Monticello, would make an unusual treat or gift
for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   A Web source for them is Kilcherman's Christmas Cove Farm in
Northport, Mich. (http://kermit.traverse.com/christmascove). Seeds
of Change of Santa Fe, N.M. (www.seedsofchange.com), sells
certified organic fresh fruit, including Oregon Anjou pears, free
of herbicides, pesticides and fungicides. Another fruit site worth
knowing is Cushman's in West Palm Beach, Fla., for honeybell
oranges (www.honeybell.com). Honeybells are supersweet Minneolas _
navel oranges (with outsy navels) that are seedless, with skins
that come away almost at a touch.

`VERY BAD THINGS': A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, OR IF POSSIBLE TO FORGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(JT) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Very Bad Things,'' written and directed by the actor Peter
Berg, is about as funny as the character who winds up a double
amputee in its closing scene. And that's the way Berg seems to want
it. Inspired by the insight that packs of guys visiting Las Vegas
can behave stupidly, Berg creates dull middle-class buddies in the
throes of a bachelor party. Then he watches a little bitty mishap
(the stripper's violent death) escalate into big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know which is more clever, the stripper's bare
corpse in stiletto boots (one of the camera's favorite reference
points) or the sequence in which her hacked-up body parts are
wrapped in plastic and buried in a desert grave. Humorous slashings
and car accidents constitute similar high points in a film that is
glaringly short on ``Scream''-style self-mockery to match its dopey
mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Berg's screenplay doesn't have black
comic possibilities as it wreaks increasing havoc among characters
obsessed with the wedding plans of Kyle (Jon Favreau) and Laura
(Cameron Diaz). Really, there's no reason not to share the script's
eagerness to see most of these smug or witless individuals wind up
dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Berg's listless direction brings the film so little point of
view that it doesn't much matter who lives or dies. There's not
even much shock value to the story itself, a kind of Dockers-clad
``Lord of the Flies.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the five men on the Vegas spree wind up with blood all over
their hotel bathroom, ``Very Bad Things'' mirthfully watches things
get worse. It turns out that one of these friends is a crazed,
boastful loose cannon, and that Christian Slater is not exactly
miscast in this role. (He is also one of the film's executive
producers.) Once his character has proclaimed himself the group's
``success coach'' and ordered a cover-up of their crimes, the
others (Daniel Stern, Jeremy Piven and the jittery, near-silent
Leland Orser) show signs of strain. The family man ( Stern) is even
uncool enough to worry whether the security guard they've killed
had any children and to suggest prayers for the dead.
</P>
<P>
   When the others aren't ridiculing him for this, they're whining,
feeling sorry for themselves and getting into fatal mishaps.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about Ms. Diaz, because the movie does. Funny as she was
in the much sharper-edged black comedy ``There's Something About
Mary,'' she spends her time here as a ninny, worrying about wedding
plans and eventually bashing the best man with a coat stand when he
puts the wedding's perfection in jeopardy. Letting even Ms. Diaz
turn ugly is certainly a neat trick, but Berg manages it all too
well.
</P>

AN ELEGANT TASTE OF PARIS IS COMING TO NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fauchon, the venerable food market and restaurant complex that
anchors one corner of the Place de la Madeleine in Paris, plans to
open its first United States store, in New York, next year.
</P>
<P>
   Laurent Adamowicz, 41, a former investment banker who bought
Fauchon in April, said he was negotiating for nearly 4,000 square
feet at the corner of Madison Avenue and 74th Street, but was
considering other Upper East Side sites. He has hired Michael
McGovern, a former manager of Dean &AMP; DeLuca, to manage the New York
Fauchon.
</P>
<P>
   Though the company, founded by August Fauchon in 1886 with a
cart of produce, has 750 stores in Europe, Asia and the Middle
East, those are franchises, and not company-owned, as the New York
store will be.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these plans, Adamowicz is spending $12 million to
revamp the Paris headquarters. The main store and Fauchon's
packaging are being redesigned in a more traditional style, dozens
of new products are being added and three of the six Fauchon
restaurants clustered around the Place de la Madeleine have been
closed, including an Italian trattoria.
</P>
<P>
   Adamowicz said that next year there would be a new Fauchon
tearoom decorated like one the company had 100 years ago, and a new
wine bar. ``First we are going back to our roots,'' Adamowicz said.
``Then New York will be our next step.''
</P>

   A new apple, the Pink Lady, is now available in limited
quantities. And it's a winner. A medium-large, squarish variety
with a pink-red, almost Day-Glo skin, the Pink Lady is crisp and
refreshingly tart for fine eating and dense enough for baking and
cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The apples, which originated in New Zealand, are grown in
California. Because they need a long growing season, some of the
finest come from the Cuyama Valley near Los Angeles. These are sold
only by mail from Loguluso Family Farms ($29.95, plus shipping, for
23, including a corer). To order: (877) 564-6587.

   Harry Wils &AMP; Co., the butter-and-egg merchant, has left 182
Duane Street (Hudson Street) in TriBeCa, its home for more than 70
years. It has moved to Secaucus, N.J. The company, now owned by
Stephen Wils, a grandson of the founder, has expanded its line of
products to include cheeses, chocolates and other foods.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many small retailers who have been forced to close or
move by rising rents, Wils, who sells mainly wholesale and owns the
building on Duane Street, needed more space. The new premises, at
505 Jefferson Avenue, are eight times bigger.
</P>

<P>
   Call it the stout of hard ciders. Hard Core, the cider company
owned by Boston Beer, which makes the Samuel Adams line, has
introduced Hard Core Black Cider, a richly complex coffee-color
brew with 6 percent alcohol, is more dry than sweet and excellent
with hearty dishes like short ribs and game. It is even good for
cooking those meats.
</P>
<P>
   The cider, which gets its color from caramelized apple juice, is
$1.69 a bottle at Broadway Farm, Broadway and 85th Street; at
D'Agostino and Food Emporium supermarkets, and at the Thrifty
Beverage Centers in Brooklyn.

`SAVIOR': AMID BOSNIA'S BUTCHERY, A KILLER BECOMES HUMANITARIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Savior,'' Dennis Quaid has the role of his career as a
hard-bitten American mercenary fighting for the Serbian side in the
Bosnian war. The actor's familiar rakish smile has faded into the
hollow-eyed gaze of a weather-beaten soldier who long ago discarded
his humanity in the muck of some forgotten battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie, directed by Serbian filmmaker Peter
Antonijevic, is set in the former Yugoslavia, it has no interest in
exploring the history of conflict in the Balkans, and it refuses to
take sides, or even to name sides.
</P>
<P>
   As Quaid's character, Guy, perilously makes his way through the
war-torn countryside, the film portrays a land whose people,
regardless of ethnicity, have been reduced to animalistic survival
tactics by the violence that has devastated the region. The war has
turned seemingly ordinary people into potential murderers, rapists
and torturers. And the movie's unblinking scenes of atrocities are
among the most graphic and upsetting ever shown in a commercial
film.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene, a woman in her final weeks of pregnancy is thrown
to the ground and repeatedly kicked in the stomach by a sadistic
young soldier. In another, a group of civilians rounded up by a
troop of soldiers are lined up one by one and clobbered over the
head with a mallet while the commanding officer calmly shaves in a
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Prolonged just enough to make you wish the camera would turn
away, these scenes rub your face in the horror to a degree that few
movies have dared. The battle scenes in ``Saving Private Ryan'' may
be gorier, but they don't convey anything close to the intensity of
cruelty and hatred that are so palpable in the scenes of torture
and butchery in ``Savior.''
</P>
<P>
   If these scenes build into a powerful antiwar statement, in
other ways the movie feels dramatically strained. That's because
``Savior,'' for all its surface realism, is essentially an allegory
of dehumanization and redemption. It wants more than anything to
counteract the horror with nobility. As Guy awakens by degrees to
his own capacity for compassion, the fable of a killer turned
humanitarian often feels like a sentimental contrivance.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scene finds Guy in Paris where he is working in some
unspecified military capacity. At a hasty meeting in a restaurant
with his wife and young son, he is distracted and neglectful.
Minutes after he leaves them, a terrorist explosion destroys the
restaurant. Guy rushes back to find his wife and child dead in the
street. In a cold, blind fury, Guy enters a nearby Islamic temple
and shoots all the Muslims praying inside. After committing mass
murder, he has no choice but to disappear, and he and his best
friend, Dominic (Stellan Skarsgard), who witnessed the killings,
escape into the French Foreign Legion.
</P>
<P>
   The story jumps ahead again. Guy is in Bosnia fighting for the
Serbs. One day while witnessing a fellow soldier (Sergej
Trifunovic) viciously brutalizing a pregnant Serbian woman who was
raped in a prison camp, he is suddenly overcome with revulsion.
When the woman, Vera (Natasa Ninkovic), goes into labor, he helps
her deliver a baby girl whom she initially rejects. The remainder
of the movie follows the threesome's journey to a safe harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savior'' is the story of two people who have been dehumanized
by war reaffirming the basic human connections without which
civilization couldn't continue. Guy, who has spent years devoured
by bitterness, finds a reason to live in trying to save the baby.
Vera, who turns out to speak fluent English, also emerges from
unspeakable trauma with a tentative will to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Orr's biting dialogue and Quaid's stoic, dry-eyed
performance do their best to undercut the more maudlin aspects of
this redemptive fable. And despite its lurking sentimentality, the
movie does its excruciating job. It conveys the nihilistic essence
of war with the force of a kick in the gut.

`BABE' SEQUEL GETS TOO DARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the whimsical swine named Babe tramped into
theaters three years ago, the film was initially perceived as a
cute little movie about a talking pig who thought he was a
sheepdog. Then it was nominated _ and deservedly so _ for seven
Oscars, including one for Best Picture, and ``Babe'' suddenly had
the aura of artistic respectability.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst thing that could have happened to the little
porker.
</P>
<P>
   With the inevitable sequel, ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' director
George Miller (who produced and co-wrote the first film) labors
under delusions of grandeur. He's so determined to prove that
``Babe'' is more than a cute little pig movie that he destroys the
franchise's delightful charm in the process. To market this dark,
dreary Fellini-esque shambles as a kid's movie is the ultimate pig
in a poke. The only children who will appreciate this movie are the
ones starved for a little more somber poignancy in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' picks up immediately where the first
movie left off. Babe and his owner, laconic farmer Arthur Hoggett
(James Cromwell), triumphantly return from winning the sheepherding
competition, heroes to the townsfolk who once mocked them. The good
times don't last for long, though (Miller wants us to begin moping
as soon as possible), and an accident involving a well _ and caused
by Babe _ cripples Farmer Hoggett. Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski)
must then deal with the men in suits with pale faces and soulless
eyes who come to foreclose on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: Cash in on Babe's popularity by accepting an
appearance fee from a fair in the city. Hoggett reluctantly agrees
but makes his wife promise to ensure the pig's safety. That's
easier said than done. Miller's metropolis is a harsh, frightening
place populated by gun-toting, frowning people who will eagerly
knock you down, take everything you have and then kick you for good
measure. In this weirdly stylized world, the women wear string
bikinis, and the men dress in leather and chains that seem to be
taken from Miller's ``Mad Max'' wardrobe leftovers (he directed the
gritty Mel Gibson-starring flicks).
</P>
<P>
   Refuge is found in Flealands Hotel, where Babe meets stray dogs
and cats and a family of chimpanzees who perform with a pitiful
clown (Mickey Rooney). There's also a sad-eyed orangutan named
Thelonius, a melancholy creature Miller seems more interested in
than Babe, given the number of heart-rending ways he films the
animal. (I guess there are only so many mournful ways to shoot a
pig.) Babe teaches all these critters that a kind and steady heart
can endure against the darkness of the city. It's a painful lesson
to endure, both for the pig and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who also co-wrote and co-produced ``Babe: Pig in the
City,'' made the decision to film the movie as a mixture of wildly
fantastic images, tragicomic lyricism, burlesque, satire and
pathos. It was a significant blunder, largely unsuited to the
material. While there are many beautifully filmed images in this
movie, Miller's work, taken as a whole, comes off as self-indulgent
egotism. It would have been better that the movie dissolve into
mushy treacle than this misguided homage to self-conscious cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the first film had its share of darkness. Babe, after
all, was originally ticketed as the centerpiece of the Hoggetts'
holiday meal. But ``Babe: Pig in the City'' often wallows in the
blackness with its scenes of animal cruelty. (A dog hangs from a
bridge on a chain, drowning in a brook. A goldfish slowly
asphyxiates. And so on and so on ...) You don't have to pander to
kids, but you don't have to smother them in misery, either. Miller
would do well to learn that lesson should he decide in the future
to make another pig movie designed for audiences instead of
film-school students.

   The idealized image of Thanksgiving is of generations of family
crowded around an 18-foot-long table laden with the fruits of our
combined labor: Cousin Liz's sweet potatoes, Aunt Mary's Jell-O
salad and Grandma's rich pumpkin pies.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of us, the family is a close-knit group of three or
four, or even two. There's no need for us to cook enough food to
feed the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. And there, indeed, lies another
reason to be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   With just a couple of hours in the kitchen, a feast (with plenty
of leftovers for the mandatory post-ballgame sandwiches) can
beautifully grace your table. Thanksgiving becomes an intimate,
more thoughtful affair.

<P>
   _ 1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   _ Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   _ 3/4 cup reduced-sodium chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   _ Sauteed fresh mushrooms; see note, optional
</P>
<P>
   _ Mashed potatoes; see note, optional
</P>
<P>
   _ 2 teaspoons chopped chives, optional for garnish
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: If desired, saute 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms (button,
shiitake or cremini) in 1 tablespoon butter and 1 teaspoon olive
oil on medium-high heat. Cook until mushrooms are softened and
lightly browned and liquid has evaporated. Season to taste with
garlic salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   This dish is great served on mashed potatoes. Make them your
favorite way, but use less butter. Instead, add some prepared
horseradish, about 2 teaspoons per 3 pounds of potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Dust turkey on both sides with flour.
</P>
<P>
   Heat oil in a large, nonstick skillet on medium-high heat. Add
onions and brown, stirring occasionally, about 5-7 minutes. Add
thyme, Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar and pepper. Stir to
combine. Place turkey, skin side up, in a 9-inch square baking pan.
Pour onion mixture on top, so that some stays on top of turkey and
some falls into the pan. Pour broth around turkey. Cover loosely
with aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 45 minutes. Remove foil and bake 30-45 more minutes, or
until an instant-read thermometer reads 170 degrees when inserted
into the thickest part of the turkey breast. Allow turkey to rest
10 minutes. Cut into slices.
</P>
<P>
   PRESENTATION: If using, spoon potatoes on platter. Place sliced
turkey on top, overlapping slightly like a fan. Spoon sauce on top.
If desired, top with sauteed mushrooms and sprinkle with chives.
Serve immediately.

A VERY GOOD `VERY BAD THING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 { Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the last couple of months, we've had the yuppie
black comedy ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' the cowboy black
comedy ``Clay Pigeons,'' the psychosexual black comedy
``Happiness'' and, today, the who-got-Drew-Barrymore-pregnant?
black comedy ``Home Fries.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this whole subgenre of outrageous sexuality,
over-the-top violence and runaway misanthropy is getting pretty
tired. It needs a shot in the arm, creatively speaking, now that
shotgun blasts to the head and nether regions have lost their
provocative edge.
</P>
<P>
   Good timing, then, for Peter Berg's black comedy on steroids,
``Very Bad Things.'' A ferociously offensive, often hilarious,
nonstop screech of a movie, it has two things going for it that the
others don't: an absurd moral core and absolutely no manners.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, an actor on the ``Chicago Hope'' television series, wrote
his feature directing debut out of, he says, a sense of deep
disappointment with the institution of marriage. ``VBF'' indeed
plays like a groom-to-be's most psychotic jitters, but there's more
going on here than that. While Berg spins the film around a
thoroughly unoriginal plot nub _ bachelor party turns ugly when the
stripper gets killed _ the ever-escalating complications he's
dreamt up are not only audacious, they've got real psychological
resonance.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone behaves despicably, but at least Berg tries, with
bludgeoning commitment, to make us understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Off for a last, necessary fling in Vegas before marrying the
self-absorbed, high-maintenance Laura (Cameron Diaz, doing the
polar opposite of her ultra-appealing ``Something About Mary''
act), likable lunk Kyle (``Swingers' '' Jon Favreau) indulges in
drugs and drink aplenty with his buds: battling brothers Michael
(Jeremy Piven) and Adam (Daniel Stern), quiet oddball Charles
(Leland Orser) and take-charge real-estate creep Robert (Christian
Slater).
</P>
<P>
   Truly _ if unaccountably _ in love with Laura, Kyle demurs when
the evening's entertainment (porn actress Kobe Tai, evidently
thrilled to be in a misogynistic movie that wasn't shot on
videotape) offers extra pleasures for a price. Doesn't matter,
though; in this movie's sado-puritan view of the universe, guilt by
association deserves as much punishiment as multiple mortal sins.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, dismemberment and midnight burials in the desert ensue,
but our party boys make it back to Southern California uncaught.
Except, that is, in the inescapable prison of their own minds. With
a fatalistic vengeance, guilt and paranoia eat away at the guys,
leading to breakdowns, vehicular malfeasance and lots of
unnecessary violence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, nothing is going to prevent Laura from having the
perfect wedding.
</P>
<P>
   No one is safe here. Moms, crippled kids, minorities,
self-motivation experts _ even that most sacred of movie
characters, the family dog _ are all fair game for Berg's vicious
humor. Marry that to escalating, graphic brutality and ``Very Bad
Things'' is obviously not going to play well with delicate souls.
Expect many strong stomachs to be turned by it as well.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're going to make a black comedy these days, there's
no point if you don't take it to the wall. Berg does, at 100 miles
an hour, with all brake lines cut. ``Very Bad Things'' is totally
nasty, with no apologies, no quarter given and a truly subversive
spirit, not just an entertaining facsimile of subversiveness. It's
an exercise in immensely poor taste that, at its very best moments,
makes you question your fundamental assumptions of what taste
should be.

RETAILERS ARE OPTIMISTIC AS SHOPPERS HIT THE STORES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KATHRYN HOPPER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a lot of shoppers, Lee Meaders and Charlotte Masters are
feeling comfortable about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meaders, a mortgage company worker from North Richland Hills
near Fort Worth, Texas, and Masters, who was visiting from San
Antonio, said they plan to spend at least as much as last year on
holiday presents. Still, Meaders and Masters won't exactly be
shelling out as if they've hit the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to be good and write down a list before I go out,''
said Meaders, who was lugging shopping bags through Fort Worth
Outlet Square this week. ``I don't want to do a lot of impulse
buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the tumult of the past year, retailers will likely settle
for a lot of shoppers like Meaders and Masters. People in the
industry are fairly optimistic as they head into the important
holiday shopping season, which accounts for the bulk of many
stores' sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Most predict respectable sales gains of 4 percent to 5 percent
in stores open at least a year. That's enough to make the season as
good as last year, when retailers enjoyed their best holiday in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears like a lot of things are going in our favor,'' said
Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of member services at the National
Retail Federation. ``We didn't launch an attack against Iraq, we've
finally seen some cold weather and the stock market seems to have
rebounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Most shoppers say they plan on spending the same amount or
slightly more on presents this year. A survey by American Express
found that shoppers who responded plan to spend an average of 4
percent more on holiday gifts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, retailers said they feared that the late summer
stock market slide would dampen shopping plans. Those fears faded
as the market rebounded and the Fed trimmed interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are generally upbeat,'' said David Edmondson, executive
vice president of Fort Worth-based Tandy Corp. and chief operating
officer of Radio Shack. ``Unemployment is low and interest rates
continue to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers have tempered their optimism with a dose of reality.
Last year, many chains did not meet sales projections and were
forced to take margin-eating markdowns in late December.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avoid that fate this year, J.C. Penney decreased its
inventory levels by a half-percentage point going into November.
The Plano, Texas-based retailer said it plans to use its catalog
operations to replenish fashion items that catch shoppers' fancy.
</P>
<P>
   On Thanksgiving Day, Penney's will roll out an advertising
campaign that spotlights specific gift items such as $49.99
televisions and $24.99 Pillow Pets _ pillows shaped like stuffed
animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing customers have told us is there's a sameness to
everything at retail,'' said John T. Cody, chief operating officer
at Penney's. ``We want to give them something unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders say this Christmas could be a tough one for
traditional department stores, as shoppers flock to discounters and
specialty stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Discounters' price advantage will help them, and specialty
stores have figured out what the customer wants,'' said John
Konarski, director of research at the International Council of
Shopping Centers.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are also struggling to staff stores in a tight labor
market. George Gillen, a retail consultant at
PricewaterhouseCoopers in Dallas, said consumers will have to
endure longer lines and scant sales help as they make their
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may get frustrated, but you'll wait because you have to
buy gifts and you figure it's just as bad everywhere else,'' Gillen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some malls are extending their shopping hours and encouraging
shoppers to come early or late to avoid crowds.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, shoppers waited until the last few days before
Christmas to do most of their buying. Almost half of American
shoppers don't start their Christmas buying until mid-November, and
23 percent wait until December, according to the International Mass
Retailers Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no big toy this year, no Cabbage Patch doll,'' said
Marvin Girouard, chief executive officer at Pier 1 Imports, a Fort
Worth-based decorative home furnishings retailer. ``So people might
wait and buy later, buying things on sale.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, many shoppers may put off holiday shopping until the
day after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Van Kleeck said he expects Dec. 26 to be the biggest shopping
day of the year as people flock to make returns, use their gift
certificates and take advantage of post-holiday markdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after will be a bonanza for retailers,'' Van Kleeck
said.

DO YOU LIKE JERRY SPRINGER ENOUGH TO PART WITH $7.50?

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Are the guests on ``The Jerry Springer Show''
stupid or moronic?
</P>
<P>
   The movie ``Ringmaster'' answers that burning question. The
answer is yes.
</P>
<P>
   A fictionalized account of life (if you can call it that) behind
the scenes of a sleazy daytime chat show, ``Ringmaster'' stars
Springer as a bemused, country music-playin',
slightly-appalled-with-himself host named Jerry.
</P>
<P>
   His life of embarrassed celebrity is contrasted with those of
two typical guest units: a sexually uninhibited young woman (Jaime
Pressly), her mama (Molly Hagan) and the lovers they share; and the
hunky Demond (Michael Jai White) and the three best girlfriends
(Wendy Raquel Robinson, Tangie Ambrose, Nicki Micheaux) who've all
been his women.
</P>
<P>
   The level of humor here is, in a word, broad; the level of
conversation, loud. The combination makes for a few laughs,
markedly more groans and an overall feeling of time and effort
wasted.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Neil Abramson, makes a few 11th-hour stabs at
suggesting the freakish guests enjoy the same full range of human
characteristics as do those of us who snicker at Springer's show.
But it's not just too little, too late; their expressions of love
and reason are just as cartoonish as their displays of dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Springer himself comes off as an affable, self-deprecating type.
When he's not sporting a ``What have I done?'' grimace, he's
passionately arguing that his show is about people, not trash.
</P>
<P>
   It would be elitist to claim otherwise, about the TV show
anyway. But the made-up characters in ``Ringmaster'' register a few
rungs down on the evolutionary scale from the stars of ``Babe: Pig
in the City.''
</P>
<P>
   They don't speak as well, either.

`CENTRAL STATION' OFFERS SATISFYING TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ That old foreign movie staple, adorable orphan kid
brings joy into crabby old person's life, gets a nice, tough
workout in the Brazilian film ``Central Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Walter Salles' often realistic, sometimes mildly
magical road movie has all the standard heart-tugging features as
well. There's an adorable, unkempt moppet (Vinicius de Oliveira)
who can shed tears on cue while maintaining a brave expression.
Then there's the series of unnervingly helpful strangers who, for
all their poverty and unrewarded hard work, happily reassure us
that most people are wonderful.
</P>
<P>
   Having none of this, though _ and thereby saving the project
from terminal twinkliness _ is Fernanda Montenegro. The 67-year-old
actress, who you may recognize from the Brazilian features ``Hour
of the Star'' and ``They Don't Wear Black Tie,'' creates such a
genuinely, even gleefully, selfish sourpuss here that her eventual
redemption plays like a real victory of the human spirit rather
than just a manipulative cliche.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's Dora is a retired, never-loved-nor-married
schoolteacher who supplements her pension by writing letters for
illiterates at Rio de Janeiro's main train station. At night, she
takes the letters home to her crummy apartment, shares them and
derisive laughs with her only friend (Marilia Pera) and shoves them
in a drawer, never to be mailed.
</P>
<P>
   De Oliveira's Josue is the son of one of Dora's hapless
customers, a young woman who's trying to contact the boy's no good
drunk of a father somewhere in the vast, northern interior. When
Josue's mother is hit by a bus, Dora learns she can make good bucks
by turning the 9-year-old over to a private adoption agency.
Informed that kids his age are only marketable for organ
transplants, Dora is uncharacteristically moved by conscience and
engineers an escape. With both of their lives at stake, it's time
to hit the road and hunt down Josue's father.
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully shot against the semi-arid landscape of Brazil's
Bahia district, the trip naturally becomes a journey of discovery
for the unwanted boy and the bitter old woman. Setbacks abound, and
they keep running into Christians of wildly divergent stripes (for
all of that, Salles refrains from posing religion as the answer to
Dora and Josue's problems).
</P>
<P>
   While the inevitable tough love blooms between our reluctant
fellow travelers, the real emotional heart of ``Central Station''
belongs to Dora, as Montenegro gradually reveals the
disappointments that have made her what she is and the hopes that
keep her going. It's a world class performance that uplifts a
formula foreign film.

`ISAIAH BERLIN': FOXES, HEDGEHOGS AND THE DEFENSE OF FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For an intellectual never to have written a major book, a
magisterial treatment of some large subject, would normally be a
disqualification for the Great Thinkers' Hall of Fame, measured by
things like frequency of mention in The New York Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   But when Isaiah Berlin died last year at 88, it was clear from
the testimonials, his knighthood, his long list of prizes and the
endurance of his influence that a major figure had passed from the
scene; this despite the fact that Berlin wrote mostly essays and
gave lectures, leaving behind a rather meager production of books.
</P>
<P>
   In this admirable, clearheaded and readable biography, Michael
Ignatieff explains not only why Berlin is celebrated, but also why
the celebration is justified.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's best-known essay was probably ``The Hedgehog and the
Fox,'' in which he breaks down writers and thinkers into two
categories: those who know many things (foxes) and those who know
one big thing (hedgehogs). Berlin, Ignatieff writes, seemed at
first glance to be ``an archfox _ nimble, cunning, quick-witted,
darting from subject to subject, eluding pursuit.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ignatieff continues, Berlin's contribution involved his
mastery of one big thing, namely ``the theme of freedom and its
betrayal.'' His place in the 20th-century pantheon of political
philosophers came from the clarity and the narrowness of his
concept of freedom, forged in the experience of freedom's battle
with fascism and communism.
</P>
<P>
   The most important of Berlin's essays in this sense is ``Two
Concepts of Liberty,'' delivered first as a lecture at Oxford in
1958. That essay distinguished between ``negative liberty,'' which
is letting people alone, and ``positive liberty,'' which, while
theoretically aimed at emancipating human potential, has ended up
putting coercive power into the hands of despots.
</P>
<P>
   In describing Berlin's contribution, Ignatieff has produced a
model biography of the man of ideas. He lucidly explicates Berlin's
work even as he draws a lively and vivid portrait of a major figure
whose crooked path from Russian obscurity to Oxfordian fame was
full of events, encounters with interesting others and even a bit
of skulduggery.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin was born in Riga, Latvia, in 1909 to a family of
prosperous timber merchants, and while he experienced at close hand
the upheavals of war and revolution, he escaped almost all terrible
personal hardship. After a short time in St. Petersburg following
the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia in 1917, the Berlin family
emigrated to England.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, who was 12 at the time, was overweight and Jewish and
spoke no English: problems in the England of that era. Soon,
however, he had become a charmer, a talker with a knack for
epigrams and an ability to insinuate himself into powerful circles.
``He became a master at fitting in,'' Ignatieff writes, ``at the
price of lingering self-dislike.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlin went on to a brilliant career at Oxford, election to a
prestigious fellowship at All Souls College (the first Jew to be so
honored), and friendships with a glittering cast of characters.
Ignatieff describes revealing meetings and exchanges with, among
many others, Victor Rothschild, Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, David
Ben-Gurion, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Sigmund Freud, John Maynard
Keynes, Boris Pasternak, John F. Kennedy and Winston Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Berlin's friendships and encounters came out of his
rapid rise into the British intellectual stratosphere. He was not
only a popular teacher and lecturer at Oxford but also a regular on
the British Broadcasting Corp., which broadcast many of his
speeches. He also came to the attention of the British-U.S.
political elite by spending World War II in Washington, reporting
to London on U.S. politics and public opinion while, in
semi-clandestine, near double-agent fashion, advancing the cause of
Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   The most moving encounter recounted by Ignatieff was that
between Berlin and the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova. Berlin,
who had the advantage of speaking Russian, was sent to Moscow in
1945 to write a report on Soviet foreign policy. Instead, he wrote
the first detailed report on Stalin's war against Russian culture,
one infused with a tragic understanding of the terrible fate of the
Russian literati under Stalin. He met three times with Akhmatova,
who lived under constant surveillance in a ``bare and denuded
room'' in Leningrad and was ``consigned to darkness and purgatory''
by Stalin and his henchmen, partly as a result of those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's experience with Akhmatova and the other Russian poets,
who always ``remained the gold standard, the touchstone of moral
integrity'' for him, stayed with him and became the essential
element in his formulation of the two concepts of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   A wise restraint is central to Berlin's thinking, an acceptance
of the fact that tragedy inheres in all choice, because there is no
choice that leads to the solution of all problems. An anti-utopian
point of view, in other words, required a certain resignation to
social imperfection and the conviction that the first task of
government is similar to the first task of physicians, to do no
harm.
</P>
<P>
   What the age calls for, Berlin wrote, ``is not (as we are often
told) more faith, or stronger leadership, or more scientific
organization.'' He continued, ``Rather it is the opposite _ less
Messianic ardor, more enlightened skepticism, more toleration of
idiosyncrasies.'' Or, as Ignatieff summarizes, ``It was individual
freedom, to choose well or ill, which had to be defended, not some
ultimate vision of the human good.''
</P>
<P>
   This basic idea, this one big thing, was attacked on all sides
for justifying a kind of right-wing laissez-faire, for failing to
condemn harshly enough the atrocities of communism. But it would be
difficult in light of the experience of the century to come up with
a clearer and more humane political credo than the one we owe to
Isaiah Berlin.

`HOME FRIES' A BIT HALF-BAKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 { Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Home Fries'' tries hard to be quirky _ too hard,
in fact. The effort shows. Its dimwitted characters seem to have
come straight from an appearance on ``The Jerry Springer Show,''
only somewhere along the way they lost their low-life credibility.
That problem extends to the film itself, which is less a movie than
a series of interconnected sketches. Certainly there are some
amusing moments, but since you never believe in the characters, you
have a hard time becoming involved in their story.
</P>
<P>
   The social life of the Texas small town in ``Home Fries''
revolves around the greasy counter and plastic tables of the
Burger-Matic franchise. Sally (Drew Barrymore) mans the
drive-through counter, hiding her eight-month pregnancy beneath the
window. The father of her baby is an old lout named Henry (Chris
Ellis), who deceived the good-hearted Sally about his marital
status and now won't own up to either the relationship or the
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough, Henry gets his comeuppance, courtesy of a couple of
weekend warriors piloting a military helicopter. They just mean to
scare the guy, but it goes much deeper than that. Much deeper. It
turns out that the two National Guard pilots (Luke Wilson, Jake
Busey) have ulterior motives for their domestic terrorism, as does
Henry's ``grieving'' widow (the marvelous Catherine O'Hara).
</P>
<P>
   Since everyone here seems to either be related to each other or
desirous of such a connection, it's no surprise that the film's one
romantic coupling (Barrymore and Wilson, a real-life pair as well)
employs a family tree more twisted than a cypress. Can a man be a
good father and a big brother, too? It's a quandary best left to
Solomon _ or Springer _ to sort out.
</P>
<P>
   The darkly comic script (written several years ago by Vince
Gilligan, currently the supervising producer of ``The X-Files'')
has a few inspired scenes, among them a foiled robbery at the
Burger-Matic and a charming Lamaze session between Wilson and
Barrymore. But despite the twists and turns, ``Home Fries'' has a
rather thin premise at its core and, ultimately, doesn't take you
any place too interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Barrymore, with a huge belly and curly hair straight out of
Little Orphan Annie, is largely wasted here. Barrymore certainly
can be quite fetching when she's sweet and smiling (see ``The
Wedding Singer''), but, if given the chance, she can do a whole lot
more, too. (See ``Ever After.'')
</P>
<P>
   The film's treasure is O'Hara as a widow and mother whose
passive-aggressive tendencies could fill a dozen psychological case
books. O'Hara takes the character to places you never would have
imagined. It's too bad the movie doesn't always have the courage _
or the inspiration _ to do the same.

<P>
   I heard a story that may or may not be true, but it certainly
makes a point. After World War II, inspectors were going through
the food depots somewhere in France and discovered that most of the
supplies had been ravaged by rats.
</P>
<P>
   One observant inspector was supposed to have said: ``We can be
sure of only one thing _ the rats were French. The cinnamon is
untouched.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Americans love cinnamon, that's about how much we
French don't. Vanilla is the typical Frenchman's favorite flavor,
so you can imagine the adjustment I had to make when I came to work
in this country. Fortunately for me, I've come to like cinnamon _
as long as it's not overpowering. These puff-pastry cookies are
perfect for my taste: they sandwich just a dollop of
cinnamon-scented pastry cream.
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for these festive cookies, great for the
holidays, came from a classic French petit four: the allumette, or
match, a thin rectangle of puff pastry topped with a baked-on
glaze.
</P>
<P>
   For my cookies, made with store-bought puff pastry, the pastry
is rolled paper thin and spread with royal icing, a blend of
confectioners' sugar and egg white. Then _ and here's a feature
that makes them right for the holidays _ the pastry can be frozen
for a month.
</P>
<P>
   When you want cookies, all you have to do is defrost, cut out (I
make these star-shaped) and bake in a double process: first you put
the cookies into a hot oven to set the icing, which pulls away from
the pastry, so that you can lift it off and keep it aside; next you
bake the bottoms until they're puffed and perfectly caramelized, a
trick to avoid the common problem of soggy half-done puff pastry.
Give the cookies their pastry cream filling, and you're set.
</P>
<P>
   You can add ground cinnamon to the icing if you want more of
that spice, or sprinkle the icing with colored sugar or even
sprinkles. You can vary the pastry cream, too. Make a plain pastry
cream and flavor it with orange zest, instant coffee or cocoa
powder; or, if you're French, go for vanilla.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes plus 4 hours chilling and drying
</P>
<P>
   { pound packaged all-butter puff pastry
</P>
<P>
   2 cups whole milk
</P>
<P>
   3 cinnamon sticks
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   4 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   4 large egg whites
</P>
<P>
   5{ cups confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   1. On a sheet of parchment paper, roll out the puff pastry into
a paper-thin rectangle. Prick it deeply all over with the tines of
a fork. Slide the paper and pastry onto a baking sheet. Cover with
plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare the pastry cream: In a medium saucepan, combine the
milk and cinnamon sticks. Place over high heat and bring to a boil,
then immediately remove from the heat. Cover and allow to sit for 5
minutes. Strain, and discard the cinnamon sticks. In a medium bowl,
combine the sugar, flour and cornstarch; whisk to blend. In another
bowl, whisk 4 eggs until frothy, then add them to the dry
ingredients. Whisk the mixture vigorously, and while whisking, pour
the hot milk into the bowl. Return the mixture to the saucepan, and
place over medium heat. Whisk without stopping until the pastry
cream comes to a boil; cook 1 minute longer. Pour the cream onto a
piece of plastic wrap laid on a baking sheet. Cover with plastic
wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   3. Prepare the royal icing: In a mixer with a paddle attachment,
or by hand with a whisk, beat the egg whites on low speed until
foamy. Gradually add the confectioners' sugar, and beat until the
icing is shiny and thick as taffy. Keep at room temperature until
needed.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove the puff pastry from the refrigerator. Using an offset
spatula, spread the royal icing evenly over the pastry. Set aside
at room temperature until the icing dries, 1 to 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   5. To bake the cookies, preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Use a
star-shaped (or any other shape) cookie cutter to cut out the
cookies. Release the cookies from the cutter by blowing into the
cutter. Put the cookies on a baking sheet lined with parchment
paper, and place in the oven. Immediately turn the oven off and
bake until the icing tops separate from the puff pastry bottoms.
Remove from the oven, and return the oven to 400 degrees. Carefully
pull the icing tops off the pastry bottoms, and place the tops on a
large plate; set aside. Return the bottoms to the oven and bake
until the pastry is golden and caramelized, about 10 to 15 minutes.
Cool the cookies on a rack.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, whisk the chilled pastry cream to loosen it, and
put it in a pastry bag with a star tip. Pipe a little pastry cream
onto each pastry bottom (or put on a small dollop with a spoon).
Cap with a royal icing top.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: About 60 cookies.

BY THE BOOK: RICE AND ITS WORLDLY GUISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you read one of Jeffrey Alford and Naomi Duguid's
cookbooks, there is no sense that they have been home in their
kitchen dreaming up novel book ideas and recipes for Americans.
Instead, they seem to take you on the road with them, weighed down
with a backpack, scribbling notes, eating with your hands and
wondering what day of the week it is.
</P>
<P>
   Alford and Ms. Duguid are married and they write as a team,
traveling the world and studying food and diet through a cultural
lens. Their latest book, ``Seductions of Rice'' (Artisan, $35), is
simply stunning.
</P>
<P>
   The book's many location photographs, taken by the authors, show
how rice is harvested, how it is sold and often how it is cooked.
They emanate life: you feel the steam curling up from a pot of rice
in Thailand and wetting your nose, and the candid stare of an
Indian woman hauling fish home from a river.
</P>
<P>
   After a section of basic information, the book is divided by
region, from Senegal to Mexico. In the Thai chapter, for instance,
Alford and Ms. Duguid discuss the essential flavors in Thai cooking
and the many types of rices used. Basic cooking instructions are
given. But most of the chapter is taken up by Thai recipes.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of recipes that actually involve rice is perhaps
the most surprising thing about the book. The authors are careful
not to overstate rice's role in the gastronomy of certain cultures,
and they do not try to enhance its sophistication. It is often
cooked simply _ steamed or boiled _ then served with meat or
vegetable dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The chapter on Central Asia and Persia, for instance, contains
two recipes for everyday Persian rice, and is followed by recipes
like Persian lamb kebabs with sumac and rhubarb-lamb stew.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everything I cooked was flawless. The Thai grilled red
snapper with basil was sharp on the tongue. Its soft texture was
the perfect contrast to the sticky rice. The grilled eggplant salad
was great for the first few bites _ tart and powerful _ but grew
increasingly salty. With a little less Thai fish sauce, it would be
fantastic.
</P>
<P>
   In the Indian chapter, the Kerala coconut chicken curry was
blazing with heat from chilies, but was balanced with a fragrant
masala paste and coconut milk. The spicy yogurt sauce with banana,
made with a paste of mustard seed, cayenne, coconut and a pinch of
turmeric, was delicious, if odd: it lay between a condiment and a
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best recipe out of the 10 that I tried was the
aromatic rice pudding from India. As it cooks, the milk reduces,
and just about every ounce of flavor is coaxed out of the cardamom
pods and cinnamon, leaving a soupy, sweet and wildly flavored
reduction of milk thickened with rice.

`THE MIRROR': NO TIME FOR STARDOM ON TEHRAN'S BUSY STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   School has just let out, and a little girl named Mina (Mina
Mohammad-Khani) stands scowling at the curb of a crowded
thoroughfare in the heart of Tehran while waiting for her mother.
When no one comes, Mina, who has one arm in a sling, becomes
impatient. A friend of a teacher volunteers to take her by
motorbike to a bus stop. But before they arrive, Mina impulsively
dashes off and hops on a bus that proves to be heading in the wrong
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Once aboard, she overhears the conversations of a number of
Iranians. An old woman complains about the cruelty and ingratitude
of her children. A group of young women discuss a cheating husband.
All over the city, radios are broadcasting the play-by-play of a
soccer match between Iran and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   These opening scenes in Jafar Panahi's powerful film ``The
Mirror'' are so realistic that the movie has the feel of a
documentary made with a hidden camera. The teeming streets and
intimate conversations convey a remarkably intense picture of a
particular city's mood and texture at a specific moment. If that
mood is predominantly optimistic, there is an undercurrent of
discontent and bitterness in the women's conversations.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Miss Mohammad-Khani conveys an amazing
richness of character. Impulsive, stubborn and feisty, but
increasingly worried as she becomes lost in the big city, Mina
often wears the hard, critical expression of a middle-aged woman.
It is difficult to imagine that when this strong-willed girl grows
up, she will readily submit to Islamic laws severely restricting
women's freedom.
</P>
<P>
   At the halfway point, ``The Mirror'' takes a surprising turn.
Miss Mohammad-Khani removes her sling, announces she's tired of
acting and runs off. A movie that at first appeared to be a
neo-realist gem, reminiscent of ``The Bicycle Thief,'' abruptly
turns into a complicated exploration of cinematic illusion and
reality as the movie continues to be shot with Miss Mohammed-Khani
going in and out of character according to whim. In some scenes,
she is Mina (but minus the sling), in others she is ``herself.''
The more she changes back and forth, the more the two Minas blur
together.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the film, the audio begins to fade in and out, as the
young actress' (or the cameraman's) body microphone malfunctions.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the movie, the perspective has shifted from Mina
to the headstrong girl playing her to the frustrated (still largely
unseen) filmmakers watching their work-in-progress fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Panahi, who is best known for the acclaimed 1995 film ``The
White Balloon,'' is a disciple of the Iranian filmmaker Abbas
Kiarostami, whose ultra-realistic films also deliberately undercut
their own verisimilitude by revealing the filmmaking process and
exploring the relation between the actors and their characters.
Like those films, ``The Mirror'' poses the deepest questions about
illusion, reality and filmmaking. Its portrait of Tehran is
unforgettable.

TV NOTES: CLOSE RACE FOR TOP RATINGS; `RUGRATS' AND NICKELODEON 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With only Wednesday night left in the November ratings sweep
period, the final standings are still very much in doubt; what is
not in doubt is that millions were spent to doctor some prime-time
schedules that will enter the holiday season still looking pale and
sickly.
</P>
<P>
   The headline that NBC has tried almost desperately to avoid may
still be written. For the first time, Fox may beat NBC in the only
race that both networks count: pre-eminence among the
18-to-49-year-old audience that advertisers most covet. As of
Monday night, the two networks were in a virtual dead heat; Fox
executives predicted Wednesday that the photo would show a
flat-footed tie.
</P>
<P>
   What is indisputable is Fox's growing ability to take young male
viewers away from NBC. Fox will beat NBC in every male category.
``I think whatever the results, we're coming out of November
sending the message that Fox is hip and cool again,'' said David
Hill, the chairman of Fox Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly close is the race to win among total viewers, where
CBS, thanks to its store of viewers over 50, has been pressing NBC.
</P>
<P>
   What a victory will mean is certainly debatable, especially for
NBC, which has seen its sweep dominance end, if not its four-year
sweep winning streak among those young adults. NBC pulled out
almost every stop over the last two weeks, tossing in theatrical
movies to supplant its gasping Monday night comedies, and using up
valuable original episodes of other series to fill holes left by
failed new shows.
</P>
<P>
   The price NBC paid to stave off defeat is eclipsed only by the
price Fox paid to try to steal a win. The network essentially
tossed out every weak show on its schedule, (much easier for Fox
because it programs only 15 hours to the other networks' 22)
filling in with video specials aimed at rubberneckers, featuring
attacks by alligators and endless car crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Fox may have paid as much as $80 million for bragging rights.
That was the cost of the film ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,''
which Fox, in almost total disregard of its long-term value, tossed
into the sweep competition twice within 24 days.
</P>
<P>
   ABC did not have a great month, falling off about 9 percent
among young adult viewers. But at least some of ABC's new shows are
holding their own. ABC's problem is its abysmal showing on
Thursdays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ABC may also have to reconsider the financial wisdom of using
big movies for ratings: the network spent more than $20 million for
``Mission Impossible'' and got about 10 percent of the Thursday
audience for its money.
</P>
<P>
   As for CBS, it played this sweep more conservatively,
pre-empting the fewest hours of any network, hoping to build a
following for its regular series. That appears to be working in a
few places, notably Monday, when ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' is
emerging as a hit, and Tuesday when ``JAG'' has begun to draw a
large if not very young audience.
</P>
<P>
   But CBS still finds itself in the odd position of having the
most viewers, yet finishing fourth among both the
18-to-49-year-olds and the 25-to-54-year-olds that CBS always
argues are a better target for advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the smaller networks, WB continues to make good progress
with its teen-heavy audience; while UPN has had disastrous falloffs
across the board.
</P>
<P>
   One note that every network, broadcast or cable, might start to
pay more attention to. Overall television use by those hotly sought
18-to-49-year-olds fell by 4 percent this month.
</P>
<P>
   _ BILL CARTER
</P>
<P>
   First Lesson in Hype
</P>
<P>
   Even Nickelodeon, the cable network parents would least expect
to disappoint their children, could not resist a Hollywood-hype
gimmick last week that may have done exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugrats,'' one of the most popular children's shows in
history, normally appears weeknights at 7:30 p.m. But Nickelodeon
took it off the air from Tuesday through Friday last week to help
promote the movie based on the show, which opened Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At tune-in time for the television show, children were told,
``The Rugrats have gone to Hollywood, but they'll be back in their
normal time slot next Monday.'' Although the message was not overt
(``Go see the movie''), children naturally could be expected to ask
their parents what was meant by ``the Rugrats have gone to
Hollywood,'' and after hearing the explanation, their next question
would logically be, ``Can I go see the movie?''
</P>
<P>
   Albie Hecht, president of film and television entertainment at
Nickelodeon, said it was difficult for a family movie to get
attention today amid the clamor over ``the big blockbuster type
movies that compete with a G-rated or even a PG-rated family
movie'' for customers. ``We thought this would help generate
excitement for the movie,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The move also gave ``Hey Arnold!,'' Nickelodeon's second most
popular show, also scheduled for a feature film _ extra exposure,
filling in for ``Rugrats'' at 7:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugrats'' is not only the most popular children's show on
television but also normally the most-watched entertainment show on
cable aside from pro wrestling. That's a hefty audience to entice
to movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   If the television tease bothered some parents, it may have
helped the film. ``The Rugrats Movie'' had the fourth-best opening
weekend ($27.3 million gross) in animated-film history, behind
three Disney hits, ``The Lion King,'' ``Pocahontas'' and ``Toy
Story.''

   ``Nerds 2.0.1: A Brief History of the Internet'' (8 EST tonight
on WGTV) may be brief compared to the sprawling encyclopedia of Ken
Burns. But by the regular blinkety-blink standards of television,
it's practically an eternity: three full hours on, yes, the history
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, host Robert X. Cringley (PBS's online technology
columnist and host of the previous ``Triumph of the Nerds'') and
his producers try mightily to make their subject rock. The first 20
minutes zoom like an MTV documentary, flitting from subject to
subject (including a brief interview with an Internet ``sex
industry worker''). It's shallow and scattershot, and therefore
looks like much of the rest of TV instead of like PBS, as if your
English teacher stood outside the classroom before a lecture on
``Romeo and Juliet'' yelling ``Teenaged lust! Come and get it!''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Nerds'' finally settles down, though, it looks a lot like
PBS, and it tells an interesting story, although possibly at
greater length than most viewers will want to sit through. Cringley
takes us through his ``glossary of geek,'' explaining what
``digital'' means and how information is moved around on the Net in
``packets.''
</P>
<P>
   Cringley starts his tour with the launch of Sputnik in 1957 by
the Soviet Union, and the boost it gave to the U.S. space program.
It turns out that NASA gave us more than Tang and Walter Cronkite;
it also gave us Arpanet (for Advanced Research Projects Agency),
the forerunner of today's Internet, as the government and
universities began finding ways to share information among
computers. From that to Matt Drudge in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In additon to talking to big names like Bill Gates and Steven
Jobs, Cringely interviews lesser-knowns like Ray Tomlinson, the guy
who was fiddling around with the origins of e-mail, looked at his
typewriter keyboard and decided the ``(at)'' above the ``2'' key
had promise.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, though, the boys tinkering in their garages give
way to the venture capitalists, and the pioneering ``Soul of a New
Machine'' spirit starts being all about the money.

MR. KABC GETS WAKE-UP CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Marc (Mr. KABC) Germain, new interim morning host
at talk station KABC-AM (790), says waking up early may be the
hardest part of going up against 85 competitors on the radio dial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting up that early _ it was a big struggle today,'' he said
Friday, his first day in the bleary-eyed airshift that begins at 5
a.m. ``But it's very exciting to host morning drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Germain segued from talker KFI-AM (640) to KABC almost two years
ago. He's doing the q&AMP;a segment familiar to fans of his Mr. KABC
alter-ego in the first hour of the new morning program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the show is talking about topical issues and the
news of the day,'' he explained, ``which is what KABC does
throughout the day.''
</P>
<P>
   With the end of KABC's previous morning team of Ken Minyard and
Peter Tilden last Thursday, general-interest talker Joe Crummey
moved into Germain's newly vacated 9 p.m. weekday slot. Crummey
will continue his weekend hosting duties.
</P>
<P>
   Minyard, who handled the KABC morning show for 26 years, has
hinted of debuting a new program with his son as co-host, possibly
at forthcoming talk outlet KRLA-AM (1110), which goes on the air
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK, NEW YORK: Longtime record spinners Scott Muni and Dave
Herman were fired recently from New York's WNEW-FM, which has been
trying to make a go of a ``classic rock and classic jocks'' format.
</P>
<P>
   Muni and Herman are New York rock radio veterans. Herman worked
at the old progressive-rock WABC-FM, moving to WNEW in 1972 as
morning host until switching to nights 10 years later. After a
stint at WXRK-FM _ known locally as K-Rock _ he returned to WNEW as
morning man in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Muni, known as ``The Professor,'' has worked in New York radio
for five decades, starting at the old WMCA-AM in 1959 when Top 40
radio was in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, Muni moved to the legendary WABC-AM before signing on
at free-form rocker WOR-FM. In 1967, he joined WNEW, which had just
adopted a progressive-rock music mix.
</P>
<P>
   During his 31 years at WNEW, Muni served as program director,
operations manager and, for the most part, afternoon-drive host.
</P>
<P>
   HELLO AND GOODBYE: Ex-KHJ Boss Jock Charlie Tuna segues to
mornings Monday on adult-standards KLAC-AM (570), replacing Don
Imus who moves to KRLA. ... KLOS-FM (95.5) afternoon-drive host
Garth Kemp exits the station at the end of the year to focus on his
work as weatherman at KABC-TV (Channel 7).

NOT-HOMELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One example of Susan's improved status is that this Thanksgiving
she'll have leftovers. When you're homeless you can usually find a
free turkey dinner, but leftovers are for people with kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Susan was the one-eyed red-haired woman with the dog
and the cardboard sign standing on the sidewalk outside a gourmet
market in Santa Rosa. Because of her looks or her dog or the fact
she was asking for money from people who'd come shopping for a
special on French Brie, it was Susan's lucky spot and often she got
enough for a $38 motel room for herself and her dog.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago Susan told me her story and said what she
wished for 1998 was a new eye and a job, because no one was going
to hire her looking like she did.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people decided to invest in Susan, helping her to
get an eye prosthesis, enroll in a computer class and put together
enough money to move into an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Now, six months after Susan got off the street and started
working, it looks like her benefactors were right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am finally back in the rat race and I love it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day we had coffee together, like any two people
before work, talking about mothers and kids, diets, even hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   Susan's mother died this summer. She knew Susan's luck was off
but never that she was as desperate as homeless. ``It was good,
though, before she died I could tell her that I had my eye, a place
to live, a job and a boyfriend. She knew I was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan told her two sons all the details, giving them the
newspaper stories about her to read. Her older son, a 29-year-old
social worker, was embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me, `How could you do that?' I told him it is just
something that happened. It's over. It's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan's gained a little weight and she's boxed up some of her
snugger clothes to give away. She's delivering them to a woman who
once gave her a box of hand-me-downs. ``Now she can give mine to
someone else who needs them.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan used to start her hustle early in the morning, but now she
works late hours. She misses the mornings, she says, and having her
dog, Rinky, accompany her everywhere, but the job dictates her
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her relative prosperity, Susan has not become a
consumer. She doesn't have a phone because she doesn't want phone
bills. Some day, she says, she'll get a computer and talk to her
sons by e-mail. She frowns over the price of a scone and says she
can't believe what some people spend their money on. She doesn't
buy new clothes. This day she's wearing a purple top from Goodwill
but she has a new haircut.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite possession is a blue bicycle that one of her
benefactors, whom she calls ``my angel,'' gave to her and which
gets her to work and across town.
</P>
<P>
   Her only consumer purchase is a remote control to go with the TV
that her boyfriend found beside a trash bin.
</P>
<P>
   Ask her what her luxuries are and she says dried cranberries
which she eats like candy and ginger-flavored granola. Her favorite
entertainment is ``going to garage sales and blowing a buck or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan works at a convenience store in the same neighborhood
where she used to panhandle. Some of the same clerks from the fancy
store come in and buy their morning coffee but she doubts many of
them recognize her behind the cash register. ``I have two eyes
now,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   One who did was an assistant manager who Susan remembered as
friendlier than most when she stood on his sidewalk. ``He came into
my store and said he was being transferred. I bought him a soda.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan used to spend her days worrying about where to spend the
night. I ask her what homeless people worry about when they finally
get their own place and she says ``keeping it.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds, ``I try not to think about what I don't have. I guess
I worry about not having enough money, but doesn't everybody worry
about having enough money?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a slow process, moving off the streets, and even though
Susan maintains that she never felt that alien from the people who
handed her dollars from their car windows she's clearly crossed
over into the workaday world.
</P>
<P>
   After work she watches TV and crochets a blanket. Last summer
she grew tomatoes and roses in her back yard.
</P>
<P>
   She says that when she and her boyfriend can afford to fix their
car she wants to drive to Jenner and spend the night in the car.
For nostalgia's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that sound stupid?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   As we leave the coffee house a young man approaches with a gas
can and asks, ``Do either of you ladies have a quarter so I can buy
some gas?''
</P>
<P>
   I give him some change and ask Susan how much gas you can get
for a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   She says, ``He probably doesn't even have a car.''

A SURE CURE FOR THE GRAVY JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thursday, with an entire Thanksgiving meal marshaled and ready,
countless cooks will quake over the last detail: the gravy. When
it's a once-a-year thing, there are no guarantees that the gravy
will come out perfectly smooth, deeply flavored and nicely browned.
There is an alternative, though. And, unlike the concoctions that
come out of jars, it requires no apologies.
</P>
<P>
   It is a reduction sauce, the easiest, most malleable sauce a
cook can make. In fact, it is a precursor to pan gravy, but because
it doesn't use flour, there's no chance of lumps or a starchy,
uncooked taste.
</P>
<P>
   When you roast meat or poultry at high heat, bits of skin, meat
and fat stick to the surface of the pan, becoming dark brown and
concentrated; meat juices and rendered fat also gather at the
bottom. If you remove the roast, add liquid to the pan and place it
over high heat while stirring, you incorporate these essences into
that liquid. At the same time, some of the liquid evaporates _
reduces _ thereby intensifying its own flavor and thickening
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not essential, most reduction sauces are finished
with a bit of butter, oil or cream to add smoothness and even more
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of ways to enhance a reduction sauce. The
more flavorful the liquid used, the more intense the sauce. Stock
is the most common, but you can also add cream, milk, wine, sherry
or port, fruit or vegetable juice, or even the liquid from soaking
dried mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporating other flavors as you cook the sauce also boosts
intensity, and adding bits of cooked meat or vegetables to the
finished sauce can add bulk and texture. (Traditional turkey gravy,
for example, uses giblets simmered to produce stock.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's the recipe for a basic sauce, followed by a variation for
those who want a thicker, more traditional gravy, and a few ideas
for jazzing it up. The basic recipe can be doubled or tripled,
something to consider Thursday, when the crowd arrives. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BASIC REDUCTION SAUCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced shallot, onion or scallion
</P>
<P>
   3 cups stock or water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons softened butter or olive oil (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Remove the roast and pour off all but 1 or 2 tablespoons of
the cooking fat (if there are nonfatty juices in the skillet or
roasting pan, leave them there). Place the roasting pan over high
heat. (Use two burners if the pan is large.) Add the shallot and
cook, stirring, until it softens, about 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the liquid and cook, stirring and scraping to loosen the
brown bits at the bottom of the pan. Allow the liquid to boil for
about 5 minutes, or until about a third of it evaporates. (This is
a good time to carve the meat; the boiling liquid needs only
occasional stirring.)
</P>
<P>
   3. Turn the heat to medium-low and add the butter or oil, a
little at a time, stirring well after each addition. Taste and
season if necessary with salt and pepper, then serve with the
meat. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: About 2 cups. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To make thickened gravy: Combine 1 tablespoon cornstarch with \
cup cold water. (It will dissolve easily.) Stir this into the sauce
after incorporating the butter or oil, and heat, stirring, until
thickened, just about 1 minute. If you want even thicker gravy,
repeat with another tablespoon of cornstarch. &QL;

FOR SOME, TIME IS A REAL LUXURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rich, as Scott Fitzgerald (or one of his characters)
observed, really are different from the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   They wear fancier wristwatches.
</P>
<P>
   A recent full-page ad in a national newspaper pictured some of
the models available. They weren't called watches, of course. They
were ``timepieces'' and ``chronographs.''
</P>
<P>
   The page was dominated by one with a dial the diameter of a
grapefruit and a leather band of corresponding size. I don't know
if the picture was enlarged to attract attention, or if it was a
specialty item for eccentrics who prefer to strap their
chronographs to the calves of their legs.
</P>
<P>
   That particular one went for only $4,580 and was the cheapest,
if ``cheap'' is the word for it, on the page.
</P>
<P>
   The others were priced in a range from $5,200 to $14,400,
although the copy in the ad noted that the seller of these
timepieces carried no fewer than 7,000 styles, retailing from
$250,000 to as little as $25.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 model was not shown.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the seven pictured were described as having automatic
movements. Others were said to have quartz accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is you'd hope so! It would be pretty disappointing
to pay 10 or 15 grand for a watch _ excuse me, a chronograph _ and
find out the darned thing wasn't self-winding and lost a couple of
minutes a day.
</P>
<P>
   If price is the bad news, the good news is that these fine
instruments come with free lifetime battery replacement by trained
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   The last time I had a watch battery replaced it was by the clerk
behind the counter in a country hardware store. I didn't ask if she
was a trained professional, but the watch has worked fine for two
years going on three.
</P>
<P>
   For those folks for whom price is no consideration, buying a
chronograph like the ones in the ad must be an impulse kind of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the event your heavy schedule doesn't permit you to travel to
New York or Houston or Palm Beach or any of the other cities where
this purveyor of fine timepieces has establishments, you can pick
up the phone, dial an 800 number, and make the purchase while you
happen to be thinking of it.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part of all, you can wear your fabulous
automatically moving or quartz-accurate chronograph for two years
interest free with no down payment!
</P>
<P>
   After the words ``no down payment'' there was an asterisk about
one-fourth the size of the head of a pin. And, at the bottom of the
page, another asterisk, this one about half the size of the hole
you'd make if you pricked the paper with the point of the pin.
</P>
<P>
   After that second asterisk there was a single line of print that
ran the width of the page, in type so incredibly small that I
couldn't read it with my glasses on. So I got a magnifying glass
from the other room.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the magnifier it still was hard to make out. As nearly
as I could tell, it was saying the monthly minimum payment was $25.
</P>
<P>
   It also was explaining what would befall you in the way of
interest if you bought one of those quarter-million-dollar
timepieces and didn't get it paid off in the 24-month period of
grace.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you right now that every month, when I wrote my $25
check, the deadline would be in the back of my mind, right there
along with death and taxes. And those two years would be gone like
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, isn't it, that for anyone who can afford a watch like
that, time doesn't really matter so much. I guess that's another
way we're different.

THE GIPPER ON A ROCK? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Ronald Reagan left the White House a decade
ago, some adoring fans proposed that his face be added to the
profiles of four presidents carved on the side of Mount Rushmore.
</P>
<P>
   Mercifully, this nutty notion failed to catch on, Reagan's place
in history being something less than secure.
</P>
<P>
   But now the idea is back. A conservative group has appointed
itself the guardian of Reagan's legacy and is crusading to put his
mug on the famous South Dakota mountain and his name on buildings,
bridges, roads and other miscellaneous stationary objects in every
state.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was inspired by the eagerness with which the
Republican-controlled Congress renamed Washington National Airport
after the former president last year. The Ronald Reagan National
Airport moniker is just about the only concrete achievement the
current do-nothing Congress can claim.
</P>
<P>
   It drives Democrats nuts to be forced to use a gateway to the
nation's capital named after a conservative ideologue who was
convinced that the capital was a sinister influence on American
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government is the problem,'' Reagan said in his first
inaugural address, before he embarked on eight years of slashing
taxes, domestic programs and the federal role in public policy.
</P>
<P>
   But so be it. A traveler using the airport is not necessarily
endorsing the uninformed views of the politician whose name it
bears.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Ronald Reagan Legacy Project is Grover
Norquist, a tax-cutting lobbyist and buddy of outgoing House
Speaker Newt Gingrich. His campaign to spread Reagan's name
throughout the land is designed to counter what he calls ``an
uneasy ambiguity about Reagan's achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ambiguity'' is putting it politely. In addition to good things
like presiding over the final phase of the Cold War, Reagan's
legacy includes several Cabinet scandals, the Iran-Contra crimes,
the mismanaged occupation of Lebanon in which 241 Marines were
killed, harsh social policies that penalized the poor, huge tax
breaks for the very rich and excessive defense spending that
produced the biggest national budget deficits ever.
</P>
<P>
   But Norquist figures if Reagan's name is on a highway or
something else in a public space, it will automatically announce
that Reagan was a great president.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads us to Mount Rushmore, the rugged national monument
in the desolate, sparsely populated Black Hills that draws more
than two million visitors each year. The mountain's granite faces
of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham
Lincoln evoke the pioneer spirit and strength that built this great
nation in a unique way that bricks and mortar cannot.
</P>
<P>
   History has judged Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln as among
our greatest presidents. Roosevelt doesn't really belong in that
front rank. But sculptor Gutzon Borglum was a Roosevelt fan who had
been active in the 1904 campaign and so TR was added when work on
the project began in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   Borglum justified Teddy's presence by adding ``expansion'' to
the themes represented by the three other heads _ the nation's
founding, philosophy and unity. Roosevelt had created the national
park system and made the Panama Canal possible by recognizing the
new republic of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   What do you suppose Reagan's head would represent? To heck with
a balanced budget? Getting rich is the American way? Stick it to
the poor?
</P>
<P>
   Ending the Cold War? Is that more important than ending the
World War II Hot War, which Franklin Roosevelt did? Of course not.
Yet FDR's head hasn't made it to the monument.
</P>
<P>
   At best, it is wildly premature to even think of putting Reagan
on the mountain, assuming it would be technically possible to add
another head to the four without damage to the monument. He is
still alive and history has not had sufficient time to digest his
record and assess his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service will not consider immortalizing an individual
on a stamp until the person has been dead at least 10 years. That
is a good rule. Political and emotional biases that are still fresh
during a president's lifetime should not color the long-term
historical judgment of the person.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it doesn't always work to turn temporary sentiments
into permanent memorials.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of President Kennedy's assassination, for
instance, Cape Canaveral, home of the space program he had recently
visited, was renamed Cape Kennedy. But the cape's original name
dated back four centuries to the Spanish conquistadors and
residents were unhappy with the change. So Cape Kennedy reverted in
1973 to Cape Canaveral again.
</P>
<P>
   And the wise ones in the nation's capital are betting that if
and when the Democrats regain control on Capitol Hill, Ronald
Reagan airport will once again become Washington National.

`THIS REALLY TAKES A MAJOR BURDEN OFF OF GORE'S BACK' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The road to the White House became a bit smoother
for Al Gore on Tuesday after Attorney General Janet Reno declined
to appoint a special prosecutor to probe alleged fund-raising
abuses by the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of an independent counsel rummaging in possibly
illegal and potentially embarrassing fund-raising incidents had
hung like a dark cloud over Gore's presidential ambitions ever
since Reno announced she was considering such a move in August.
</P>
<P>
   While the appointment of a prosecutor would not necessarily have
doomed Gore's chances, it would have forced him to spend precious
time and political capital responding to various charges as he
tried to wage a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   With the threat now lifted, political observers say Gore is in a
stronger position to discourage potential primary challengers and
concentrate on what will likely be a competitive general election
contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really takes a major burden off of Gore's back,'' said
Mark Rozell, political science professor at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``It could give him an almost unfettered path to the
presidential nomination in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Rozell noted that Republicans still are likely to raise the
embarrassing fund-raising incidents, such as Gore's visit during
the 1996 campaign to a Buddhist temple as ``evidence that Gore is
not squeaky clean.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that ``without an independent counsel it will be
hard to keep it before the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls have continued to show Gore a favorite in hypothetical
Democratic matchups for the 2000 nomination. Nevertheless, a number
of other prominent Democrats have been mentioned as possibles in
the race, including House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, former
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   If Reno had appointed an independent counsel, potential
challengers may have been emboldened to take on the vice president,
arguing that Gore was too vulnerable to beat a strong Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from dodging an independent counsel, Gore recently
strengthened his position among the party faithful with his
aggressive campaigning for candidates in the midterm election, when
Democrats picked up five seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He also does not appear to have been hurt by the scandal
surrounding President Clinton involving former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats suggested that voters are so turned off by
independent counsels, particularly after Kenneth Starr's probe into
Whitewater and the Lewinsky matter, that if Reno had sought one for
Gore it may have backfired on the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this country are disgusted with independent
counsels. They have become witch hunts,'' said Molly Beth Malcolm,
the chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woodburn, the chairman of the New Hampshire Democratic
Party, said that voters in the state that holds the first
presidential primary were not paying much attention to Reno's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   He said the vice president has to overcome other obstacles if he
wants the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test for Gore is not the independent counsel. The test for
Gore is how he is going to relate to real people on the ground
here,'' said Woodburn. The chairman said that some voters in the
New England state have low expectations for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think he is stiff, he can't relate to people,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Woodburn said in today's volatile political atmosphere, no
one can predict where the candidates will be in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of political environment where one day you
are up, the next day you are down. The key is to be up a week
before the primary,'' he said.

WOLF KILLED-ARIZONA (Undated) - Someone killed yet another
endangered Mexican gray wolf in eastern Arizona, federal officials
said Tuesday, the fifth lobo killed since the wolves were brought
back to the wild this year. The latest killing has
environmentalists calling for FBI and National Guard intervention.
Also, new evidence says a $35,000 bounty has been posted for the
wolves' slaughter. Ironically, that is the same amount the federal
government and environmentalists are offering for information
leading to the arrest of the wolf killer or killers. By STEVE
YOZWIAK. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
$100 MILLION-GIFT (Undated) - Pretty soon, the University of
Arizona is going to get it over with, and just rename the place
Rogers University. Alumnus James Rogers on Tuesday became one of
the largest benefactors in the history of higher education,
donating $100 million to the UA law school, with the possibility
that the gift will climb to $130 million. If that occurs, it will
be one of the five largest gifts in American academic history.
Rogers had the law school named after him last week, and will sit
on the board of the foundation that will administer his gift. Is he
perhaps getting too influential? By MARTIN VAN DER WERF. Story will
move inthe ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NURSES-SHORTAGE (Undated) - The promise of sunny skies, a casual
lifestyle and friendly people lured Barbara Griffin from Pittsburgh
to Arizona this year, nudging the state closer to overcoming a
shortage of up to 10,000 nurses. But not nearly close enough. So
hospitals in Phoenix and Tucson are offering free trips to Hawaii,
signing bonuses of up to $6,000 and other incentives to attract
nurses willing to work long hours under stressful conditions. Some
who already have jobs in Phoenix say they're so worn out that they
welcome all the help they can get. By MAUREEN WEST. Story will move
in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CHILD ABUSE-ARIZONA (Undated) - Thirteen-year-old Andy wore two or
three pairs of underwear under his jeans and slept fully dressed in
the months after he got home from spending half a year in foster
care. Now 14, Andy averts his eyes when he talks about what
happened to him in that shelter in Mesa in late 1996 and 1997. Andy
was taken from his mother because child welfare officials said
their house was too filthy. `Basically,'' the boy says, sinking
down in a cushioned chair in his mother's office, ``I was raped.''
As many as 250 Arizona children were sexually abused while in
foster care over a decade, according to a lawsuit filed in Tucson
in 1994. Pima County Presiding Judge Michael Brown is considering
whether to grant class action status to the lawsuit. By KARINA
BLAND. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WELFARE2WORK (Phoenix) - Desperate for workers to fill jobs in
their booming companies, some small businesses are turning to that
once-shunned group: welfare recipients. A look at who's hiring them
and how it works out. By JANE LARSON. Story will move in the ``F''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Undated) _ They may argue over where the
original Thanksgiving was held, but the meaning isn't changed. An
offbeat look at things to be thankful for. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ.
Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - The government is going after the killer
with a vehemence every victim's family dreams about. A member of
the president's cabinet flew in to the area to draw attention to
the case. A $30,000 reward is being offered for information leading
to the arrests of the killer or killers. In this case, though, the
victim is a wolf. By E.J. MONTINI Story moved in the ``A'' and
``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RAVE-ARIZONA (Undated) - In a back alley off Main Street in Mesa,
Ariz., hundreds of teenagers and young adults converge in a
kaleidoscopic tangle, dressed like sci-fi conventiongoers on their
way to an all-night slumber party. They're jittery with a
can't-wait feeling, knowing they'll soon be psychicly free-falling
through a rave, a form of all-night, semi-clandestine partying that
has re-invented itself again and again over the past 10 years. It
has becomes more slick, commercial and global in its reach. There's
a rave every weekend in the Phoenix area, drawing at least 1,000
young people, who find their way to the site by dialing up a
recorded message or clicking on a Web site. Drugs are part of the
scene to some degree. But more important are the opportunities a
rave offers for losing yourself in pulsating music, escaping your
frustrations, feeling free enough to fly. With Photos. By JAYE
BEELER. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL;

COURT TO REVIEW COUNTING METHOD PROPOSED FOR 2000 CENSUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a case that could alter America's political
landscape and redirect billions of dollars in federal money, the
Supreme Court on Monday will examine whether a new method to
conduct the 2000 census is legal.
</P>
<P>
   The method would employ statistical sampling to help determine
the number of people in the United States rather than relying
completely on the traditional system of mailing out questionnaires
and then dispatching thousands of enumerators to hunt down those
who don't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of sampling say it would help correct an expected large
undercount in the next census.
</P>
<P>
   They point to a 1992 study by the National Academy of Sciences
that showed the 1990 census missed 8.4 million people and
double-counted 4.4 million others. The study also said that a
disproportionate number of those missed were minorities and recent
immigrants living in urban or rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that if the 2000 census uses the old method, the
survey results will be worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau _ backed by President Clinton and
congressional Democrats _ has proposed using statistical sampling
to improve that result. Under the plan, the bureau would use
traditional methods to count everyone living in 90 percent of the
households in each of the country's census tracks _ neighborhoods
containing about 1,700 houses each. The bureau then would use the
data gathered to estimate the number of people in the remaining 10
percent of the population who haven't been located.
</P>
<P>
   Following that count, the bureau would conduct another,
independent census _ known as the Integrated Coverage Measurement
(ICM) _ of 750,000 specially selected households that, when put
together, mirror the country as a whole. This second count would
much more intensive, with enumerators tracking down and questioning
every person, not just the head of the household, in each of the
750,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau then would compare the results of the ICM with those
of the original 90-percent census. In areas where the two counts
differ, the bureau would use the ICM figures to adjust the original
census.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the plan, including congressional Republicans, say
it would violate the Constitution, which mandates an ``actual
enumeration'' of the population every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Walker, spokesman for Rep. Dan Miller, R-Fla., who is
chairman of the House subcommittee that overseas Census Bureau
appropriations, said the framers of the Constitution called for an
actual count of population and that sampling could result in large
errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration wants to `guesstimate' 10 percent of the
population using the unproven technique of sampling,'' he said.
``It's just crazy to take chances with something as important as
the census.''
</P>
<P>
   The census is used to determine the makeup of the House of
Representatives and state legislatures and to decide where federal
funds should go.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists from both political parties say sampling would turn
up increases in the number of people living in historically
Democratic areas, giving the party an advantage when new boundaries
for congressional, state and local legislative districts are drawn
after the 2000 census has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   These strategists also say that since sampling would find
increases in the number of poor people counted in urban and rural
areas, cities and agricultural counties would receive extra federal
dollars at the expense of suburban communities.
</P>
<P>
   However, Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., argues that sampling is
not about helping Democrats or hurting Republicans, but about
achieving the ``most accurate census possible.'' She adds, ``It's
about basic fairness and getting money and political representation
to the people who need it most.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sampling have attempted to block its use by filing
lawsuits in federal district courts, claiming the method is
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has fought the suits by saying that
the plaintiffs _ congressional Republicans in one case and a group
of 16 individuals in six states plus officials from Cobb County,
Ga., in another _ have no right to file the motions. The
administration argues that since the census has yet to take place,
the plaintiffs have not been hurt by it and therefore cannot say it
is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a three-judge federal district court in Richmond,
Va., unanimously ruled, in the case of the 16 individuals and Cobb
County, Ga., that federal law bars the use of sampling for the
purpose of apportioning congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   That court said the six states where the 16 people live are
``substantially likely'' to lose seats in the House if the national
head count is determined partly by sampling. As a result, the lower
court found, the 16 can legitimately claim that they would be hurt
by prospective ``vote dilution'' of the sort that the Supreme Court
has recognized in the past as a basis for challenging an
apportionment plan.
</P>
<P>
   The six states are Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
Missouri, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in August, a separate three-judge district court panel
here in Washington, D.C., issued a unanimous ruling in the suit by
House Republicans, saying sampling violated federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The D.C. court ruled that the lawmakers did have the right to
file the suit. It said sampling threatens the ``institutional
interests'' of the House because it could alter that body's
composition.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the courts' decisions, Clinton and the congressional
Republicans agreed last month to postpone their fight over whether
to use sampling in the next census until the Supreme Court rules on
the two cases. The high court is expected to decide the case in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say that even if the court rules sampling legal,
they will still try to make sure that the 2000 census uses
traditional counting methods.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said an experiment in 1991 by the National Academy of
Sciences to conduct the count using the old method plus sampling
resulted in a number of errors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If sampling was used again and the same errors occurred, the
whole 2000 census might be ruled invalid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pat Cantwell, a bureau statistician, said the errors in
the experimental census were quickly discovered and corrected. He
added that even with the errors, the experimental census was more
accurate than the original census.

 &HT;    CITING AOL DEAL, MICROSOFT URGES GOVERNMENT TO DROP LAWSUIT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. attorneys urged the federal
government Tuesday to drop its antitrust case, saying the America
Online-Netscape merger has created a seismic shift in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry can change dramatically overnight. And this shows
that government is five steps behind when it comes to regulating
this technology,'' said William H. Neukom, Microsoft's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom said the AOL-Netscape deal creates an Internet powerhouse
that will give consumers new choices in markets ranging from web
hosting to Internet browsing to e-commerce. It undercuts the
government's argument that Microsoft is stifling competition in
these areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lead attorney, John L. Warden, added that
Microsoft would move to have the case dismissed when the government
completed presenting its evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the government has no intention of withdrawing this
case,'' said lead Justice Department attorney David Boies.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining the government's main intention, that Microsoft has
used its dominance in operating systems to stifle competition in
other markets, Boies said that ``even if the AOL-Netscape deal goes
through, the impediments to competition in the operating-system
market still exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning's announcement of the $4.3-billion merger
between Dulles, Va.-based America Online Inc. and Silicon Valley's
Netscape Communications Corp., which markets the popular Netscape
Internet browser, jolted the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   AOL will swap 0.45 of its shares for each Netscape share,
valuing Netscape at $41.12 a share. AOL will enter into a second
marketing agreement with Sun Microsystems Inc., in which Sun will
pay AOL $350 million for the right to sell Netscape software. AOL,
in turn, will pay Sun $500 million for various services and
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies testified against Microsoft in the
government's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies aren't running scared from Microsoft,'' Neukom
said. ``They are running hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Many attorneys and legal scholars predict that the pending
merger will have some effect on the antitrust case. In particular,
if the government wins its case against Microsoft, some believe the
shake-up likely would influence the type of remedy selected to curb
Microsoft's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the 20 states that have filed suit
against Microsoft have not been specific about what remedies or
penalties they would favor if U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson rules in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Options would range from Jackson giving Microsoft a stern
warning to curb its bullying behavior to a move to break up the
company by insisting that it spin off different product
departments.
</P>
<P>
   William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University
School of Law, says the AOL-Netscape deal means Jackson would be
less likely to impose the most stringent remedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the deal, the judge is less likely to think he has
to take specific actions to reduce Microsoft's dominant market
position,'' Kovacic said. ``Now there's evidence that the market is
taking care of it. So it takes a great burden off his shoulders.''

RUSSIAN LAWMAKER'S SLAYING GALVANIZES ANTI-COMMUNISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By Celestine Bohlen   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Thousands of mourners waited hours in
the bitter cold Tuesday to pay an emotional and politically charged
farewell to a liberal legislator whose killing on Friday has turned
into a call to arms for Russia's frayed democratic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ornate Marble Hall at the Museum of Ethnography,
where the lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, lay in state, her
grim-faced friends and allies issued a challenge to the forces that
many believe ordered a brazen political assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are killing our comrades, they are killing our friends,''
said Anatoly Chubais, a reform-minded former Kremlin aide and
native of St. Petersburg, in a voice choked with emotion. ``Do they
want to stop us? Do they want to frighten us? It won't work. I want
to say this at the coffin of our comrade, absolutely clearly and
absolutely firmly: They will not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks reflected Russia's growing political instability at
a time of deep economic crisis with a weakened President Boris
Yeltsin at the helm. In just the last few weeks the country has
heard anti-Semitic statements go uncensored, allegations that a
renegade hit squad was working within the Federal Security Service,
and open threats against Russia's independent news media.
</P>
<P>
   People at the scene were comparing the crowds Tuesday to those
that came out for the funeral of the Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov
in Moscow in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Poets and politicians, including three former prime ministers,
were among the first to crowd past Ms. Starovoitova's open coffin
and to deliver their eulogies. The line of ordinary citizens that
followed was so long that the viewing had to be prolonged by
several hours. Even then, hundreds of mourners were unable to get
in before the coffin was taken to a cemetery at the historic
Alexander Nevsky Monastery for a private funeral and burial.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the turnout was seen here as a protest against the
growing lawlessness in the city and as a gesture of respect for a
woman known both as a staunch defender of democracy and as a
plain-speaking warmhearted figure, a mother and a grandmother. In
homage to Ms. Starovoitova, Russia's main television channel
repeatedly interrupted its programming Tuesday with an old film
clip, showing her sitting at home, singing a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything she did, she did as a strong personality,'' said
Vladimir Talanov, a 68-year-old engineer who was at the back of the
line that doubled around a statue of Pushkin. ``We should pay
homage to someone who is one of the brightest faces of a democracy
that we are now so worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave of violence that has swept this city struck Ms.
Starovoitova Friday as she and an aide were going up the staircase
in her apartment building on Griboyedova Canal. She was shot in the
head three times by waiting assailants and died at the scene. Her
aide, Ruslan Linkov, was wounded in the head and neck and is in a
local military hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the midst of an ugly local election campaign that has
been rife with dirty tricks, the attack has heightened the sharp
polarization of political forces both here and in the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Ms. Starovoitova have openly blamed nationalists and
communists for her death. The speaker of the Russian parliament, a
communist from St. Petersburg, threw back the charge on Monday by
suggesting that her death had been ordered by extremists in the
democratic movement.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, hospitalized on Monday with pneumonia, was described as
``deeply angered'' by the killing of Ms. Starovoitova, his close
ally in Russia's anti-communist movement.
</P>
<P>
   She was an ethnographer and psychologist, and she served as his
adviser on inter-ethnic affairs until she was fired in a conflict
over the Kremlin's policy in the northern Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Ms. Starovoitova, who was a figure of
considerable influence here in St. Petersburg, had spoken out
against nationalism _ and against corruption, collecting materials
on illegal fund-raising by local Communist politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters contend that her resolute positions may have cost her
her life. ``I know what work Galina Vasilyevena was involved in, I
know why she paid with her life and I know that we will continue to
do this work until the end,'' said Chubais at the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has thrown his weight behind the
investigation, summoning Russia's top law enforcement officials to
a meeting at which he pressed them to find the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers in St. Petersburg announced Monday that they had
conducted a number of raids and detained several people as they
cast their net wide in the search for the suspects. The attack had
the earmarks of contract killings here, with the assailants
dropping two guns at the scene and leaving in a waiting car.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, shots were fired at the windows of the apartment of a
local member of the City Council. Last year, a top city official _
another close associate of Chubais _ was gunned down on the city's
main avenue, Nevsky Prospekt, and numerous bankers and business
executives have been targets of contract killings.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city,
with a population of 5 million, have been troubled by the low-key
response to the attack by the local governor, Vladimir Yakovlev.
Yakovlev, a former city official who won elections in 1996 as an
opponent of the democrats, waited two days to send a telegram of
condolences to Ms. Starovoitova's family and, citing health
reasons, did not appear at the memorial services Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the people who began to line up around the Ethnography
Museum in the chilly morning darkness, the death of Ms.
Starovoitova had come as a bitter reminder of democracy's tenuous
hold in Russia, seven years after the collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we could have democracy, but we don't have it yet,''
said Lada Uvarova, 28, an employee at United Parcel Service here
and one of the few members of her generation to join the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at the beginning of reforms there was an enthusiasm, an
optimism, now something has changed,'' she said. ``Young people
don't care about government, they count only themselves. For older
people, times are difficult and they blame the situation on
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the people who came Tuesday, Ms. Starovoitova was more
than just another ``democratic.'' The response to the killing of a
popular woman who held a leadership role swept across ideological
lines and brought out a big crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected fewer people,'' said Irina Zapozhnikova, a senior
instructor at a technical institute. ``After all, democrats are now
considered the ones to blame for everything. But people trusted
her.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another powerful storm will affect the Northwest on Thursday,
bringing inclement weather to northwest California and western
sections of Oregon and Washington. Windswept heavy rain will buffet
coastal areas as a steady stream of moisture from the eastern
Pacific is lifted by an approaching cold front. Local flooding will
occur, particularly where the ground is saturated from recent rain.
As the damp air is further lifted and cooled by the interior
mountains, rain will turn to heavy snow above 4,500 feet with over
a foot of fresh snow blanketing sections of the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   Dry and seasonably warm conditions will extend from southern
California to southern sections of the interior West. Skies will be
mainly sunny across the region, though filaments of clouds will
obscure the sun at times near the Rockies. Meanwhile, partly sunny
skies and mild air will extend eastward into the Plains where
another day of unseasonable warmth covers western Kansas and
eastern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   After a clear and cold start, ample sunshine will boost
temperatures to near normal levels from the northern Middle
Atlantic states to New England as high pressure drifts off the
Eastern Seaboard. Farther west, scattered showers will develop near
a cold front pressing through the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley.
Isolated thunderstorms could occur as a jet stream disturbance
passes overhead. Elsewhere, partly sunny and warm conditions will
cover much of the Southeast and Florida with isolated showers
burgeoning in the increasingly humid air.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Late Season Storm
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm Nicole swirled to life in the far eastern
Atlantic Ocean on Tuesday, a rare event given that hurricane season
officially ends November 30. The birth of tropical storm Nicole put
the Atlantic ahead of the normally more active eastern Pacific
Ocean for the number of tropical storms and hurricanes in 1998. The
Atlantic has been a busy basin in recent years. Since 1995, 53
named tropical cyclones have roamed the Atlantic, marking the
busiest four consecutive hurricane seasons on record. In contrast,
the period between 1991 and 1994 was one of quietest, spawning only
30 named storms.

IRAQ TO REPLACE 18 AMBASSADORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the largest diplomatic shakeup since the
Gulf War, Iraq decided Tuesday to replace 18 key ambassadors,
including Baghdad's most visible envoy, UN ambassador Nizar
Hamdoon.
</P>
<P>
   The move, portrayed by Iraqi sources as a routine changing of
the guard, comes just months after Baghdad's ambassador to the UN's
Geneva office ignored his government's request to return to Iraq.
And it has fueled speculation among some observers that Iraq is
seeking to head off an embarrassing wave of potential defections in
its diplomatic corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what's going on in the mind of Saddam
Hussein,'' said White House foreign policy spokesman David Leavy.
``But any time he can tighten his grip on power, he will do it.
This could be one of the reasons for the changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and analysts said the move to replace Hamdoon will
deprive Iraq of its most effective advocate for ending more than
seven years of economic sanctions. Leavy said the recall of Iraq's
high profile envoy appeared aimed at permitting Hussein to keep
tighter control over Iraq's message to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon will be replaced by his deputy, Saeed Hasan, a shy
Sorbonne-educated diplomat who admits to being allergic to the
media spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamdoon is without a doubt their best spokesperson in
English,'' said Gregory Gause, an Iraq scholar at the University of
Vermont. ``He is the smoothest and the best the Iraqis have. I
can't imagine his successor can do any better.''
</P>
<P>
   US officials said privately that the departure of Hamdoon, a
regular guest on American talk show circuit, would make it easier
for the Clinton administration to prevail in its battle of words
with Iraq. Publicly, the US expressed sarcastic ``sympathy'' for
the new diplomatic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is I feel sorry for those who have to defend
such a lost cause,'' said State Department spokesman James P.
Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomatic shuffle also brought about changes in other key
diplomatic outposts, including Iraqi missions to the Arab League,
the UN headquarters in Geneva, and the Vienna-based International
Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling speculation of defections was the recent refusal
by &UR;  &LR; Saddam Hussein's half-brother, Barzan Tikriti, to return to
Baghdad in June from from his job as Iraq's representative to the
UN office in Geneva. Tikriti initially refused to return home in
order to be with his ailing wife, who was receiving treatment for
an illness at a Swiss hospital. But he refused to come home after
she died last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tikriti is to be replaced by Mohammed Douri, a legal expert in
the Iraqi foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon, a trained architect who enjoyed close relations with
the United States during the Iran-Iraq war, is expected to return
to Baghdad around the end of the year to take a senior post in the
Iraqi foreign ministry, according to Iraqi sources.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday that Hasan, who has served as his deputy for
four years, is ``probably the best replacement at this very crucial
time.''

MEXICO MAY FACE NAFTA SANCTIONS FOR NOT PROTECTING WORKERS'
RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Mexican officials have acknowledged that their labor
laws do not adequately protect the rights of Mexican workers,
according to documents obtained by Canadian union officials who
have filed a complaint against Mexico under the North American Free
Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian complaint involves conditions at an automobile
brake plant outside Mexico City that is owned by Dana Corp. of
Toledo, Ohio, and follows a similar action taken in the United
States earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   If both complaints determine that Mexico did not adequately
enforce its labor laws, it could lead to the first sanction applied
since NAFTA went into effect in January 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian office of the United Steelworkers of America and 40
labor and human rights organizations from Canada, Mexico and the
United States contend that workers at the plant were intimidated
and in some cases beaten when they tried to switch unions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint, workers at the brake plant, which
operates under the name Itapsa, wanted to organize an independent
union because wages were stuck at $5 a day and there were dangerous
levels of asbestos dust.
</P>
<P>
   The existing union, the Confederation of Mexican Workers, has
strong links to the government and reportedly ignored worker
complaints. On Sept. 9, 1997, Itapsa workers voted on switching to
an independent union, but they said they did so in the presence of
outsiders carrying sticks and pipes. They also were forced to
declare their vote at an open meeting in front of plant
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the labor side agreement to NAFTA, each of the three
countries in the accord has established an administrative office to
receive such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Canadian office received the complaint about the
union vote and the safety conditions at the Itapsa plant. In
September, the head of the Canadian office, May Morpaw, traveled to
Mexico to meet with her counterpart, Rafael Aranda, and officials
from the Mexican Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   In the notes of the meeting, which were obtained by the
steelworkers union, Mexican labor officials acknowledged that union
representation elections usually are not conducted in secret, even
though workers can be dismissed if they vote for the losing union.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican officials also said they were not concerned that the
lack of secrecy had made it inevitable that employers would know
how a worker had voted. The Mexican officials said such elections
were free and open, but they could not guarantee that coercion did
not occur outside the voting site, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
   In response to calls over several days seeking comment, the
Mexican Labor Department sent a one-page summary of the complaint
by fax but did not elaborate on the contents of Ms. Morpaw's notes.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative office in the United States issued a report
in July supporting most of the accusations in the complaint about
Itapsa filed there. The office sent the complaint to the next stage
in the regulatory process, which is direct consultations among the
labor ministers of the three countries.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morpaw of the Canadian office said a vote on whether to make
a similar reference was scheduled for early December.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations concerning free association for union members
can only be taken up in talks among the labor ministers. But if two
of the three labor ministers are sufficiently convinced that
asbestos levels prove worker safety laws were not enforced at the
plants, the issue could result in the first labor sanctions against
Mexico.

`STEAM': HOME IS WHERE THE BATH IS _ FINDING HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: production notes at end of review) 
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francesco and Marta are one of those hip couples: young, busy,
fashionable and good-looking. They live in Rome in a great
apartment with a terrace, work together as decorators and don't
seem particularly unhappy, but maybe they are.
</P>
<P>
   Francesco (Alessandro Gassman) is the protagonist of ``Steam:
The Turkish Bath'' (``Hamam: Il Bagno Turco''), Ferzan Ozpetek's
seductive new film, an Italian-Turkish-Spanish production set in
Istanbul and Rome. Francesco has inherited a building in Istanbul
from an aunt he didn't really know, and neither he nor Marta
(Francesca d'Aloja) wants to be bothered. But it's HIS relative, so
he sets out for Turkey, where he plans to sell the building quickly
and get back home.
</P>
<P>
   What he doesn't count on is falling in love, not so much with a
person as with a city. Early in his trip, Francesco meets a frail,
elderly man on the street and helps him to a nearby hamam, or
Turkish bath. There is something about the atmosphere there, with
many centuries of luxury and decadence in the air.
</P>
<P>
   He soon learns that the building his aunt has left him is, in
fact, a hamam, albeit a very run-down one. Then he discovers that
the woman who wants to buy the hamam from him is buying up all the
property in the neighborhood to build a huge trade center, and his
decision is made (a very unfortunate one, it turns out). He won't
sell. He'll stay and restore the hamam to its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that the family that his aunt lived with is the
warmest group of parents and children to sit around a dinner table
since ``The Waltons'' went off the air. They ply him with food and
affection.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful daughter, Fusun (Basak Koklukaya), and an equally
beautiful son, Mehmet (Mehmet Gunsur), give Francesco equally long,
admiring looks; Mehmet invites him to visit a hamam with him. A
relationship may be developing.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone helps in the renovations. Meanwhile, Francesco takes
long walks along the ancient, winding streets and in the harbor.
</P>
<P>
   And he reads his aunt's old letters, describing her growing love
for Istanbul (``Here, things flow more slowly and soft'') and her
emotional convictions (``One can be happy in this life, Giuliana;
one must'').
</P>
<P>
   What seemed a noisy, dirty city, Francesco now sees, is an
almost magical one surrounded by sapphire-blue waters. Then Marta
arrives, seemingly just to see her husband after all these weeks
but with a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steam'' ends with a completely unexpected death, but it
doesn't end unhappily.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a love letter to the quiet joy of finding one's
place in the world. It even promotes the lovely illusion that
finding that place can be a matter of mere geography.

`A BUG'S LIFE': OUT-OF-STEP ANT SAILS OUT TO SAVE THE HILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It looks as if ``A Bug's Life,'' from the computer-animation
outfit Pixar and some of the personnel behind ``Toy Story,'' is the
best ant colony movie of the year. And that's no small distinction,
considering the bug-eat-bug movie rivalry under way.
</P>
<P>
   Both this and the uncannily similar ``Antz'' are sophisticated,
entertaining feats of animation, but ``A Bug's Life'' has the
conceptual edge as a clearly defined family film (as opposed to the
more verbally adult, yet visually youth-oriented ``Antz'').
</P>
<P>
   As directed by John Lasseter, who directed ``Toy Story,'' and
Andrew Stanton, who collaborated on the ``Toy Story'' screenplay,
``A Bug's Life'' makes jaunty, imaginative use of both
extraordinary technology and bold storytelling possibilities within
the insect world.
</P>
<P>
   At first ``A Bug's Life'' looks disappointingly familiar, as one
more line of identical insect drones trudges across the screen.
``Antz'' started with the same collective mentality and then
invoked bugs with star personalities (Woody Allen in one of his
funniest recent performances) to deliver some zest.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the ants' story is more coherent on its own terms,
so the audience is more caught up in narrative than in all-star
individual characters. Also, ``A Bug's Life'' shows off the same
shrewd anthropomorphism that gave ``Toy Story'' so much spark.
</P>
<P>
   Though no children's film is without tyrants these days, and the
bullies here are towering grasshoppers (with Kevin Spacey nice and
threatening as their ringleader), ``A Bug's Life'' is still
relatively benign. It concerns a whimsical, daydreamy ant named
Flik (with the voice of Dave Foley) who accidentally runs afoul of
the grasshoppers. Clinging to a sprig of dandelion fuzz and blowing
off into the wind, Flik sets out to find reinforcements who will
help defend the ant colony, but he accidentally comes across a bug
circus. With these show-biz types, there's a bit of
misunderstanding about what ``knock 'em dead'' means.
</P>
<P>
   The circus clowns (with Denis Leary as a macho ladybug, David
Hyde Pierce as a stick-shaped bug, Bonnie Hunt as a black widow
spider and Madeline Kahn as a butterfly) show off some hilarious
teamwork before being reluctantly dragged into the ant colony's
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Phyllis Diller supplies the voice of an ant queen
with a flower for a hairdo, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus frets
charmingly as the princess who's sweet on Flik. There's no real
need to know more than this except that the material combines
pastel colors, natural settings and vibrant, comical insects into a
spectacle that lots of children ought to find irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   The film's message about standing up for freedom is similar to
that of ``Antz,'' but it's delivered with less strife and a lighter
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bug's Life'' is being shown with Pixar's Academy
Award-winning short, ``Geri's Game,'' in which an old man playing
chess imagines a doppelganger partner for himself and is then
carried away by the excitement of the game. It's a showcase for the
incredible range of facial expressions that make this type of
animation more and more invitingly lifelike all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``A Bug's Life'' is rated G, it includes big, scary
grasshoppers who are sure to get their comeuppance in the end.

QUEEN SETS STAGE FOR END TO HEREDITARY PEERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Uttering the political equivalent of ``Off with their
heads,'' Queen Elizabeth II opened a new session of Parliament
Tuesday by announcing the government's intention to get rid of
hereditary peers, those who inherit their seats in the House of
Lords.
</P>
<P>
   The queen's annual speech, in which she reads a
government-scripted list of its legislative agenda, took place at
Westminster in a ceremony replete with the regal pageantry that
many of those who want to throw out the hereditary peers say has no
place in modern British democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the paradox of having a monarch who inherited her crown
formally set the stage for the eradication of one of the most
tangible examples of aristocratic privilege also underscores the
political bind in which Prime Minister Tony Blair finds himself.
While Blair has declared war on the hereditary peers, calling their
position in the upper house of Parliament an embarrassing
anachronism, he would move similarly against the monarchy at his
own political peril.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the queen listed 21 bills the government hopes to pass,
none more controversial and central to Blair's pledge to replace
Britain's constitutional monarchy with a modern democracy than his
plans to strip the hereditary peers of their voting and speaking
privileges.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government's agenda, which includes bills aimed at
modernizing the health, welfare, educational, and criminal justice
systems, could get bogged down if the hereditary peers decide to
obstruct Blair as their last gasp.
</P>
<P>
   While the queen's speech is traditionally received without
partisan response, there were cheers of ``Hear, hear!'' from a
number of Labor partisans when the queen said the government
intended to begin ``a process of reform to make the House of Lords
more democratic and representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the red-robed peers, as members of the House of Lords
are known, harrumphed in disgust, although it was unclear whether
they were registering their disapproval of Blair's plan or partisan
triumphalism.
</P>
<P>
   Some 759 of the 1,164 peers are hereditary peers, whose seats
are awarded by birthright. Blair has vowed to get rid of them, but
his vague plans to replace them and the House of Lords with a more
democratic upper house has led critics to charge that Blair merely
wants to neuter one of the few checks on his power.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has said he will give up his right to appoint so-called
life peers, who account for the other 400 or so members of the
Lords. Only 17 of the hereditary peers are Labor supporters, and
fewer than 100 are women, making them a relic of Britain's
aristocratic past.
</P>
<P>
   But many Britons, especially those in the Conservative Party,
which has traditional ties to the hereditary peers, say they are an
important balance of power. Their supporters point out that they
regularly frustrated the Conservative prime minister Margaret
Thatcher, using their powers to veto bills.
</P>
<P>
   Some peers have threatened to use those powers to frustrate
Blair's plan. But, under law, they can only delay government plans
for a year, so the most they can do is put off the inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Blair later told the House of Commons it was time to end the
``feudal domination'' of the Lords by one party.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Party leader William Hague dismissed the
government's legislative agenda as irrelevant.

`BABE' SEQUEL GETS TOO DARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 2 Stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the whimsical swine named Babe tramped into
theaters three years ago, the film was initially perceived as a
cute little movie about a talking pig who thought he was a
sheepdog. Then it was nominated _ and deservedly so _ for seven
Oscars, including one for Best Picture, and ``Babe'' suddenly had
the aura of artistic respectability.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst thing that could have happened to the little
porker.
</P>
<P>
   With the inevitable sequel, ``Babe: Pig in the City,'' director
George Miller (who produced and co-wrote the first film) labors
under delusions of grandeur. He's so determined to prove that
``Babe'' is more than a cute little pig movie that he destroys the
franchise's delightful charm in the process. To market this dark,
dreary Fellini-esque shambles as a kid's movie is the ultimate pig
in a poke. The only children who will appreciate this movie are the
ones starved for a little more somber poignancy in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babe: Pig in the City'' picks up immediately where the first
movie left off. Babe and his owner, laconic farmer Arthur Hoggett
(James Cromwell), triumphantly return from winning the sheepherding
competition, heroes to the townsfolk who once mocked them. The good
times don't last for long, though (Miller wants us to begin moping
as soon as possible), and an accident involving a well _ and caused
by Babe _ cripples Farmer Hoggett. Mrs. Hoggett (Magda Szubanski)
must then deal with the men in suits with pale faces and soulless
eyes who come to foreclose on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: Cash in on Babe's popularity by accepting an
appearance fee from a fair in the city. Hoggett reluctantly agrees
but makes his wife promise to ensure the pig's safety. That's
easier said than done. Miller's metropolis is a harsh, frightening
place populated by gun-toting, frowning people who will eagerly
knock you down, take everything you have and then kick you for good
measure. In this weirdly stylized world, the women wear string
bikinis, and the men dress in leather and chains that seem to be
taken from Miller's ``Mad Max'' wardrobe leftovers (he directed the
gritty Mel Gibson-starring flicks).
</P>
<P>
   Refuge is found in Flealands Hotel, where Babe meets stray dogs
and cats and a family of chimpanzees who perform with a pitiful
clown (Mickey Rooney). There's also a sad-eyed orangutan named
Thelonius, a melancholy creature Miller seems more interested in
than Babe, given the number of heart-rending ways he films the
animal. (I guess there are only so many mournful ways to shoot a
pig.) Babe teaches all these critters that a kind and steady heart
can endure against the darkness of the city. It's a painful lesson
to endure, both for the pig and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who also co-wrote and co-produced ``Babe: Pig in the
City,'' made the decision to film the movie as a mixture of wildly
fantastic images, tragicomic lyricism, burlesque, satire and
pathos. It was a significant blunder, largely unsuited to the
material. While there are many beautifully filmed images in this
movie, Miller's work, taken as a whole, comes off as self-indulgent
egotism. It would have been better that the movie dissolve into
mushy treacle than this misguided homage to self-conscious cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the first film had its share of darkness. Babe, after
all, was originally ticketed as the centerpiece of the Hoggetts'
holiday meal. But ``Babe: Pig in the City'' often wallows in the
blackness with its scenes of animal cruelty. (A dog hangs from a
bridge on a chain, drowning in a brook. A goldfish slowly
asphyxiates. And so on and so on ...) You don't have to pander to
kids, but you don't have to smother them in misery, either. Miller
would do well to learn that lesson should he decide in the future
to make another pig movie designed for audiences instead of
film-school students.

 POP REVIEW: MOBY GRAPE, PRETTY THINGS REPRISE '60s COMPOSITIONS  
 (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took nerve for Moby Grape to start with ``Hey
Grandma'' at Wetlands on Thursday night. When Moby Grape recorded
the song in 1967, it was a come-on to a hippie girl in granny
glasses. But now, with gray in the musicians' hair, Moby Grape
could be chasing a real grandma. The song declares, ``This time
'round, everything's upside-down'' and so it was.
</P>
<P>
   The music created by brash young men three decades ago sounded
almost as eccentric and vital now as it did when it was written.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend was bracketed by two long-lost bands from the
psychedelic era: Moby Grape on Thursday and Friday at Wetlands and
the Pretty Things at Coney Island High on Sunday, where the band
concluded the three-day Cave Stomp '98, a celebration of
1960s-style garage rock.
</P>
<P>
   Both bands left behind half-forgotten psychedelic masterpieces:
Moby Grape's 1967 debut album, ``Moby Grape'' (Columbia) and the
Pretty Things' 1968 ``S.F. Sorrow'' (Snapper), the first
full-length rock opera. And as fate would have it, both bands
showed how fragile the psychedelic moment was. The songs that were
left behind _ with their fractured logic, sonic experiments and
airborne whimsy _ now seem as inspired and preposterous as
hallucinations.
</P>
<P>
   Moby Grape was the ill-starred band among the Summer of Love
hopefuls. It held five songwriters who were also first-rate
instrumentalists and singers. Like the Grateful Dead, the band
dipped into country, blues and soul; like the Jefferson Airplane,
which included Skip Spence before he joined Moby Grape, it had a
folky side, too. Moby Grape also had a bungling record label, a
manager who tied the band in legal knots and a penchant for trashed
hotel rooms and prodigious drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The band fell apart after its third album, ``Moby Grape '69,''
though it regrouped sporadically afterward. In 1995, the original
members wrested control of the Moby Grape name from the band's
former manager. By then, Moby Grape's two most innovative
songwriters, Spence and Bob Mosley, had descended into
schizophrenia. Spence is still under residential care, unable to
perform, while Mosley was homeless in the mid-1990s. But he
rejoined the band for its previous New York show in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At Wetlands, the band included Mosley on bass and two of Moby
Grape's original guitarists, Jerry Miller and Peter Lewis, joined
by two other San Francisco stalwarts, Sam Andrews (from Big Brother
and the Holding Company) on guitar and James Preston (from the Sons
of Champlin) on drums. It started with a short set of the band's
most familiar songs, then returned for obscurities and jams.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the songs have the easygoing, countryish tone and
fanned-out harmonies that the Grateful Dead would arrive at on
``Workingman's Dead''; others, like Spence's ``Omaha,'' have the
dance-party exuberance that current jam bands try to reconstitute.
The songs tend to extremes: either utterly optimistic or bitter and
desolate.
</P>
<P>
   While some of Moby Grape's songs, like the tender ballad
``8:05,'' are perfect examples of standard genres, Spence and
Mosley often skewed ordinary structures, as Mosley did in ``Sitting
and Watching,'' which moves in and out of waltz time as the singer
tries to fight off hopelessness. Mosley was stone-faced most of his
time onstage, but with that song, he unleashed the dramatic tenor
he brought to Moby Grape in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The singers' voices aren't as clear as they were, but the music
has kept its instrumental spark. With the guitarists in charge,
songs that were condensed to three minutes for LPs made room for
solos that reveal Miller as one of San Francisco's outstanding,
uncelebrated lead guitarists. Moving from the jabs of Chicago blues
to the bends and curls of country to jazzy parallel-octave lines to
the quivering high leads of psychedelia, he gave his solos a clear
narrative line; Lewis engaged him with finger-picking and wiry lead
phrases. Their byplay was pure San Francisco, now unconnected to
youthful excesses; the songs were enduring period pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pretty Things' psychedelic phase was brief but lofty. The
band was founded in 1963 by the singer Phil May and Dick Taylor, a
guitarist who left the early Rolling Stones. Like the Stones, the
Pretty Things found in American blues and rhythm-and-blues an
outlet for all the raunchy, aggressive impulses that English
culture repressed. The band still boasts of its members' 61
convictions for offenses like assault with a deadly weapon,
inciting to riot and setting fire to an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   They detoured into psychedelia; a 1965 single, ``L.S.D.,'' was
banned by the BBC. Suddenly, they revealed that they could write
more than three chords and offer more than threats and come-ons.
And then after ``S.F. Sorrow'' flopped commercially they moved back
into blues-rock with slicker flourishes before disbanding in 1976.
They have had frequent reunions, but had not appeared in New York
since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   At Coney Island High, the Pretty Things' psychedelia and
blues-rock converged. The band's 1966 lineup _ five men in their
50s wearing jackets and ties _ tore into its old boogies and blues,
with slicing solos from Taylor, honky-tonk keyboards and wailing
harmonica from John Povey and reedy, melodic growls from May. They
could easily challenge the current Rolling Stones for rowdy energy.
</P>
<P>
   They still drove the riffs hard when they turned to four songs
from ``S.F. Sorrow'': odd tunes with glimpses of Indian modality,
Beatles harmonies and elaborate suitelike structures and
antecedents for bands like Led Zeppelin and Jethro Tull, which
would turn psychedelic impulses into exacting structures.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Pretty Things charged into ``L.S.D.,'' based on a
one-chord garage-blues riff, they stretched it into a furious,
surging acid-rocker, an urgent amalgam of the Stones, early Pink
Floyd and late-1960s Who. ``It's all I want/It's all I need!'' May
proclaimed, over whooshing organ and a tidal-wave crescendo. He was
invoking an era of audacity and innocent innovation that not even
pharmaceuticals could bring back.

TELEVISED DEATH: PRURIENT OR NEWSWORTHY, OR BOTH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They're ganging up on ``60 Minutes.'' In the pile-on are Roman
Catholic prelates, medical ethicists, editorial writers, television
reviewers and teachers of journalism, all expressing indignation,
shock, outrage that the pre-eminent news magazine should have run a
video of Dr. Jack Kevorkian giving lethal injections to Thomas
Youk, who suffered from Lou Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   To which ``60 Minutes'' on CBS and any other journalistic
operation is bound to reply that where such a controversy occurs,
the solid principle is to cover the news.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, that was more than amply justified by the
attention the report drew to issues that make most people
uncomfortable and only too inclined to ignore. When a news program
compels many of them to confront a life-and-death issue it is doing
the journalist's job, which is to say the educator's job.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the onslaught on the Sunday program vary, but
common to much of the opposition is a widely held feeling that the
picture of a man being killed simply ought not to be shown on
television, that it offends respect for privacy, dignity, good
taste and other values common to decent folk. The offended class
can claim to be more refined than the people who put on television
shows, more sensitive, more  &UR; feeling &LR;  and so merit special due from
the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   But with all respect, as television panelists are prone to
introduce their caveats, such expressions of private delicacy are
not self-evidently persuasive and may invite other interpretations.
Perhaps blinking at death is attributable to squeamishness,
immaturity, fear, denial of the reality that Kevorkian, the
celebrant of euthanasia, is determined to force on viewers.
</P>
<P>
   When a Boston Globe editorial (``Shame on `60 Minutes''') calls
the showing of the videotape ``an unparalleled obscenity,'' one
suspects that the writer has not been paying close attention to
world events lately. The truly great obscenity for journalists is
to ignore what should be before one's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motives of the opposition, they have more to do
with defensive therapy than reporting. In a field rampant with
entertainment violence, a television program with very subdued
violence is protested because it defies some amorphous standard of
propriety. In a field where mindlessness rules, a program with
deeply serious content is protested because it goes uncomfortably
deep. In a field of instantly forgettable trivia, a program that is
bound to stand as one of the more powerful offerings of the season
is protested because it may upset some stomachs or nerves or
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Should ``60 Minutes'' have resisted the temptation and spared
itself charges of sensationalism and exploitation? ``What price
ratings?'' asked a spokesman for the Brooklyn Roman Catholic
diocese. Alas, television producers are all to some degree in
thrall to ratings; by that criterion, they are all sinners. The
justification for any decision has to rest with the work that
emerges. In this case, however crass the motives, the important
result was to force public attention to a subject that is so hard
to think about that many find excuses for looking away. Isn't that
a mandate of responsible journalism?
</P>
<P>
   The immediate salubrious effects were evident even in the
dithery purviews of cable shows that picked up on the subject.
Audience panels proved affecting; everyone seemed to have had a
hard experience of a loved one's dying and to want to find words to
talk about it in a reasoned way. The commotion over the video
provided an opportunity, and they rose to it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the opposition to ``60 Minutes'' is directed not
strictly at the death scene but at the subject of doctor-assisted
suicide itself. A lot of people are against euthanasia and many no
doubt are put off by the zealotry and flamboyance of Kevorkian, who
is not the most appealing television personality around. They can
make a fair case that the ``60 Minutes'' segment was a platform for
the doctor's reach for martyrdom and might have been classier
journalism if he had not been allowed to carry the day.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a criticism of the shaping of the program, not of the
decision to roll the big scene. The suggestion that a more decorous
report, like others over the years, could have been offered without
the evidence of the killing became irrelevant and sappy once the
tape's existence was announced. Call the taping a stunt if you
like; that was the evening's news.
</P>
<P>
   Both opponents and enthusiasts of euthanasia and admirers and
detractors of Kevorkian can welcome a program that sets millions
arguing over the hard issue of dying. Given how little appears on
the nation's news magazines to stir recumbent minds, the notion of
discouraging them further with rules of deportment seems a touch
gratuitous.
</P>
<P>
   As for the six CBS affiliates owned by the Dallas-based A.H.
Belo Corp. that refused to run the segment, I bet they have never
banned a show on grounds that it was too puerile for their viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The message for television journalism in this episode is an
abiding one: at its best it ought not to be in the business of
concealment, whether on grounds of piety or politeness or prudence.
Its mission is to carry the news and take the knocks.

`HOME FRIES,' FOR LAUGHS, A MURDER BY FRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at the end of the review.) 
(rl) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time a movie like ``Home Fries'' appears, you can sense
Hollywood's eagerness for a smart screwball comedy that hits the
commercial bull's-eye and proves that there really is a place for
sophisticated humor in a market dominated by the dumbed-down capers
of the Farrelly brothers, Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler. ``Home
Fries'' probably isn't that movie. But this absurdist satire of
sex, sibling rivalry, Oedipal ties, homicidal fantasies and fast
food in the American heartland at least has the right attitude. It
just isn't funny enough in its particulars to make you break up
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   The first feature film directed by Dean Parisot (from a
screenplay by Vince Gilligan), ``Home Fries'' belongs to the same
comic genre as ``Clay Pigeons,'' another intelligent but not
terribly funny dark comedy that opened in September and quickly
disappeared. Both films throw together an unlikely assortment of
familiar American types and let them all go a little crazy. At the
center of the goofy psychological maelstrom in ``Home Fries'' is
Sally Jackson (Drew Barrymore), a worker at a rural Burger-Matic
who is carrying the baby of a married man. In the movie's opening
scenes, the reluctant father-to-be is pursued, driven off the road
and literally scared to death by two men in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots, Dorian (Luke Wilson) and Angus (Jake Busey), both
Army National Guardsmen, turn out to be the victim's two stepsons,
acting on the orders of their mother (Catherine O'Hara) to scare
her cheating husband back into being faithful. The boys, being
dutiful, God-fearing sons devoted to Mom and apple pie, wouldn't
think of disobeying her. But during their mission they hear strange
voices on the helicopter's radio. Realizing later that the voices
could conceivably be witnesses against them in a murder trial, they
decide to investigate the source. Taking a job at the Burger-Matic
where the employees communicate on radio headsets, Dorian
determines to find out who heard what. There he meets and is
immediately infatuated with his late stepfather's very pregnant
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the humor of ``Home Fries'' comes from the collision of
caricatures who suggest refugees from ``Tobacco Road'' reinvented
for a 1990s version of the classic '70s sitcom ``Mary Hartman, Mary
Hartman.'' The two young pilots are revealed to be nursing a fierce
sibling rivalry that eventually erupts into another mad helicopter
chase. Their mother _ fluttery and scatterbrained one minute,
poisonous the next _ is a trailer-trash version of a classic
Southern belle.
</P>
<P>
   Sally, who lives in a dilapidated shack with her eccentric
mother and drunken father, is by far the sanest character in this
crazed bunch. In a sweet, understated performance, Ms. Barrymore
makes Sally the movie's likable common-sense grounding wire.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Home Fries'' evokes a cultural climate overheated with
tabloid television and talk show melodrama, its humor lacks teeth.
By the end of the movie, you almost long for the gross-out
shenanigans that comedies aiming a little lower deliver with such
leering gusto. One good salacious joke in ``Home Fries'' would have
helped a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Fries'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It
has some strong language.
</P>

OTTAWA SEEKS TO BLOCK TEXAS EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canada is pulling out the diplomatic stops to save a
native son from the deadly needle of the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stanley Faulder, a 61-year-old Albertan on death row at
the Ellis Unit prison in Huntsville, Texas, is scheduled to be
executed Dec. 10 by lethal injection for the murder of an elderly
widow. Faulder would become the first Canadian put to death in the
United States in nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa is expected to take the unusual step Wednesday of filing
a ``friend of the court'' brief with the US Supreme Court in an
effort to block the execution. It is rare for a foreign government
to lend its weight to the last-ditch legal maneuvers that take
place as the hours tick down toward an execution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy has appealed for
clemency to Secretary of State Madeline Albright, Texas Governor
George W. Bush, and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada opposes capital punishment on a humanitarian basis, but
we also feel this individual's rights were violated under the
Vienna Convention,'' said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sophie
Legendre, referring to an international treaty requiring that
foreigners accused of crimes be informed that they have the right
to seek diplomatic assistance from their own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Faulder was never informed of his right to speak to the
Canadian government,'' said Legendre. ``Nor was the Canadian
government ever told he was arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of Faulder's supporters in Canada believe he is innocent.
Still, his plight has touched a nerve in a country that banned the
death penalty in 1976, and conducted its last executions in 1962
with a double hanging in Toronto. He is one of three Canadians on
death row in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely wrong, that Americans would still use such a
means of punishment,'' said Joyce Milgaard of Winnipeg, a
prisoners' rights activist whose son, David, served 23 years in
Canadian prison for a murder that later evidence showed he did not
commit. ``We can't stand by and let this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pleas reverberating from the north, there appears
little prospect that either Bush or the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles will opt for clemency. Texas executes more people than any
other state: 161 of the more than 480 convicts put to death since
the United States restored capital punishment in 1976 have been
executed in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder would be the first Canadian executed in the United
States since 1952, when Stan Buckowski of Ontario died in the gas
chamber in San Quentin, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, 1975, Faulder and a prostitute named Stormy Summers,
bent on robbery, talked their way into the home of Inez Phillips in
Gladewater, Texas, binding the 75-year-old woman with tape and
torturing her before driving a knife into her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible, vicious crime that still haunts our
community,'' said Gladewater Mayor Curtis Bight.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was caught in 1977, and convicted on the basis of a
confession given to police. That conviction was overturned, but he
was convicted again in 1981 on the basis of testimony from the
prostitute, who was given immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Faulder has won five stays of execution. But his
appeals appear to have run out.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., he refused
to discuss his guilt or innocence. But he did offer views on
capital punishment. ``I'd hate for Canada to go back to the death
penalty,'' he said. ``There is no fair way you can adjudicate
capital punishment.''

<P>
   Gorgeous to look at but virtually uninhabited, the Metropolitan
Opera's new ``Traviata'' seems to have been the victim of a neutron
bomb. Whatever happened during the process of preparation, Monday
night's opening performance found Franco Zeffirelli's sets still
standing but not an opera character left alive.
</P>
<P>
   We have had periodic reports on the progress of the Met's new
production and have crossed our fingers in hopes that bad luck and
bad judgment would somehow be overcome. I am afraid they haven't.
Zeffirelli reverts to his worst instincts in the last two acts, but
his new look at Verdi's masterpiece remains waiting and ready for a
cast strong enough in personality to compete with its director's
illusions of grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Originally thought of for these performances was the
wife-husband team of Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna. They were
shown the door when their demands were deemed highhanded. To
replace Ms. Gheorghiu, Renee Fleming was named, but she withdrew
scarcely a month ago. Personal problems were cited, but backstage
rumblings hint that Ms. Fleming was having trouble with Act I's
severe coloratura demands. Patricia Racette, who was to have sung
some of the later performances anyway, stepped into the No. 1 slot,
and it was she who sang Violetta on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Alagna was an Argentine tenor and relatively unknown
commodity, Marcelo Alvarez. To complete this revolving door of a
production, Vladimir Chernov reported in sick near the end, and
Haijing Fu was brought in to take the role of Germont. Perhaps the
only musical consistency left in place was James Levine and the Met
orchestra; both seem to play more glowingly with each new
assignment. (Dare we mention that originally scheduled for ``La
Traviata'' was the young British conductor Simone Young, and not
Levine at all?)
</P>
<P>
   Zeffirelli, as usual, will not be ignored, and here he plays the
interior decorator with a taste for Empire style and an unlimited
budget to indulge it. Act I is magnificent luxury. Despite good
intentions, the mind keeps fixing on Zeffirelli's choice of
wallpaper. If and when this production is retired, those two
splendid sofas in the opening scene would fit right in my living
room.
</P>
<P>
   The country house decor is all flowers and sunlight, a
sybarite's dream. Act II, Scene 2, is Zeffirelli-at-the-Met as we
know him best. With its lacy crimson veils and descending steps,
his ballroom is big, big, big, while Violetta and Alfredo are not.
Opera is miniaturized by the grandness around it. The dance
sequences here are wonderful, made naughty by the introduction of
dancing cows with provocatively stuffed bosoms and behinds.
</P>
<P>
   Act III indulges the director's fascination with the Met's stage
elevator. He is as ever the master of the gratuitous scene change,
and having Violetta's death scene begin in the upstairs bedroom and
end in the parlor may serve no dramatic purpose, but it makes sure
we won't forget that Verdi and Zeffirelli have equal billing in
these proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   One wishes no disrespect toward Ms. Racette. She is an excellent
singer and a scrupulous performer. The voice carries. The
coloratura is firm. The expression is in place. There are some
adventures with high notes, but they are quickly covered. Yet it is
a portrayal that projects light but no heat. We consistently admire
Ms. Racette's singing without ever being moved by Violetta's
plight. It is as if Violetta scarcely exists at all.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is multiplied in the case of Alvarez, a tenor of
pleasant natural qualities and modest prospects but clearly out of
his depth in this setting. Alvarez is hardly compelling onstage,
and the musicality is inelegant, at moments downright coarse. One
blamed him less than the people who put him in such an unfair
position in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Fu was even more baffling. Certainly there were
better last-minute alternatives for such a well-traveled role. No
production will survive a Germont wan to the point of invisibility.
Fu's severe vocal problems often went unnoticed, because he himself
was barely noticeable. He was one more misfortune in the bringing
together of this ``Traviata.'' The problems were not always
self-made, but they have been met with a curious halfheartedness.
In the end, compelling singing will stand up to Zeffirelli's ego.
When it is put in place, this production might do very well.

SCIENTISTS DISCOVER `WIRING' THAT CONTROLS YEAST GENES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exploiting the power of new, miniaturized ``laboratories on a
chip,'' scientists have discovered the key network of biological
controls that turn off or on all of the 6,000 genes in a baker's
yeast cell.
</P>
<P>
   It is a step, said the researchers, toward eventually tracing
the same kinds of gene controls in humans, which could lead to
better and safer drugs and a deeper understanding of health and
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in the current edition of the journal Cell,
researchers led by Richard Young of the Whitehead Institute in
Cambridge, Mass. say they used the tiny silicon chip-based
analyzers, also known as DNA arrays, to identify a master ``wiring
diagram'' that enables yeast cells to regulate their genes,
one-at-a-time or in groups.
</P>
<P>
   They created the biological wiring diagram by knocking out parts
of the control mechanism, one at a time, to see which genes were
affected. In concept, it is like switching different
circuit-breakers off in a house, noting which rooms go dark and
which appliances go off, to figure out the paths controlled by the
circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of different on-off patterns of genes in the yeast
cell gives scientists insights into how the organism grows, mates,
and responds to environmental changes, said Young in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report is published as other scientists, also using the
lab-on-a-chip tool, are looking for similar patterns of gene
activation and deactivation when they expose yeast organisms to
various pharmaceutical drugs. This is a quick and comprehensive way
to predict what beneficial effects and side effects the drug might
cause. Still others, in the field of what is called
pharmacogenomics, are using the DNA arrays to scan human genetic
material in a search for normal variations that explain why drugs
have different effects in different individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who headed a team from the Whitehead and UMass Medical
Center, credited the relatively new DNA chips with making possible
a great leap in analyzing how genes work. Until now, he said, using
traditional lab techniques ``it's taken us 40 years to learn how a
few dozen genes are regulated. Now, almost overnight, we're
learning how 6,000 genes work.''
</P>
<P>
   The chips are tiny silicon wafers, less than an inch square, to
which tens of thousands of DNA genetic probes are attached.
</P>
<P>
   In searching for the control circuits of the yeast cell, Young
explained, the scientists isolated all the messenger RNA _ copies
of genetic information that are produced when a gene is
``expressed,'' or switched on. When the solution of messenger RNA
was placed on the tiny chip, the tens of thousands of genetic
probes searched for specific RNA sequences. By noting which RNA
sequences were present and which were absent, the chip created a
rec-ord of which genes were on and which were off.
</P>
<P>
   Those on-off patterns were different depending on the state of
the yeast cell when its genetic information was analyzed, said
Young _ mating, responding to shortages of nutrients, or meeting
other environmental challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists knew that every gene's activity is regulated by a
protein _ part of the control mechanism. In yeast, there are about
250 activator proteins that shut genes on and off. In an effort to
determine which genes each protein regulated, the &UR;  &LR; scientists
``knocked out'' or disabled one protein at a time and noted the
gene changes using the DNA arrays.
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, noted Young, the scientists thought that perhaps
knocking out even one important regulatory component would disable
the entire cell. ``Instead, what happens is that when one regulator
is knocked out, sets of genes that are involved in very specific
cellular functions shut down,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitehead scientists say they will have a complete
description of the regulatory components of yeast genes by next
summer. They are placing the results on a Web site for other
scientists to access. Otherwise, said Young, publishing all their
findings in paper journals ``would take all the volumes Cell ever
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Other authors of the paper include Frank Holstege and Eric
Lander at the Whitehead and Michael R. Green of UMass Medical
Center.

OTTAWA SEEKS TO BLOCK TEXAS EXECUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Canada is pulling out the diplomatic stops to save a
native son from the deadly needle of the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Stanley Faulder, a 61-year-old Albertan on death row at
the Ellis Unit prison in Huntsville, Texas, is scheduled to be
executed Dec. 10 by lethal injection for the murder of an elderly
widow. Faulder would become the first Canadian put to death in the
United States in nearly half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa is expected to take the unusual step Wednesday of filing
a ``friend of the court'' brief with the US Supreme Court in an
effort to block the execution. It is rare for a foreign government
to lend its weight to the last-ditch legal maneuvers that take
place as the hours tick down toward an execution.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy has appealed for
clemency to Secretary of State Madeline Albright, Texas Governor
George W. Bush, and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada opposes capital punishment on a humanitarian basis, but
we also feel this individual's rights were violated under the
Vienna Convention,'' said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sophie
Legendre, referring to an international treaty requiring that
foreigners accused of crimes be informed that they have the right
to seek diplomatic assistance from their own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Faulder was never informed of his right to speak to the
Canadian government,'' said Legendre. ``Nor was the Canadian
government ever told he was arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   Few of Faulder's supporters in Canada believe he is innocent.
Still, his plight has touched a nerve in a country that banned the
death penalty in 1976, and conducted its last executions in 1962
with a double hanging in Toronto. He is one of three Canadians on
death row in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely wrong, that Americans would still use such a
means of punishment,'' said Joyce Milgaard of Winnipeg, a
prisoners' rights activist whose son, David, served 23 years in
Canadian prison for a murder that later evidence showed he did not
commit. ``We can't stand by and let this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pleas reverberating from the north, there appears
little prospect that either Bush or the Texas Board of Pardons and
Paroles will opt for clemency. Texas executes more people than any
other state: 161 of the more than 480 convicts put to death since
the United States restored capital punishment in 1976 have been
executed in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder would be the first Canadian executed in the United
States since 1952, when Stan Buckowski of Ontario died in the gas
chamber in San Quentin, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On July 8, 1975, Faulder and a prostitute named Stormy Summers,
bent on robbery, talked their way into the home of Inez Phillips in
Gladewater, Texas, binding the 75-year-old woman with tape and
torturing her before driving a knife into her heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible, vicious crime that still haunts our
community,'' said Gladewater Mayor Curtis Bight.
</P>
<P>
   Faulder was caught in 1977, and convicted on the basis of a
confession given to police. That conviction was overturned, but he
was convicted again in 1981 on the basis of testimony from the
prostitute, who was given immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Faulder has won five stays of execution. But his
appeals appear to have run out.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., he refused
to discuss his guilt or innocence. But he did offer views on
capital punishment. ``I'd hate for Canada to go back to the death
penalty,'' he said. ``There is no fair way you can adjudicate
capital punishment.''

FUND INVESTORS JUMPING BACK INTO STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excited by Wall Street's surge, mutual fund investors are once
again buying stock funds in earnest, casting off months of doubt
and helping to fuel a rise in the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Only four months ago, investors were scared out of equity funds
by the stock market's steep plunge. Now they have apparently
decided that the Dow's upswing is too good to sit out. The renewed
confidence, the result of recent interest rate cuts designed to
boost the economy and quell prospects of a global recession,
represents a major shift after months of skittish sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are expected to pour $13 billion into equity funds
this month, according to Carl Wittnebert of Trimtabs.com Investment
Research, a Santa Rose, Calif. firm that estimates fund flows. That
amount is six times October's level and double September's flows,
and is an about-face from August. That month, amid cries that the
US bull market had run out of steam, investors shocked fund firms
by yanking $11 billion out of stock funds as the Dow plunged.
</P>
<P>
   November's buying also represents a strong rebound from October,
when stock funds gained a meager $2.35 billion in net new
investments, according to data released Tuesday by the Investment
Company Institute, a trade group. The Dow did not begin to pick up
until mid-October, when the Federal Reserve undertook the second of
three interest rate cuts; investors apparently waited until
November to digest the news and wade back in.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after withdrawals are factored in, net investments in
stock funds last month are only a third of year-ago levels. In
October 1997, when the US stock market first shuddered at Asia's
economic crisis, domestic stock funds still drew in a net $18.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   There is strong evidence that a major market rally will lure
fund investors back into buying, regardless of volatility or
warnings about overvalued prices. At Fidelity Investments of
Boston, the nation's largest fund firm, net sales of stock funds in
November are on track to be the strongest monthly sales so far this
year, and possibly the best November sales in five years,
spokeswoman Anne W. Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity stock funds had grabbed $3 billion so far this month,
compared to outflows of $1 billion in October, she said. Overall,
Fidelity funds of all stripes would take in around $6 billion this
month, three times October's levels.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund firms also reported a rebound in sales this month.
The Vanguard Group of Valley Forge, Pa., the nation's second
largest fund company, said its stock funds would attract $2.6
billion for November, double October's level. Eighty percent of the
new cash was going into the company's popular index funds, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual funds attracting new cash these days are chock-a-block
with the large-company issues behind the market's new rally.
Crowley said Fidelity's best sellers included Dividend Growth,
Magellan, and Growth &AMP; Income. The latter two are closed to new
investors, meaning existing shareholders have clamored to put more
money in, she said.
</P>
<P>
   After the August crash, when the Dow sank 6.4 percent and
investors worried that the eight-year bull market was over,
stock-loving Americans switched gears and turned to conservative
investments.
</P>
<P>
   While investors are now buying stock funds again, conservative
products are still selling well this year. Although down 18 percent
last month compared to September's level, bond fund sales have
tripled so far in 1998. And year-to-date sales of money market
funds are up 129 percent. Overall, stock funds have taken in $142.7
billion over the first 10 months of 1998, a decline of 19 percent
on year-ago levels and the first time since 1994 that annual sales
may drop, ICI data showed.

   WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 -- A new batch of $29.9 million in loans and
grants is on the way to Philadelphia as part of a federal effort to
spur urban economic development, with a focus on luring businesses
and industry to the now-defunct Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development officials doled out the funding Tuesday, giving
Philadelphia a $2 million grant and $27.9 million in loans.
Philadelphia's share was the largest of $213 million in loans and
grants for development and job creation in 23 cities.
</P>
<P>
   City development officials said they will use about half of the
money to offer incentives and low interest loans to businesses to
move to an industrial park in the Navy Yard in the next five years.
The rest of the funding will go to other economic development
efforts, such as refurbishing run-down buildings and other ongoing
programs.
</P>
<P>
   All told, federal officials believe the Philadelphia funding
would lead to almost 1,800 new jobs, particularly if the city can
leverage the federal money into an estimated $260 million in
private funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled to have this leverage in getting businesses
interested in moving to the shipyard,'' said William Hankowsky,
president of the Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation,
the city's economic development arm that will administer the loan
funds. ``We will be able to attract industrial firms, corporate
offices, warehouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hankowsky said he hopes the funding will help make Philadelphia
into a national model on how to redevelop closed military bases.
</P>
<P>
   The base closure commission announced its intentions to shutdown
the Navy Yard in 1991, officially closing its doors in September of
1995.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the new federal funds and private shipbuilding
contracts, city officials hope the shipyard is well on the way to
being converted from military to commercial and industrial use.
</P>
<P>
   The federal money will go toward luring businesses to the
industrial park section of the old Navy grounds, around I-95, west
of the shipyard section. That portion of the yard is being taken
over by Kvaerner, a Norwegian shipbuilding company. Kvaerner
Philadelphia Shipyard is being underwritten with $240 million from
the state and the city, and another $185 million in workforce
training funds from federal and local sources.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the Thanksgiving spirit, Gore said creating urban
jobs was a key mission in an otherwise robust economy. ``We must
not judge our success by the size of the national feast, but by the
number of those who fit around the table,'' he said.

NO SURGERY FOR BLEDSOE'S BROKEN FINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Hope surfaced again for the Patriots
following a 26-23 victory over the Miami Dolphins Monday night.
Hope that a season could be saved. Hope that Drew Bledsoe may play
Sunday afternoon against Doug Flutie and the Buffalo Bills. Hope
that the Patriots could make a comeback after losing four of five
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' quarterback fractured his right index finger in
two places with less than two minutes remaining in the game and
debated whether he could stay in. But he pulled out a huge win with
a gutsy fourth-down completion to Shawn Jefferson to the 25,
followed by a touchdown pass to Jefferson with 29 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's heroic effort, with a busted finger that had gone
numb, may have saved the Patriots' season.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Bledsoe visited Dr. James Herndon, a hand specialist at
Massachusetts General Hospital, who ruled out surgery, which means
Bledsoe will not have to have pins or screws inserted.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether Bledsoe will be able to play with a
fitted splint, which may allow him enough freedom to grip the
football and throw it. That appears to be a long shot, but the
doctor decided that Bledsoe was not going to be fitted with a cast.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots said in a statement that Bledsoe's status ``is
undetermined at this time and will be updated during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Bledsoe will test the splint to see if he can
throw effectively with it. The index finger is used mainly to guide
the ball and get a tight spiral; without use of it, Bledsoe found
that his throws tended to sail, as evidenced by a pair of
incompletions before the fourth-down heroics.
</P>
<P>
   Another hand specialist, Dr. Susan Scott, who is a member of the
Association of Professional Team Physicians, said, ``In general, a
fracture of that kind would take four weeks to heal and it would
require immobilization of the area (i.e. a cast).''
</P>
<P>
   Scott did not examine Bledsoe, whose condition may be less
severe than the kind she was addressing, since he does not need
surgery or a cast.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe may find, after practicing with a splint, that he is
unable to go, which leaves the Patriots with either Scott Zolak or
Tom Tupa.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak had his helmet on Monday night and was two steps on the
field when Bledsoe came to the sideline during a timeout shaking
his hand, unable to get feeling in the finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know whether I'd be hurting the team by going back
out there,'' said Bledsoe, who injured the finger with 1:55
remaining when he hit the helmet of onrushing defensive tackle
Shane Burton on his follow-through.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates in the huddle were wondering whether Bledsoe should be
out there, because the finger looked bad. Jefferson even told
Bledsoe, ``I'm not sure this is going to work.'' As it turned out,
Bledsoe made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who earned NFL Player of the Week honors after
completing 28 of 43 passes for 423 yards and two touchdowns, said
after the game that he expected to play against the Bills. But the
finger likely has stiffened since then, with soreness setting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably know more by the end of the week,'' said
Carroll. ``If he can play with what he's got, then he'll be out
there. I don't know how hard it is to play with two cracks in your
finger. Hopefully, he'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll wouldn't commit to Zolak as the substitute if Bledsoe
can't go. Tupa, who played well in the exhibition season, has a
good throwing arm, which might suit the spread-out offense that
Ernie Zampese introduced Monday night. But the Patriots may not
want to risk getting their punter injured.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the injury couldn't be worse. He seemed to thrive
in the shotgun formation with five receivers, and he was excelling
in the no-huddle offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the Drew Bledsoe we know,'' said safety Willie Clay.
``The whole defense was rooting for him. He took charge and control
and directed the offense with a broken finger. That's the character
we see in this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Patriots will have to decide is whether a less-than-100
percent Bledsoe is better than Zolak or Tupa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to be in first place again next week,'' said
Carroll. ``We're hoping we can overcome these things and do it. It
seemed the odds were stacked against us late in that game and we
pulled it out. Those are my favorite moments in this game.''

 &HT;    Videotape of midfield brawl shows Gator QB involved
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Further review of the videotape of Saturday's pregame
fight between Florida and Florida State revealed that Gator
quarterback Doug Johnson threw the ball into the pile of players,
nearly hitting Florida State coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Florida does not plan to punish Johnson, but athletics director
Jeremy Foley said he was ``embarrassed'' by the total incident and
guaranteed that ``it will not happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Players from the two teams began exchanging blows at midfield
about 20 minutes before kickoff at Doak Campbell Stadium in
Tallahassee. SEC officials separated the two teams and ejected
starting Florida cornerback Tony George and two Florida State
reserves, linemen Ronald Boldin and Josh Baggs.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Sentinel reported Tuesday that it had reviewed
several videotape clips of the melee and saw Johnson firing a ball
into the middle of the fracas, hitting assistant strength coach
Eric Johnson and narrowly missing Bowden. The SEC officials who
worked the game were aware of the thrown ball when they were
discussing penalties but could not determine who had thrown the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said he had not reviewed the videotape but was aware of
reports that Johnson had thrown the ball at the Florida State
coaches. He said that he had discussed the matter with coach Steve
Spurrier and that Johnson would not be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Johnson nor Spurrier could be reached for comment
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the best thing to do at this point is to let the
ejections stand and move on,'' Foley said. ``Doug will have to live
with the criticism he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Foley made it clear Tuesday that he is upset about the
incident, which he called ``an embarrassment to everyone associated
with the University of Florida.'' He said that by next season he
will have a plan in place to prevent it from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to surround the field with police to separate
the teams, but we will find a way to make sure nothing like this
ever happens again, I guarantee you that,'' Foley said. ``It was an
embarrassing situation for the university and totally uncalled for.
Maybe if I had been more pro-active, I could have done something,
but we will not tolerate that kind of behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The videotape also showed that George's ejection came for
punching FSU graduate assistant coach Steve Gabbard, not assistant
Odell Haggins, as had originally been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Foley said that George, a senior, will play in Florida's bowl
game.

   RAFAH, Gaza _ Palestinians celebrated with euphoria the
long-delayed opening of their international airport Tuesday as a
parade of planes swooped down from cottony skies and glided to a
literal red-carpet landing in the flatlands of Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   With brass bands, bag-pipes and grandiloquent speeches,
Palestinian officials made it clear that they see the sleekly
modern airport as the most concrete symbol yet of their fledgling
sovereignty. The high emotion and pageantry Tuesday stood in stark
contrast to the muted response last week to an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my day of great joy as a Palestinian refugee,'' said
Ahmad Abdel Rachman, the general secretary of the Palestinian
Cabinet. ``I am standing on Palestinian soil, and I have an
airport, I have a flag, I have an airplane. This is our path to the
independent Palestinian state.''
</P>
<P>
   The airport, a potential economic lifeline to the depressed Gaza
Strip, was completed more than a year ago, with about $60 million
in grants from Egypt and Morocco as well as from Spain and other
European Union countries. But its fate became mired in the
stalemated peace talks until the peace memorandum signed in
Washington last month provided a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaza International Airport, with 400 employees, will open
for regular business next week. Royal Air Maroc is expected to
begin Gaza-Casablanca service. And the Palestinian National Airline
will fly routes to Amman, Cairo and Jidda with three planes: two
Fokker 50s donated by the Netherlands, and a 20-year-old Boeing 727
given by Saudi Prince Walled bin Talal. There are 20 pilots, most
with Egyptian flying certificates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may look like a little airport to you, but to us, it's
bigger than John F. Kennedy,'' said Nabil Shurafa, a travel agent
in Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
   The alabaster towers of the new airport rise from a particularly
hardscrabble stretch of southern Gaza near the Egyptian border.
Thousands of local residents pushed at its gates Tuesday morning,
begging to be let into the closed ceremony, gaping at the
elaborate, Moroccan-style architecture, and ducking with the whoosh
of each landing plane.
</P>
<P>
   For Mafa Barbakh, an elderly woman wrapped in black from head to
toe, the moment was too important to experience from afar. Like
many, she said she had never even seen a plane before. She wanted
to be on the tarmac, to ululate and raise her hands to the heavens.
She finally did, when the gates were opened and the Palestinians
swarmed the grounds _ chanting, dancing, laying down prayer rugs
and otherwise making it their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to fly to Mecca,'' she said. ``I hope God gives me this
gift, to go up in the sky like a bird, on Palestinian wings. Hey,
we have Palestinian passports now. I can travel with my Palestinian
passport on a Palestinian plane. This is Palestine!''
</P>
<P>
   At 8:30 a.m., with a punctuality remarkable for Gaza, the first
of seven planes landed: a white Airbus from Egypt, disgorging
government officials and three actors. One, a comedian, Adel Imam,
caused the the Palestine National Airline's entire staff of flight
attendants _ 18 women in navy pants suits and Muslim head scarves _
to jump up and down and squeal.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft carrying delegations from other principal donors to the
project followed: the Jordanians, the Moroccans, the Spanish, the
Dutch and, aboard an Israeli charter, some European Union
officials. The bagpipes, a holdover from the days of the British
Mandate, seemed a disconcerting greeting to many who strode down
the red carpet past upturned bayonets on their way into the V.I.P.
lounge to see Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the airport was named Yasser Arafat International
Airport by Arafat's aides, and signs were duly posted. But the
Palestinian leader was not pleased. The signs were taken down, and
the original entry banner restrung: Gaza International Airport, it
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The V.I.P. lounge, a lavish building decorated with Moroccan
mosaics, crystal chandeliers and a fountain, bears a gilded dome
atop its roof, meant to echo the Dome of the Rock Mosque in
Jerusalem. In a way that irked Israeli officials, Jerusalem was
itself a constant theme as Palestinian officials got swept away by
the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``God willing, we will open the Jerusalem Airport next,'' Arafat
said. ``God willing, we will land soon at the Jerusalem Airport.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of Jerusalem will be debated in the final-status peace
talks, which began last week. The Israelis say it will remain
undivided, but the Palestinians want to reclaim East Jerusalem,
annexed by Israel in 1967, as the capital of their eventual state.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, under the peace memorandum signed in Washington, the
first phase of a three-part Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
tripled the amount of territory under complete Palestinian control.
Still, it was sparsely populated, rural land dotted with small
towns and villages. The Palestinian response was quiet, and Arafat
received only two calls of congratulations from world leaders: one
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the other from a
Norwegian official.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, in contrast, a who's who of the Palestinian
leadership, flanked by dignitaries from the Arab world and Europe,
declared the airport's opening a milestone, while the Palestinian
police danced with their rifles in the air. The officials said it
would ease the claustrophobia of Gazans, who feel locked into their
dusty strip of territory by Israeli border checkpoints most do not
have permits to cross.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``These people in Gaza have been living in this ghetto since
1948,'' Abdel Rachman said, talking with foreign reporters. ``More
than 60 to 70 percent have never left. Now with free access to the
rest of the world, they will feel they're human, like all of you.''
</P>
<P>
   During the year-and-a-half delay before the airport opened, the
Palestinian airline operated on a limited basis out of El Arish in
Egypt. Passengers traveled by bus across the border and often
waited hours before departure. Most business travelers flew out of
Cairo; those who imported goods relied on Israeli ports or the
airport in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'll be able to travel like a regular businessman, on
overnight trips,'' Sayeed el-Madhoun, who owns a floor-covering
company, said while videotaping the ceremony. ``And it'll make it
easier and cheaper to bring materials in and out.''
</P>
<P>
   When the airport opens for regular service next week, there will
still be difficulties to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Some $15 million in donated equipment, including radar and
high-tech air-traffic-control devices, has been held up in a
dispute between Israel and the donor nations. Most of it has sat in
the port of Ashdod for the last year. Now the Port Authority of
Israel is demanding $650,000 in storage fees to release it.
</P>
<P>
   And about $3 million in night-landing equipment donated by
Germany has been held in Hamburg because the Germans fear similar
difficulties with Israeli customs and security officials.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the airport will at first handle only daylight
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Israelis will retain considerable control over routes,
flight schedules and security. Israeli aviation officials, in fact,
have described the Gaza airport as a new airport under Israel's
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   As they do at some of the land crossings into Jordan, the
Israelis will operate a kind of shadow document-checking system.
Palestinian officials will review passengers' documents, passing
them behind a screen to Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Fadda Jabr, a former negotiator for the Palestinian Authority,
brushed aside those issues as mere ``technical difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the concrete evidence of the success of the camp of
peace,'' he said. ``Now the ink of the agreement has turned into
something we can see, we can touch and we can admire. Lovely, isn't
it?''

SOUTH AFRICA TRIES TO SMOOTH VOTER-REGISTRATION WRINKLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ In 1994, South Africa's first
all-race elections were sloppy, but everybody was too happy to
care. This time they care.
</P>
<P>
   Last time, there was no voter registration. All you had to do
was show up with an identification document. This time, however,
the country is trying to enforce stricter controls.
</P>
<P>
   But for weeks controversy has been brewing over the registration
process, and fears that administrative chaos could keep millions
from voting have been growing. A date for the elections has not
been set, though sometime in May seems likely.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Independent Electoral Commission announced that it
would postpone its registration drive in about half the country,
saying it was not prepared to meet a goal it set for itself that
seemed hopelessly optimistic _ to sign up 23 million of 25 million
eligible voters this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said they needed more time to train the
72,000 civil servants and 8,000 soldiers who were to man 15,000
registration booths.
</P>
<P>
   The commission had to turn to the civil servants because it does
not have the money to hire and train its own workers.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the latest problem with the registration. More than
5 million people are thought to lack the updated national identity
booklets needed to register. Red tape, confusion and long lines
have hindered many from getting their documents. And most of those
left out in the cold are white, because blacks acted quickly to get
rid of their apartheid-era papers.
</P>
<P>
   The governing African National Congress is nevertheless
insisting that the new bar-coded identification documents are
needed to register, and this has set off an outcry from the mainly
white-supported opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in the registration process hardly appeased them.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the National Party, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, said
the delay in voter registration showed that the country was being
governed ``by a bunch of incompetent people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nationally broadcast speech, President Nelson Mandela said
difficulties were to be expected given the scope of the first-time
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the work that has been done so far and the good will that
has been shown give me the confidence that we will succeed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the commission's new plan, only the nation's five northern
provinces, including Gauteng, where Johannesburg and Pretoria are
situated, will register voters Friday, Saturday and Sunday. The
provinces account for about half the number of eligible voters.
</P>
<P>
   The other four will go forward Dec. 3-5, said the commission's
chief electoral officer, Mandla Mchunu.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls indicate a decline in the support for the African
National Congress, with a growing number of South Africans saying
they are uncommitted to any party. Some experts believe, however,
that those voters are likely to return to the parties they left. In
any case, even with the lost of support, the ANC is still the
choice of between 50 and 60 percent of the voters, making its
victory a largely foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   The issue for the ANC, however, is not whether it will win the
election, but whether it can capture more than two-thirds of the
vote, the share needed for it to change the constitution. A few
months ago, party officials were open about this goal, but lately
say less about it. The other parties rallied quickly to question
what it was that the ANC wanted to change and to warn about giving
any one party that much power.
</P>
<P>
   Which party will become the official opposition is more in
question. There is quite a lot of jockeying among the opposition
parties. The party that brought South Africa apartheid, the
National Party, has plunged in many of the recent polls. It won
about 22 percent of the vote in the 1994 elections, but some
surveys have said it would now win less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The largely white, liberal and very vocal Democratic Party is
gaining ground, as is the newly created United Democratic Party,
which is an attempt at a multiracial party.
</P>
<P>
   The date for the election is to be set by Mandela. But the
constitution prohibits him from doing so before late April. Mchunu
said the commission was urging Mandela to settle on a May election
date, before the winter set in and days shortened in the Southern
Hemisphere.

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
A courtship that seemed one-sided from its inception ended rather
predictably Tuesday morning. To the surprise of almost no one,
Randy Johnson will wed himself to a team other than the Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barry Meister, one of Johnson's agents, informed Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker that it would take a four-year contract to
sign the Big Unit, and that was one more year than the Astros were
willing to offer. The Astros officially withdrew their three-year,
$33 million offer to Johnson and likely are done with any major
dealings this offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that early on I was less than optimistic,''
Hunsicker said. ``For a guy who spent a couple of months here, I
would like to have heard a more definitive endorsement that we were
among the top teams vying for his services, and we really never
heard that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who was 10-1 with a 1.28 ERA after joining the Astros
in a July 31 trade with Seattle, is expected to decide on a new
team by the end of the week. Arizona, Anaheim, Los Angeles and
Texas appear to be on his final list of competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy really enjoyed Houston,'' Meister said. ``He had a
wonderful time there. All things being relatively equal, Houston
was clearly a part of our plans. It was a mutual parting of the
ways. We agreed to disagree. This wasn't just about money; it was
mostly about the term of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy would like to play at least four more years, and he's
hoping to sign where he would finish his career. We've spoken to a
number of clubs that feel like four years is the right term for
this contract. There's a pretty good chance that Randy will make a
decision in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on his past experiences with Doug Drabek and Greg
Swindell, Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. didn't feel it was in his
team's best interest to offer a four-year contract to Johnson, who
will celebrate his 36th birthday next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for some reason Randy was not able to pitch at a high level
in the third and fourth year, it just paralyzes the entire team
because you have so much money wrapped up in one player who is not
producing at an extremely high level,'' McLane said. ``We just were
not ready to take that risk. We're disappointed that it didn't
work, but we just had to be truthful and honest with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros also were truthful with themselves, realizing the
longer the Johnson saga played out, the more their chances of
re-signing the coveted free agent eroded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling was that once we got past the exclusive period
and into the open market, we're always going to be the underdog
when it comes to an open competition financially, and ultimately
that's what happened,'' Hunsicker said. ``We made a very aggressive
offer right out of the box, and it really didn't go from there. As
the stakes got higher, we were not prepared to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Re-signing Johnson would have put the Astros over the $50
million mark in terms of payroll already committed to players in
1999, and that doesn't include the eight arbitration-eligible
players on the roster. Signing Johnson almost certainly would have
meant unloading key members of last season's team, which won a
franchise-record 102 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, the whole payroll wasn't $11 million,''
McLane said. ``I was very optimistic about it in the beginning, but
as time lingered and no decision was made, we felt it slipping
away. We're not sure, if Randy had agreed to the $11 million a
year, just how the team would have shaped up next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly would have had to make some provisions to the
team. We weren't sure if Randy was going to accept our offer, so we
really hadn't sorted through those things. But now, we don't have
to make those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears third baseman Ken Caminiti will be the Astros' only
major free-agent acquisition of the offseason. The club does not
expect to use the money designated for Johnson to lure another
big-ticket free agent to town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come a long way in a short period of time, and we have
to get back somewhat to reality,'' Hunsicker said. ``We have a very
exciting baseball team, and it's among the best in baseball without
Randy Johnson or another high-profile pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on our way to winning a division championship without
Randy. Certainly, he added the excitement and a significant piece
to our club. But as we all found out in the postseason, one person
does not make the difference between winning and losing. I like our
baseball team. I think it's going to be one of the top teams in all
of baseball and certainly a top contender to win our division next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, speculation in regard to acquiring five-time Cy Young
Award winner Roger Clemens from Toronto will continue to linger
until the Blue Jays decide which direction they're headed in the
immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Blue Jays don't indicate a strong desire to
trade Clemens, but that could change next month when the general
managers get together for baseball's winter meetings in Nashville,
Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros explored the possibility of trading for Clemens
before they acquired Johnson but were turned off by the Blue Jays'
demands, which are believed to have included at least two
established players and either outfielder Richard Hidalgo or
pitcher Scott Elarton.
</P>
<P>
   ``In getting someone like a Roger Clemens, we can't give up the
really high-quality young players that we have just to get one
player,'' McLane said. ``It's got to be something that works for
us. We'd certainly look at that very aggressively before we made a
decision. Shane Reynolds, Mike Hampton and Jose Lima are not a bad
crew to go with.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had hoped Johnson would help them reach the World
Series, but they were eliminated from the playoffs in the first
round despite two well-pitched games by Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Although they now have nothing to show for the trade that sent
prospects John Halama, Freddy Garcia and Carlos Guillen to Seattle,
Hunsicker said he had no second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have absolutely no regrets about the trade,'' Hunsicker
said. ``It provided a magical time in the city. It took the
excitement and enthusiasm for major-league baseball to a new level.
When we made this trade, we went into it with our eyes wide open
and really didn't even think about 1999. I think we got our money's
worth. We took a gamble that was worth taking, and I'd do it
again.''

<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; KING OF THE WORLD &QL; 
 &UR; David Remnick (Random House, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Remnick, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book, ``Lenin's
Tomb,'' and is now editor of ``The New Yorker,'' tells the deeply
American tale of the self-creation of Muhammad Ali. The book begins
with Ali's predecessors as heavyweight champion: Floyd Patterson _
the kind-hearted ``Good Negro'' who was burdened with a relentless
awareness of his own failures _ and his antithesis, Sonny Liston,
whose prison background and lack of education made him a target for
a condescending public. Then came Ali. Fast, sleek, confident and
controversial, he flew in the face of everything audiences and
sportswriters expected from fighters. He lived by his own terms,
and for a long time no one would forgive him for it. Remnick does a
spellbinding job of recreating the atmosphere into which Ali
brought his remarkable persona, dooming all of the best
heavyweights from that point on to languish in his shadow. ``I came
to love Ali,'' Patterson told Remnick. ``I came to see that I was a
fighter and he was history.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; LAS CHRISTMAS &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Esmeralda Santiago and Joie Davidow (Knopf, $22)
</P>
<P>
   Junot Diaz came to the United States when he was 7, just before
Christmas. He arrived in New York, where, he says, ``the December
winds plowed me open. . . . I remember my first weeks as a series
of astonishments: the cold, my father, English, our apartment, the
indoor plumbing, the TV, the loneliness of apartment life, of being
a recently arrived immigrant.'' Denise Chavez remembers better
holidays, paced by the quirky generosity of her mother. Julia
Alvarez writes about an uncle who on Christmas Eve was delivered
from political oppression in the Dominican Republic. Sandra
Cisneros offers a sermon about understanding and generosity, based
on memories of her father. We get lots of warm, fuzzy, forgettable
books at Christmas time, so when a good one comes along we like to
mention it. Here are poems, songs, recipes and stories by Latino
authors, including Luis J. Rodriguez, Ray Suarez, Gary Soto and
Francisco Goldman. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MADNESS ON THE COUCH &QL; 
 &UR; Edward Dolnick (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Dolnick, a contributing editor of ``Health'' magazine and former
science writer for the ``Boston Globe,'' takes on Freudian
psychoanalysis and the arrogance with which it was applied to three
forms of mental illness: schizophrenia, autism and
obsessive-compulsive disorder. Convinced of their righteousness,
Freud's disciples set out to conquer madness, their approach heavy
with egotism and unsupported by science. Here is psychoanalyst
Frieda Fromm-Reichmann in 1948: ``The schizophrenic is painfully
distrustful and resentful of other people due to the severe early
warp and rejection he encountered in important people of his
infancy and childhood, mainly in a schizophrenogenic mother.'' Or
Bruno Bettelheim, who said ``the precipitating factor in infantile
autism is the parent's wish that his child should not exist.''
Parents were blamed for their children's misery, whether they were
too cold or too loving _ either sin would do. As Dolnick points
out, it was an era of guilt-mongering and misinformation from which
we were slow to recover. ``Unlike con men,'' he writes, ``the
psychoanalysts fervently believed their own patter and ended up
bewitched by their own spells.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; AIR-CONDITIONING AMERICA &QL; 
 &UR; Gail Cooper (Johns Hopkins, $35)
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. Which could you live without _ your computer or
your air-conditioner? Cooper's history of efforts to achieve
artificial climates indoors (she points out that air-conditioning
first gained acceptance not among people looking for comfort but in
factories where owners were concerned about the effects of humidity
on production) is scholarly but entertaining. By 1917, movie
theaters were air-cooled as a competitive tool, but until the
technology was perfected, moviegoers took newspapers to wrap around
their feet as chilled air settled to the floor. And during World
War II, systems were removed from civilian buildings such as
Tiffany's and Lord and Taylor's and placed in military production
factories. These and other anecdotes make for an interesting look
at how new technologies become part of our lives. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SESAME STREET UNPAVED &QL; 
 &UR; David Borgenicht (Hyperion, $24.95)
</P>
<P>
   This one arrived with a bunch of yellow feathers tucked inside
the cover, and we almost swooned. ``Sesame Street'' (known as
``Sesameet'' to some people we know) is 30 years old this month.
Many of you have children or grandchildren who counted on it, and
Hyperion is now counting on you to be interested in a walk down
Memory Lane. The milestones are here: the death of Mr. Hooper, the
marriage of Maria and Luis, and one of our favorites (although not
a milestone by everyone's definition), Robert MacNeil's interview
with Oscar the Grouch (MacNeil: I see that you're in the ice-cream
business. Oscar: Oh, d'you figure that out all by yourself or did
Lehrer help you?). There's trivia _ Luis was the first human
addition to the original cast, and his marriage to Maria was done
in haste (Sonia Manzano, who plays Maria, was already pregnant in
real life _ her baby played Maria's baby on the show). Also
included are profiles of cast members and a list of famous guests.
Says Barbara Walters: ``I hear more from people who see me on
``Sesame Street'' singing ``Put Down the Duckie'' than from almost
any interview I do.'' &QL;

EX-SCREENWRIT ER'S `DAY' FAL TERS AFTER `TOMORROW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
DAY OF CONFESSION 
Allan Folsom (Little, Brown, $25) 
 
 By MONTY PHAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you didn't know author Allan Folsom was a former
screenwriter, his new novel, ``Day of Confession,'' may give you
some clues.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, there's a bit more going on than in your average pop
fiction thriller. Inside the front cover, there's a map of Italy,
where the story takes place. Inside the back cover, there's a map
of Vatican City, also crucial to the plot. Before the first page,
there's a movielike list of characters and their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the main character is an entertainment lawyer, a type
of person Folsom likely is familiar with, because he got a million
bucks for the film rights to his first novel, 1994's ``The Day
After Tomorrow,'' before it even was released.
</P>
<P>
   That book got its fair share of praise, and rightly so, melding
elements of horror and political intrigue into a tightly woven
plot. But this is a different ``Day.'' The maps and character list
make the book seem more like the print version of a movie than a
means to enhance the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Also, of the 20-some characters mentioned in the list, only
about 10 show up with regularity. Surely the reader is able to keep
track of 10 people in the time it takes to finish the book,
especially if the story is the up-all-night page-turner it claims
to be.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the point: It's not. It focuses on Harry Addison, a
Los Angeles entertainment lawyer who receives a desperate-sounding
message from his estranged brother, Daniel, a Vatican priest, days
after a Vatican cardinal is assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, while traveling to Assisi, Italy, the bus Daniel
is on explodes. After arriving in Rome to claim his brother's body,
Harry is taken into custody by Italian and Vatican police, who
believe Daniel was behind the cardinal's assassination and suspect
Harry may know something about it.
</P>
<P>
   However, Harry then begins to doubt his brother really is dead.
Before he can do anything about it, however, he is framed for a
police officer's murder, kidnapped, tortured by a terrorist also
looking for Father Daniel and then left for dead.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to flee police while searching for his brother, Harry
also stumbles onto a bizarre plot by Cardinal Umberto Palestrina,
the Vatican secretariat of state, to orchestrate a Vatican takeover
of China as the first step in creating a modern-day Holy Roman
Empire.
</P>
<P>
   It's as outrageous as it sounds. It's also incredibly linear.
Palestrina's plan is revealed in the first fifth of the book, then
becomes a subplot to the ``bad guys chase good guys'' portion of
the novel. That's a real disappointment, considering Folsom's first
novel was rife with subplots and twists.
</P>
<P>
   That book, although at least as far-fetched, was original in its
fiendishness, even if it did use German neo-Nazis as its primary
evil-doers. In ``Day of Confession,'' villainy falls in the hands
of the Holy See, which, despite the trendiness of Catholic-bashing,
still is difficult to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't help that the scheming Cardinal Palestrina is
depicted as cartoonishly flat and devoid of any redeeming
qualities, traits he realistically would have had to have to reach
a position that high. In fact, only one character, Otello Roscani,
an Italian detective trailing the Addison brothers, shows any signs
of internal conflict needed to give him life beyond the words on
the page.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither novel is a benchmark of fine writing, lines
such as ``It was nuts, but it might work'' in ``Day of Confession''
are disappointly typical of pop-fiction schlock. Folsom mostly
avoided that in ``The Day After Tomorrow,'' another illustration of
how his first effort succeeded in areas his second does not. If
Folsom fans are to tolerate another ``Day,'' it had better be more
like ``Tomorrow.'' &QL;

   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   HORROCKS-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ In her latest film, ``Little
Voice,'' directed and adapted for the screen by Mark Herman
(``Brassed Off''), Ms. Jane Horrocks plays L.V. (for Little Voice),
an introverted working-class waif who holes up in her bedroom,
hoping both to escape the scalding remarks of her alcoholic mother
(Brenda Blethyn) and to recapture the comforting presence of her
late father by playing and re-playing the 33 and one-third records
from his collection of pop classics. For all her mother's seedy
boyfriend (a gold-chained Michael Caine) knows, L.V. is completely
mute. Then, as the sounds of famous female pop singers seep from
beneath her door and out the windows, he discovers that this mousy
young woman has a gift for impersonating divas. The rest of
``Little Voice,'' which opens on Dec. 4, documents his hapless
attempts to exploit L.V.'s talents _ and also shows a veteran actor
being bowled over by his younger co-star. By Margy Rochlin.

<P>
   BRAZIL-FILMS (Undated) _ Brazil has long been proud of its place
in world cinema. But these days the country, quite simply, is film
mad. Headlines appear on the front pages of the major newspapers
every time a Brazilian film wins an international award or an
Academy Award nomination. By B. Ruby Rich.

   FILM-CREDITS (Undated) _ IN the beginning, there was simply
``The End.'' Now, there are gaffers, best boys and Celine Dion.
Hollywood movie credits, which began as modest lists, have grown
over the years into lumbering behemoths as extravagant _ and
seemingly as time-consuming _ as the films they accompany. By

   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   FRANKFURT-BALLET (Frankfurt, Germany) _ In Europe, the
choreographer William Forsythe is widely considered the most
important dance maker on the planet. In his own country, the United
States, his name is probably known only to a limited number of
balletgoers who have seen his works in the repertories of the New
York City Ballet, the San Francisco Ballet or the Joffrey Ballet,
or perhaps performed by a touring company from across the Atlantic.
The visit of Forsythe and the company he directs, Frankfurt Ballet,
to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for six performances starting
Wednesday marks a decade since the troupe's last appearances in the
United States. By Roslyn Sulcas.

   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   DONMAR-THEATER (London) _ A former hops brewery might seem an
unlikely source for Broadway. But the tiny Donmar Warehouse theater
in London has over time become a powerful producing entity way out
of proportion to its 251 seats. While maintaining a full level of
activity at home, the nonprofit theater has originated, in one form
or another and sometimes with outside collaborators, three highly
disparate productions currently on Broadway: ``Cabaret'' at Studio
54, which won last season's Tony Award for best musical revival;
Sophocles' ``Electra,'' with Zoe Wanamaker in the title role, now
in previews and opening on Thursday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater,
and ``The Blue Room,'' also in previews and opening on Dec. 13 at
the Cort Theater with Nicole Kidman in her Broadway stage debut. By

   MUSIC-LISTEN (Undated) _ As mechanisms of sound reproduction
improve, the day may come when one cannot distinguish aurally
between sitting in Avery Fisher Hall in New York City (where this
concert took place) and listening at home with headphones, though
that day is a long way off. And with DVD and its future
developments, the time may come when the impression of facing an
orchestra can be reconstructed. But it is hard to imagine the
technology that would allow individual watcher-listeners to use
their eyes and ears with the range of choices available in any
concert hall: to fix attention on a cellist's bowing, to scrutinize
the field. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYER-PIANO-CDs (Undated) _ Geneticists have their Dolly. They
also have the goods on Thomas Jefferson: the old miscegenator long
suspected, now betrayed by his own DNA. Where the progress of
science is concerned, art is rarely far behind, and now comes
Sergei Rachmaninoff, dead since 1942, walking among us again.
Telarc has released ``A Window in Time,'' a CD made from piano
rolls, and promises another in March. On the first, the great man
plays his own music and arrangements ranging from Bizet to ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' On the second, Rachmaninoff addresses the
significant (Chopin, Schubert, Mendelssohn) and the less
significant (Henselt, Rubinstein and bowdlerdized Bach, Beethoven
and Gluck). The music comes from a process developed by Wayne
Stahnke, who got his ideas working on the Voyager space mission for
NASA. By Bernard Holland.

   BRUCKNER-MUSIC (Undated) _ Imagine the Bruckner symphonies shorn
of sentimental piety, and you're at the starting point of a
provocative cycle emerging on CDs. Through five symphonies, Georg
Tintner, 81, a conductor born in Vienna, casts Bruckner's grand,
emotionally charged structures in a refreshing light of restraint
and proportion. Reflected back is an aura of honest affection and
with it a paradoxical exchange: a beguiling intellectual beauty
where one often finds a cloistered spirituality. By Lawrence B.
Johnson.

Johnson's place in history, and both architects are the
beneficiaries. If Gehry hadn't come along, Johnson's work might
well be remembered as an emblem of a time when American
architecture lost its way. His restless rovings from movement to
movement and style to style offered giddy architectural
entertainment, particularly during his high-flying days of big
corporate commissions in the 1980s. But they demoralized many who
think that architecture should stand for something more than relish
for flirting with forms. By Herbert Muschamp.

   BRASSAI-PHOTOGS (Undated) _ Next Sunday, an exhibition of
photographs by Brassai, called ``The Eye of Paris,'' will open at
the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston. The result of 15 years of

photography, it is the first major museum retrospective of

Caesar-Cocas but also the technical geniuses like Philo Farnsworth
and the unrecognized heroes of television's early years like

glass designer Saara Hopea, who died in 1984) has spent years
traveling the highways and byways of the subcontinent, studying
jewelry-making techniques and buying jewelry. His collection of
jewelry and photographs along with loans from museums and other

SHAKESPEARE: THE INVENTION OF THE HUMAN 
Harold Bloom (Riverhead Books, $35) 
 
 By LELA STROMENGER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (begin itals) Not marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of princes,
shall outlive this powerful rhyme. (end itals) &QL; 
_ Sonnet 55 &QR; 
It's been almost 400 years since William Shakespeare made that
prediction, and so far so good. Many a gilded monument crumbled
while the Bard rose to the rank of first among the greatest.
Outright Bardolatry began in the 18th century and continued
unabated into our intellectually Balkanized age.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, the Swan has occasionally swum into rough
waters. Among his detractors, New Historicists base their denial of
his supremacy on a rejection of the whole traditional literary
ordering, or canon. Neo-Marxists attribute his reputation to a vast
right-wing conspiracy they feel has used him for centuries to help
preserve the social status quo. Feminists and multiculturalists can
be found who see him simply as the deadest White European male.
</P>
<P>
   Into the breach made by these critical armies leaps Harold
Bloom, the champion of ``the Western Canon'' (a phrase he made
current in his 1994 book of that title) and the canon's final
arbiter and gatekeeper, at least in his own opinion. And as the
holder of prestigious chairs at Yale and New York University, the
winner of a MacArthur Fellowship and the author of an enormous body
of influential criticism both scholarly and popular, he's entitled
to his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom contends that the canon rules us and that Shakespeare
rules the canon. More than that, he asserts Shakespeare actually
created us as personalities. Before Hamlet and Falstaff, he
believes, people lacked the faculty of ``self-overhearing'' _
individual self-awareness _ that defines us as post-medieval human
beings.
</P>
<P>
   Quibblers are going to feel that Bloom arrogates for Shakespeare
an achievement that belongs to the entire Renaissance, but Bloom
doesn't spend much time pushing his thesis. The idea seems to be
more of a peg on which to hang his favorite form of Shakespearean
criticism: analysis of the characters, in particular the
``prodigies'' _ Hamlet, Falstaff, Rosalind, Shylock, Iago, Lear,
Macbeth and Cleopatra.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news here is that this approach leaves out any explicit
discussion of the poetry, an area in which Shakespeare's influence
on the modern world is surely at least as pervasive as in
characterization. The good news is that Bloom is the equal of his
famous predecessors in this kind of analysis _ Samuel Johnson,
William Hazlitt, A.C. Bradley _ and is, in fact, a walking
summation of the Shakespearean sensibility of the past 400 years.
</P>
<P>
   Canon specialist Bloom can bring in the big guns _ he has read
them all. We hear the roar of Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, Freud,
Melville, Dostoevski, Auden and their ilk as well as the academic
critics. His lighter artillery ranges from Cormac McCarthy, whose
``Blood Meridian'' boasts a character Bloom considers the only peer
of ``pyromaniac Iago'' in the art of evil (except for Milton's
Satan), to Josephine Tey, whose ``The Daughter of Time'' Bloom is
not too proud to include in his discussion of ``Richard III.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to this sweep of readership 50-plus years of knowing and
loving the plays (Bloom is 68), and you have a formidable
Shakespearean commentator. And commentary is probably nearer the
heart of this volume than analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a sharply focused study. It's a big, shambling,
opinionated, alternately warmhearted and cranky, endlessly
interesting collection of essays that read the way a very good
lecturer talks and that probably are lightly reworked lectures,
complete with a sprinkling of critical jargon and a lecture series'
relentless repetitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   It seems ungracious, however, to object to the method when the
results are so illuminating. You may disagree with individual
judgments, but Bloom's overall grasp is awesome. His mental
storehouse is so crammed, his concept of Shakespeare's artistic
course so clear and his heart so large that on practically every
other page the reader finds a fragment of Bloom that can light up a
facet of Shakespeare the way pages of somebody else could not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This echo chamber of a play,'' for instance, simultaneously
illustrates a point about ``Twelfth Night'' and awakens the
reader's own realization of the extent to which duplicated elements
make up the harmony and counterpoint of that musical drama. ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' ``could be anyone's dream or any night in
midsummer, when the world is largest.'' The brilliant, lengthy,
conflicted and almost uncontrollable ``Hamlet,'' written ``partly
out of . . . compulsion,'' is ``Shakespeare's white elephant.'' The
book is an Ali Baba's cave of this kind of treasure.
</P>
<P>
   In the light of this golden trove, you can see that Bloom and
the traditionalists don't have much to worry about. Shakespeare has
survived four centuries of intermittent trashing, misreading, bad
editing and rewriting, and he's a safe bet to survive a few more.
People will probably be reading and watching his plays when most of
the gilded monuments we're busy with at the moment are moldering in
some archive in another solar system. &QL;

RUSSIAN LAWMAKER'S SLAYING GALVANIZES ANTI-COMMUNISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ Thousands of mourners waited hours in
the bitter cold Tuesday to pay an emotional and politically charged
farewell to a liberal legislator whose killing on Friday has turned
into a call to arms for Russia's frayed democratic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ornate Marble Hall at the Museum of Ethnography,
where the lawmaker, Galina Starovoitova, lay in state, her
grim-faced friends and allies issued a challenge to the forces that
many believe ordered a brazen political assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are killing our comrades, they are killing our friends,''
said Anatoly Chubais, a reform-minded former Kremlin aide and
native of St. Petersburg, in a voice choked with emotion. ``Do they
want to stop us? Do they want to frighten us? It won't work. I want
to say this at the coffin of our comrade, absolutely clearly and
absolutely firmly: They will not succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks reflected Russia's growing political instability at
a time of deep economic crisis with a weakened President Boris
Yeltsin at the helm. In just the last few weeks the country has
heard anti-Semitic statements go uncensored, allegations that a
renegade hit squad was working within the Federal Security Service,
and open threats against Russia's independent news media.
</P>
<P>
   People at the scene were comparing the crowds Tuesday to those
that came out for the funeral of the Nobel laureate Andrei Sakharov
in Moscow in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Poets and politicians, including three former prime ministers,
were among the first to crowd past Ms. Starovoitova's open coffin
and to deliver their eulogies. The line of ordinary citizens that
followed was so long that the viewing had to be prolonged by
several hours. Even then, hundreds of mourners were unable to get
in before the coffin was taken to a cemetery at the historic
Alexander Nevsky Monastery for a private funeral and burial.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the turnout was seen here as a protest against the
growing lawlessness in the city and as a gesture of respect for a
woman known both as a staunch defender of democracy and as a
plain-speaking warmhearted figure, a mother and a grandmother. In
homage to Ms. Starovoitova, Russia's main television channel
repeatedly interrupted its programming Tuesday with an old film
clip, showing her sitting at home, singing a song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything she did, she did as a strong personality,'' said
Vladimir Talanov, a 68-year-old engineer who was at the back of the
line that doubled around a statue of Pushkin. ``We should pay
homage to someone who is one of the brightest faces of a democracy
that we are now so worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   The wave of violence that has swept this city struck Ms.
Starovoitova Friday as she and an aide were going up the staircase
in her apartment building on Griboyedova Canal. She was shot in the
head three times by waiting assailants and died at the scene. Her
aide, Ruslan Linkov, was wounded in the head and neck and is in a
local military hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the midst of an ugly local election campaign that has
been rife with dirty tricks, the attack has heightened the sharp
polarization of political forces both here and in the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of Ms. Starovoitova have openly blamed nationalists and
communists for her death. The speaker of the Russian parliament, a
communist from St. Petersburg, threw back the charge on Monday by
suggesting that her death had been ordered by extremists in the
democratic movement.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, hospitalized on Monday with pneumonia, was described as
``deeply angered'' by the killing of Ms. Starovoitova, his close
ally in Russia's anti-communist movement.
</P>
<P>
   She was an ethnographer and psychologist, and she served as his
adviser on inter-ethnic affairs until she was fired in a conflict
over the Kremlin's policy in the northern Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Ms. Starovoitova, who was a figure of
considerable influence here in St. Petersburg, had spoken out
against nationalism _ and against corruption, collecting materials
on illegal fund-raising by local Communist politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters contend that her resolute positions may have cost her
her life. ``I know what work Galina Vasilyevena was involved in, I
know why she paid with her life and I know that we will continue to
do this work until the end,'' said Chubais at the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has thrown his weight behind the
investigation, summoning Russia's top law enforcement officials to
a meeting at which he pressed them to find the killers.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers in St. Petersburg announced Monday that they had
conducted a number of raids and detained several people as they
cast their net wide in the search for the suspects. The attack had
the earmarks of contract killings here, with the assailants
dropping two guns at the scene and leaving in a waiting car.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Monday, shots were fired at the windows of the apartment of a
local member of the City Council. Last year, a top city official _
another close associate of Chubais _ was gunned down on the city's
main avenue, Nevsky Prospekt, and numerous bankers and business
executives have been targets of contract killings.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city,
with a population of 5 million, have been troubled by the low-key
response to the attack by the local governor, Vladimir Yakovlev.
Yakovlev, a former city official who won elections in 1996 as an
opponent of the democrats, waited two days to send a telegram of
condolences to Ms. Starovoitova's family and, citing health
reasons, did not appear at the memorial services Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For the people who began to line up around the Ethnography
Museum in the chilly morning darkness, the death of Ms.
Starovoitova had come as a bitter reminder of democracy's tenuous
hold in Russia, seven years after the collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we could have democracy, but we don't have it yet,''
said Lada Uvarova, 28, an employee at United Parcel Service here
and one of the few members of her generation to join the mourners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at the beginning of reforms there was an enthusiasm, an
optimism, now something has changed,'' she said. ``Young people
don't care about government, they count only themselves. For older
people, times are difficult and they blame the situation on
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the people who came Tuesday, Ms. Starovoitova was more
than just another ``democratic.'' The response to the killing of a
popular woman who held a leadership role swept across ideological
lines and brought out a big crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected fewer people,'' said Irina Zapozhnikova, a senior
instructor at a technical institute. ``After all, democrats are now
considered the ones to blame for everything. But people trusted
her.''

CHILD KILLED BY LARGE SHARK OFF VERO BEACH, FLA. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Flailing his arms was the only sign of distress that
9-year-old James William Tellasmon was able to send before he
disappeared under the ocean waters Saturday while on an outing with
his mother and a family friend at Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Medical Examiner's office had uncovered the reason
for the mysterious disappearance of the boy: James was killed by
``a large shark'' in an attack that experts say is the first such
fatality on the United States shoreline in more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes after James, of Vero Beach, disappeared, police
and Coast Guard units began searching for him. It was not until
7:22 a.m. Sunday that the boy's body, headless and armless, was
found by a team of fire rescue divers.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have not yet determined what type of shark
attacked the boy and it was not clear whether the boy drowned after
the shark pulled him under water or whether the decapitation
occurred while he was still alive. More damage to the body may have
come from other fish scavenging off the shark's prey.
</P>
<P>
   `'`The body was in poor shape and had considerable damage,''
said Vero Beach Police Chief Jim Gabbard. `'All we recovered were
the legs and torso of the boy.''
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Dr. Frederick Hobin, the district medical
examiner, said that the body was identified based on the
circumstances in which it was found and because several witnesses
were present at the time of the attack. James was found close to
where he was last seen, in shallow water, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The last recorded death attributed to a shark took place in
Florida's Panhandle in 1988 and it involved a swimmer diving off a
boat in deep waters far from shore. A recorded shoreline fatality
such as James' had not occurred in the U.S. since 1976, said George
Burgess, the director of the International Shark Attack File at the
Florida Museum of Natural History in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Florida leads the nation in the number of shark attacks per
year, between 15 and 25, but the state also has the highest
estimated number of swimmers, so the statistical probability of
getting attacked by a shark is minute, Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1959 and 1988, 12 people were killed from shark attacks
in 23 states, compared with 1,505 who died after being struck by
lightning, according to statistics compiled by Shark Attack File.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came at a time of year when small fish fleeing the
cooling northern waters migrate south and, in a Darwinian chain of
survival, are followed by their predators, larger fish, who in turn
are closely shadowed by several species of shark. Yet an attack
this vicious is still rare, Burgess said, since in most encounters
between sharks and humans, the fish that bite a limb normally
release it once they find they have not targeted their usual prey.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Andy Capak, a 13-year-old who was surfing not far
from where last week's fatality occurred, was bitten on his right
leg by a shark. The shark immediately released his leg, but the
boy's wound required 20 stitches, police said.

NOVELL'S 4TH-QUARTER EARNINGS SURPASS PROJECTIONS

<P>
   Novell Inc. reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded
estimates by Wall Street analysts, and attributed the performance
to strong sales of the new version of its network operating system,
Netware 5.
</P>
<P>
   Novell announced its results after the close of the market.
Shares of Novell closed at $17.38, down 63 cents, in trading on the
Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Oct. 31, Novell had earnings of $42
million, or 12 cents a diluted share, more than five times the $7.2
million, or 2 cents a share, reported in the period a year earlier.
Revenues rose 10.5 percent, to $297.6 million from $269.3 million
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Novell to earn 9 cents a share, according to
the First Call Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is clearly working,'' said Novell chairman and
chief executive Eric Schmidt in a telephone interview. ``My
strategy was to turn this thing into a viable robust business and I
think we have done that,'' he said. ``A lot of it was due to
Netware 5, but we saw business up across many product lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Netware 5 is the first release of Novell's operating system to
adhere completely to Internet-based standards rather than its own
internal set of rules and practices. The program also incorporates
Novell's directory services technology for identifying and locating
myriad users and computers across multiple networks.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Novell signed agreements with Cisco Systems
Inc., Lucent Technologies and Nortel under which they will
incorporate Novell directory technology in their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective to establish Novell as an Internet company is
being achieved,'' Schmidt said. ``As we flesh out the strategy, the
real value is in applications we develop that use the directory,''
he said. These are primarily network management programs for large
enterprises. ``It's a very big space because people have huge
problems in this area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Novell reported earnings of $102 million, compared
with a loss of $78.3 million in fiscal 1997. Revenues rose 8
percent, to $1.08 billion from $1.01 billion.

BLUE CROSS PLAN WOULD SUBSIDIZE ELDERS' DRUG COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts said
Tuesday it expects to plow &UR;  &LR; more than $5 million next year into a
foundation to subsidize the purchase of prescription drugs for
approximately 7,500 seniors currently enrolled in Blue Care 65, its
Medicare health maintenance organization.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The foundation would compensate seniors for prescription costs
greater than $300 a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after Blue Cross and other insurers in
Massachusetts proceeded last week with final plans to cap drug
coverage for the elderly beginning Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross foundation, proposed several weeks ago without
much detail, is an attempt to temporarily shield current customers
from the new limits. Blue Cross's subsidies, however, would be
available for just one year and would be open only to seniors who
are members of Blue Care 65 as of Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Though limited in scope, the subsidies are expected to cost Blue
Cross $5 million in 1999. Blue Cross reported net income of $12.7
million in 1997 and expects &UR;  &LR;  to make more than $50 million in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Senior advocates Tuesday praised Blue Cross, but noted that
other insurers also need to step up to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend Blue Cross for their responsibility and compassion
in offering this solution,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy. ``I urge
the other HMOs in Massachusetts to live up to their
responsibilities as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased to see that Blue Cross is working quickly to
find a stopgap measure to this crisis,'' said Allison Staton of
Health Care For All, a consumer advocacy group in Boston.
``However, we're disappointed that this isn't more of a group
effort among all of the plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care has said it will create a
``transitional assistance program'' for low-income seniors in its
First Seniority Medicare HMO, but has not released details. Tufts
Health Plan, which runs the state's largest Medicare HMO, has not
indicated whether it will provide financial assistance to its
seniors.

SCHROEDER'S MORNING AFTER: WINNING WAS THE EASY PART
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Less than a month after he swept into office with a
ready smile and talk of a ``new middle'' that would revitalize
Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has lost much of the momentum
and good will that propelled his ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Sniped at by state premiers who wield much power in Germany's
decentralized system, criticized by his Green coalition partners,
attacked by leading businessmen and buffeted within his own Social
Democratic Party, Schroeder has appeared unable to impose his stamp
on the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no need to panic,'' Peter Struck, leader of the
Social Democratic Party in Parliament, said Tuesday, but the
admonition itself clearly reflected mounting concern.
</P>
<P>
   Heide Ruhle, party manager of the environmentalist Greens,
declared that Germany ``cannot be governed by the troops of
chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when German companies are on a self-confident buying
spree in the United States _ Deutsche Bank's impending purchase of
Banker's Trust follows Daimler's acquisition of Chrysler and
Bertelsmann's absorption of Random House _ this political
uncertainty may appear out of character.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality of Germany today is a streamlined and aggressive
corporate sector, acutely aware of the challenges of the global
economy, alongside an uncertain social and political model that
Schroeder has vowed to galvanize.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Schroeder's difficulties stem from teething problems
that are inevitable, given the Social Democrats' 16-year absence
from power and their coalition government with the Greens, which
was widely regarded as unlikely before the September elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not prepared at all, nothing was prepared, and then
the program was put together in haste,'' said Claus Leggewie, a
sociologist close to the government. ``It does look kind of
amateurish.''
</P>
<P>
   But at a deeper level, Schroeder seems to be suffering from the
very ambiguities of his campaign. While his ability to appear both
as an energetic modernizer and a traditional Social Democrat
sensitive to workers' concerns was effective at election rallies,
it seems to be proving too wide a stretch for government.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in the Social Democratic Party burst into the open with
the recent publication of a blunt letter to Schroeder from Wolfgang
Clement, the Social Democratic premier of North Rhine-Westphalia
state, which has a huge economy itself with a population larger
than that of the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Clement said tax reforms proposed by the government were
inadequate and would do nothing to reduce unemployment, now running
at more than 10 percent. He said government plans to close tax
loopholes for corporations and raise energy taxes would cost
businesses about $17.8 billion; he suggested slashing the corporate
income tax level to below 30 percent from more than 40 percent, and
lowering top tax rates for individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of his argument, which is also that of big business,
was that only a deregulation of Germany's economy will spur
corporations to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Clement's letter revealed the extent of the chasm between
reformist Social Democrats like Clement and Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine, who has focused more on the widening gap between rich
and poor in Germany, the need to spur growth through cutting
interest rates and the possibility of creating jobs through a
state-sponsored ``alliance for jobs'' that would bring together
labor unions and industry leaders.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Schroeder, whose essential political talent is
that of an effective communicator, at once polished and unruffled,
has appeared to want to remain above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   This policy of aloofness may spare him the worst of the vitriol
flying between the wings of his party, but at some point it appears
inevitable that the chancellor will have to intervene more
forcefully or face growing criticism for indecisiveness.

NEW BATCH OF KENNEDY RECORDINGS RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the largest batch of recordings it has yet released,
the John F. Kennedy Library Tuesday made public 37 hours of tapes
in which President Kennedy conceded that his administration must
bear some responsibility for the assassination of South Vietnam
President Ngo Dinh Diem.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that conclusion, in Kennedy's view, was a cable
sent to South Vietnam in August 1963 that appeared to give tacit US
approval for a coup against Diem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we must bear a good deal of responsibility for it
beginning,'' Kennedy said on Nov. 4, 1963, two days after Diem's
assassination. ``In my judgment, that wire was badly drafted. It
should have never been sent on a Saturday. I should have never
given my consent to it without round-table discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Fawcett, a former Kennedy Library archivist who
prepared the tapes for declassification, said Kennedy was at
Hyannisport when the cable was sent. The president mistakenly
believed it had been approved by all relevant Cabinet officials,
according to Fawcett.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, for one, had not been in
Washington when the cable was dispatched, and protested to the
president when he returned, Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked by the death of Ngo Dinh Diem,'' Kennedy
continued in the recording, which he dictated less than three weeks
before his own assassination. ``He was an extraordinary character.
While he became increasingly difficult in the last few months, he
has been able to hold his country together for the last 10
months.''
</P>
<P>
   With Diem dead, Kennedy said, ``the question is now whether the
generals can stay together and build a stable government or whether
public opinion will turn on Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, South Vietnam's continued instability in the face of a
communist insurgency led to a massive infusion of American military
support by Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The memo on Diem was part of four hours of tapes held privately
by Evelyn Lincoln, Kennedy's personal secretary, until her death in
1995. The Kennedy Library received the tapes in March from Robert
White, a private collector of Kennedy memorabilia who had been
given the tapes by Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 hours of recordings released Tuesday, 24 hours are of
meetings held in the White House. The remainder are of telephone
conversations, Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
   In the phone recordings, Kennedy is heard briefing former
Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman, and Herbert Hoover
about the conclusion of the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Although satisfied with the outcome, Kennedy showed he did not
consider the communist problem in the Caribbean to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Cuban story is over yet,'' the president
told Truman. ``It may be only one more chapter in a very long story
as far as Cuba is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In other tapes, Kennedy and his advisers discuss the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty and foreign policy concerns in such widely diverse
places as Berlin, Laos, China, Taiwan, and the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   To Fawcett, part of the importance of these recordings is that
they provide the public with a freeze-frame of debate on vital
issues, such as nuclear weapons and relations with China, that
continue to concern the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, Fawcett said, ``won't dramatically alter the
historical records, but they certainly fill in some gaps in what
was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a person among us who wouldn't want to
be in the Oval Office or Cabinet room when these decisions are
made. And these take you there.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's release, 110 hours of tapes from the Kennedy
White House have been made public. All of the recordings about the
Cuban missile crisis have now been made available.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett said 150 hours of tapes remain to be declassified.

GATHERED NO MOSS: IRVIN ACCEPTS BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Watching the NFL draft on TV in April, Michael
Irvin knew even before the pick came up that the Cowboys would
gather no Moss. He also knew why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' said Irvin yesterday at Valley Ranch. ``With everything
I'd been involved in, we couldn't draft Randy Moss. Because of me,
Jerry \RJones\S had to go out on a limb over character issues.''
</P>
<P>
   So Irvin immediately picked up the phone that day in April and
called Moss. ``I apologized to Randy because I knew he really
wanted to be in Dallas,'' continued Irvin. ``I told him all my
stuff is what had prevented that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy told me he was fine with going to Minnesota _ he thought
he had still ended up in a good place. As it turned out, he did.
But he wanted to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, Moss will be here. With the Vikings, of course. It is
tough to argue against the current theory that Moss is the best
player on the best team in the NFC.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Moss' sensational rookie season, Jerry Jones, as the
owner, says he has nary a regret that the Cowboys passed up Moss in
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Gailey, as the head coach, strongly seconds the Jones'
motion. ``We had other needs, more pressing needs. We did what we
should have done \Rdrafting defensive end Greg Ellis\S,'' Gailey
said on a radio show Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But to have seen the Cowboys' sudden offensive growth under
Gailey, and then to imagine a weapon such as Moss also being
involved, well ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been great for Randy to be here,'' said Irvin,
despite having seen his offensive role already diminished with the
emergence of Billy Davis and Ernie Mills (now injured) as
alternative receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin added: ``I think Randy would have loved Dallas. I admit I
do wonder if Dallas would have loved Randy because of the
reputation he would have had coming in here. But that goes back to
me again, and what I've put the team through.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin then laughed, and brought up the controversy Jerry Rice
stirred up in San Francisco this week. ``If that had been me,'' he
said, ``''SportsCenter'' would have had its lead item. My picture
would have been splashed all over the place to lead off the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Rice was so miffed over his lack of offensive
involvement in Sunday's win over New Orleans that he threatened
after the game to retire. Rice immediately backed off the next day
after being roasted by the Bay Area media for being selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, of course, saw his reception streak ended at 117 games 10
days ago in Tempe, Ariz. But he handled that shutout in a
professional manner.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's off-the-field antics have been a team wrecker in the
past. His personal lifestyle helped end a dynasty era in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to football, just football, he continues to be
among a handful of stand-up players who serve as team leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I've done,'' he said. ``No one has to remind me.
Everyone does anyway, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   But tomorrow, here comes Moss into Texas Stadium, obviously
intent on making the Cowboys pay for their draft-day look the other
way. Plus, the Vikings are thinking Super Bowl with their 10-1
record.
</P>
<P>
   This is also where Irvin began to show a bowed back yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the guys in here \Rthe locker room\S are taking
exception to this game being called a critical test for us,'' said
Irvin. ``And that includes me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck, every week is a test. This will be a test. But
this game won't be a gauge of our team, and there's a difference
between a test and a gauge.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are the Minnesota Vikings going to tell me about winning
a Super Bowl, huh? I've won three. How many have they won?
</P>
<P>
   ``If we beat them, we still aren't a Super Bowl team. Remember,
we lost to Chicago. But if they beat us, that doesn't make them a
Super Bowl team, either. Let's see where everybody is in January.''
</P>
<P>
   The 8-3 Cowboys have a variety of health concerns for tomorrow's
game, although Irvin said, ``That can't and won't be used as an
excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, however, the Dallas offense has quickly
picked up steam over the last two games. And in the locker room
this week, Dallas players have been openly challenging the
Minnesota defense ``to try and stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to hear that stuff,'' said Irvin, smiling. ``With Chan,
we are coming back. And our offense is still a long way from being
where we will be. There is a lot of football left. People had
better remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Randy Moss, there's also the urgency tomorrow for the
Cowboys to remember a draft-day decision.
</P>

N.H. SEEKS 2-YEAR EXTENSION OF SCHOOL FUNDING DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RALPH JIMENEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ In a debate before the state Supreme Court
Tuesday, advocates for a swift end to New Hampshire's school
funding crisis welcomed a ``meltdown'' if they don't see action
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Justices whose patience appeared to have been tried by the
long-running case listened as the state asked for a two-year
extension of the court's April 1 deadline to replace New
Hampshire's unconstitutional school funding system.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for towns that sued the state in 1991 said it deserved
no extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it is costing $196 million per year in
unconstitutional taxes, and children are sitting in bathrooms
learning,'' said Andru Volinsky, lead lawyer for the Claremont
Coalition of property-poor towns. ``That should not continue.
That's why we need to move forward, and there is no guarantee that
the Legislature will move to correct any of these problems unless
they are facing a deadline and a meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The system relies more heavily on local property taxes than any
other in the nation, and allows tax rates to vary by as much as 15
times between property-rich and property-poor towns. Last December,
the court found that disparity illegal, ruling that all taxes used
to fund public education must be levied ``reasonably and
proportionately.'' It gave the Legislature until Dec. 2 to devise a
plan and until April 1 to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire Attorney General Philip McLaughlin told the court
that progress has been made, if only through the elimination of
some possible responses to the court's order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe that if this court grants a reasonable
extension, it will continue to see the funnel narrow,'' McLaughlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature has been reluctant to consider any replacement
plan that would result in a broad-based sales, income, or property
tax. Governor Jeanne Shaheen has pledged to veto any such plan.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative action has focused instead on amendments that would
modify or reverse the court's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year extension would give lawmakers time to bring such an
amendment before voters in November 2000, a scenario that did not
escape the justices or the Claremont Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The problem is not a lack of time. The problem is a lack of
will,'' said John Tobin, a lawyer for the coalition. ``The court
three times has respectfully asked the governor and Legislature to
do their duty and they have accomplished nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The court should prepare to place the state into receivership,
Tobin said. Appointing a receiver empowered to spend the state's
general fund on education could force the state's hand or, failing
that, provide money to keep public schools open after the fiscal
year ends in July, Volinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one judge indicated interest in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't it be prudent of us at this time to start exploring
the possibility of being put in a constitutional crisis and a
meltdown and to find out what remedies are available to us?'' asked
Justice Sherman Horton. ``I don't want the schools to close ... I
want to see the education system perking along.''

THIRD QUARTER PRODUCED STEEP DROP CORPORATE PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The government said Tuesday that the US economy grew
faster last summer than previously estimated. But analysts
cautioned the economic tour-de-force was more a marker of good
times past than a portent of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Of special concern, according to analysts, were new figures
showing that US companies suffered their steepest profit decline of
the decade during the three-month quarter ended in September, and
for the first time in nearly seven years cut the amount it invested
in new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate profits and business investment are key indicators of
economic health. Analysts said their decline raises doubts about
the economy's ability to keep growing and the stock market's
capacity to sustain record highs reached Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With weakening profits, it's going to be hard for businesses
to keep expanding,'' said Mark M. Zandi, chief economist with
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``As a result,
they will be hiring and investing less aggressively than they have
in the past,'' he said, moves that are likely to cause both the
economy and market to falter.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over corporate profits sent stock prices lower Tuesday,
taking some of the snap out of what was hailed a day earlier as the
fastest comeback from a bear market in US financial history.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average slid 73.12 points, or 0.8
percent, to close at 9301.15, well off its record close on Monday.
The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 5.22 points, or 0.4
percent, at 1182.99. The high technology-laden Nasdaq Composite
index lost 11.54 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 1965.88.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department, which originally estimated that the
economy grew at an unexpectedly strong 3.3 percent rate during the
third quarter, boosted its estimate Tuesday to an even stronger 3.9
percent, crediting a surge in consumer spending,
less-severe-than-expected deterioration in the trade deficit and an
almost-total absence of inflation for the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said if the economy keeps growing at a 3 percent or
better rate through the end of the year, as many now believe is
likely, that will make the current expansion the longest ever in
peacetime America, topping both the boom of the 1980s and the even
longer boom of the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news Tuesday seemed to stop there. Commerce
Department officials said corporate profits dropped 6.2 percent
last quarter as compared with the same quarter in 1997, the
steepest such drop since 1989. And they said that business
equipment investment, which has accounted for about one-third of
the economy's growth during the decade, fell 1.1 percent, its first
decline since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are concerned that the stock market's miraculously fast
recovery is almost entirely the result of recent Federal Reserve
interest rate cuts, rather than fundamental improvements in the
economy, and is therefore unsustainable. Some worry the central
bank has gotten itself trapped in a bind of having to prop up the
market to protect against a growth-damaging tumble even as stock
prices grow increasingly out of line with profits and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fed is the captive of the financial markets here,'' said
Charles I. Clough Jr., chief investment strategist with Merrill
Lynch &AMP; Co. ``You had a bubble that threatened to take the economy
down with it so the Fed flooded the finacial markets with
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have to be trying to figure how to produce a soft
landing,'' Clough said.

NEW BATCH OF KENNEDY RECORDINGS RELEASED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the largest batch of recordings it has yet released,
the John F. Kennedy Library Tuesday made public 37 hours of tapes
in which President Kennedy conceded that his administration must
bear some responsibility for the assassination of South Vietnam
President Ngo Dinh Diem.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that conclusion, in Kennedy's view, was a cable
sent to South Vietnam in August 1963 that appeared to give tacit US
approval for a coup against Diem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we must bear a good deal of responsibility for it
beginning,'' Kennedy said on Nov. 4, 1963, two days after Diem's
assassination. ``In my judgment, that wire was badly drafted. It
should have never been sent on a Saturday. I should have never
given my consent to it without round-table discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Fawcett, a former Kennedy Library archivist who
prepared the tapes for declassification, said Kennedy was at
Hyannisport when the cable was sent. The president mistakenly
believed it had been approved by all relevant Cabinet officials,
according to Fawcett.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara, for one, had not been in
Washington when the cable was dispatched, and protested to the
president when he returned, Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked by the death of Ngo Dinh Diem,'' Kennedy
continued in the recording, which he dictated less than three weeks
before his own assassination. ``He was an extraordinary character.
While he became increasingly difficult in the last few months, he
has been able to hold his country together for the last 10
months.''
</P>
<P>
   With Diem dead, Kennedy said, ``the question is now whether the
generals can stay together and build a stable government or whether
public opinion will turn on Saigon.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, South Vietnam's continued instability in the face of a
communist insurgency led to a massive infusion of American military
support by Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The memo on Diem was part of four hours of tapes held privately
by Evelyn Lincoln, Kennedy's personal secretary, until her death in
1995. The Kennedy Library received the tapes in March from Robert
White, a private collector of Kennedy memorabilia who had been
given the tapes by Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 37 hours of recordings released Tuesday, 24 hours are of
meetings held in the White House. The remainder are of telephone
conversations, Fawcett said.
</P>
<P>
   In the phone recordings, Kennedy is heard briefing former
Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Harry Truman, and Herbert Hoover
about the conclusion of the Cuban missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Although satisfied with the outcome, Kennedy showed he did not
consider the communist problem in the Caribbean to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Cuban story is over yet,'' the president
told Truman. ``It may be only one more chapter in a very long story
as far as Cuba is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   In other tapes, Kennedy and his advisers discuss the Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty and foreign policy concerns in such widely diverse
places as Berlin, Laos, China, Taiwan, and the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   To Fawcett, part of the importance of these recordings is that
they provide the public with a freeze-frame of debate on vital
issues, such as nuclear weapons and relations with China, that
continue to concern the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, Fawcett said, ``won't dramatically alter the
historical records, but they certainly fill in some gaps in what
was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a person among us who wouldn't want to
be in the Oval Office or Cabinet room when these decisions are
made. And these take you there.''
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday's release, 110 hours of tapes from the Kennedy
White House have been made public. All of the recordings about the
Cuban missile crisis have now been made available.
</P>
<P>
   Fawcett said 150 hours of tapes remain to be declassified.

SAFETY BOARD ISSUES PLAYPEN WARNING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa., Ill., Ohio, N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government announced Tuesday that nearly 10
million playpens must be repaired or destroyed because children
could strangle themselves if their clothing became caught on metal
rivets protruding from rails and hinges atop the pens.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, which said that eight toddlers had died in such
playpens over the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   At first, federal officials said, they thought the problem
occurred only when children were choked by strings attached to
pacifiers. But last year, they said, a toddler died when the
child's clothing was snagged on a playpen rivet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That indicated that the problem may be attributed to the
rivets on the playpens, rather than to pacifier cords,'' said
Nychelle Fleming, a spokeswoman for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that consumers should destroy or repair
the playpens, which carry a variety of brand names: Kolcraft,
Playskool, Strolee, Bilt-Rite, Evenflo, Gerry, Graco and
Pride-Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are cooperating with the government to make sure
that parents and day care centers eliminate the hazard. Companies
are offering refunds or repair kits to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the portable mesh playpens were made as long as 38 years
ago; others were produced just six months ago. The rivets look like
nuts and bolts, but cannot be removed. They stick out one-quarter
to one-half inch from the top rails of the playpens. The shape of
the rivets varies with the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   There are many models of playpens without the dangerous rivets.
They are not affected by Tuesday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Rader, commission spokesman, said the action was ``one
of the largest recalls of a children's product in the history of
the agency,'' which was created in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials and spokesmen for the baby-products
industry said they did not know how many playpens were sold in a
year or how many exist.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that consumers should immediately stop using
the playpens with protruding rivets and should call a toll-free
telephone number established specifically to deal with the problem.
The number is (800) 794-4115. Callers will be told how to obtain
refunds or repair kits.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that the dangerous rivets were found in
playpens manufactured by seven companies. Three companies account
for 90 percent of the products to be repaired or destroyed. The
companies are Graco Children's Products of Elverson, Pa., which
made 2 million of the playpens from 1976 to 1990; Kolcraft
Enterprises of Chicago, which made 2.6 million such playpens from
1986 to May of this year, and Pride-Trimble Corp. of Burbank,
Calif., which produced more than 4 million of the playpens from
1960 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Graco is now a unit of Rubbermaid Inc., in Wooster, Ohio. Its
products carry the Graco name on floorboards or side rails.
</P>
<P>
   The Kolcraft products have the name Kolcraft or Playskool on
floorboards or side rails. The Pride-Trimble name appears on the
floorboards of its playpens.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that other companies cooperating with its
effort were Bilt-Rite of Orangeburg, N.Y., which made more than
409,000 playpens with protruding rivets through 1989; Evenflo Co.
of Piqua, Ohio (205,000 playpens from 1994 to 1996), and
Hufco-Delaware of Dayton, Ohio (100,000 playpens from 1986 to
1992). The commission said that another manufacturer, Strolee Co.,
of Compton, Calif., had made 200,000 such playpens through 1983 but
was no longer in business.
</P>
<P>
   Hufco-Delaware playpens carry the Gerry brand name on their
floorboards.
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Reuter, a spokeswoman for the Juvenile Products
Manufacturers Association, which represents makers of playpens and
baby strollers, said, ``We will do everything we can to cooperate
with the Consumer Product Safety Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Koltun, president of Kolcraft Enterprises, said his
company was working with the government and with retailers to
publicize the problem. He said the company would provide free
repair kits to consumers who requested them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Playpens, also known in recent years as play yards, are meant to
provide a safe place where children can play. They typically have
nylon mesh sides to keep toddlers in an enclosed area. The rails
are padded and collapse when several levers are released. The
models identified as potentially hazardous can be folded in half
for storage.
</P>
<P>
   The price for a unit ranges from $35 to $70. Graco and Bilt-Rite
are offering a refund of $20 for a unit, with proof that the
playpen has been destroyed. Pride-Trimble is offering a refund of
$15 a unit.
</P>
<P>
   The commission said that Houdini-brand playpens manufactured by
Evenflo from 1994 to 1996 needed to be repaired even if they had
plastic covers over the rivets. ``The rivet covers on these
playpens must be replaced because they are defective and can crack,
break or come off, exposing the rivet and presenting a risk of
strangulation,'' Ms. Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   In a further caution to parents, the commission said that a
pacifier should never be hung from a string around a child's neck.

 &HT;    Atlanta's Y2K `point person' breathing easy
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Commissioner Herbert McCall, head of Atlanta's
Department of Administrative Services, acknowledges he's ``the
city's point person on Y2K.'' His message is, breathe easy.
</P>
<P>
   According to McCall, the city doesn't have much in the way of
vulnerable inventory and the problems that remain are being
addressed with straight-forward simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   The city has about 3,000 desktop computers. The glitchy software
on them is being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these have been ``mostly upgraded with compliant''
software, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
   There are only about 27 computer mainframe programs and just
eight mission critical systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what they are. Most are in the process of being
remediated, `` McCall added.
</P>
<P>
   In this context, mission critical means life, safety, health,
McCall explained.
</P>
<P>
   The work being done is both centralized and de-centralized.
There are about 40 centralized technology specialists and another
60 spread around the city. All of them have at least part-time Y2K
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In addition there are three different consulting teams, with a
total of about 30 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the state's contract for Y2K program management,''
McCall said, ``and we're using the top-ranked firm, Information
Systems and Network Corp., based in Maryland'' as the overall
manager.
</P>
<P>
   The city also has three project management offices. One focuses
upon legacy systems, the software that's been handed down; a second
team is assigned to the airport's software. The third, for
non-legacy systems, deals with everything else, including embedded
software chips that operate equipment and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said the city has inventoried these chips and his team is
deciding which are critical.
</P>
<P>
   What's all this costing? McCall said that's hard to figure. A
lot of equipment is decentralized and some has been fixed as a
by-product of overall repairs.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a ``shot in the dark,'' McCall estimated the city had
spent $2 million fixing the desktops and ``$4-to-$6 million
overall'' in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, the city expects to spend another $9 million in
1999, but, again, some of that will be general technology upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be in the ballpark. For instance, Los Angeles, a
larger city than Atlanta, recently reported expenditures of $10
million with another $5 million projected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the drop dead date'' for fixing Y2K is Dec. 31,
1999, Mayor Bill Campbell has given us a June 30, 1999 deadline,
McCall said. ``We will be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   For an all-day Internet Y2K conference Nov. 27 that will feature
U.S. cities, go to http://www.y2kactionday.com.

 &HT;    Atlanta rated towards the top in real estate trusts
 &HT;    By Sallye Salter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Buoyed by the recent sale of Lenox Square and Phipps
Plaza, metro Atlanta ranks at the top of the heap of U.S. cities in
the dollar value of properties owned by real estate investment
trusts. The ranking affirms metro Atlanta's attraction for real
estate buyers.
</P>
<P>
   REITs own 936 properties here valued at $14.6 billion, according
to Alliance Capital/CB Richard Ellis , which tracks quarterly
transactions of 142 of the largest U.S. REITs.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.3 billion in purchases completed here in the third
quarter largely reflects deals negotiated before the turmoil in
capital markets made financing more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   While acquisitions of $1.3 billion last quarter pushed Atlanta
ahead in total REIT holdings, two other cities had higher sales
volumes during the three months. Boston had $1.6 billion and
Midtown Manhattan, $1.31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Transactions nationwide totaled a strong $20.5 billion despite
the tightening in credit markets and lanquishing stock prices that
are expected to take a toll on REIT purchases. Almost 40 percent of
the third quarter sales were in three large deals worked out months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Debartolo Group's $5.8 billion purchase of Corporate
Property Investors _ the deal that included Lenox Square, Phipps
Plaza and other holdings here _ accounted for 28 percent of the
third quarter volume nationwide.
</P>

   In metro Atlanta, REITs purchased $861 million of retail

acquisition. After that transaction, which was announced last
February, Simon Debartolo ranks second among REITs in the amount of
property owned here.

<P>
   Simon Debartolo's $1 billion in metro Atlanta holdings is
surpassed only by the $1.3 billion of Atlanta-based apartment

 &HT;    Forum on whether college class violates civil rights laws
delayed
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Federal officials have delayed until early
next year a public forum to examine whether a community college
noncredit course violated civil rights laws by teaching that most
black people during the Civil War were happy under slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Civil Rights Commission had planned to hold the forum
in Greensboro by the end of the year. But officials said Tuesday
the commission wants to broaden the scope of the forum beyond the
recently canceled Civil War class on the Archdale, N.C., campus of
Randolph Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Robert L. Knight, a civil rights analyst in the commission's
Atlanta office, said he believes ``it might be a stretch to find a
rights violation'' solely in the continuing education course, which
was sponsored by a High Point, N.C., camp of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans. Taught by people affiliated with the veterans
group, the final class scheduled for last week was canceled amid
criticism by civil rights leaders and skepticism by historians.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said federal officials are still gathering information
about the course.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt Kirk, chairman of the North Carolina advisory committee to
the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, praised the college's
administrators for canceling the course, and he urged the college
to participate in the forum.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said the forum could possibly focus on the commission's
recent investigation of racial tensions in North Carolina. A report
on the investigation's findings is being reviewed by the state
advisory committee before it is released to the public, Kirk said.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible topic is the 1994 police shooting of
19-year-old Daryl Eugene Howerton. A jury last month ruled in favor
of two Greensboro policemen, charged in a civil lawsuit of using
excessive force when they shot Howerton. A group representing 92
black churches has asked the city to pay damages to the victim's
mother, who claims her son was mentally unstable when, according to
police, he lunged with a knife at a bystander.

 &HT;    More bad news from Hayes: manufacturing site closing down
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hayes Corp. started shutting down its once-stellar
manufacturing unit Tuesday, laying off about 100 employees, with 50
more slated for pink slips in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross, Ga.-based company, which filed for bankruptcy
protection Oct. 9, suspended two shifts right away and told workers
the third shift will be idled soon. When that happens,
manufacturing will cease.
</P>
<P>
   Of about 225 employees who were working in manufacturing several
weeks ago, about 25 have left voluntarily and about 50 will be
retained _ at least for awhile _ while the rest of the jobs will
disappear. The company, which once dominated the market for analog
modems, has already shrunk from a workforce high of about 1,200 to
less than 450.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes officials both here and in the company's executive offices
in Maryland could not be reached for comment. Ron Howard, chief
executive officer, was unavailable, as was Steve Mank, the
company's chief operating officer. Mank was the one who came to
Norcross to make the announcements and meet with employees.
</P>
<P>
   But bad as it was, the news wasn't as grim as many had expected
_ at least, not yet. Hayes could face a fire sale of assets, that
would leave virtually nothing of its former glory except perhaps
its brand name slapped on someone else's modems. And the shutdown
of manufacturing had been expected, part of a restructuring that
might leave the company fit for competition in markets for new
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Howard had said he hoped the operations would lure a
buyer who would keep employees on the job.
</P>
<P>
   A quick and painful demise for Hayes was avoided days ago, when
financing for Hayes expired. That deal with NationsCredit expired
Nov. 20, but the bank has agreed to a two-week extension, according
to bank attorney Jesse H. Austin III, who declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   That action, which staved off the grimmest possibility, was
apparently linked to the desperate cost-cutting that comes with
suspension of manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Another key to the company's fate is the committee of creditors
named as part of the Chapter 11. That committee, whose goal is to
receive as much as possible of what its members are owed, is still
open to all options, said Charles Campbell, attorney for the
committee. ``They've got to come up with a proposal acceptable to
the banks. We don't rule anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hayes, the best-possible scenario calls for emergence as a
shadow of its former self, a company that would sell modems made
overseas by someone else. Hayes would need engineers, if it wanted
to sell newer modems, and it would need a sales staff _ but not a
lot more. The company's total workforce could wind up far fewer
than 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, during a previous bout with bankruptcy, had fended off
takeover tries by several rivals, including a $140 million proposal
from Diamond Multimedia. This time, no companies have been bidding
for Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa-based Reptron Electronics, which has an office in
Norcross, had apparently expressed interest in Hayes, but employees
were told Tuesday that an agreement calls for Kaifa Technology of
Taiwan, to take on manufacturing of Hayes modems. As part of the
arrangement, Kaifa, one of the company's largest creditors,
apparently wants Hayes to keep its warranty and repair shop open.

 &HT;    Big Blue loosens up
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to the Internet, forget everything you
ever knew about IBM. Members of its Atlanta-based Web development
team are not the buttoned-down IBM company men of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   The 500-plus employees in the Telecommunications and
Entertainment Division work in super-sleek offices decorated with
bold artwork at workstations cluttered with personal belongings. To
top it all off, they design Web sites for their clients on _
horrors _ Power Macs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joke that we have ambulances waiting right outside in case
anyone has a coronary,'' says Jeff Ramminger, the engineer who
heads up this most unusual division of IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM team is responsible for some of the best event-oriented
Web sites, including the Masters golf tournament, and the
Wimbledon, Australian and French open tennis tournaments. In 1999,
it'll add the Grammy awards and the Ryder Cup to its list of
credits. The Web site for Macy's with a Christmas shopping theme is
now under construction.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is an unlikely player in the Web design and development
arena. Most interactive shops would kill to have IBM's big-ticket
client list. With technology as its core industry, IBM has been
able to expand its business to include Web development and
electronic commerce. Most interactive ad agencies began life as Web
development shops and expanded their businesses to include
programming and other technical components.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come to IBM because we are a tech company,''
Ramminger says. ``The technology is a means to the end, but we have
to be clever about how we implement it.'' IBM's core business is
manufacturing computer hardware, but the job of Ramminger and his
team is to show off Web technology to its best advantage.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they're not doing too badly. In fact, they are doing
very well. The sites they've designed for the Masters at Augusta
National and for Wimbledon were a sports lover's dream come true
featuring streaming video, real-time leaderboards and virtual
course tours, and real-time audio commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Ramminger likes to think that great Web sites combined with
great technology are what makes the IBM team successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think it's the whole package,'' he says. ``You
have to do a good job of hosting. We are committed to good response
time _ my focus is to create an experience that people will enjoy.
We see ourselves as a complement to TV. However, television is a
produced medium, but the Web is a self-produced medium _ users can
look at whatever they want to look at whenever they feel like it.''
</P>
<P>
   While providing a great experience for users is obviously one of
IBM's goals, Ramminger says there are three main reasons for
pouring so much time, effort and personnel into the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three benefits,'' he says. ``First, we leverage the
brand of IBM by doing good event Web sites. We are doing some
pretty unique things and we want to be perceived by both Generation
X and by baby boomer clients as folks who do good, cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, the people who typically view our stuff are potential
clients for our e-commerce business, and the Web site components
also appeal to IBM clients looking for business solutions. And
third, the sites are also an incredible draw to get people to come
and work here.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no shortage of employees to staff the IBM
telecommunications and media division, which also includes video
and DVD divisions. The average employee in the division is in the
upper 20s _ as opposed to the mid-30s companywide. ``Atlanta is
such a good place to find talent,'' Ramminger says.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers include area graduates as well as producers, art
directors and others who viewed IBM's sites on the Web and liked
what they saw. Prospective employees have sent resumes from all
over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., the IBM scenic
``campus'' on Windy Hill Road comes not only with a free snack bar
but a massage therapist as well. Employees don't have set hours,
and the facility runs pretty much on a 24 hour, seven-day-a-week
basis. Being a sports fan or a music freak isn't required for
employment, but it clearly doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Web sites were conceived as a way to draw attention and
business to IBM's hardware offerings. The sites have been so
well-received that the company continues to focus attention and
money on their online products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are students of what people do in the (online) event
area,'' Ramminger says. ``When we see the feedback we get for our
sites, it means a lot.''

 &HT;    Dec. 4 might be lucky day for lawbreakers in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fed up with the prospect of yet another year with
hardly a pay raise and possibly no uniform allowances, Atlanta
officers are threatening a one-day work action that could leave the
city thousands of dollars short.
</P>
<P>
   They call it ``no ticket Friday'' and it's planned for Dec. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if a ticket is written on Dec. 4, except
if there's an accident,'' said Chip Warren, vice president of the
International Brotherhood of Police Officers, the city's 800-member
police union. ``It's been years since I've seen officers this
enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a ticketless Friday was the brainchild of an Atlanta
officer _ who union officials will not identify. The officer said
he's ``had enough of Mayor Bill Campbell's abuse of the police
department,'' Warren said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer distributed fliers encouraging his colleagues to
stash their ticket books. The fliers read: ``Ticket-free Friday.
December 4th. Don't write 'em. Have the Christmas spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   If the plan takes off it could mean a shortfall of as much as
$50,000 in revenue. The money is garnered through speeding,
accident and DUI tickets, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Warren assured the action would not compromise public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Through a written response Campbell said: ``We expect our police
officers to maintain and uphold their sworn oath of office and
enforce the laws of this city every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Beverly Harvard had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week officers learned their annual pay increases may be
frozen and their $600 uniform allowance may be wiped out as
cost-cutting measures next year. For the past three years, officers
have received only a 1 percent raise each year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether officers would be disciplined for not writing
tickets, Warren smiled: ``What are they going to do fire all of
them?''

KERRY SAYS HE'S LEANING TOWARD FORMING PAC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a new signal that Senator John F. Kerry may seek
the presidential nomination, the Massachusetts Democrat privately
has begun taking steps toward establishing his first political
action committee, which could pay many of his pre-campaign expenses
and raise his national profile.
</P>
<P>
   In addition Kerry, who throughout his career has made much of
his refusal to accept PAC money, has told associates he may lift
his ban on accepting funds from other political action committees
because it is so time-consuming to raise money.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, sounding exultant over having erased much of his leftover
Senate campaign debt with a $650,000 fund-raiser Monday in Boston,
said Tuesday that he is ``very inclined'' to form the political
action committee soon. Such PACs are frequently used by
presidential prospects to cover costs such as travel and staff
salaries and to distribute campaign money to a network of political
allies.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said the creation of the PAC doesn't mean he is running
for president, but he didn't discourage people from interpreting it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's fine if they want to conclude that,'' Kerry said in an
interview. ``Regardless of what happens, I want to play a stronger
role and have an impact. That builds the reason for setting up a
PAC; it can go both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Kerry might end his career-long refusal to
accept PAC money is another signal of his presidential ambitions.
``I'm not sure I can continue to do that,'' Kerry said about his
ban on PAC funds.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry plans to spend the next few weeks consulting with friends
about whether to seek the nomination and expects to make a decision
in January or February.
</P>
<P>
   While Kerry is considered a longshot to win the Democratic
nomination, his chances could be improving. For example, House
minority leader Richard Gephardt is considering staying out of the
race in hopes that Democrats will win control of the House in 2000
and elect him as speaker. Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska,
meanwhile, expressed some reservations about running, telling the
Omaha World-Herald last weekend, ``I don't intend to enter a race
to cause anybody any difficulties.'' Aides to Gephardt and Kerrey
stressed that no decision has been made.
</P>
<P>
   If both Gephardt and Kerrey decline to run, that would leave
Kerry, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Senator Paul
Wellstone of Minnesota as the most prominent Democrats who have
said they are seriously considering challenging the front-runner,
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, however, remains a formidable candidate, especially with
Tuesday's announcement that Attorney General Janet Reno will not
seek the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the
vice president's fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry's difficulty in paying off his Senate campaign debt led to
speculation earlier this year that he would be too burdened to move
toward running for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry said Tuesday that his campaign debt should not be
considered an issue, because he raised more money than any other
Senate candidate in 1996 and is continuing to raise money that
should result in nearly eliminating the debt within months. While
the extent of Kerry's debt won't be known until he files a year-end
report, Kerry said Monday's fund-raiser went a long way toward
paying off the $1.2 million debt he reported in June. As long as
his debt is below $500,000, Kerry said, it should not be a factor
in his decision whether to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry is behind other presidential prospects in establishing a
PAC. Republicans Lamar Alexander and Dan Quayle have raised
millions of dollars this year for their PACs to help boost their
candidacies. Alexander, for example, uses his PAC not only to
contribute to candidates, but also to pay many expenses that
otherwise would have to come from a formal campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   PAC contribution limits are more generous. A campaign committee
can accept no more than $1,000 per person for the primary and
general election, totaling $2,000, while a PAC can accept $5,000
per person per year. Individuals can give to campaign committees
and PACs at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the presidential race, you are limited to $2,000,'' Kerry
said. ``A lot of people in this country are prepared to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hendrie, of the non-partisan Center for Responsive
Politics, said setting up a PAC often is a crucial step for a
presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help people run for president because you can pay a lot
of your general political expenses from the PAC,'' Hendrie said.
``If you want to have a fund-raising event in New Hampshire, you
can pay for air transportation and all costs associated with that.
It is a way of covering a lot of those expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   After a person formally declares his candidacy, a PAC cannot pay
direct campaign expenses such as travel. But the PAC still
continues to be a valuable source for staff support and can absorb
the high cost of important projects such as developing a direct
mail fund-raising list.
</P>
<P>
   Some presidential prospects such as Alexander have gone further,
establishing PACs in states that have no limits on contributions.
Such a step would be politically difficult for Kerry, given his
efforts to pass campaign finance laws that would restrict
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerry said he saw no conflict between his support for
overhauling the campaign finance system and his move toward
establishing a PAC. Indeed, Kerry said, he hoped he could use a PAC
to help elect other members of Congress who would support his
campaign finance effort. Asked why he waited so long before taking
such a step, Kerry responded: ``Because I haven't been considering
the kinds of options that I am considering now.''

A THINKING MAN'S BRUCKNER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine the Bruckner symphonies shorn of sentimental piety, and
you're at the starting point of a provocative cycle emerging on
CDs. Through five symphonies, Georg Tintner, 81, a conductor born
in Vienna, casts Bruckner's grand, emotionally charged structures
in a refreshing light of restraint and proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Reflected back is an aura of honest affection and with it a
paradoxical exchange: a beguiling intellectual beauty where one
often finds a cloistered spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Many things are surprising about this project on the budget
label Naxos, not least the ``sudden'' appearance of the conductor
himself. Tintner, who lives in Canada, has spent most of his life
as an expatriate and pursued his career out of the international
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   When Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, Tintner fled
to New Zealand, eventually becoming principal conductor of the
Australian National Opera and holding other posts in Australia. In
1987 he began a 10-year stint as music director of Symphony Nova
Scotia in Halifax, where he remains conductor laureate.
</P>
<P>
   He has devoted himself to Bruckner for many years, and his
expertise tells, not only in the originality of the present
interpretations but also in his accompanying essays. Although
Bruckner often revised, even truncated, his symphonies at the
urging of colleagues, Tintner is a strong advocate of playing the
first published versions, as he does here.
</P>
<P>
   There is perhaps a poetic appropriateness in the scattering of
orchestras involved in a project led by the peripatetic Tintner.
The National Symphony Orchestra of Ireland plays the Second
Symphony and, in a two-disk set, the Eighth and the Symphony No. 0;
the Royal Scottish National Orchestra performs the Fifth Symphony,
and the New Zealand Symphony the Sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Through and through, Tintner's sure grasp of structure underpins
his lyrical bent. The Second Symphony (Naxos 8.554006), with its
warmly Schubertian character, glows in a long-lined treatment. One
can only agree with the conductor that the Second has never enjoyed
its just measure of popularity. Tradition, he says, has followed
Wagner in choosing the Third, which was dedicated to him, over the
Second.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish orchestra paints the Second in warm hues. While one
might wish for a more burnished string sound, the woodwinds and
brasses distinguish themselves in both solo and ensemble
assignments. The winds' ability to muster a true blaze of sound
illuminates and propels the scherzo, which here follows the opening
movement in accordance with Bruckner's original intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruckner wisely placed the scherzo second, because this robust
music makes a perfect contrast to the largely lyrical first
movement,'' Tintner writes. ``It is not clear what made him change
his mind, but perhaps he was frightened (and he was easily
frightened) that critics would accuse him of copying the order of
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Symphony (8.553452) sidesteps the issue of
revisionism. Somehow, the first versions of both the Fifth and the
Sixth sailed into history without doctoring. Declaring the Fifth
``the most intellectual of all Bruckner's works,'' Tintner says it
is ``the furthest removed from the seductive world of Wagner's
harmony and orchestration.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which points up the depth and power of the conductor's
own intellectual instincts. While his reading of the Fifth may
reflect his aversion to self-indulgence (what he calls the
self-pitying emotion of Tchaikovsky and Mahler), his unfailing
sense of line and pace and balance does not make for any kind of
mathematical encounter. Here is the essence of Beethoven
transfigured by a spirit of perhaps unsuspected kinship.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this strain of intellectual humanism more compelling
than in the Fifth's sweeping (25-minute), rigorously contrapuntal
finale. ``Was the great Furtwangler right when he described this
finale as surpassing all others in the symphonic literature?''
Tintner queries. ``Superlatives are always dangerous, but it is
certainly one of the greatest.'' And this version is among the most
lucid and radiant to be found on disks.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Second Symphony, the Sixth (8.553453) has lagged in
public affection, or perhaps more accurately, in the hearts of
conductors. Tintner suggests that the problem lies with the finale,
which ``in contrast to the perfect first three movements is not
absolutely satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   He finds two shortcomings: a rather banal yet belabored
principal theme and a final affirmation of the home key that does
not feel adequately prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Both points are debatable. The Sixth's finale is (on the
Brucknerian scale) a scant 15 minutes long. Over that short course,
the modesty of the main theme doesn't wear all that thin. Nor does
the suddenness of the return to the symphony's home key, A major,
seem unusual for Bruckner.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the symphonies, the Sixth may be the most winsome: a
Greek maiden between the Norse gods of Five and Seven, to
paraphrase Schumann on the Beethoven Fourth. Perhaps because of its
merry A major, the Sixth has always struck these ears as Bruckner's
``Pastoral,'' no matter that Beethoven cast his in F.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Tintner draws from the New Zealanders just such a
sunny, unconstrained reading, with a finale that holds up very well
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been overambitious of Naxos to pair the monumental
Eighth and the Symphony No. 0 (8.554215/6). Although Tintner
supports the idea that No. 0, far from being a novice work, was in
fact written after the First Symphony, he dismisses its finale as
an academic exercise in counterpoint and treats it as such.
</P>
<P>
   But his return to the ``original'' 1887 version of the Eighth
Symphony, edited by Leopold Nowak, in preference to the widely
performed Robert Haas edition, is historically intriguing, even if
the differences tend to be subtle. What is constant, on a line from
the Second to the Eighth, is the conductor's knack for boiling away
the Romantic excess of tradition and getting at the crux of
Bruckner's art.
</P>
<P>
   One may find more elegant playing of the Eighth among the many
options on CD, but Tintner's view of the music, ardent yet ever
poised, commands a place in the sun.

PACT TO BUILD CASPIAN OIL PIPELINE REACHED BY RUSSIA, KAZAKHSTAN,
COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia, Kazakhstan and major oil companies Tuesday
agreed to build a multibillion-dollar pipeline to the oil-rich
Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
   The project is scheduled to completed in 2001 and would be the
first major new pipeline in the region. It would connect the Tengiz
oil field to a Russian port on the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   While the move is an important step in tapping the oil resources
of the Caspian, it is also part of the Russian government's
struggle to regain credibility with foreign businesspeople.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia in the grips of a financial crisis, foreign
investors have been fleeing in droves. The nation's banking system
is virtually paralyzed. The Kremlin has served notice that it will
seek to renegotiate its foreign debt. Major Western oil companies
have also scaled back their operations in Russia by cutting back
staff and selling stakes in joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's accord is intended to signal that Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov's left-leaning team is still capable of
doing business with an increasingly skeptical West. It will also
bring billions of dollars in tax revenue to Russia's cash-starved
government.
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty of work needed to turn Tuesday's accord into
a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still a long way to go,'' warned Richard Matzke,
president of Chevron Overseas Petroleum Inc., a unit of Chevron
Corp. ``We have not built the pipeline yet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Tengiz pipeline has a tangled history. It has been under
discussion for the better part of a decade. At stake were huge
profits for U.S. oil companies, greater political independence from
Moscow for Kazakhstan and revenue for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Kazakhstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev agreed that the pipeline should be built in
1996. But it took another two years to iron out the details.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly the only pipeline project being planned. The United
States and Turkey are also pressing the construction of a separate
pipeline from Baku the capital of Azerbaijan to the Turkish port of
Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has even said that it might try to fight competition from
the new Tengiz pipeline by reducing tanker traffic through the
Bosporus, the strait between the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara,
and raising transit fees.
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's accord was an important breakthrough. While
Chevron and other oil companies are investing $20 billion to
develop the Tengiz field transportation has been a major problem.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the crude is shipped by train. The new plan is to ship
it along a 900 mile pipeline to the Russian port of Novorossiysk.
There, it will be loaded onto ships and sold to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to load the first ship before July 1999. The
capacity of the pipeline will be 67 million tons a year, but the
plan is to reach a level of 28 million tons a year before the end
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tengiz oil field may be fully developed only after this
pipeline has been built,'' Primakov said. ``Many oil companies
think this oil region is even richer than the Persian Gulf,
although I personally doubt this.''
</P>
<P>
   Building the pipeline will cost some $2.3 billion. More than
$854 million is to spent next year. But Russia's will ultimately
earn as much as $23 billion in tax revenue from the project.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium will
oversee the project. Russia has a 24 percent share of the
consortium; Kazakhstan, 19 percent, and the Persian Gulf nation of
Oman, 7 percent. Other shares are held by oil companies, led by
Chevron, which has 15 percent, and also including a venture of
Lukoil and ARCO, 12.5 percent; Royal Dutch/Shell Group and RAO
Rosneft, a Russian oil company, 7.5 percent; ENI SpA of Italy, 2
percent; BG PLC of Britain, 2 percent, and the Oryx Energy Company
of Dallas, 1.75 percent. &QL;

INJURY TO VIKINGS' REED MEANS MORE MOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys' banged-up secondary received some
good news and some bad news yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings' three-headed receiver corps of Cris Carter, rookie
sensation Randy Moss and Jake Reed was reduced to two. Vikings
coach Dennis Green said yesterday that Reed will not play in
tomorrow's Thanksgiving Day game at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, suffering from a disk problem in his lower back, is
expected to undergo surgery in a few days and could be out least
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, however, is that Reed's injury means that the
Cowboys will get to see even more of the explosive Moss, who had
been averaging 25 plays per game but now will move into the
starting lineup next to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the Vikings' vaunted air attack would be less
difficult if the Cowboys could count on the services of All-Pro
cornerback Deion Sanders, listed as questionable because of a
sprained toe. The decision on whether Sanders will play might not
come down until right before tomorrow's kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   If Sanders is available, look for him to lock up one-on-one on
Moss to try to stifle the rookie's game-breaking ability. Five of
Moss' eight touchdown receptions have been from 44 yards or longer.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, the Cowboys would then give cornerback Kevin
Smith help from a safety on Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Cowboys are planning on using reserve cornerback
Charlie Williams in place of Sanders and a mix of varying coverage
schemes, defensive coordinator Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that the Cowboys have such a healthy dose of
respect for the Vikings' big-play passing game that they will
depart some from their stop-the-run-first strategy and not be as
willing to commit a safety to run support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do both,'' Campo said. ``We will mix it some where
we can slow down both the run and the big play. We can't have them
always playing coverage or stopping the run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will likely use some double coverages on Moss and
Carter _ an option that looks even better with Reed out,
considering that Campo said they ``couldn't double cover three
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has been burned for three touchdowns in spot duty
in place of Sanders the past three games, knows the Vikings will
try to target him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not scared or worried about that,'' Williams said.
``It's a challenge, but there is no sense in running from it. All I
can do go out there and play the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety George Teague said that's the attitude the entire
secondary will take.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of stuff Moss does,'' Teague said. ``He makes
some incredible plays. But it comes down to us not being put in his
highlight reel. Besides, with everybody watching on Thanksgiving
Day, it's a chance to make plays against a good team and get
remembered and recognized yourself.''

 Matt Wolf is the London theater critic for Variety and a regular
writer on the arts from Europe.  
 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A former hops brewery might seem an unlikely source for
Broadway. But the tiny Donmar Warehouse theater in London has over
time become a powerful producing entity way out of proportion to
its 251 seats.
</P>
<P>
   While maintaining a full level of activity at home, this
nonprofit theater has originated, in one form or another and
sometimes with outside collaborators, three highly disparate
productions currently on Broadway: ``Cabaret'' at Studio 54, which
won last season's Tony Award for best musical revival; Sophocles'
``Electra,'' with Zoe Wanamaker in the title role, now in previews
and opening on Thursday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, and ``The
Blue Room,'' also in previews and opening on Dec. 13 at the Cort
Theater with Nicole Kidman in her Broadway stage debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a bumper year,'' said Caro Newling, 41, the
Donmar's executive producer. ``It's one of those extraordinary sets
of circumstances where everything comes together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Newling was speaking from the Donmar's Covent Garden offices
around the corner from the theater, where she and a producing staff
of nine mount about six productions a year on a budget of roughly
$2.7 million. (By contrast, the McCarter Theater in Princeton,
N.J., with which the Donmar's Broadway ``Electra'' is a co-venture,
spends some $5 million annually to present seven plays, their
annual ``Christmas Carol'' included.)
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the Donmar enterprise is its rectangular space on
Earlham Street in the West End. It owes its name to Donald Albery,
the venerable London theater manager, and the dancer Margot Fonteyn
(Donmar deriving from Donald and Margot) during that period several
decades ago when Albery was Fonteyn's friend and ad hoc manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, his son Ian Albery bought what was by then a
banana-ripening warehouse and transformed it into the Donmar
Rehearsal Rooms in honor of the friendship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, it became the London studio theater for the Royal
Shakespeare Company, an equivalent to the troupe's Other Place in
Stratford, housing such celebrated productions as the Ian
McKellen-Judi Dench ``Macbeth.'' In the 1980s, the Donmar came
under the artistic directorship of Nica Burns _ now a production
director with the Stoll Moss theater chain in London _ who
presented initial London appearances by, among others, Declan
Donnellan's Cheek by Jowl theater company; Garry Hynes's Druid
Theater Company from Galway, Ireland (Ms. Hynes was this year's
Tony-winning director for ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane''), and the
American singer Barbara Cook, whose 1987 Donmar season more or less
began her career in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The Donmar's international cachet at the moment is attributable
to the accomplishments over his six years as artistic director of
Sam Mendes, 33, himself director of two of the theater's current
Broadway entries, as well as Ms. Newling and her team.
</P>
<P>
   They were aboard when the Donmar, after extensive renovations,
reopened in late 1992 with the British premiere of Stephen
Sondheim's musical ``Assassins.'' It was directed by Mendes, whom
Ms. Newling had met in 1990 when she was head of press relations at
the Royal Shakespeare Company. Mendes was then directing ``Troilus
and Cressida'' at the RSC.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, said Sir Peter Hall, the veteran theater director,
``the Donmar has proved a settling ground for talent, and that's
Sam's achievement. Both the West End and Broadway are great big
vacuums, and talent comes to fill them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Donmar, Sir Peter said, ``costs are very low, therefore
they can take risks, and if the risks work, the shows get
exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional challenge for the theater has been the decision to
earmark $1.67 million from various sources _ the Shubert
Organization in New York is one _ to produce three shows over 18
months in the West End under the banner of Warehouse Productions,
the Donmar's separate-but-equal commercial wing.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these, a double-bill of Tom Stoppard's ``Real
Inspector Hound'' and Peter Shaffer's ``Black Comedy,'' ended a
successful seven-month run in October. Next up, and opening in
April, will be Tennessee Williams's ``Suddenly Last Summer''
directed by Sean Mathias.
</P>
<P>
   To date and Broadway aside, the Donmar has had three West End
transfers and another to Buenos Aires, where David Leveaux (who is
directing the current ``Electra'' in New York) remounted a
Spanish-language version of his 1996 Donmar staging of the musical
``Nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Donmar's greatest critical successes have played no
more than six or eight weeks at the theater itself: Mendes's
passionate 1993 revival of Brian Friel's ``Translations'' led to an
offer for him to direct the play in New York, which he declined.
His 1996 revival of Alan Bennett's ``Habeas Corpus'' turned a
putative farce into a stinging meditation on death.
</P>
<P>
   All this from a stark, stripped-brick auditorium with a narrow
gallery above the main floor, where, on both levels, patrons are
squeezed together on cushioned benches. ``The Donmar is almost like
an informal space,'' said Brenda Blethyn, the star of the Mike
Leigh film ``Secrets and Lies,'' who was in ``Habeas Corpus'' at
the theater. ``It's not sophisticated backstage. There are only two
dressing rooms, so you all muck in. There's a feeling of
camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   That can make for crowded conditions when you have a cast not of
2, as with ``The Blue Room,'' but of 19, as with the current
production, a revival of the 1987 Stephen Sondheim-James Lapine
musical ``Into the Woods,'' which runs through Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   (Sondheim has become something of a de facto house dramatist at
the Donmar, having had three shows there, including Mendes's
acclaimed revival of ``Company'' in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   Though Mendes is embarking on his film debut _ a Hollywood
venture entitled ``American Beauty'' starring Kevin Spacey _ he has
renewed his contract with the theater through March 2002. For him,
the Donmar is home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I care about this building,'' he said. ``I like the feel of
it, the smell of it. I want to come back here as a sad git in my
60s and point at photos and go, `I did that.' ''

   Next Sunday, an exhibition of photographs by Brassai, called
``The Eye of Paris,'' will open at the Museum of Fine Arts in
Houston. The result of 15 years of research by Anne Wilkes Tucker,
the museum's curator of photography, it is the first major museum
retrospective of Brassai's work to be held in this country since
one at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, not so many years ago, when Brassai was one of
the best known and most visible photographers around. He was also
one of the great company of Central European exiles of World Wars I
and II.
</P>
<P>
   In person, he was a twinkling little Transylvanian with a magic
touch in all human relations. Born in 1899 in the ancient Hungarian
city of Brasso, he was a cosmopolitan by birth, almost, in that
Brasso had a large numbers of Hungarian, German and Romanian
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man he took the pseudonym ``Brassai,'' which means
``the man from Brasso.'' After the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy in 1918, he eventually made his way to Berlin, where he
fell in with an exiled artistic elite. (Among them were Kandinsky,
Moholy-Nagy and Oskar Kokoschka.)
</P>
<P>
   From Berlin, early in 1924, he got to Paris, which was to be his
home until his death in 1984. There he lived with his wife,
Gilberte Mercedes Boyer, who after his death became a formidable
guardian of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   He endeared himself everywhere, and to almost everyone. He got
the pulse of a certain Paris, and he knew how to present it. When
the two great high-art magazines in Paris were ``Minotaure'' and
``Verve,'' he was welcomed in both of them. But he could also adapt
to more raffish milieus.
</P>
<P>
   To writers _ Americans like Henry Miller and Englishmen like
Lawrence Durrell _ he was the embodiment of an easy-going Paris in
which people could live as they pleased, and for very little.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1939, Brassai had made his name in England primarily with
his contributions to the new-style magazines _ among them
``Lilliput'' and ``Picture Post'' _ which brought a new,
fast-moving and somewhat rakish esthetic to the stately world of
English periodicals. He was also well known, then as now, for his
studies of the more disreputable aspects of Parisian night life.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, and when Carmel Snow presided over
Harper's Bazaar, he was constantly on view. (Ms. Tucker says in her
catalogue that between 1945 and 1960, Brassai appeared in more than
70 features in Harper's Bazaar.)
</P>
<P>
   But he also had an auxiliary activity. Little known at that
time, it may well be his most lasting achievement. He had won the
confidence of many of the major painters and sculptors of the day.
Among them were Pierre Bonnard, Georges Braque, Alberto Giacometti,
Fernand Leger, Henri Matisse, Joan Miro and Pablo Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he photograph them, but he overheard what they
talked about. Thanks to him, posterity can know what they looked
like, how they lived, what company they kept and what was said
around them.
</P>
<P>
   A major document in that connection is ``Picasso and Company,''
with text and photographs by Brassai (published in 1966 by
Doubleday). Another, smaller one is ``The Artists of My Life,''
also with text and pictures by Brassai, published by Viking in
1982. The Picasso Museum in Paris is preparing an exhibition of
Brassai's photographs of Picasso and his friends for next year.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Brassai was taking those photographs, major artists
were not celebrities in today's sense. Often their neighbors did
not even know who they were. The ``photo-op'' was unknown.
Brassai's photographs have therefore a certain privacy, not to
mention an authenticity that we immediately recognize.
</P>
<P>
   It so happens that both the name and the work of Brassai have
specific echoes for me. During much of the 1950s, I was way behind
with a long-promised and largely paid-for book about Paris. Those
were easy-going times for delinquent authors, but even so I was
conspicuously late.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally gave my manuscript to my publishers, B.T.
Batsford in London, they did not scold. What they said was: ``We
have good news for you. Brassai is doing the photographs for your
book.''
</P>
<P>
   Batsford's had published the English-language version of
Brassai's ``Paris by Night.'' They had also organized his first
exhibition in London. It was natural that they should bring Brassai
aboard. Nor could I have wished for a better jacket image than his
panoramic photograph of the Place de la Concorde, with its
fountains, its obelisk, its two great town houses designed by
Gabriel, and the church of the Madeleine in the distance. Inside
the book were 42 more photographs by Brassai.
</P>
<P>
   Our joint book (if I may so describe it) did not result from a
collaboration. My work was already done. I did not meet Brassai
until late in the day, when I was deputed to ask him to make two
new photographs for the book.
</P>
<P>
   We met as strangers, therefore. On our way out to lunch I
noticed that when it came to crossing the road _ and especially at
one of those five- or six-way crossings in which Paris specializes
_ he would take me by the waist, as if I were made of blown glass.
After looking in every possible direction, he would tighten his
grip and guide me, step by step.
</P>
<P>
   What I then regarded as almost an excess of courtesy (and one
that was to mark our every outing in Paris), has been made clear to
me by Ms. Tucker in her catalogue. When Brassai's parents took him
to Paris in 1903-04, he was terrified by the still largely
horse-drawn traffic. That he would be trodden underfoot was a
matter of daily anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   The headlong gallop of horse after horse was terrifying to the
small boy. Something of that terror never left him, and for that
reason he would continually watch over his friends when crossing
the road.
</P>
<P>
   This matter apart, our relations were cloudless. Brassai was the
very spirit of mischief and good humor. His images chimed with what
I had written. The jacket, with its blue rinse, has never faded,
and the book sold nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brassai: The Eye of Paris'' will be on view in Houston through
February. It will then travel to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles
and to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot resist remarking on the exemplary discretion with which
Gilberte Brassai, the artist's widow, has chosen to be represented
by a portrait of herself that is exactly 2\ inches high by 1\
inches wide.

HEREDITARY PEERS FEEL THE WINDS OF OBSOLESCENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Among the snubbed were the silver stick in waiting,
maltravers herald extraordinary, black rod, portcullis pursuivant,
the crown equerry and the gentleman usher of the sword of state.
</P>
<P>
   Casualties of a Buckingham Palace effort to slim down the
grandest occasion of the British ceremonial calendar short of a
coronation or royal funeral, they were not in their accustomed
places Tuesday at the state opening of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And many in the ranks seated before Queen Elizabeth on Tuesday
probably won't be in theirs next year. In the most noted passage of
the traditional queen's recitation of government plans for the new
legislative session, the hereditary peers heard from the sovereign
herself the official notice that a principal government goal next
year is the removal of their right to sit and vote in the House of
Lords.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't need to note their ermine-caped scarlet robes to spot
them. They were the ones who kept stony silence while members of
the Labor-dominated House of Commons standing behind them bellowed
their approval at mention of the reform.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever degree of flash was lost from the pageant by the
Buckingham Palace decision to downsize was glitteringly compensated
for by the wives of the dukes, earls, marquesses, viscounts and
barons, appearing in larger numbers than anyone could recall, who
pressed onto the benches in silk and fur and family heirloom tiaras
and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The queen's speech, which is written by the government and read
by the monarch, disclosed 22 bills to be introduced covering the
National Health Service, food safety, immigration, youth justice,
trade union rights and welfare reform. The program, the queen said,
staring at her script from beneath the imperial state crown
surmounted by a diamond-encrusted Maltese Cross and orb, ``will
focus on the modernization of the country, its public services and
its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking omission was any commitment to freedom of
information legislation, something that has been promised since the
Labor Party was elected in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the speech was the government's resolve to force
passage of new voting procedures for coming elections to the
European Parliament, a measure the Lords defiantly sent back to
Commons five times this month. Prime Minister Tony Blair called
their performance ``an affront to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The peers, who have the power to delay but not defeat
legislation that has passed Commons, could still stall the European
elections bill for weeks with meddlesome amendments. They could
then proceed to tie up Parliament with objections to the bill to
banish the hereditary members, and thereby deny the government time
to pass its other priority bills dealing with health and education.
</P>
<P>
   There is no widespread public opposition to abolishing the
voting rights of hereditary peers, the 759 members of the Lords
whose titles, some dating back to the Norman Conquest, are passed
down from generation to generation. But there is concern over
Labor's failure to produce a plan for what will replace them.
</P>
<P>
   In the queen's speech on Tuesday, the government assigned the
job to a royal commission, a step as inconclusive and unconvincing
in Britain as referring problems to task force studies is in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hereditary peers are gone, the House will be made up of
512 life peers and 26 archbishops and bishops known as lords
spiritual. With that action, the government changes a body with an
overwhelming Conservative majority to one with a slight Tory edge.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents fear that with no agreed-upon plan in place, the
government could quickly stack the new body with its sympathizers
and end up with a reform that simply exchanges an unelected House
with a Conservative dominance to an unelected one with a built-in
Labor bias.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Tuesday's pageant unfolded, its slimmer dimensions weren't
immediately noticeable, a reminder that regal reform moves at a
stately pace. A reduction in the number of attendants to the queen
from 51 to 37 was barely noticeable; even if the silver stick in
waiting was gone, the gold stick in waiting remained.
</P>
<P>
   While black rod, dressed shoulder to stocking feet in black, no
longer marched in the royal procession, he went through his
traditional pantomime of knocking loudly on the door to the House
of Commons with his gold lion's head ebony stick after it had been
slammed in his face in the symbolic act representing the
parliamentarians' independence from the crown.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the queen's arrival at Westminster, uniformed
yeomen of the guard conducted their Gilbert and Sullivan search for
explosives in the lords' basement _ a throwback to the discovery of
the Gunpowder Plot in 1605.
</P>
<P>
   Led by parading soldiers of the Household Cavalry, the queen
rode from Buckingham Palace to Parliament in a gilded carriage
drawn by four Windsor Grays and guarded by coachmen in cockaded
hats who are still called bargemen because in the past the monarch
would make the passage by river. Separate carriages rattled along
the streets of London carrying velvet cushions bearing the imperial
state crown, the sword of state and the miniver-trimmed crimson cap
of maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Once seated in the House of Lords, she received the speech from
a ceremonial purse borne up the stairs to her throne by the lord
chancellor, Lord Irvine. In his second victory over cumbersome
protocol this month, Lord Irvine was permitted by the queen to
descend the stairs forward rather than in the more precarious
backward mode of his predecessors. He had earlier won the right to
wear suit trousers and polished black shoes instead of black tights
and buckled shoes when he serves as speaker of the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   No such relief awaited the earl marshal and lord great
chamberlain. As the queen and her procession moved out of the
chamber, they were retiring from the hall before her humbly _ and
very carefully, their backs turned to the exit and their faces
respectfully regarding their sovereign.

FCC SAYS SPRINT AND TELMEX OVERCHARGED ON SOME RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government said Tuesday that it had
received significant evidence that a joint venture created by
Sprint Corp. and Telefonos de Mexico, or Telmex, had committed
anticompetitive practices in the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Federal Communications Commission rejected the
venture's proposed rates that are charged to other long-distance
carriers. The agency also gave the venture 30 days to explain why
officials should not review its long-distance license.
</P>
<P>
   ``U.S. consumers have to pay much more than they should to reach
friends and relatives in Mexico,'' said FCC Chairman William
Kennard. ``The carriers have not moved quickly enough to bring
these rates down and ensure meaningful competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said the high rates affected ``the most vulnerable
consumers,'' recent Hispanic immigrants who used the service to
talk with friends and relatives back home.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint officials said the joint venture had been caught in a
struggle between U.S. and Mexican authorities, and that the
company's pricing had not been unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed by today's development,'' the company said
in a statement. ``The Telmex-Sprint Communications joint venture is
in the marketplace today, enjoying initial success because it
provides a service that Hispanic and other consumers want and need.
We are confident that neither any U.S. carrier nor the public
interest has been hurt by TSC's entry into the U.S. market.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Epstein, a lawyer in Washington representing Telmex, said
the venture had met all of the conditions of the license and that
the company would dispute the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture's license was approved three months ago over
the objections of the two biggest long- distance carriers in the
United States, AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom Inc. The high volume of calls
between the two countries has generated some $700 million last year
in payments to Telmex, far and away the largest payment overseas by
U.S. carriers.
</P>
<P>
   In granting the license, regulators had imposed a list of
conditions intended to keep the marketplace competitive. Officials
said Tuesday that those conditions had not been met, and they took
action following a new round of complaints by AT&AMP;T and MCI that the
joint venture remained fundamentally anticompetitive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the heart of the Tuesday's action are the rules and fees
governing the so-called settlement rate, the fees that phone
companies make to each other to complete calls. Settlement rates
have historically been set well above the cost of completing a
call, particularly in countries with less-developed economies or
powerful state-owned telephone monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that any reduction in the rates would be passed
on to consumers in the form of lower telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex had promised to lower the settlement rate to 19 cents a
minute by the beginning of the year 2000. The FCC approved the
19-cent rate but rejected the company's interim rates of 37.5 cents
for 1998 and 34.5 cents for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also described a variety of other anticompetitive
practices, such as a 58 percent surcharge levied by Telmex for
international calls made to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   While officials said that the proceeding initiated Tuesday might
not lead to the revocation of the venture's license, they expected
it would encourage significant changes that would open the market
to competitors of the Sprint-Telmex venture.

RENO REJECTS INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO INVESTIGATE GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno decided Tuesday against
seeking an independent counsel to investigate whether Vice
President Al Gore intentionally lied to federal officials during an
inquiry into his 1996 campaign fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   Calling evidence of wrong-doing ``insubstantial,'' Reno said
there ``are no reasonable grounds'' for further examination into
Gore's statements to FBI agents about his effort to solicit
campaign funds by telephone from his government office.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision not to launch an independent inquiry of Gore's
campaign fund-raising practices _ her second such decision in a
year involving the vice president _ heads off what could have been
an embarrassing probe of Gore as he gears up for a run for the
White House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The White House expressed relief and congressional Republicans
expressed outrage over the attorney general's decision, which she
outlined in a 19-page document filed with a three-judge federal
panel that oversees appointment of independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is conducting similar preliminary reviews
of alleged campaign finance irregularities involving President
Clinton and his former White House chief of staff, Harold Ickes.
Decisions by Reno on whether to seek outside investigators in those
cases are due in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton ``believes the
vice president has always acted within the letter and the spirit of
the law and that the news of today indicates this.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said, ``The vice president is
pleased that this preliminary review has been concluded without the
need for an independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican who chairs a House
committee that examined Democratic fund-raising practices, blasted
Reno's decision. ``This is a sad day for the rule of law,'' Burton
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether or not Janet Reno asks for independent counsels based
on three separate, preliminary inquiries really misses the point,''
Burton said. ``There should be one, single, independent counsel
named to investigate the entire set of questionable
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, echoed Burton's call for an independent inquiry and
suggested that Congress might ``need to take these matters out of
the hands of the attorney general, who appears to be acting
politically and not in accordance with the act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The improper placement of phone calls or misstatements to
investigators is not the issue here,'' Hatch said. ``What is at
stake is whether the public's confidence in the rule of law and the
integrity of the Department of Justice will be further eroded by
this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno dismissed critics' claims that her department has not
aggressively investigated charges against Clinton and Gore.
``Today's determination does not mean our work has ended,'' she
said. ``We will continue to vigorously investigate all allegations
of illegal activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, for more than two years, the Justice Department's
120-member Campaign Financing Task Force has been investigating
allegations of wrongdoing surrounding the 1996 elections,'' she
said. Investigators have ``traveled across the country and around
the world tracking down leads. Their work is paying off _ already
14 people have been charged.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Reno decided against launching an independent
investigation of telephone calls made by Gore after he said none of
the money he raised was for the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign,
which would make the funds ``hard money'' under federal law.
Instead, he told the FBI, his efforts were to raise ``soft money,''
which would be used for issues advertising by the Democratic Party.
Soliciting so-called ``soft money'' is not regulated by law.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Gore's private attorney delivered to the attorney
general a meeting memorandum bearing hand-written notes by a Gore
aide. The notes suggest that Gore could have known more about the
purposes of the money he agreed to raise. The notes also indicate
that a portion of what Gore was soliciting would be ``hard money,''
which federal law prohibits officials from soliciting while on
government property.
</P>
<P>
   The notes were ``not sufficient alone to warrant a conclusion
that the vice president made a false statement,'' Reno said, adding
that some meeting participates had vague and, in a few instances,
mistaken understandings of the complicated allocation of money Gore
was raising. And some said Gore did not concern himself with the
details of the uses made of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find by clear and convincing evidence that the vice
president did not lie,'' Reno said in her filing with the
three-judge panel. She added: ``I am unable to identify any
additional investigation that might reasonably be expected to
provide sufficient evidence to support a successful prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision not to seek an independent counsel in the
Gore case was the first of three Reno must make by Dec. 7. Under
the independent counsel statute, the attorney general has 90 days
to decide whether to go forward with an inquiry once a formal
review of an allegation is begun. The three-month period for Gore
ended Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, Reno must decide whether to seek appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate the case of Harold Ickes, a
former White House deputy chief of staff who ran the 1996
re-election campaign for President Clinton and Vice President Gore.
The attorney general's review focuses on whether Ickes lied to a
Senate committee about administration assistance to the Teamsters
during a strike against Diamond Walnut Co.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 7, Reno must decide whether to seek an outside counsel
to investigate whether President Clinton and his aides violated
federal law when they set up a multimillion-dollar advertising
campaign financed by the Democratic National Committee. Federal
rules limit such ad campaigns to generic party ads, but Federal
Election Commission auditors have said the ads directly supported
the Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Ickes have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has turned to six independent prosecutors to investigate
allegations against Clinton administration officials. Although the
Justice Department has conducted several preliminary reviews _ the
step prior to naming of an independent counsel _ Reno has never
allowed an outside counsel to review how the Democrats financed the
1996 campaign.

SOUNDS HEARD IN THE SHIMMERING BUBBLE OF THE PRESENT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While listening to David Robertson conduct the Juilliard
Orchestra recently in Gyorgy Ligeti's ``Atmospheres'' _ a
remarkable performance, by the way _ I started to understand
something of the difference between live and recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra got to that point where the sound becomes a kind
of buzzing, and here _ with the piece's dynamic variation projected
as strongly as its continuity, and the noise now quite loud _ the
effect vividly called to mind the composer's reference of his music
to a childhood dream: he was in bed, and his room was filled with a
spider's web in which candles, damp cushions and insects were all
held.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes in this dream, he recalled, a cushion would tumble,
the web would lurch, and some beetles would be set free for a
moment, only to get themselves caught up again and emit ``a
stifling buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   But the contact with Ligeti's dream was not the main point. What
struck me, as I tried to make out which instruments were
responsible for the whir of coleopterous doom, and why I had not
heard it quite like this before, was the immediacy of the sound. It
was not just this one passage that sounded new. The entire piece
had little connection with my previous experiences of it, nearly
all of which had come through recordings.
</P>
<P>
   My intent visual scanning of the orchestra at this point was a
clue. As mechanisms of sound reproduction improve, the day may come
when one cannot distinguish aurally between sitting in Avery Fisher
Hall (where this concert took place) and listening at home with
headphones, though that day is a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   And with DVD and its future developments, the time may come when
the impression of facing an orchestra can be reconstructed. But it
is hard to imagine the technology that would allow individual
watcher-listeners to use their eyes and ears with the range of
choices available in any concert hall: to fix attention on a
cellist's bowing, to scrutinize the field.
</P>
<P>
   Such an advance seems especially unlikely given that the whole
effort of people in the film and television industries is to do the
fixing of attention, the scrutinizing, for you. Few movies are
generous enough with visual information and with pace that one's
eyes can wander around and into the screen. This is one of the
things that make Andrei Tarkovsky's films so special.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the freedom to relate ear and eye, while the bassoon, as
I decided it principally was, droned with such agonizing intensity,
was only part of the issue. Perhaps Ligeti's dream was the next
clue, for it was a dream, as he himself recognized, about ``the
hopelessness of elapsing time and of a past that could never be
made good again.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the concert hall, time was indeed elapsing. But at home,
when you are listening to a record, it never is. The past of a
recording can always be made good again: all you have to do is
rewind the tape, press the start button another time.
</P>
<P>
   This is time that has already been experienced, music that has
already been heard. In the useful term of Claude Levi-Strauss,
recorded time is time ``cooked'': prepared not only by composers
and performers, as any music is, but also by producers and the
whole apparatus of the record business. Time in the concert hall is
time raw.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of freshness is one thing, but the psychological
difference goes deeper. Listening to a recording, one feels oneself
to be receiving an object with an almost tangible existence: a
length of recorded time. One can even check the precise length on
the back of the box. Hence the invitation to try to reconstruct
this object in one's head, to create an image of a shape, a form.
</P>
<P>
   That was what I thought ``Atmospheres'' was: a length of time
that I had more or less copied from one sort of memory (dots in
silver plastic) to another (brain cells).
</P>
<P>
   In the concert hall, though, there is no object being
transferred. A performance does not exist until it is happening,
and then it is gone again. Everything one hears is in the present,
and has to be seized in the present. Perceived time is thin, and
forever being renewed.
</P>
<P>
   As the brasses and woodwinds came forward with their diatonic
chord near the start of the piece, like a rainbow arcing out of
cloud, the moment moved into that bubble-thin, shimmering time of
perception with an immediacy that cannot be matched when one is
listening to a recording, which one knows to be repeatable, already
in the past, already a memory.
</P>
<P>
   If recordings give the effect of music as a sequence of events,
one after another, at a concert each event seems to flash on top of
the last. Music becomes vertical _ sound on sound on sound _ rather
than horizontal.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it needed a piece of relatively recent music to make
this clear. After all, the great effort of composers in the
classical tradition, from the Renaissance through the early 20th
century, was to create a horizontal effect: to suggest, by all the
musical means at their disposal, a continuity, to make the piece
seem indeed an object in time.
</P>
<P>
   Once this could be taken care of by recording, composers were
free to do other things with their time. Recordings may, by their
difference, have changed how concerts are experienced. If so, they
changed music by changing time.

WHERE THANKSGIVING GUESTS COME FOR PARADE-WATCHING, NOT DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By N.R. KLEINFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If things go the way they always seem to, something
like 2.5 million people will clog the streets to watch Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade on Thursday. Roughly 60 million more will
take in the festive event on television. And 90 of them will watch
it from the windows of Julie and David Tobey's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone reading this who is going to the Tobeys', they wanted
to point out that 8:30 a.m. will be plenty early enough. The parade
starts at 9, a couple of blocks north of their building. One year,
someone showed up at 7:45 and Julie Tobey was still in bed. It was
an entirely unnecessary inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   The Tobeys live in the San Remo apartment building on Central
Park West between 74th and 75th Streets. There are any number of
good reasons to be thankful one lives in the San Remo _ it's hard
to beat the neighborhood, and there's always a chance of seeing
Steve Martin or Steven Spielberg in the elevator _ but on
Thanksgiving, if one's apartment faces the park, the best reason is
an unimpeded view of the parade without being trampled and with
tastier food than the oversize pretzels sold by the street vendors.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has become a cherished holiday custom for dozens of
people who live in the San Remo, not to mention in so many of the
apartments lining the parade route along Central Park West, to have
relatives, friends and occasional interlopers converge on their
homes to witness the marching bands and majorettes and Barney.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the San Remo residents even got to admire one of
their own out there. Eugene Tonkonogy, who lives in the building,
marched in the parade for many years as a volunteer clown. He
relented three years ago. He decided he was too old. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   The Tobeys' party, continuous for 17 years, built onward and
upward slowly. The Tobeys have no children of their own. The first
year, the 8-year-old daughter of a friend asked if she could pretty
please come by to see the parade. She came with her parents. Three
people. She returned the following year, and brought some friends.
Ten people. Then the Tobeys invited some of their other friends.
Twenty-five people. Then other acquaintances started to call and
ask if they could come by. Ninety people. ``People bring their
grandparents,'' Ms. Tobey said. ``Or they bring their neighbors. Or
they borrow children.''
</P>
<P>
   On 364 days of the year, New Yorkers want to be as high up in a
building as possible. Today, for those in the San Remo, low is
best.
</P>
<P>
   Among the residents, there is a consensus, at least a consensus
among those who live on the seventh floor, that seven is pretty
much the perfect height. That is the height at which the balloons
float past. When Superman flies past, you can practically step out
your window and climb onto his back. The Tobeys feel seven is
unquestionably best. The Tobeys live on seven.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie and David Silverman have little doubt that three is
actually a much better floor. That's right, they live on three.
They moved into the San Remo 10 years ago with two young children.
Somehow it never occurred to them that the Thanksgiving Day parade
went directly past their windows. They were very abruptly made
aware of this when they were awakened their first Thanksgiving by
bands that sounded as if they were bounding through their living
room. ``After that, we realized that it was sort of our obligation
to have a parade party,'' Ms. Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are ostensibly for the children, but the critical
word is ostensibly. Kathy and James Goodman, who live on seven,
used to invite all the classmates of their daughter, Laura, each
Thanksgiving, which naturally also meant siblings and those dreaded
escorts known as parents. After fourth grade, Laura's interest in
Big Bird and Kermit began to flag. Now that she has started
college, it is nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother's appreciation of the parade, however, remains
strong. Hence the Goodmans continue to invite friends over, though
the quantity has diminished to about two dozen from more than 100
in past years. Among the regulars is a woman who grew up in the
apartment but now lives on the 24th floor, where the parade might
be best enjoyed with the Hubble telescope. ``Laura will be here,
too,'' Ms. Goodman said, ``but she'll probably sleep through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman finds it difficult to relax entirely during these parade
parties, which is understandable. Being art dealers, the Goodmans
have a fair amount of art on display in the apartment. Particularly
fragile pieces are stowed away, but much of it remains where it
always is. Yet nothing has ever been damaged, and one year there
were 120 people.
</P>
<P>
   The one clear reminder of the event is on the windows.
``Thousands of tiny handprints, greasy ones, on all the windows
throughout the apartment,'' Ms. Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the genuinely gratifying things about having a crowd over
to watch the parade is that often you get to meet people you had
never expected to meet. Invitees mention to their own friends where
they are going, and suddenly those friends are in the back seat
going, too. One year, someone took Pepe Navarro, known as the David
Letterman of Spain, to visit the Tobeys, who found him rather
interesting. Another year a Welsh cabaret singer came with someone
or other, and willingly sang for an hour after the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the guests are mixed up. One year there were three
people wandering around the apartment of the Silvermans, who invite
only people they know. He thought they were her friends. She
thought they were his friends. Actually, they were supposed to be
going to a party on five. By the time they figured that out, they
decided to just stay where they were. ``They were lovely people,''
Ms. Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, a few San Remo residents with unbeatable views have had to
forgo their tradition this year. Mady and Sandy Harman live on the
second floor, with a normally exquisite view of the parade. This
year, however, scaffolding to enable waterproofing work has been
erected outside the building and it completely blocks their
windows.
</P>
<P>
   And so when the 50 or so people who normally came to the
Harmans' party began calling this year, they were advised that
there would be nothing to come to.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harman is having her brother over with his wife and three
children, but she doesn't know how they will see the parade. She
asked an upstairs neighbor if the Harman party could go there, but
was told the neighbor already had too many people. The Harmans and
their guests might have to watch it on television.
</P>
<P>
   After being hosts to a battalion of parade-watchers, the San
Remo dwellers often have to tidy up hurriedly for the second shift,
their guests for Thanksgiving dinner. Some residents, however,
simply don't have the stamina. ``By the time the parade people
leave, I'm ready to collapse,'' Ms. Tobey said. ``Thank God,
someone always invites us to their place for dinner.''

COMMENTARY: TICK, TICK, T... 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The day after they broadcast a tape of Dr. Jack
Kevorkian killing a terminally ill 52-year-old man by lethal
injection, Don Hewitt, the executive producer of ``60 Minutes,''
and Mike Wallace, who reported the story, sat in Hewitt's office on
West 57th Street in Manhattan watching one of their many critics
hold forth on TV. Howard Kurtz was making the point on CNN that had
``60 Minutes'' not aired the tape, Kevorkian ``simply would not
have gotten the same attention.'' Though the remark was not meant
as a compliment, Hewitt and Wallace vigorously nodded their heads
in approval, taking it as one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no story without the tape,'' Wallace said. ``You'd
have a lot of talking heads, which can be fascinating, but just
look at how the whole country has focused on it now. Every radio
talk show is talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rap on Hewitt and Wallace is that they pumped up ratings
during the all-important November sweeps with the ultimate
sacrilege: death as entertainment. They argue that their
perennially top-rated show (it had been No. 8 the week before) has
no history of sweeps whoring, and that they were reporting
legitimate news, even as they recognized that Kevorkian is, in
Wallace's words, ``a publicity seeker ... a zealot, fanatic,
whatever.'' He added that he had initially not been keen on the
story. ``As soon as I heard the word `Kevorkian,' I thought _,''
Wallace said, ending the sentence with a gagging noise. ``He's
shopworn. I've seen the act before. Why in the world could I
possibly be interested?'' What persuaded him was the tape.
</P>
<P>
   And I must say the tape persuaded me, too. It is not
entertaining like the crime carnage of local news, nor is it
terrifying like the Pulitzer Prize photo of the South Vietnamese
police commander executing a Vietcong soldier in 1968. It is
upsetting, and forces you to stop and think. It thrust me back to a
chilling moment I had had, a moment many Americans have had, when a
doctor quietly asked a leading question about the ``quality of
life'' of a hospitalized loved one who could live on indefinitely.
The ``60 Minutes'' piece presented a man crippled by Lou Gehrig's
disease who still had his own waning chance to answer this question
himself, and chose death with the approval of his wife and brother
_ who gave their own testimony to Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Courts can and should judge Kevorkian's role in all this; they
must rise to his taunts and determine if he's a criminal
manipulator of the terminally ill. But it is not so easy to condemn
Thomas Youk, the man who turned to him in desperation, or to
dismiss the words of his family. Not if you can imagine yourself or
anyone you love in his or their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   In a culture where oral sex has joined graphic violence as
routine fare, candor about terminal illness and death is still
often taboo. Though ``60 Minutes'' has had its debacles _ its
tobacco retreat of '95 and the recent Kathleen Willey botch _ this
piece wasn't one of them. Its sober account of a man's final
breath, not the nadir of taste in TV's Springerland, did provoke
the entire country into talking openly about the right to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going on right now in every hospital in New York,'' said
Hewitt of assisted suicide and euthanasia, with only a touch of
hyperbole. Whatever is going on, it's often shrouded in whispers
and secrecy. Honest debate, which can lead to sensible regulation
of managed-death scenarios now exercised covertly, is desperately
needed _ even if its catalyst is Kevorkian, yet another one of
those American flakes (remember Madalyn Murray O'Hair?) who
habitually push the most inflammatory moral questions onto the
national radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Wallace, who is 80, if he had any personal thoughts
about these questions, should he find himself in the situation of a
Thomas Youk. ``Would I want this for myself? Absolutely,'' he
answered. ``Instead of having some stranger come in and assist me
with suicide, I'd like to say to a doctor who was a friend, who
knew me, `Enough _ help me.''' Wallace added that he wasn't
advocating any position in his piece, and I think its
straightforward presentation of Kevorkian's ghoulish self-promotion
bears him out. If anything, ``60 Minutes'' may finally speed the
trial of Dr. Death for murder, which, whatever the verdict, can
only be a spur to a frank, humane and long-overdue national
conversation about the boundaries of life.

 &HT;    Heavy hitters go to bat for Jackson
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S. C. _ Since the time Shoeless Joe Jackson was
banished from organized baseball, campaigns to clear his name have
been mounted, reached feverish peaks, then faded away. This time
it's different. This time it's in a serious state.
</P>
<P>
   It begins centuries, well, decades ago. After Shoeless Joe had
been set down with seven of his Chicago White Sox mates for
allegedly consorting with gamblers in the 1919 World Series, he had
played his way through semipro leagues, operated a dry cleaning
shop in Savannah, managed bush league teams, then had come home to
Brandon Mill village, where he grew up. A few doors down the street
lived this lad who delivered his afternoon paper, raked his lawn
and occasionally swung at his pitches when Joe dropped in on the
game they were playing down the street. The kid's name was John
Burgess.
</P>
<P>
   Monday evening, John Burgess and a few of his close, personal
friends gathered in the Poinsett Club to keynote the latest
campaign to right the Shoeless Joe injustice. Now, the Poinsett
Club is about as far from Brandon Mill as Harvard is from Sul Ross.
John Burgess has prospered as a manufacturer, and while he had no
idea of the prominence of the man whose papers he delivered and
whose pitches he swung at on the sandlot as a kid, as an adult he
does.
</P>
<P>
   For this occasion, he spared no expenses. Tommy Lasorda flew in
to preside. Ted Williams appeared by two-way video. The newly
elected governor, Jim Hodges, announced his support. The outgoing
governor, not to be outdone, announced he was making a special
award to Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   For Tommy, this was a homecoming of sorts. It was here, as a
young pitcher, that he met his bride, Jo, and one corner of the
room was filled with her kin. It was a big ballroom, every table
occupied, including a lot of old-time players, Alvin Dark, Lou
Brissie, Billy O'Dell, Bobby Bolen, Don Buddin, John Buzhardt and
Sonny Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I've seen that many judges was at Olympic figure
skating. Congressmen, state legislators, sheriffs and every kind of
public official, including the mayor, Knox White. The president of
Furman University, Dr. David Shi, was there, and his football
coach, Bobby Johnson, in a state where coaches are living
perilously these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for us to get together and put Joe Jackson in the
Hall of Fame,'' Lasorda said, delivering the evening's theme.
</P>
<P>
   Highlight, though, was Williams, ``The Splendid Splinter,'' a
member of the Hall of Fame Veterans Committee who has picked up the
cudgel and spoken out for Shoeless Joe. And few can wield a cudgel
and speak out more forcefully than Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He flashed onto the screen to deafening applause, sitting in an
easy chair at his place in Citrus Hills, Fla. Lasorda had just
preceded him with, ``It's the bottom of the ninth. Who's up? Ted
Williams!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I look better on screen than in real life,'' he said, for
openers. He did look better than expected, strong of voice, and he
got through the whole spiel without a profanity, a new turn in his
elocution. ``I just hope these players and all you people will join
in our cause and see that an injustice can be rectified. His debt
has been paid and it's time for the commissioner's office to
reinstate him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a sensitive issue, in view of Pete Rose and his
non-status, but Williams has recruited some strong names, including
his old wing pilot in the Korean War, John Glenn. Fritz Hollings,
the senator, messaged his backing, as has nearly every South
Carolina senator before him.
</P>
<P>
   It's a provincial thing. Shoeless Joe is one of their own. He
made no attempt at reinstatement, never visited commissioner
Landis, wrote his congressman or filed a suit. He took it silently,
went on with his life and had no regrets, as he told me when I
wrote his story of the Black Sox Scandal 50 years ago. Of course,
whatever becomes of this, he'll never know. Shoeless Joe died in
1951.

 &HT;    Oliver takes himself off Auburn list
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Speculation grew Tuesday that Tommy Tuberville of
Mississippi will be Auburn's next football coach, after interim
coach Bill Oliver withdrew his name from consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's withdrawal leaves the list of candidates at three:
Tuberville, Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary and Temple coach
Bobby Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   One report Tuesday from Alabama said Tuberville, 44, will be
offered the job as early as Friday, the day after Mississippi ends
its regular season at Mississippi State. The report said that
Tuberville will be offered a compensation package that exceeds $1
million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville has refused to comment on the reports, except to say
that speculation surrounding his future was blown ``way out of
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, 59, who had been the defensive coordinator, took over as
interim Auburn coach on Oct. 23 when Terry Bowden resigned with the
team at 1-5. Oliver coached Auburn to a 2-3 record, including a
season-ending 31-17 loss to Alabama on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver had expressed a strong desire to become the permanent
coach, which was one of his lifelong goals. But over the past 10
days, as Auburn pursued Tuberville, it became apparent that he
would not get the job.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver said he made his decision to withdraw some time after the
loss to Alabama.

<P>
   ``At my age, I just can't look in the mirror and justify to
myself that I can do for these players what a younger coach can do
for them,'' Oliver said. ``I can't say that after a year the fire
will still be (there).''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver's chance to become coach might have been hurt by a media
story that accused him of undermining Bowden and orchestrating his
ouster, which Oliver has denied strongly. Tuberville became coach
at Ole Miss on Dec. 1, 1994. Two months later, the Rebels were
placed on a two-year probation that cost them 26 scholarships. Even
so, the 1997 team went 8-4 and beat Marshall in the Motor City
Bowl. He was named SEC coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberville last year turned down $900,000 to become coach at
Arkansas. In his four seasons at Ole Miss, the Rebels are 25-19
overall, 12-19 in the SEC.

 &HT;    Georgia Southern gets ready _ again _ for I-AA playoffs
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been business as usual this week for Georgia
Southern coach Paul Johnson. Just as he did during the regular
season, Johnson clicks on the light in his office at 5:30 a.m. A
few minutes later, he is viewing film.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles' second-year head coach is not leaving anything to
chance, as he prepares his top-ranked team for an opening round
game in the I-AA playoffs against 16th-seeded Colgate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's down to a one-game season, and we've got to be ready to
play,'' Johnson said, who hopes that his players are as focused as
he is heading into the 1 p.m. game Saturday in Paulson Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southern (11-0), winner of four Division I-AA national
championships, has a home playoff record of 17-0. The Eagles hope
it will be an advantage against Colgate (8-3), which averaged 35.5
points and 477.5 yards in total offense as a member of the Patriot
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we played hard for all year -- the chance to play
at home,'' said Johnson, who guided the Eagles to their second
Southern Conference title in a row. ``History has shown that
(Paulson Stadium) has been very good to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Colgate is led offensively by junior quarterback Ryan Vena and
senior receiver Corey Hill. The pair is sure to challenge the
Eagles' secondary, one of the weaknessess on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Vena, a 6-0, 195-pound junior, has hit 58.3 percent of his
passes for 2,298 yards and 16 touchdowns and has rushed for 736
yards. Hill, a 5-11, 186-pound senior, has 71 catches for 1,267
yards and 11 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Vena ``can make plays, so we've got to be concerned about him,''
Johnson said. ``And (Hill) is a good receiver. In fact, they're a
solid football team.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Georgia Southern, which gained its 10th playoff appearance
behind a potent one-two offensive punch of its own. Junior
quarterback Greg Hill has rushed for 1,061 yards and 16 touchdown.
He also has completed 58.8 percent of his passes for 108 yards a
game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles' most awesome weapon has been fullback Adrian
Peterson, the first freshman in NCAA Division I history to rush for
more than 1,900 yards. Peterson, a 5-10, 207-pound native of
Alachua, Fla., will face Colgate after gaining 1,932 yards and
scoring a national freshman record of 25 touchdowns.

 &HT;    Star QB has done it all at Tech, except beating archrival
Georgia
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Junior quarterback Joe Hamilton has won a Carquest
Bowl MVP trophy, is on the brink of a first-team All-ACC selection,
and has helped Georgia Tech get its first New Year's Day bowl
invitation since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is Tech's most valuable player and a proven winner. But
something's missing. Like it or not, Hamilton will be judged by
whether he leads Tech to a win over Georgia. ``They'll probably put
an asterisk by my name to say, `He never beat Georgia,' '' Hamilton
conceded. ``Georgia people will say, `He may have done this and
that, but he could never beat us.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Hamilton committed to Georgia Tech, he has been
compared with former Yellow Jackets standout Shawn Jones. With two
games left in his junior year, those comparisons have all but
stopped, as Hamilton has carved out his own quarterback niche. But
he'd love to have one important reason to bring up the Jones talk
again: Jones is the last Georgia Tech quarterback to beat Georgia,
his sophomore season in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe's certainly capable of winning a game like that,'' said
offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen, who coached both at Tech.
``Shawn won the big games. Joe has won some big games, but that's
still there for him, too. What's left for Joe is to beat Florida
State and Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's first big win came against Virginia this season,
putting Tech in position to accomplish two of its three team goals
this season: win the ACC _ the Yellow Jackets were co-champions
with FSU, despite losing to the Seminoles _ and make a New Year's
Day bowl. Now he's going after the third _ beating Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Leading up to the Virginia game, Friedgen got in Hamilton's ear,
challenging him by saying he couldn't win the big ones. Friedgen
said he didn't plan to do that this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell Joe to play his game,'' Friedgen said. ``If
he does that, things will happen for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton doesn't want this game perceived as his own personal
issue; he just wants a win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would mean a lot,'' Hamilton said. ``Even if the first play
of the game I'd have to go out with an injury, I'd celebrate just
as well. If we get a win 2-0 or 1-0, all you want is a win. It'll
be so exciting, you want to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in the low country of South Carolina in the tiny town
of Alvin, Hamilton wasn't even much of a Clemson or South Carolina
fan. He knew hardly anything about the Georgia Tech-Georgia
rivalry. But once he arrived on campus as a redshirt freshman in
1995, he was a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was talking about (how) the big game is Georgia, we
have to beat Georgia,'' Hamilton said. ``Then I saw how bad it
hurts to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   He felt it as he watched from the sideline of Bobby Dodd Stadium
his redshirt year when Georgia beat Tech with Kanon Parkman's
wobbly, last-minute field goal, 18-17.
</P>
<P>
   He was feeling two kinds of pain the next year, 1996, when a
sprained ankle cosh him his first opportunity to start against
Georgia. Hamilton's initial appearance in the rivalry came that
day, in the desperate final minutes of Tech's 19-10 loss in Sanford
Stadium after backup Brandon Shaw left with an injury of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in Hamilton's first start of the series, he brought
Tech its closest to beating Georgia since 1990. He had 276 yards
passing, 55 yards rushing and one fumble on the Georgia goal line.
He figures he's got to do more on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play mistake-free football, play to the best of
your abilities, pray for some luck and refuse to lose,'' Hamilton
said. ``Right now, they've got a lot of confidence (and think) that
it's hard for us to beat them. It's our job to try to turn that
around.''
</P>
<P>
   By coming so close last year, before losing on the final drive,
Hamilton might be that much more hungry. He watched the drive in
anguish while standing on the bench on Tech's sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that moment of time when we scored to when they scored,
that's the loudest I've ever heard it,'' Hamilton said. ``(It gives
you) the feeling that you want to get a win for the community,
everybody around the program.''

 &HT;    Similarities reign in upcoming UGA-Ga. Tech match
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Both defenses have been criticized for
surrendering too many yards, but Georgia and Georgia Tech enter
Saturday's game among the best in their conferences in points
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Their ability to stop the other's high-powered offense will be
the key when they meet in Georgia's Sanford Stadium. Last year,
Georgia Tech was allowing an ACC-worst average of more than 418
yards before the Georgia game. This year, despite making some
strides under first-year defensive coordinator Randy Edsall, the
Yellow Jackets have cut that number by only 20 yards and still rank
eighth in the conference. ``It's just like our defense,'' Georgia
coach Jim Donnan said. ``Factually, they've given up a lot of yards
and a lot of points. But they haven't had to worry about that
because their offense is scoring so many points.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, led by quarterback Quincy Carter and receiver Champ
Bailey, has struggled to score in recent weeks. In their last three
games, the Bulldogs have scored just one second-half touchdown. The
Dogs have battled injuries on the offensive line _ All-America left
tackle Matt Stinchcomb missed last week's game against Mississippi,
and starting center Miles Luckie probably will be out against Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia also has committed a lot of turnovers, losing three of
nine fumbles and throwing five interceptions in the last three
games. In last year's 27-24 win at Georgia Tech, the Bulldogs'
offense was its own worst enemy. Quarterback Mike Bobo threw
interceptions on two of the first five drives, and the Yellow
Jackets stopped the Bulldogs twice on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, (Georgia Tech) had some similar problems on
defense, but we couldn't put them away,'' Donnan said. ``We had
every opportunity to put them away, but we couldn't do it. Their
defense rose up on a couple of short-yardage situations and they
stopped us inside the 20-yard line once with an interception. They
did a good job of stopping us last year, but we stopped ourselves,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets' improvement on defense this season has been
against the pass. Last year, opponents threw for more than 350
yards in four games against Tech's secondary, including 489 by both
Florida State and Duke and 415 by Georgia. This season, the Jackets
had not surrendered more than 330 yards passing until Wake Forest
threw for 494 in last week's 63-35 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The difference has been in the pass rush provided by senior
defensive ends Jesse Tarplin and Nate Stimson. Tarplin, a 6-foot-3,
250-pounder from Cross Keys High, has nine sacks, nearly double his
total from last season. Sophomore Felipe Claybrooks, who had two
sacks in some 40 plays against the Demon Deacons, is Tech's best
pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are still in the secondary, despite the presence of
free safety Travares Tillman, whom Donnan calls ``one of the better
players we will play against.'' Both cornerbacks, Louisville
transfer Jamara Clark (5-8) and senior Jason Bostic (5-9), must
contend with height disadvantages against Georgia receivers Bailey
(6-1), Tony Small (6-2) and Michael Greer (5-10).

IN INTERVIEW, STARR SAYS CONTROL OF TRIPP TOO LAX
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who has
recommended that Congress impeach President Clinton, has
acknowledged that his investigators should have kept closer watch
on Linda Tripp, the government employee whose furtive tape
recordings precipitated the criminal investigation of the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have had better control of her,'' Starr
declared in an interview with ABC News to be broadcast Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   While yielding to second-guessing over his control of Ms. Tripp,
his main witness, Starr repeated his insistence, made before
Congress, that his office ``had no indication whatsoever'' that Ms.
Tripp, following her interview with prosecutors, would immediately
brief lawyers for Paula Corbin Jones about Monica Lewinsky's taped
accounts of a sexual affair with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The president's flat denial of misconduct with Ms. Lewinsky in
the Jones suit triggered Starr's investigation and eventual
recommendation that the president be impeached for perjury and
obstruction of justice. Clinton's defenders suspect collusion
between the Jones lawyers in the civil case and the independent
counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   In denying this, Starr, his impeachment recommendation against
the president aside, said he found Clinton to be ``extraordinarily
talented, wonderfully empathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he inspires just tremendous affection and loyalty by,
you know, a wide range of people,'' said Starr, whose investigators
have spent 10 months vetting many of Clinton's loyalists in trying
to build a case against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News released excerpts of what it said was an ``exclusive
in-depth'' interview with Diane Sawyer on ``20/20 Wednesday.'' The
full transcript was not released, just enough to lure viewers for
the interview with Starr, who told Congress last week, ``We go to
court and not on the talk show circuit.'' ABC said Starr was not
paid for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question, Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly
III, said that Starr felt that, having testified publicly before
Congress, it was appropriate for him to conduct selective news
interviews. ``But we're not going to do a road show,'' Bakaly said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr made no observations about whether the questions he
fielded were fair, even when he was asked about his own sex life
and criticism that he was ``self-righteous, sanctimonious.'' He
denied any wrongdoing as flatly as any other Washington denizen has
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer to the big question is no, I have not been
unfaithful to my spouse,'' Starr declared. ``I'm not trying to pat
myself on the back, but I've tried to live by what I believe is my,
my obligation and my responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sawyer followed up with, ``People wonder if you understand
human frailty.'' Starr responded, ``I've got plenty of frailties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lying under oath, and encouraging lies under oath, does go to
the very heart and soul of what courts do,'' Starr said when Ms.
Sawyer asked what would happen ``if Bill Clinton is allowed to get
away with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Perjury must not be tolerated in the courts, Starr said. ``We do
not want junior high students and high school students to in any
way say there is anything other than zero tolerance for knowing
untruthfulness in court.''

 &HT;    Early detection of diabetes urged
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Screening and treating adults earlier for Type 2 diabetes would
reduce its most severe complications and result in a better quality
of life, but not a longer life, a study by the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention found.
</P>
<P>
   A computer analysis published today in the Journal of the
American Medical Association found that detecting diabetes earlier
in its onset would reduce the likelihood of kidney failure during a
patient's lifetime by 26 percent, blindness by 35 percent and foot
or leg amputation by 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Using what is known as ``opportunistic'' screening _ adding a
diabetes blood test onto an already scheduled doctor's visit _ on
average found diabetes 5.5 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   However, such a strategy also ends up costing more in health
care dollars, not less, said Dr. Michael Engelgau, CDC medical
epidemiologist. Screening and treating those age 25 and older now
for diabetes instead of waiting until age 45 _ the current
guideline _ would cost about $4,500 more over a person's lifetime,
Engelgau said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some cost reductions from the decrease or delaying
complications, but in the end, it's not a net savings,'' Engelgau
said. ``You actually spend a little bit more on the screening, and
the treatment begins earlier. But you're getting a better value for
your money. It's an improved quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Type 2 diabetes, or adult-onset diabetes, has increased in the
past decade to record numbers among Americans, particularly among
minority groups. About 16 million Americans are estimated to have
the disease. However, up to 5.3 million may not be aware of it
because its symptoms often go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, caused by an inability to properly process glucose,
is usually treated with exercise, a change in diet, and,
oftentimes, medications. Not catching and treating the disease
early can lead to kidney failure, dialysis, blindness, nerve damage
and possible amputation.
</P>
<P>
   While it's been widely assumed that detecting and treating Type
2 diabetes earlier would prove beneficial for individuals and for
the health care system at large, that theory had never been tested.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the CDC researchers used 10,000 hypothetical
patients, breaking them into groups by age to measure health care
costs over a lifetime. It compared costs and disease complications
between those who were screened beginning at age 25 and those
detected through current practice.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly any difference was noted in the longevity of the two
groups; those screened earlier lived only one week longer than
those screened later. African-Americans benefited the most from the
early screening.

 &HT;    Powerchicks and other birds
 &HT;    By Richard L. Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens when Powerchicks meet Dirty Birds?
</P>
<P>
   We're not sure it'll be pretty, but at least it'll be on
national TV. So says Matt Towery, who on Tuesday, promised Buzz
that his Dec. 8 appearance on ABC's ``Politically Incorrect With
Bill Maher'' will promote more than his new book, ``Powerchicks:
How Women Will Dominate America.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll also be braggin' on an old love, the red-hot Atlanta
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna wear some sort of Falcons jersey on the air,'' said
Towery, 39, an Atlanta native who started going to games in 1966.
``They've been losing for so many years, and now that they're
finally winning, I want the rest of America to know that we've got
the best football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Already in its second printing, ``Powerchicks'' could make
Towery one of Atlanta's better-known authors _ and not just because
Tom Wolfe has finally left town. The former state legislator and
occasional Las Vegas stand-up comedian swears he won't forget the
Falcons on ``Correct,'' a late-night current events talk show with
a comical bent. He may even dance for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do the `Dirty Bird' and if Bill Maher asks me to do it
on the air,'' Towery pledged, ``I will.''

 &HT;    Consumer group brands 20 items as risky for kids
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some teething rings could be dangerous to a baby's
health, and other toys on the market pose choking hazards for young
children, according to the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual survey of dangerous toys, released Tuesday, the
nonprofit consumer group cited 20 examples of items it thinks
should be discontinued or carry more prominent warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Consumer Product Safety Commission has banned small
toys and parts for children under 3, PIRG says manufacturers
circumvent the law by labeling the items for older kids, even
though they might have play value for a younger child.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some products are poorly labeled and retailers sell
toys with outdated warnings, according to PIRG.
</P>
<P>
   The teething rings appear on the group's trouble list because
they contain ``pthalates,'' substances that PIRG says can cause
liver and kidney problems and reproductive abnormalities. Specific
teethers named include the Baby Looney Tunes Cooling Ring by
Gerber, the Cool Ring Teether by First Years, the Funny Face
Teether Rattle and Disney Babies Mickey Collection by Playskool and
the Sof'Sport Teether and the Sports Fan Water Teether, both by
Safety First.
</P>
<P>
   Kirpal Singh, PIRG's campaign director, said the group wants the
use of pthalates banned, particularly in products aimed at children
under 3, because they are toxic. The group based its recommendation
on tests commissioned by Greenpeace, an environmental organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Toy Manufacturers of America, which represents more than 300
toy producers and importers, disputed the claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked at the research and the allegations. The toys are
safe. Period,'' said Terri Bartlett, TMA's communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, PIRG sends surveyors to stores to check out toys.
Their findings form the basis of its report. PIRG hopes the report
will help educate parents about toy hazards, encourage the industry
to make safer products and, ultimately, lead to stronger laws and
regulations about toy safety.
</P>
<P>
   But the toy industry is not impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very interesting that the media gets a list
before the industry gets a list. I really question their
motivation,'' Bartlett said, calling PIRG's pre-holiday news
conference an ``annual ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   TMA also accused PIRG and other ``self-appointed watchdog
individuals and groups'' of alarming consumers when no real danger
exists.

RENO SEES NO CAUSE TO INVESTIGATE GORE FUND RAISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno Tuesday said there were
no ``reasonable grounds'' to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate Vice President Al Gore's fund-raising activities,
removing a potential hurdle in his bid for the presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the evidence was ``clear and convincing'' that Gore
did not lie to FBI agents investigating the legality of
fund-raising telephone calls he made from his West Wing office at
the White House during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the evidence fails to provide any reasonable support
for a conclusion that the vice president may have lied,'' Reno
wrote in a 19-page filing to a three-judge appeals court panel. ``I
also find a lack of evidence to reasonably support a conclusion
that he may have had a motive'' to lie.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Reno has rejected an independent counsel
to investigate Gore, and she previously has resisted pressure to
ask for a special prosecutor to examine Democratic fund-raising
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's determination does not mean that our work has ended,''
Reno said in a statement. Referring to the work of the Justice
Department 120-member Campaign Financing Task Force, she said: ``We
will continue to vigorously investigate all allegations of illegal
activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next two weeks, Reno must decide whether an independent
counsel is warranted to investigate campaign fund-raising issues
involving President Clinton and former White House deputy chief of
staff Harold Ickes. She is expected to reject a special counsel for
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But her review of Gore had broad political implications, with
analysts predicting that the decision could narrow the field of
Democratic candidates considering challenging him for the party's
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was attending a staff meeting in the West Wing when he
got the news of Reno's decision, had a ``muted, modulated''
reaction, said one of his aides. ``There were no cartwheels,'' the
aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane: ``The vice president is
pleased that his preliminary review has been concluded without the
need for an independent counsel. Vice President Gore will continue
focusing on what he has been doing _ working with the president to
prepare America for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision brought swift and angry reaction from Capitol
Hill, mostly among Republicans who have been calling for an
independent counsel to investigate the Clinton adminstration's
fund-raising practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad, day for the rule of law,'' said Representative
Dan Burton of Indiana, chairman of the House committee
investigating campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona and possible
presidential candidate, said Reno ``blatantly disregarded'' the
recommendations of FBI Director Louis Freeh and US Attorney Charles
LaBella to request the appointment of a special prosecutor to
investigate Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very hard to refute suspicions in this town that
this was a political decision, not one based on the merits,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was whether Gore lied to FBI agents investigating the
legality of fund-raising calls he made from his office to help pay
for a media campaign run by the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he believed he was soliciting ``soft money,'' or
unregulated contributions to the party, and that the media campaign
was being paid for only with soft money, which turned out to be
false.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, after a 90-day preliminary review, Reno decided
not to seek an independent counsel to examine Gore's telephone
solictations, concluding that the 45 calls he made from the White
House in 1995 and 1996 were not in violation of the federal law
that bans political fund-raising on federal property. She said the
law applied only to federally regulated contributions known as
``hard money'' while Gore thought he was soliciting unregulated
contributions or ``soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno reopened the question in August when the Justice
Department obtained a memo that seemed to suggest Gore knew he was
solicting hard money. The memo, from a Democratic National
Committee budget meeting on Nov. 21, 1995,t hat Gore attended,
included handwritten notes by David Strauss, who was then a Gore
aide. The notes said the fund-raising would be ``65 percent soft,
35 percent hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In her decision Tuesday, Reno said the handwritten notes alone
were not sufficient to conclude that the vice president made a
false statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the vice president was present at the meeting, there is
no evidence that he heard the statements or understood their
implications, so as to suggest the falsity of his statement two
years later that he believed the media fund was entirely soft
money,'' Reno wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She said she reached her conclusion based on interviews that
investigators conducted with the 15 people who attended the DNC
meeting, plus documents and depositions from previous congressional
and Justice Department task force inquiries on campaign
fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said none of the people who attended the meeting recalled
any particular questions or comments by Gore about the financing of
the media campaign. One attendee said Gore did not often get into
``that level of detail.'' Reno also said Strauss was unable to say
whether the references in his notes to soft and hard money were
about the media fund, the DNC's operating budget or something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor does anyone recall the vice president asking any question
or making any comments at the meeting about the media fund, much
less questions or comments indicating an understanding of the issue
of the blend of hard and soft money needed for DNC media
expenditures,'' Reno wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is thus only weak circumstantial evidence of the vice
president's knowledge _ his presence at a meeting where the subject
was briefly discussed _ which I do not believe provides reasonable
grounds to belive that further investigation of this matter is
warranted,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said the decision will make Gore, who is
already considered the front-runner for his party's presidential
nomination, even tougher to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end it might just give him unfettered control over the
nomination for the Democrats,'' said Mark Rozell, a political
scientist with the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nomination now becomes his to lose,'' said James A.
Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential
Studies at American University. ``One way to lose it would have
been to have an ongoing investigation about how he solicited funds
and have to go through that Chinese water torture test.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Reno's decision will make it harder for other
Democratic candidates to compete against Gore, saying, ``it's bad
news'' for Senators John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and Bob Kerrey
of Nebraska, who are weighing presidential bids.

PEPPERDINE LAW SCHOOL PUTS THE BIBLE IN THE COURTROOM  
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By William Glaberson   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ A towering cross dominates the sweeping
hillside of the Pepperdine University campus here, perched in the
Santa Monica Mountains north of Los Angeles with a view of the
glittering Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The cross is a symbol of the University's commitment to
Christian values and nowhere is that more evident than at the
Pepperdine School of Law, an institution that is proudly at the
edge of mainstream legal thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's public courtship of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr to be dean of its law school has brought unprecedented
attention to the school, which is one of a handful of law schools
that say their mission is to incorporate the values of Jesus Christ
into the law, and are working to influence legal thought
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But a visit to the law school, while Starr's congressional
testimony is making news in Washington, offers a look at the
conservative Christian legal community that can claim both Starr
and Pepperdine. Pepperdine's students and professors described a
Christian approach to the law that some of them said was designed
to combat the amorality of the American legal system. With lawyers
perceived widely as dishonest opportunists and with public opinion
polls traditionally ranking the legal profession near the bottom in
integrity, some people at Pepperdine said, a more spiritual
approach to legal education seemed justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just here to learn to be attorneys but to learn to
be virtuous attorneys both in our performance and in our hearts,''
said one third-year student, LeAllen Frost, from Duncan, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Often in conversations here, Starr was cited as an example of a
moral lawyer while Clinton's legalistic distinctions were used an
examples of strategies that Christian lawyers should reject. ``At
Pepperdine,'' said Jennifer Vanse, a second-year student, ``they
teach you: `Don't try and get off on your little technicalities.'''
</P>
<P>
   Liberals and conservatives both criticized Starr's plan in 1997
to resign as the independent counsel to take up an academic life at
Pepperdine. After at first delaying his arrival, Starr said last
spring that he would not come here at all.
</P>
<P>
   At the law school, the only one in the country affiliated with
the Churches of Christ denomination, professors cover all the usual
law school material and then they add another dimension. The
Churches of Christ is a theologically conservative denomination,
which historically has discouraged drinking, smoking and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer's morality, said Douglas W. Kmiec, a Pepperdine
professor, can be as important to clients as a solid knowledge of
the statutes and court decisions. ``If you're going to hold
yourself out as a counselor giving people advice,'' he said, ``you
can't give incomplete advice.''
</P>
<P>
   So, in one of his classes, he said, students read papal
encyclicals in addition to court opinions. Some professors hold
Bible study groups. Some urge their students to ask combatants in
litigation to read scripture as a path toward the resolution of
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In one class, students said, a professor who opposes abortion
rights presented all the material including cases dealing with
abortion and then asked his students, ``OK, now you know the law,
now we're going to discuss the law: What do you think of it as a
Christian?''
</P>
<P>
   There are 37 religiously affiliated law schools in the United
States, although most do not emphasize those ties. Law schools at
many of the country's large religiously affiliated universities,
including some at the major Roman Catholic universities, teach law
much as secular schools do. Legal educators say that only about a
dozen of the 180 law schools in the country emphasize their
religious values in their courses. Pepperdine administrators say
their school is among the ones that are most committed to the
religious mission.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's approach differs from that of most American law
schools, where moral or religious convictions are often avoided in
the classroom. Traditional law schools focus their attention less
on questions of right and wrong than on a more objective mastery of
what the law is.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Pepperdine and most law schools is
intentional, said Richardson R. Lynn, a soft-spoken law professor
with a graying beard and a bias for bow ties who was named dean
when Starr failed to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, who like Starr was raised attending the Church of Christ,
says the school focuses on taking a Christian view of the law.
Asked for an example, he said that would include training students
to challenge clients involved in immoral businesses like Internet
pornography. Law students, he said, are not asked to reject clients
of whom they disapprove and are taught to represent their clients
as zealously as any other lawyer. But they are also taught ``to
think about what they can do to raise with clients the moral
dimensions of what their business is.''
</P>
<P>
   Many law schools across the country in recent years have tried
to increase their focus on lawyers' ethics. But their approach,
legal educators say, has emphasized the secular rules of the
profession, like the concept that every person is entitled to a
defense no matter how reprehensible the act he is accused of
committing.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal educators say Pepperdine's focus flies in the face of
the pragmatic approach to the legal profession that, for good or
ill, has shaped many law schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are very bread-and-butter-oriented,'' said Barry R.
Furrow, the interim dean of Widener University School of Law in
Wilmington, Del. Few young lawyers, he said, would be comfortable
delving into the morality of their clients. ``Their first
concern,'' he said, ``is not to alienate a client.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn said the sense of morality extended to the administration
of the school, which has 650 students who take standard bar
examinations and work in traditional legal jobs, like clerkships
with judges and positions in law firms all over the country.
Pepperdine, which, like many regional law schools is typically
ranked well below the elite schools, seeks to make produce students
who can compete with graduates of other law schools for jobs. But
several students said in interviews that smaller firms in small
cities seemed most receptive to them.
</P>
<P>
   Students agreed that the fierce competition that characterizes
many law schools was not the norm here.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some students said, too, that Pepperdine encouraged a constant
examination not only of what the law was but whether it was moral.
Eric Nelson, a student from Menomonee Falls, Wis., said he had been
taught that ``just because the law says what it says doesn't mean
you should stop there.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students also expressed irritation at what they called the
cliched portrayals of Starr, Christian lawyers in general and
Pepperdine in particular. After Starr announced his decision to
become dean and to head a new public policy school, some of his
critics called Pepperdine a haven for right-wing activists.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mellon Scaife, a wealthy conservative who has
contributed to many conservative causes, has given some $13 million
to the 7,800-student Pepperdine University over the years. Scaife
has not given money to the law school, but Pepperdine said a
foundation associated with him gave $1.2 million of some $20
million in start-up costs for the public policy school.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the students and professors acknowledged that their own
politics were politically conservative. But some of them complained
that stereotypes have shaped the public view of Christian lawyers
and of Starr, who has said he likes to start the day singing a hymn
and offering a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There just seems to be this view that if you are a Christian,
you think everybody else that's not just like you is wrong,'' said
Chad Brown, a 25-year old law student who grew up in Texas.
``That's just not it. That's not how the original man we named our
religion after _ Jesus Christ _ was; he wasn't judgmental.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the school, the line between moral and political
positions sometimes seemed to blur. In his constitutional law
class, Kmiec questioned students about a series of cases just as
professors do at secular law schools.
</P>
<P>
   But then he led the discussion toward what he called ``natural
law,'' which he and several of the students agreed was a force more
powerful than the precedents of courts. Many conservatives say the
natural law of God requires that abortion or assisted suicide
should be outlawed no matter what the courts have said.
</P>
<P>
   The routine at Pepperdine sometimes seemed much like that of
other law schools and the students, in T-shirts, looked like
students everywhere. But occasionally the differences seemed
evident.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Pepperdine faculty members seemed anxious to show
how different from traditional law schools Pepperdine is. William
P. Haney Jr., who has been teaching law at Pepperdine for 22 years,
was one who pointed out distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   Haney is a professor of juvenile justice issues, calls himself a
community service activist and describes himself as very
conservative. Every year he trains some 200 law students to work
with him to help prisoners and disadvantaged inner-city residents
through programs he runs that he said stress character, strong
values and Christian redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy he teaches law students, he said, is that there
are good and bad people. ``One of our functions as lawyers,'' he
said, ``is to make sure that the good people win.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, from a room across the hall from his law school office,
Haney summoned a 15-year old boy. Haney said the boy was a former
gang member who had been imprisoned for robbery and had a mother
who was a drug addict. The boy shook hands politely.
</P>
<P>
   Haney said the boy was one of 20 who have lived with him and his
wife. The boy, he said, was working with him ``preparing to be a
good person.'' Under his supervision, Haney said, the youth does
several hours of homework every day and, when he goes to school, is
not permitted to accept school lunch money because of Haney's
objections to government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some law schools,'' Haney added, ``I would be considered
out of step.''

 &HT;    FBI's Freeh visits N.C. to rally team searching for Rudolph
 &HT;    By John Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C. _ FBI Director Louis Freeh vowed in a visit here
Tuesday that federal agents would search the rugged western North
Carolina mountains ``as long as necessary'' for bombing suspect
Eric Robert Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to rally the small army of agents who have
hunted the area for Rudolph for almost 10 months, Freeh met for
about three hours with federal, state and local law officers
serving on the Southeast Bomb Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will maintain the investigation and search for as long as
necessary,'' Freeh said during a short media conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case will not be closed,'' he added. ``We will not stand
down. We will do whatever is reasonable and appropriate given the
information we have at the time to find the suspect and bring him
back safely to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeh's stopover comes at a time when authorities have again
reinforced the manhunt to more than 150 agents with hopes of
apprehending the former soldier and self-employed carpenter they
still believe is hiding in the surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It was at least the second time Freeh has flown in a government
jet to the local airport to spend a few hours being briefed on the
course of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the extent of the operation and the importance of
the case to myself , the attorney general, the (Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms), the country, I wanted to make sure the men
and women on the front line have all the equipment and resources
that they need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the agents will be working Thanksgiving, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh declined to speak about specifics of the manhunt, saying
merely, ``I was very impressed with the briefings, as I was in
May.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director also praised the morale of the agents and the
cooperation they have received from the local community, despite
the fact that a gunman two weeks ago fired as many as eight rounds
at the Task Force command center. No suspect has apprehended in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to extend my appreciation to the local community,''
Freeh said. ``We've not been received with anything except warmness
and support.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, 32, who grew up in the nearby mountains, is wanted in
connection with a string of nail bomb attacks in Atlanta and
Birmingham. He is accused of setting the bomb that killed one
person and wounded more than100 people during the Atlanta Olympics
in 1996, as well as the 1997 bombings at a Sandy Springs abortion
clinic and an Atlanta gay nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were led to this area the day after a Jan. 29 blast
rocked a Birmingham abortion clininc. A witness spotted a gray
Nissan pickup truck registered to Rudolph near the clinic. The
attack killed an off-duty police officer working as a security
guard and seriously wounded a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   With the leaves off the thick forest of hardwoods that cover the
ridges, authorities searching for Rudolph are optimistic. They hope
the suspect, who is considered a seasoned woodsman, will be easier
to spot. In addition, investigators also think Rudolph's food
supply is nearly exhausted and that he may make another move to
obtain more food.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph resurfaced briefly in July and took supplies from an
acquaintance who runs a health food store in Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're prepared to really exploit any opportunity, any break,''
Freeh said.

 &HT;    Southern unit plans far-reaching expansion
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Energy Inc., a unit of Southern Co., plans to
spend $1.2 billion to buy electric generating plants in California
and New York, a move that will double its U.S. capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have now, for a number of months, seen a lot of opportunity
in the North American market,'' said Southern Energy President Tom
Boren.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Co. is racing to diversify its holdings in advance of
deregulation of the nation's $200 billion-a-year electric utility
industry. A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg, the company's chairman, president
and chief executive, projects 30 percent of Southern's profits will
come from new U.S. businesses and foreign operations by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy will be responsible for generating much of that
growth.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, Boren said Southern Energy has identified
four markets for development: the Northeast, the upper Midwest,
Texas and Louisiana, and California and the Southwest desert.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy already has announced acquisitions and
developments in all of those regions except California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have generating assets in all of our target regions,''
Boren said. ``We are linking those assets with our trading and
marketing business that is run out of Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren said the challenge now is to develop those assets and look
for new opportunities to enhance the company's national presence.
</P>
<P>
   In the first deal, Southern said it would buy 1,776 megawatts of
capacity in New York from Orange and Rockland Utilities Inc. and
Consolidated Edison Inc. for $480 million. The deal includes oil,
coal, natural-gas and hydroelectric plants.
</P>
<P>
   The largest asset in the New York deal is the two-unit,
natural-gas-and oil-fired Bowline power plant in West Haverstraw,
which has a total capacity of 1,215 megawatts. The other plants are
in Grahamsville, Ramapo, Tomkins Cove, Sullivan County, Middletown
and Mongaup River.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy also said it is considering spending $390
million to upgrade the New York plants and increase its new
natural-gas-fired generation in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the other deal, the company will purchase plants with a total
capacity of 3,065 megawatts from San Francisco-based Pacific Gas &AMP;
Electric for $801 million.
</P>
<P>
   The largest purchase in this deal includes seven Pittsburg
natural-gas-fired plants in the San Francisco Bay Delta with a
combined capacity of 2,022 megawatts. The other plants are Contra
Costa and Potrero plants in southeast San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions, which are subject to regulatory approval,
``are quite significant,'' said David Burks, an analyst with
Hilliard Lyons in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The deals are indicative ``of a trend within the industry where
one utility will purchase the generating capacity from another
utility, and certainly a major company like Southern would want to
be able to have the strong capacity to meet future energy
demands,'' he said.
</P>

THOMAS MANNING, 86, EXPLORER KNOWN AS LONE WOLF OF ARCTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England, Canada)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Manning, an explorer known as the lone wolf of the Arctic
who followed his dog sled and camped in igloos to map desolate
reaches of the far north of Canada, died Nov. 8 in the hospital in
Smiths Falls, Ontario, near his gentleman's farm in Merrickville.
He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   A frequently solitary wanderer, Manning rarely seemed to need
the comforts of conversation and used words sparingly. Consider a
message that he asked a passing Eskimo to carry by dog sled to a
radio transmitter, where it could be sent by Morse code to
Montreal. The message, in 1938, was intended for Ella Wallace
Jackson, a woman from Nova Scotia who was called Jack, and it said:
``If wish join me Cape Dorset for two years I shall be pleased.
Think well. Fools rush in.''
</P>
<P>
   Though pithy, it proved persuasive. Miss Jackson, whom Manning
had met three years earlier, arrived above the 75th parallel to
marry him and to spend a prolonged honeymoon of a year and half
mapping the coast of Baffin Island. The newlyweds sustained
themselves with the fish, birds and seals that they hunted.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to her laconic husband, Mrs. Manning, who survives
him, not only amassed, but also recounted the couple's Arctic
experiences, writing ``Igloo for the Night'' in 1943 and ``A Summer
on Hudson Bay'' in 1949. In ``Igloo'' she described the long months
that she and Manning spent without seeing any other person until
Manning had a dream that impelled them to head south by dog sled to
the Eskimo settlement of Cape Dorset. They arrived on Jan. 2, 1940,
to be told that World War II had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to participate in the war effort Manning continued around
the Foxe Basin on a journey by boat and dog team that covered 2,500
miles and lasted just over a year.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at Churchill, Manitoba, for a train to carry him
south from Hudson Bay, he met a U.S. Air Force officer, who asked
whether the story he had heard from Eskimos about Manning's killing
a polar bear with a boning knife was true. Manning replied, ``It
was not a very big bear.''
</P>
<P>
   He subsequently enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy and helped
direct the building of Arctic airfields and worked on developing
cold-weather clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Henry Manning was born in Dalling, Northamptonshire,
England. The son of a well-to-do farmer who was a well-known
cricketer, Manning was educated at Harrow and Cambridge, where he
studied biology. He made his first northern journey in 1932 in
Lapland, and the next year he went to Southampton Island in the
Canadian Arctic, where he lived among Eskimos for two years,
learning skills to survive long periods of Arctic travel.
</P>
<P>
   Among his ventures was an expedition in 1949 on which he
discovered an Arctic island that was later named for Prince
Charles. In 1952, Manning and a young colleague, Andrew Macpherson,
tried to circumnavigate Banks Island by canoe and chart its coast.
They were engulfed by ice close to the spot where, in 1853, the
explorer Robert McClure and his men had to abandon their ship.
</P>
<P>
   Manning and Macpherson similarly headed overland, pulling their
meager rations on sledges made from barrels left by the McClure
party. They walked through snow and marsh for 14 days and Manning
suffered snow blindness before a trading schooner picked him up.
The next year Manning returned to complete his canoe trip.
</P>
<P>
   He kept returning to the Arctic into his late 60s, with his
later expeditions devoted to zoological and ornithological studies
at James Bay and the southern parts of Hudson Bay, where he tagged
polar bears for the Canadian Wildlife Service. His learned papers
covered birds and mammals from Banks Island in the west to Ungava
in the east, as well as archeology and Eskimo life.
</P>
<P>
   He donated his library of several thousand books to the Eskimo
community of Ikalhuit on Baffin Island, and shortly before his
death he presented $645,000 to Cambridge University to go toward
the new Shackleton Library at the Scott Polar Research Institute.

CURB ON TRAVEL AGENCY FEES FOR OVERSEAS FLIGHTS MAY COST PUBLIC
MILLIONS  
 THANKSGIVING TRAVEL MANIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (duplication warning: also sent with `t' code)  
 (bl)  
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   If travel industry predictions prove accurate, the public will
pay millions of dollars more in air fares as the result of the $100
limit that the major airlines recently imposed on travel agency
commissions for booking international flights.
</P>
<P>
   American Express has warned that those increased costs could
amount to $500 million, and the industry consensus is that business
travelers will pay the lion's share.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines was the first to impose the limit, on Nov. 12,
but was quickly joined by most other big carriers. Instead of the
existing 8 percent commission _ which, for example, would earn
travel agents a commission of $240 on an international round-trip
fare costing $3,000 _ the maximum commission is now $100 for a
round-trip international flight and $50 for a one-way flight.
</P>
<P>
   United chief executive Gerald Greenwald said the cap would save
the airline about $100 million annually, enabling United to operate
more effectively against worldwide competition, while Delta Air
Lines projects a savings of $40 million to $45 million annually.
Those savings are on top of the almost $1 billion that American
Express estimates the airlines have saved from the two earlier
commission reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the airlines lowered the commission to 8 percent
from 10 percent for both international and domestic fares, but with
no limit on international commissions. In February 1995, while the
airlines did not touch the existing 10 percent commission rate,
they put a $50 commission ceiling on domestic round-trip fares and
a $25 ceiling on domestic one-way fares.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the new caps will raise costs for leisure
travelers by putting some travel agencies out of business and
requiring surviving agencies to impose fees for service even higher
than the $10 to $15 average already charged by 64 percent of
members of the American Society of Travel Agents. Both the society
and the Association of Retail Travel Agents are loudly protesting
the latest commission caps to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers are likely to be the hardest hit, according
to Ed Gilligan, president of American Express Corporate Services,
because the large majority of big corporations already pay their
travel agencies a management fee, in return for receiving the
commission on air fares. But he added that leisure travelers would
also be affected by the cap, which he described as ``an indirect
fare increase.''
</P>
<P>
   That Time of Year
</P>
<P>
   The indigestion that often accompanies Thanksgiving may have
less to do with turkey and all the trimmings than with the huge
crowds on roads and at airports. A record 33.6 million people,
roughly one in eight Americans, will travel at least 100 miles from
home over this Thanksgiving holiday, 2 percent more than last year,
according to a survey by the AAA auto club.
</P>
<P>
   That breaks down to 27.7 million people going by car _ at a time
when the average gallon of gasoline is about $1.07, or 18 cents
cheaper than last Thanksgiving, according to the Lundberg Survey _
and 5.8 million by airplane, bus or train. Average air fares appear
to be about the same or slightly higher than last year, but many
airlines have some sort of Thanksgiving sale, even if only for
quickie trips of three to four days.
</P>
<P>
   Most travelers (63 percent) plan to stay overnight with family
or friends, according to the AAA survey, and the 23 percent who
intend to stay in a hotel can expect to pay an average $80.34 a
night, or $3.55 more this year than last, according to the Lodging
Research Network of PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, however, where the occupancy rate through the
remainder of this year is expected to be very tight, the daily room
rate will average $245, 15 percent higher than last year. The rate
for a standard room at deluxe New York hotels will range between
$350 and $700 a night.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday travel advice does not change much from year to year,
but it bears repeating that Wednesday and Sunday are among the peak
days of the year for air travel, while Thursday and Friday are the
least hectic.
</P>
<P>
   And along with advice to arrive at the airport at least an hour
ahead of time, remember that airports are cruising grounds for
pickpockets and thieves, so don't let your luggage or your laptop
out of your sight.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, drivers should bear in mind that on New England
roadways alone, an estimated 80 people are likely to be killed from
Thanksgiving through New Year's Day and 20,000 are likely to be
injured, according to the Connecticut Department of Transportation.
As the AAA advises: ``Take your time. The current land speed record
is 733 miles per hour. Don't try to break it on the way to
Grandma's.''

   LIVADICA, Yugoslavia _ There was a small advance Tuesday in the
effort to prop up the fragile cease-fire between Yugoslav
authorities and ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo province. After
U.S. diplomats had interceded, a Serbian police officer whom rebels
kidnapped a week ago, Goran Zbiljic, was released.
</P>
<P>
   The release is important because experts estimate that the
rebels have kidnapped more than 200 Serbs, with most believed to
have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that the release seemed to show that international
monitors might help in limited ways to defuse what diplomats see as
a surge in tensions between two forces that suspended serious
fighting less than two months ago and that seem to be preparing for
more war.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, the foreign monitors who patrol Kosovo say, small
fires have to be stamped out to prevent renewed combat. Although on
paper their mission is to keep their own governments informed about
events in Kosovo, they have become de facto negotiators of local
peace agreements and, Tuesday, the prisoner release.
</P>
<P>
   For now, their efforts and a furious snowstorm have helped keep
fighting isolated and at a low level. ``It looks good, but I think
we are living in a false reality,'' a European diplomat said,
``because neither side really believes they can get what they want
without more combat.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels want an independent country and are supported by most
of the ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the Kosovo
population. The government has, through U.S. mediators, offered
limited autonomy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After a summer in which the rebels greatly expanded their
territory and a fall when the government struck back with an
offensive that left thousands homeless, NATO threatened air strikes
unless the government withdrew many of its forces.
</P>
<P>
   With fewer soldiers and police officers deployed, civilians
began to return to most of the areas that they had fled in the
offensive. Many found that government forces had destroyed their
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as colder weather impedes fighting, an intense diplomatic
effort is beginning to bring rebel leaders, ethnic Albanian
politicians and the government into negotiations. But many foreign
diplomats and officials harbor doubts that diplomacy will bring
peace before the spring fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at the released officer's home gave some hope that
diplomacy might work. Snowdrifts covered the haystacks and the
outbuildings. Around the kitchen table inside Zbiljic's neighbors
and fellow officers gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Zbiljic, wearing the clothes that he had on seven days earlier
when masked rebel soldiers kidnapped him, was escorted home by U.S.
monitors, who said they had convinced the rebels that it was wrong
to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the man who saved me,'' Zbiljic said, whipping out a
business card that read, ``William `Nick' Slavik.'' ``He visited me
when I was a prisoner and he got me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats said the monitors are increasingly able to
gain the confidence of the government and rebel leaders and broker
agreements to reduce tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to convince them that even if they can't work
out the little things between themselves they can usually count on
us to broker an agreement they can live with,'' one monitor said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 177 U.S. monitors, most are on loan from the State
Department and the Pentagon. Fifty-eight have private contracts.
The monitors include British, Canadian, French, Italian and Russian
contingents.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of next month they are to begin to merge with the
monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe, which by early next year is supposed to have up to 2,000
people in Kosovo.

WOMEN'S TENNIS SEASON RUNS ON AS THE TOUR LIMPS ON
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At least on the surface, women's tennis shut down for
the season at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, and did so with a
flourish:
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis received a check for $500,000 for winning the
Chase Championships, Lindsay Davenport received $250,000 as
runner-up and became the first American-born player since Chris
Evert to take the No. 1 ranking home for the holidays, and Mother
Tennis, Billie Jean King, was on hand to acknowledge the renaming
of this world championship trophy in her honor. In perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   But perpetuity, when it comes to the women's game, is a relative
term.
</P>
<P>
   Just how long the year-end championships will remain sponsored
by Chase, and just how long the event will retain the prestigious
Garden as its address, and just how long the Women's Tennis
Association will hold out before acquiescing to the novelty of an
annual championship that is combined with the men's ATP Tour
championships and staged vagabond-style in a different spot on the
globe each year _ well, all of those unanswered questions are the
reason women's tennis really didn't shut down on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did its top players, for whom a lion's share of the
circuit's $40 million yearly prize money, plus whatever endorsement
deals they have, apparently is not quite enough to make ends meet.
After complaining interminably about the interminable length of the
tennis season, which this year stretched from January through late
November, and after parading an assortment of nagging,
fatigue-related injuries from start to finish of championships
week, it would have seemed sensible for the players to beat a hasty
retreat to their spa of choice for some major unwinding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, how did Steffi Graf plan to spend her ``time off''?
Immediately after losing to Davenport in the semifinals, Graf
hopped a flight to Florida not to hit the beach, but to hit her
mark at a commercial shoot for a sponsor. Tuesday, it was back to
the airport for a quick visit to Baltimore, where Graf had herself
penciled in for an exhibition with Jana Novotna. And because Graf's
opening-round defeat of Novotna at the championships made Novotna
the event's first defending champion ever to be dethroned in the
first round, the rematch in Baltimore promised not to be a
hit-and-giggle affair.
</P>
<P>
   Then Graf planned to fly home to Germany for business meetings
and another exhibition, this time in Cologne against 17-year-old
Anna Kournikova, who evidently doesn't spend her off-season
catching up on her homework.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the WTA's intentions of shortening the tennis season
by three weeks by the year 2001, a sleight of scheduling that Bart
McGuire, the chief executive officer, claimed he would accomplish
without actually trimming away any tournaments or prize money, were
met with skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't three fewer weeks of official events just open up the
players' calendars for more exhibition appearances? Kournikova
admitted she finds them more rewarding than real tournaments
because they inflict less stress and give her a chance to put on a
livelier show for her fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we would try to discourage the over-playing of
exhibitions during the off season; we certainly ought to build in
dis-incentives,'' McGuire said. ``One of the ways we can keep them
from over-playing exhibitions is to make the Tour itself lucrative
enough that making another hundred thousand dollars is of less
significance to them.''
</P>
<P>
   That'll be the day. That type of approach to the problem would
require something the Tour doesn't happen to have right now: a
title sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance hit a record of 3.6 million in 1998, and domestic and
international television coverage will virtually double in 1999,
but the $4 million-a-year deal with its title sponsor, Corel, the
Canadian software firm, expires at the end of this year. Because
Corel chose not to embellish the deal beyond the bare bones
stipulated in its four-year contract, the company exits with the
WTA's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But unless one of the four global firms currently mulling the
prospect of a multiyear pact in the $7 million-$9 million range
(plus promotion, corporate entertainment and other perks that
essentially double the sponsor's investment) comes to terms with
McGuire by year's end, the tour will be running on the fumes of its
contingency fund in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the future fate of the championships, which has a
lease at the Garden through 2000?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think if we can get the championships of both the men and
women together, it would be a dynamite way to end the season,''
McGuire said. ``I simply don't know what will happen to the
Championships in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for perpetuity.

 &HT;    TO GOP OUTCRY, RENO DECLINES GORE FUND-RAISING PROBE
 &HT;    580&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Tuesday there was
insufficient evidence to request that an independent counsel
examine whether Vice President Al Gore misled officials about
campaign fund-raising phone calls from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's conclusion, after a 90-day preliminary investigation,
removed a major obstacle for Gore's 2000 presidential campaign,
which otherwise would have begun under the shadow of an ethics
probe.
</P>
<P>
   However, the decision brought renewed protests from Republicans
that the attorney general is shielding the Clinton administration
from a serious examination of the campaign fund-raising scandals of
1996. ``Janet Reno has gone through extraordinary contortions not
to appoint an independent counsel for the entire campaign finance
investigation,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee. He called the
attorney general ``hopelessly conflicted when investigating her own
boss.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The attorney general has a responsibility to see that the laws
are faithfully executed,'' said Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga. ``By twisting
the independent counsel statute beyond recognition, the attorney
general is actively subverting the law in order to protect the
president who appointed her.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than two years, Reno has resisted calls for an outside
investigator to delve into the funding controversies of the last
presidential campaign. Both FBI Director Louis Freeh and a Justice
Department fund-raising investigator, Charles LaBella, have urged
her to appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision on Gore _ the first of three similar
decisions on campaign funding probes that Reno faces within two
weeks _ was the second time that she has reviewed the vice
president's fund-raising activities and concluded that no outside
probe was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I base my decisions solely on the facts and the law, not
politics, pressure or polls,'' Reno said in a statement that
anticipated the outcry over her latest move.
</P>
<P>
   In a 19-page explanation filed in federal appeals court here,
Reno said, ``I find the evidence fails to provide any reasonable
support for a conclusion that the vice president may have lied''
when he told investigators last year that he believed his phone
calls were to raise unregulated, or ``soft'' money for Democratic
TV issue ads.
</P>
<P>
   It was later learned that some of the money Gore raised went
into ``hard'' money Democratic campaign accounts, which have more
stringent regulations and which can be used to directly support
individual candidates. A staff memo unearthed earlier this year
indicated that the vice president may have learned at a November
1995 meeting about plans to use the ``hard'' money for the TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Reno told the court that interviews with the 15 attendees at the
meeting found only two who recalled the subject of ``hard'' money
coming up. Gore was among those who said he did not remember such a
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who also attended the session, provided a
statement that ``he had no independent recollection of the
meeting,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Gore brought a low-key response from members
of the vice president's team, who have insisted that they expected
him to be cleared. His spokesman, Chris Lehane, released a terse
statement saying Gore was ``pleased'' at the outcome and that he
would ``continue focusing on what he has been doing _ working with
the president to prepare America for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it good news? Absolutely,'' said former Gore press
secretary Marla Romash. ``All of us believed that this would be
where we would be in the end. So to get there sooner rather than
later is certainly good news, but I think this is where we believed
we would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Romash cast doubts on whether having an independent counsel
examining Gore would have been an inducement to other Democratic
hopefuls to join the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to make a decision about whether to run for
president as to whether the vice president is the subject of an
independent counsel, that's nuts,'' she said. ``I think the vice
president, if he decides to run, is going to be a very formidable
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore averted an outside probe on his phone calls, the
Clinton administration could still face scrutiny on the 1996
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno faces two more decisions on whether to seek outside
investigators. By Monday, she must announce whether to seek an
probe into whether former White House aide Harold Ickes misled a
Senate committee on his dealings with the Teamsters Union.
</P>
<P>
   And by Dec. 7, the attorney general must decide whether to seek
an independent counsel to examine Clinton's role in directing the
$44 million in Democratic TV issue ads, which critics say violated
federal campaign spending limits by tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That allegation could lead to the broadest examination yet of
campaign finances in both parties, if Reno chooses.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some reformers see that investigation as far more
significant than the Gore case. ``This was very narrow question
involving a technical issue,'' said Don Simon, counsel for Common
Cause, a non-partisan reform group.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton and the TV issue ads, Simon said, ``the question
Reno now has to face is on the broader issue that really goes to
the heart of the massive illegalities that occurred in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
said at a news conference Tuesday that ``what is at stake'' is
``whether there will be a full accounting for the reckless
fund-raising practices of President Clinton and other
administration officials.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if Reno turns down an independent counsel in the
next two cases, then Congress may pass legislation to overrule her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it is becoming very apparent to me, and I think many
others as well, that we need to take these matters out of the hands
of the attorney general,'' he said.

EUROPEAN BANKS STRUGGLE TO REINVENT THEMSELVES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Deutsche Bank AG's $9.7 billion bid for
Bankers Trust of New York is merely the most visible sign of a much
broader upheaval in European finance.
</P>
<P>
   From Swiss giants like UBS to aggressive acquirers like ABN-Amro
of the Netherlands, big money-center banks in Europe are coping
with intense new competition both globally and in their home
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The new pressures are sending more and more financial
institutions _ banks, insurers and mutual fund companies _ into one
another's arms. Many analysts and industry executives assume there
will be additional trans-Atlantic deals as European banks struggle
to carve out positions in the huge American market.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the pressure comes from American investment banks, which
now play a dominant role in orchestrating Europe's biggest
industrial mergers and help companies raise money from global
markets.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other forces at work. The introduction of the
single European currency, the euro, for 11 countries in January has
increased the pressure on national banks to reinvent themselves as
European players.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, profit margins in traditional banking areas like
commercial lending have declined so much in countries like Germany
that banks are scrambling to enter more lucrative areas.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a sweeping realignment in European finance. Big
insurers are forming cross-border alliances with commercial banks.
Takeover battles have erupted between rival institutions; the
Belgian financial firm Fortis, for example, outbid ABN-Amro earlier
this year in the $14 billion takeover of Belgium's Generale de
Banque SA. And within countries, banks are merging to reduce their
costs and bolster efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are whole new growth areas, and these have caused the
banks to realize they have to reposition themselves,'' said Norbert
Enste, a managing partner at B. Metzler Seel. Sohn &AMP; Co., a private
bank in Frankfurt. ``This is something that won't be over in one
year. It will last a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Deutsche Bank's bid for Bankers Trust has
prompted speculation about other big deals. Dresdner Bank, which
owns the relatively small investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson, has acknowledged that it is interested in American
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Other institutions may feel pressure too, analysts said. Credit
Suisse Group conducted talks with Chase Manhattan earlier this
year. And UBS, which is still struggling to reorganize after its
merger with the Swiss Bank Corp., may still have an appetite for a
U.S. investment bank. Though UBS has an American base in asset
management, Warburg Dillon Read, its investment banking business,
is not in the top tier of Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the chess-like machinations lie deeper problems. Except
for Credit Suisse Group, which owns Credit Suisse First Boston,
European commercial banks have had little success when they have
bought Wall Street investment banks. Investment banking, with its
reliance on superstar deal-makers and stratospheric salaries,
remains alien to the stodgier ``universal'' banks that are built
around traditional lending activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an open question as to whether the endgame of containing
the two things under one roof is workable,'' said Claus Lowe,
chairman of J.P. Morgan's German office. ``The culture in retail
consumer banking and wholesale investment banking is just so
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts and industry executives have been almost
uniformly critical about Deutsche Bank's attempt to buy Bankers
Trust, which derives most of its income from investment banking
activities but is not big enough to compete directly with Wall
Street's biggest firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the management challenge from hell,'' said Peter Thorne,
a banking analyst at Paribas Capital in London.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the big credit-rating agencies placed Deutsche Bank
under review for a possible downgrade soon after the bank confirmed
that it was in ``advanced stages'' of a deal on Monday. In
announcing its review, Moody's Investors Service emphasized the
``difficulty'' of integrating with an investment bank and noted
that Deutsche Bank had already had problems after it bought the
British investment bank Morgen Grenfell.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Monro Davies, chief executive officer of the rating agency
Fitch IBCA in London, was more blunt. ``There are relatively few
firms, maybe three or four in the world, that have consistently
been successful at investment banking,'' Davies said at a banking
conference here Tuesday. ``The history of buying banks has not been
a happy one.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To be sure, European banks and insurers may well be more focused
on deals with one another than with Wall Street firms. Many
institutions have become fixated on the idea of ``bankassurance,''
the idea of marketing bank services and insurance through the same
channels, and European insurers already have a web of
cross-holdings with banks.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Commerzbank, Germany's fourth-largest bank,
recently exchanged a 5 percent stake with Generali, the big Italian
insurer. Besides giving both companies new channels to market their
products in Europe, many bankers say the deal provides Commerzbank
with a white knight to fend off any takeover attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, most of the big deals have been between banks within
individual countries. In Italy, Credito Italiano acquired the rival
Unicredito for about $7 billion earlier this year. The two biggest
banks in the German state of Bavaria, Bayerische Vereinsbank and
Bayerische Hypobank, merged in a deal that created Germany's
second-largest bank. Several Scandinavian banks have reached deals
to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The action is not over. One of the most aggressive banks in
recent years has been ABN Amro, which has acquired businesses in
most European countries and unsuccessfully attempted a $12 billion
hostile takeover of Generale of Belgium. ABN has bought up smaller
banks and brokerage firms across Europe, and it acquired the
Michigan savings bank, Standard Federal Bancorporation, for $1.9
billion two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With total assets of about $500 billion, the Dutch bank is now
in the same league as Germany's biggest institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, political obstacles continue to block many
bank mergers. In Germany, 80 percent of the bank industry is
controlled by either nonprofit cooperatives or state-owned
institutions. Private banks like Deutsche Bank or Dresdner Bank are
essentially prohibited from buying these institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In France, government leaders continue to block foreign banks
from taking over French institutions. Even the loss-plagued Credit
Lyonnaise, which the government is desperately trying to sell,
remains off limits to banks from other European countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``France in a way is a closed shop,'' said Michael Klein, a
German bank analyst at Sal. Oppenheim in Frankfurt. ``They don't
want to sell their silver to foreigners, but they don't have enough
money to really enter Germany.'' &QL;

INTERNATIONAL PAPER TO BUY UNION CAMP IN $5 BILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   International Paper Co., the nation's largest paper maker,
announced Tuesday that it would buy a rival, Union Camp Corp., for
$5 billion in stock in one of the first consolidations in an
industry that has consistently lost money because it produces too
much.
</P>
<P>
   The merger would greatly expand International Paper's leading
market position in the office paper market and would make it the
No. 2 supplier of containerboard, the thick brown paper used to
make boxes. The merger will also be followed by a $300 million
cost-cutting program, including the closing of some administrative
offices and reductions in overhead. The possibility of job losses
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said International Paper's move was long overdue in an
industry that has lost money for nearly a decade, fallen behind in
a rising stock market, been battered by the Asian crisis and
stubbornly avoided a corporate downsizing that has swept the
nation's manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger tells us what a lot of us have been crying and
screaming and shouting for over the last years,'' said Linda
Lieberman, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. ``This is an
industry in desperate need of consolidation. This is a blueprint
for something that has to take place and is an important first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Paper industry stocks, as moribund as the industry, came alive
on this move and hopes of further mergers. Shares of Champion
International Corp., a pulp-and-paper company, rose $3.875, to
$43.1875; stock of Georgia-Pacific Corp. rose $5.6875, to $59.625,
and shares of Boise Cascade Corp. rose $4.3125, to $32.1875. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's index of paper manufacturing stocks rose 5.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The big market winner was Union Camp, which rose $16 to close at
$64.9375. Just last month the company reported falling earnings for
the first nine months of 1998 and announced a restructuring
designed to save $42 million a year. International Paper, which has
generally traded in a range around $45 for the last few months,
closed at $44, down $1.8125.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Adding to the market bounce was the announcement Tuesday that
the newly merged Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., the biggest maker
of cardboard boxes, would cut as many as 3,600 jobs, or 10 percent
of its workforce. This move, which will result in a $350 million
fourth-quarter charge against earnings, is designed to reduce an
oversupply of containerboard.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in the paper industry is simple: There are too many
companies and too much paper supply to match a demand for paper
products that has been growing only slowly. Prices have fallen; for
instance, prices for linerboard, a form of containerboard, dropped
to $350 a ton last month from $530 a ton in 1995. The Asian crisis
has worsened the oversupply by reducing the export market for
domestic paper products.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry that has completely collapsed from an
investor point of view,'' said Kathryn McAuley, an analyst with
Brown Brothers Harriman. ``Something had to be done. There are too
many players and too much supply. The industry has had, maybe, two
profitable years in the past 10 years. They've had ugly, difficult
years, and Asia was the last straw.''
</P>
<P>
   John Dillon, chief executive of International Paper, which is
based in Purchase, N.Y., called the merger ``a perfect fit.'' Union
Camp chief executive W. Craig McClelland said the savings that
result from the merger would ``create significant value for
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, International Paper will also assume $1.6
billion in Union Camp's debt.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the nation's paper industry has suffered from
cyclical price fluctuations. A major reason is widespread industry
fragmentation, which was only made worse in the early 1990s, when
one company after another added unneeded plants and production
capacity. But in a corporate version of the Cold War, no company
wanted to shut its operations to reduce output; instead, all
continued to produce paper, driving prices down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change an industry that has traditionally been based
on building capacity,'' Ms. Lieberman said. ``But this move is
designed to take a cyclical business and make it a little less
cyclical. You can get cost reductions, transportation benefits and
reduce your headquarters staff.''
</P>
<P>
   In acquiring Union Camp, based in Wayne, N.J., International
Paper is taking over a company with assets described as the
Rolls-Royce of the paper industry. Union Camp has around 18,000
employees in 40 countries; International Paper has more than 80,000
employees in 30 countries and exports to 130 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Union Camp is really an excellent choice,'' said Ms. McAuley
of Brown Brothers. ``Their product lines match up perfectly. This
was a strategically brilliant move by International Paper.''

NASDAQ'S OPEN POSITIONS OF SHORT SALES DOWN 2 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Open positions of short sales on the Nasdaq stock
market fell 2 percent in the most recent monthly period, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees the
market, reported Tuesday. It was the first time in the last 12
months that short-interest positions have declined for two
consecutive periods.
</P>
<P>
   In the month ended Nov. 13, uncovered short positions totaled
2.01 billion shares, down from 2.05 billion shares in the previous
month.
</P>
<P>
   A short position is created when an investor sells shares that
have been borrowed. If the share price falls, the investor can
profit by buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed
ones. Conversely, if the shares rise in price, the short-seller
faces a loss. Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions,
are those shares that have been borrowed and sold but not yet
covered by repurchase.
</P>
<P>
   For the second month, the largest short position on Nasdaq was
Dell Computer. But the stock, whose price rose sharply in the
period, also recorded the biggest decrease in open short positions.
Short positions in Dell totaled 35.8 million shares, a drop of 18.9
million shares, or 34 percent, from the previous month.

 &HT;    Suspect indicted in hotel slayings
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During a string of killings at hotels last month,
suspect Timothy Carl Dawson made repeated visits to a jailed man
whose name he had assumed, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost a counseling, a soul kind of healing process for
his wrongdoings or something,'' Fulton County District Attorney
Paul Howard said Tuesday after a Fulton grand jury indicted Dawson
on 32 charges related to the slayings of four men.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson is accused of killing LaDarris Hawkins, 19, at a College
Park, Ga. hotel Oct. 15 and Phillip Dover, 31, of Gainesville, Ga.
and Gerrold Shropshire, 50, and Ronald Gutkowski, 51, of Florida on
Oct. 18 at the downtown Hilton. All were shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson will plead not guilty, said his attorney, Thomas West.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's motive was robbery and he killed his victims so they
could not identify him, said Howard, who is considering whether to
seek the death penalty. Howard said he wants to meet with the
victims' families in the next two weeks before announcing whether
he will try to send Dawson to death row.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson, 37, was arrested early Oct. 31 in Shelby County, Tenn.,
and initially told police his name was Harry Lee Johnson. Johnson,
in fact, was an inmate in the DeKalb County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson visited Johnson in jail after the slayings, Howard said,
although he did not know how many times or exactly when.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really aren't sure about what the dimensions of these
discussions were,'' Howard said. ``It's interesting at this point,
but we are not sure that it's of tremendous significance to us.
It's strange. It's very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's apparently some kind of symbiotic relationship they
had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said Johnson is not considered a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson probably met Dawson in jail and is cooperating with
investigators, DeKalb County Sheriff Sidney Dorsey said recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Dawson visited Johnson here at the DeKalb jail several
times,'' Dorsey said recently. ``They were friends. In fact Johnson
was aware that Dawson had used his identity.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury indicted Dawson on four counts of murder; 12
counts of felony murder, which applies when someone is killed
during the commission of a felony; eight counts of aggravated
assault; four counts of armed robbery; and four weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not unusual to load up as many charges as they can think
of,'' West said. ``We've got a long way to go to sort out what the
state has and what they don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawson also has been charged with the Oct. 5 slaying of DeKalb
County (Ga.) real estate agent Raycell Mason, 44, who was shot
several times in the head at his home. DeKalb County District
Attorney J. Tom Morgan said he will not seek an indictment against
Dawson until the Fulton cases are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said Dawson apparently had some prior knowledge of
Hawkins. But Dawson did not know the Hilton victims, although he
might have met Dover in the hotel bar, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, it was a crime of opportunity and, for some
reason, he saw this as an opportunity to rob one of the victims,''
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Gutkowski reportedly had about $600 with him, but the money was
not found on his body, Howard said. Police did not find it when
they stopped Dawson. They are still trying to learn if he used
victims' credit cards, which were found in his car, along with the
same type of gun used in the killings.

RENO SAYS EVIDENCE INSUFFICIENT TO INVESTIGATE GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By David Johnston   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno concluded Tuesday that
there was insufficient evidence to seek the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore's
fund-raising role in the 1996 reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time she has investigated and cleared the vice
president in connection with campaign solicitations he made from
the White House, and the decision, while assailed by Republicans,
swept away a potentially ominous cloud of criminal inquiry that had
hung over Gore's presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   With her aides divided, Reno deliberated until the final day of
a 90-day preliminary inquiry into whether Gore misled Justice
Department investigators during their initial inquiry last year.
They were examining whether calls he made from his White House
office violated laws against fundraising on federal property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence fails to provide any reasonable basis for a
conclusion that the vice president may have lied,'' Reno said in a
legal brief filed with the three-member panel of federal appellate
judges who supervise independent counsel matters. She added, ``As
our court filing demonstrates, I have found that there are no
reasonable grounds for further investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno still has two independent counsel decisions pending on
other campaign finance issues, but neither is aimed so pointedly at
Gore. One is examining the truthfulness of statements by Harold
Ickes, the former deputy chief of staff. The other is a broadly
framed inquiry into whether Clinton and other officials violated
the law when they used Democratic party funds, rather than
Clinton-Gore campaign funds, to finance a major advertising
campaign that went too far, according to election auditors, in
directly promoting the Clinton-Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gore, Christopher Lehane, expressed the vice
president's relief at the decision. ``The vice president is pleased
that this preliminary review has been concluded without the need
for an independent counsel,'' Lehane said. ``Vice President Gore
will continue focusing on what he has been doing _ working with the
president to prepare America for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also expressed his satisfaction. ``Obviously the
president welcomes the news,'' said Joe Lockhart, the White House
spokesman, who said the president ``believes the vice president has
always acted within the letter and the spirit of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who have assailed Reno for two years over her
refusal to seek an independent prosecutor to investigate possible
campaign finance abuses by the Democrats again expressed
frustration over her unwillingness to allow an outside review.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who is chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, said she had unnecessarily limited her focus
to small issues, like whether Gore's fundraising phone calls from
the White House were proper. ``Whether an independent counsel
should be appointed to investigate narrow issues such as the
improper placement of phone calls or misstatements to investigators
is not the issue,'' Hatch said. ``What is at stake is whether the
public's confidence in the rule of law and integrity of the
Department of Justice will be further eroded by this administration
and whether there will ever be a full accounting for reckless
fundraising practices of President Clinton and other Administration
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who is chairman of the House government
Reform and Oversight Committee, which has investigated campaign
finance issues, said, ``Once again, the attorney general has failed
to follow the law. For the past two years, the attorney general has
made it clear she is committed to protecting the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Few officials within the Justice Department believed that Reno
was likely to open a wider criminal inquiry of Gore, but some
expressed surprise over the extensive legal debate that the case
ignited. FBI Director Louis Freeh urged her to refer the case to an
independent prosecutor _ a position he has long taken on the
campaign finance issue.
</P>
<P>
   But other top officials, among them David Vicinanzo, lead
prosecutor for Reno's campaign finance unit, were unconvinced. They
recommended against appointment of an independent counsel because
the evidence was insubstantial and provided little promise that
further investigation would prove worthwhile, law enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Vicinanzo replaced Charles La Bella as head of the Justice
Department's campaign finance team. La Bella left in July, before
the latest Gore inquiry began, but he had urged Reno to refer a
number of campaign finance issues to an independent counsel on
grounds that the possible violations were so serious they should be
reviewed by an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's second inquiry of Gore began in
September after the White House belatedly disclosed a fundraising
memo written by David Strauss, a Gore aide. Strauss' handwritten
notes were taken during a White House meeting on Nov. 21, 1995,
that focused on campaign finance issues and suggested that Gore may
not have been truthful about his fundraising practices during the
1997 inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Gore had told Justice Department investigators
that he thought the funds he had raised in telephone calls from his
White House office were only so-called soft money donations. These
contributions generally fall outside federal election laws, may be
given in any amount and are spent by political parties only for
generic purposes like get-out-the-vote drives and other
party-building activities. There is no prohibition on raising soft
money from government property.
</P>
<P>
   But the Strauss memo indicated that Gore may have known when he
was questioned by Justice Department investigators in 1997 that the
contributions he helped raise were partially diverted into hard
money accounts by the Democratic National Committee. Hard money
donations to the political parties are limited by federal election
law to $20,000 _ and unlike soft money _ could be spent directly on
the Clinton-Gore re-election effort. Under Federal election law,
Gore was barred from soliciting hard money contributions from
government property.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The November 1995 meeting was attended by Gore, Clinton and 13
other presidential aides and campaign officials. Reno said Tuesday
in her legal brief to the three-member panel of appeals court
judges that investigators had interviewed or obtained statements
from each of the participants. Clinton provided a statement that
said he could not remember the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No attendees recall any particular questions or comments by
the vice president,'' Reno wrote. ``No one who arrived at the
meeting without a working knowledge of the DNC financing issues
left with an accurate understanding of the fact that both hard and
soft money were necessary to pay for the media campaign. Only two
of the fifteen attendees at the meeting even recall the topic of a
hard money component to the media fund being raised during the
meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the interviews with the participants in the meeting,
Reno concluded that the evidence was too weak to support a
prosecution of Gore for lying. Reno said that there is ``only weak
circumstantial evidence of the vice president's knowledge _ his
presence at a meeting where the subject was briefly discussed _
which I do not believe provides reasonable grounds to believe that
further investigation of this matter is warranted.''

 INTUIT REPORTS SEASONAL LOSS: $49.2 MILLION IN 1st QUARTER  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Intuit Inc. reported a fiscal first quarter loss
Tuesday, reflecting the costs of developing tax preparation
products to sell in coming months. The loss had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., has been
shifting from a traditional packaged software producer to an
Internet-based business model. But though its sites, including
Quicken.com and QuickenMortgage, are among the most popular on the
World Wide Web, more than 90 percent of its revenue still comes
from software programs like Quicken, the personal finance package,
and -TurboTax.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit reported its financial results after the market had
closed. In Nasdaq trading, Intuit shares closed at $59.875, down
$4.25. Analysts said that the drop reflected profit-taking after
Intuit's $6.63 gain in the rally Monday, and that the quarter
contained no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter that ended on Oct. 31, Intuit reported a loss of
$49.2 million, which included charges resulting from the
amortization of goodwill and other acquisition-related expenses of
$22.8 million. It had a net loss of $12.8 million for the first
fiscal quarter last year. Revenue rose 17 percent, to $112 million
from $96 million.
</P>
<P>
   Without the charges, Intuit had a loss of $26.8 million, or 45
cents a share, fully diluted. Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
had expected Intuit to lose 46 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Lise Buyer, an analyst with CS First Boston, said the quarter
essentially matched her expectations, with some growth that was
better than expected in QuickBooks, Intuit's bookkeeping software
for small businesses. ``The software business is holding its own
and they have a huge potential upside on the Internet,'' she said.
If the company can persuade the 13 million Quicken users to start
using its Internet sites, ``they have a huge shot at being the big
winner in online financial services,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's financial results reflect the seasonal nature of its
businesses, particularly its tax return preparation products. The
company typically produces most of its annual profits in the
January and April quarters and posts losses in the July and October
quarters.

NEW DATA SHOWS THAT ECONOMY REMAINS STRONG

<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest snapshot of the U.S. economy showed on Tuesday that
the long-predicted slowdown is still more forecast than fact.
</P>
<P>
   The economy performed better during the summer than had been
originally reported and consumer confidence bounced back this fall,
according to a fresh batch of data released on Tuesday. Along with
other signs of buoyancy _ in jobs, retail sales and housing _ the
new data suggest that growth remains surprisingly solid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite financial turmoil abroad and tremblings at home, the
nation's gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.9
percent in the third quarter, revised upward from an initial
estimate of 3.3 percent, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.
The growth did not reflect goods piling up in warehouses but
stronger demand in most parts of the economy. Inflation, meanwhile,
was less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer confidence, as measured by an index by the Conference
Board, a private research group in New York, has risen this month
after four consecutive declines that brought it to an 18-month low
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the latest data, forecasters are saying that growth
in the current quarter could run as high as 3 percent but slow down
sometime in the new year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slowdown turns out to be a 1999 story rather than a 1998
story,'' said Nick Perna, chief economist at Fleet Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a bolt from the blue, the current economic expansion
should by January overtake the 92-month boom experienced during the
Reagan administration and close in on the Kennedy-Johnson
expansion, the longest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in familiar forecasting territory,'' William Dudley,
chief economist at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said. He pointed to the
three interest rate cuts made by the Federal Reserve over the last
two months. ``We don't usually think of an economy with a 4.6
percent unemployment rate that's growing at a rate of 2.5 percent
to 3 percent as requiring three Fed rate cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   All this does not mean that the economy is not suffering some
visible strains that presage slower growth in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite healthy growth in sales, American industry is suffering
a profit squeeze. Excess capacity at home and intense competition
from abroad are making it nearly impossible for manufacturers to
pass along rising labor and other costs to customers. The most
accurate and broadest measure of corporate profits rose only
marginally this summer compared with results from the spring
quarter, the Department of Commerce reported on Tuesday, and it is
down 2 percent compared with figures from the quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Despite optimistic forecasts from analysts, few economists
expect the corporate profit picture to brighten much, though the
recent surge in the stock market's main gauges indicates investors
obviously think the companies in those indexes will do better than
the average company.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the cash flow businesses had for retooling and
expansion was flat in the third quarter, explaining why spending on
plants and equipment, which was rising at double-digit percentile
rates in the first half of the year, has also stopped growing. And
while shipments of business equipment jumped 0.6 percent last
month, orders that prefigure spending a few months down the road
dropped 1.7 percent, more than erasing a 1.3 percent rise in
September. That probably reflected Asia's woes and those of
American producers.
</P>
<P>
   But businesses might have reined in new investment anyway.
Another report, concerning revised Federal Reserve data on
industrial capacity and production going back to 1992, shows that
capacity growth has been phenomenal in key industries. In the
computer and office equipment business, for example, production
capacity soared 58 percent in the last year alone.
</P>
<P>
   A reduction in capital spending by itself does not necessarily
indicate slower growth. Half of the equipment American businesses
buy comes from abroad, thus less capital spending means fewer
imports, a smaller trade gap and more domestic production than
would otherwise be the case. Indeed, imports as a whole rose less
than initially reported this summer, at a 1.3 percent annual rate
compared with 3.4 percent, while exports also fell less than
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing, of course, is the sector where the economy has
been weak, though not as weak as previously thought, according to
the Fed. In the last two years, industrial output has grown nearly
a percentage point more than originally reported. Still, growth has
fallen off sharply, only 1.9 percent this year compared with 6.6
percent last year. And forward-looking indicators, like the monthly
reports by purchasing managers, suggest that the weakness in
manufacturing is deepening.
</P>
<P>
   Still, manufacturing is not the whole story. American
households, whose purchases of consumer goods and services and new
homes account for almost three-fourths of the nation's gross
domestic product, have been living up to their reputation as big
spenders. Spending on goods and services rose at an annual rate of
more than 4.1 percent in the third quarter. That is slower than the
more than 6 percent annual rate of the first half, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, home buying in the quarter jumped at an annual rate
of 8.6 percent. Low interest rates, fatter household balance sheets
and healthy income gains combined with a surge of consumer
confidence have kept home and car sales near record highs.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers cannot keep spending faster than they earn, of course.
In the last year, consumption has outpaced income, rising 4.7
percent vs. 3.2 percent. As a result, saving out of current income
has slipped to practically zero. The stock market's rebound has
repaired some of the damage to household balance sheets, but few
economists expect that stock market gains from here on can provide
fuel for big spending gains.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, Dudley of Goldman, Sachs noted, the impact of
improved consumer spirits may be less than it appears. The
Conference Board's November confidence reading shows that
confidence has bounced back to the high levels it reached in
September. What has not rebounded nearly as much is consumers'
assessment of job market conditions. Just 40.6 percent rated jobs
as ``plentiful'' in November, compared with 45.2 percent in
September.

GERMANY DROPS CALL TO NATO ON NUCLEAR USE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Germany's newly elected government Tuesday backed
away from a threat to press NATO to renounce a central tenet of its
strategy and to pledge never to be the first to use nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting at the Pentagon with Defense Secretary William
Cohen, German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said that ``there
is no intention in my government to question any core element of
NATO strategy, including the fact that nuclear forces play a
fundamental political role.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they were alarmed when the new German
foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, a member of the environmentalist
Green Party, suggested in a magazine interview published this week
that Germany would press NATO to renounce the possible first use of
nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen publicly rebuffed the German proposal. Welcoming
Scharping's remarks Tuesday, Cohen said that NATO's nuclear policy
should remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on my conversations with Minister Scharping,'' Cohen
said, ``I think that we have a meeting of the minds _ that the
strategic concept is critical for NATO's security, that the
strategic concept as far as the nuclear component should not be
altered.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is firmly opposed to any change in the
doctrine allowing NATO to make first use of nuclear weapons in a
war, arguing that it proved an effective deterrent during the cold
war and remains one today against small, non-nuclear nations that
might develop chemical or biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it continues to serve a vital security purpose for
the NATO organization and should not be changed,'' Cohen said,
standing next to Scharping at the news conference at the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The public debate within Germany in recent days over nuclear
strategy suggests new rifts in the government coalition between the
Social Democrats and the Greens. In a coalition agreement reached
last month, the two parties agreed that NATO should renounce the
possible first use of nuclear weapons, a clear concession to the
Greens.
</P>
<P>
   But it had been unclear to American officials whether Gerhard
Schroeder, the Social Democrat who is the new chancellor, had
accepted the declaration as an empty concession to the Greens or
would in fact move to question one of the central tenets of NATO
doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   Scharping, a Social Democrat on his first visit to Washington as
defense minister, said that the new German government had no
intention of creating a rift with NATO by acting unilaterally on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is the most successful alliance we have ever seen in
history so the main goal of our government in Germany is to
strengthen NATO and its cohesion and to make NATO able to face the
challenges for the next century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said that his government ``is following the vision of
a nuclear-weapons free world'' and that ``the necessity to use them
may be extremely remote as it is written down in the actual NATO
strategy.''

AOL LAYS OUT PLAN FOR MARRIAGE TO NETSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By STEVE LOHR and JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Envisioning a thoroughly networked world in which the World Wide
Web is a limitless marketplace of information, entertainment,
products and services, America Online Inc. Tuesday laid out the
details of its agreement to buy the Netscape Communications
Corporation for $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By moving quickly toward what both companies have recently come
to see as the inevitable convergence of technology and media,
America Online hopes that it will secure a solid lead in a battle
already joined by giants like the Microsoft Corp. and the
International Business Machines Corp. to transform the greater part
of cyberspace into a vast virtual mall.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that vision rests on an alliance with Sun Microsystems
that America Online negotiated as part of the deal. Sun not only
brings a cyber-savvy sales force to the effort but, even more
importantly, a strong technology partner in developing Netscape's
industrial-strength software for running Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is indeed a technology heavyweight. It owns the Java
programming language specially designed for Internet applications,
and Solaris, among the most popular commercial operating systems
for the powerful computers that big corporations use to serve up
Internet services like the World Wide Web, e-mail and retail
transactions. It also manufactures a highly respected line of
powerful computers based on its own microprocessor chips.
</P>
<P>
   But for America Online _ and for the big Internet players
against which it will compete _ the real potential gold mine lies
further down the road, perhaps five years away, when people will
venture on line for information or shopping not only from personal
computers but from inexpensive Internet appliances costing $200
each, or maybe included free as part of a subscription service,
just as some cellular phones are now.
</P>
<P>
   Today, being wired remains a comparatively elitist activity _ an
estimated 25 percent of American households had access to the
Internet last year, and 5 percent of households bought merchandise
on line. But the executives at America Online and Netscape hope
that their deal will accelerate the timetable for the day when the
Net is ubiquitous, when people will tap into the World Wide Web
from appliance-like devices, pagers, cell phones, television
set-top boxes or computers as routinely as they use the telephone
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new generation of Internet devices to be able to deliver our
service anywhere is a key part of what this deal is about in the
long run,'' said Stephen M. Case, 40, the chairman of America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   For the present, however, the idea is to make America Online,
the nation's leading online service, the standard way to get onto
the Internet, the executives explained. Netscape, the Internet
pioneer, is a crucial part of that effort, they said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no assurance that this vision of the technological
future will prove accurate or, even if it does, that the America
Online-Netscape combination will lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the long-range game plan helps explain what brought
America Online and Netscape together. And the ability of the
companies' executives to sell that vision to Netscape's whiz-kid
programmers in particular will determine whether the merger
succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., is likely
become a prime target for Silicon Valley headhunters. As is the
case with any software company, Netscape's key asset is its
talented programmers, and many of these code hackers may be
reluctant to work for America Online, which still has a reputation
as a middle-brow service catering to online newcomers, known
derisively as ``newbies.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock options and other financial incentives will be tailored to
try to keep Netscape employees on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these people want to change the world, and we've got to be
clear that joining with America Online, along with the Sun
component, really is a bigger opportunity for us,'' said Marc
Andreessen, the 26-year-old cofounder of Netscape who led a team of
young programmers from the supercomputing center at the University
of Illinois to Silicon Valley to start the Internet software
company in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to be the preeminent Internet company over the next
decade,'' Andreessen declared, speaking from a cell phone on a
streetcorner in Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Andreessen, a Netscape executive vice president,
will become Netscape's chief technology officer for the next three
or four months, until the merger is completed. His new job at
America Online has not yet been determined, but it is likely to be
chief technology officer of the combined company as well, an
America Online executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, according to one Netscape board member, Andreessen has
delivered a 12-page single-spaced memorandum to Case, setting out
his view of the technological road map the new company should
follow into the future, emphasizing the opportunities for
electronic commerce in an environment in which most people are
linked to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape, populated with computing sophisticates, and America
Online, known as an on-ramp to the Internet for the technologically
challenged, seem a corporate odd couple. But the two companies, its
executives explained, had been evolving toward each other for more
than a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from America Online's headquarters in
Dulles, Va., Case described Netscape as an enterprise that had
``morphed itself'' from a company dependent on sales of its
software used to browse the World Wide Web _ and ``in Microsoft's
cross-hairs'' _ into a business that relied on advertising and
other revenues from its popular Netcenter Web site and from selling
software to corporations to handle electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Netscape transformation was largely a reaction to
Microsoft's competitive assault on its browser business _ a central
element in the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft.
Microsoft bundled its browser into its industry-standard Windows
operating system, and gave away the browser for free. The
government alleges these steps were part of a pattern of
anticompetitive practices, while Microsoft maintains the moves were
intended mainly to benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, after laying off workers and suffering a large
loss last year, Netscape announced that it would also distribute
its browser for free. It seems to have stabilized its business
around its new model. Netscape announced Tuesday that it earned
$2.7 million on revenues of $162 million in its fourth fiscal
quarter, which ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   Yet America Online has also changed in the last couple of years,
moving well beyond its reputation as an online service for
beginners. It now has an Internet chat service and runs its own
all-in-one site on the Web, known as a ``portal,'' which includes
e-mail, Internet searching, news, entertainment and online
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``America Online has really changed from a closed online service
for novice users to an Internet media and technology company with a
diverse set of brands,'' Andreessen said. ``These two companies
have been moving in the same direction, and the fit is a good
one.''

 &HT;    Guessing game on over Bush appointees
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore and Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Decisions that Jeb Bush will begin
announcing the week after Thanksgiving will affect the lives of
Floridians more than all promises he made on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   The governor-elect's appointments to 18 state agencies and
nearly 100 boards will play a critical role in determining such
matters as:
</P>
<P>
   Whether the state's Department of Children and Families will
fire state workers in order to contract with private agencies. Bush
made it clear Friday the needs of foster children take precedence:
``Our foster care must be more compassionate and efficient. Though
I want to be considerate of state workers, it will not deter me
from doing what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Who controls Florida's water in the next century. If he wishes,
Bush will be able to remake all fivecq of the state's water
management boards within three years. Because of quirky vacancies,
the change could happen even faster at the Everglades-managing
South Florida Water Management District.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion. An anti-abortion legislator/physician with views
shared by Bush, Rep. Bob Brooks, R-Winter Haven, is a leading
candidate for Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the next developments in South Florida cities are in the
suburbs or downtown. Bush, a developer, must decide how hard he
wants his Department of Community Affairs to enforce
growth-management laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire face of environmental protection in Florida is at
issue here,'' said Charles Lee, senior vice president of the
Florida Audubon Society. ``The appointments will guide whether this
administration lives up to its promises. This is where the rubber
meets the road.''
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach City Commissioner Mary Hooks, who Bush selected
as a policy adviser to his transition team, met Friday in
Tallahassee with a nine-member group that will deal with
environmental agencies.
</P>
<P>
   She revealed little, saying the team's job is to recommend
candidates whose ``policies reflect Jeb Bush's vision . . . we've
got to look at each department in its entirety in 50 days.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Bush will appoint more than 3,000 people in his first
two years., running mate Frank Brogan estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Already, hundreds of resumes have flooded the offices of the
Bush transition team in a fourth-floor office in Tallahassee. One
long shot: a Tampa woman who listed her experience as co-sales
manager at Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County names mentioned include County Commissioner
Mary McCarty and Sheriff Bob Neumann, but both say they plan to
serve out their elected terms.
</P>
<P>
   The incoming governor has sole power to nominate secretaries or
executive directors of 18 agencies, from Corrections to the
Lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The picks must be approved by a Senate committee chaired by Sen.
William G. ``Doc'' Myers, R-Hobe Sound. Bush will share power with
the Cabinet for appointments at several more agencies and has
indicated he may want to keep some department heads in place, such
as Tim Moore at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   With the Department of Transportation, there's talk Bush may
wait until after the legislative session to take action because of
a messy bullet-train debate and other pending business. Democratic
Sen. Jim Hargrett of Tampa, the former Senate transportation
chairman who endorsed Bush, was an early name mentioned for the job
but he may not want it.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush may leave some agencies alone, make no mistake: He
will have tremendous power to make changes right away if he wants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to posts where terms are expiring, there is a huge
backlog of nominations left over from last session. Despite
Democrats' protests, the Republican-controlled Senate never
confirmed 285 nominees of Gov. Lawton Chiles last year.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly stranded nominees included 145 trustees of community
colleges, all but 10 of which are Democrats, including four at Palm
Beach Community College and six at Indian River Community College.
Also in limbo are 37 nominees to the state's five water and
environmental boards, of which 25 were Democrats. In virtually all
cases, Bush is free to put forward his own picks.
</P>
<P>
   Appointments to the Department of Environmental Protection and
the South Florida Water Management District will put a new stamp on
what, for this entire decade, has carried Gov. Lawton Chiles'
imprimatur.
</P>
<P>
   Adding even more intrigue is a 1997 law that directs that the
new governor ``shall'' appoint three members to the South Florida
water board in his first term, and two members in each of the next
three years. The intent: to prevent a new governor from remaking
the water boards in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, however, neglected the case of the water district,
SFWMD, where the terms of five board members began in March 1995
and end on March 1, 1999. In addition, there is a vacancy left
because of board member Eugene Pettis, whom the Senate refused to
confirm this spring.
</P>
<P>
   So does that mean Bush can appoint three members his first year,
or four? Leaving the board with only six or seven members for a
year?
</P>
<P>
   Water district lawyers aren't sure. Neither are lawyers for the
House committees that wrote the bill. Rep. Lee Constantine,
R-Altamonte Springs and chair of the House Resource and Land
Management Council, said it was never the legislature's intention
to leave some geographic areas unrepresented for a year on a water
board, as would happen if one or more vacancies remained opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly if we're going to have openings on the board that
can't be filled, we'll just have to change it,'' he said, promising
a quick new law to fix any problems caused by the last one.
</P>
<P>
   But whether Bush appoints six members in one or two years makes
little difference in the long run: By the end of his first term, he
will have shaped the entire board in the image he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   While some environmentalists viewsee with this trepidation,
others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to find out that Bush is a pretty savvy
guy,'' said Peter Antonacci, who until last year was Attorney
General Bob Butterworth's chief deputy and who now lobbies for The
Everglades Trust.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts, for example, that farmer and cattle rancher Frank
``Sonny'' Williamson Jr., the SFWMD's chairman, will be reappointed
for a third four-year term: a prospect he believes
environmentalists should welcome. ``Just because you're a farmer or
rancher doesn't mean your interests are adverse to ours,''
Antonacci said.
</P>
<P>
   Should change come, some of the most mentioned names as board
members or possible replacements for Executive Director Sam Poole _
a favorite of environmentalists _ include former Deputy Executive
Director Tom MacVicar, who narrowly lost to Poole for the top spot
in 1994, and former district spokeswoman Cathy Vogel. Both work as
consultants to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the rumor mill: retired Army Corps of Engineers
commander Terry Rice, who is a consultant to the Miccosukee Indian
tribe, and Ken Adams, a former board member and ex-Palm Beach
County commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Poole said he has no plans to leave, but even he has heard the
rumors. For example, he said he's heard that former district
Chairman Jim Garner _ a Fort Myers agribusiness and development
lawyer _ has been recruiting people to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   But Garner said that's news to him. ``I'm not aware of a
throw-Sam-out movement,'' he said before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam and I have been friends for years,'' Garner added,
although he acknowledged that ``If I had a complaint about Sam,
it's that I believe he lacks the management skills and management
training to deal with a 1,600-person agency. . . . I guess time
will tell whether he's been effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Eva Armstrong, a lobbyist for the Audubon Society, said Bush
promised to extend the Preservation 2000 land-buying program and to
continue Everglades restoration during the campaign, and that he
will be obligated now to reflect those commitments in his
appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``My instinct tells me that the appointments he makes the first
year will be the most balanced we'll see,'' she said, scoffing at
some worries that Bush will fill the board with road pavers and
sugar growers. ``I'm not sure it'll be all pavers, at least
initially. Or at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Dunbar, a prominent Republican lobbyist and a decade ago
the general counsel to Gov. Bob Martinez, said Bush has far more
pressing worries in the next two months than filling vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be astounded if they've even thought about these,'' Dunbar
said. ``They have hundreds, HUNDREDS, of appointments that have got
to be made first.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar denied any interest in running the Department of
Environmental Protection, as some rumors in Tallahassee would have
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumors are running wild in this town.'' he said, adding
that he had heard Curt Kiser was a possibility for the job but
would be surprised if he took it. Kiser said he wasn't interested.
</P>
<P>
   Antonacci said he had heard that Martinez' running mate in 1990,
former Monroe County sheriff Allison DeFoor, was interested in the
DEP position. ``Rest assured: I'm sure Sally (Bradshaw) is handling
it,'' Antonacci said.
</P>
<P>
   A state legislator who opposes abortion, Rep. Bob Brooks,
R-Winter Park, is a name frequently heard for Secretary of Health.
Bush shares Brooks' views though he said during the campaign he was
not in favor of any drastic action without a wide consensus.
</P>
<P>
   The man Brooks would replace, James T. Howell of Palm Beach
County, took a cautious approach to Brooks-sponsored legislation
that required the state to give women seeking abortions a pamphlet
about risks and alternatives. The size and content of the
three-fold pamphlet came under fire from abortion foes., who said
it was not nearly as bold or straightforward as publications in
other states. Distribution was halted by a court injunction that is
still in place while a constitutional challenge to the law is
decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he (Brooks) would be a good selection,'' said Mike
McCarran, executive director of the Florida Catholic Conference.
``I think he has the credentials and experience to be a good
director of that agency.''
</P>
<P>
   People who say they support abortion rights expressed concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only problem I have with Brooks is he is anti-choice,''
said Charlene Carres, a women's rights attorney in Tallahassee. ``I
know he's a very caring physician.'' who treats AIDS and HIV
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   As an agency head, Brooks would have to carry out laws passed by
the legislature, though his own judgment would come into play in
sometimes subtle ways, Carres said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the state gathers statistics on abortion, but there
have been debates about whether the state should obtain more
specific personal information, such as age, ethnicity and other
characteristics. Doing so might help identify them in smaller
communities, Carres argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I hear is Brooks, Brooks, Brooks,'' said one
Department of Health employee. ``I think Howell thought for a while
he would not be replaced, but that doesn't seem to be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he talked last week with Broward County Circuit Judge
Kathleen Kearney though he did not get into specifics about the
Children and Families job. A call to her chambers was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Manatee County Sheriff Charlie Wells, who has led pilot efforts
to have child-investigative and foster services assumed by private
or law-enforcement agencies, is on Bush's transition team. He could
wind up part of the Bush administration as well.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he would try to be creative with state employees who
might be displaced by privatization efforts, perhaps shifting them
to other jobs, but their welfare should not be the overwhelming
priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to focus on the children we are serving,'' Bush said.
``Not on who's providing the service.''

 &HT;    Smoke not cleared yet over lawsuit
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ The fight over legal fees in the state's
tobacco lawsuit isn't quite over, and a last-ditch appeal by three
of the state's trial lawyers has at least temporarily delayed
approval of a $1.7 billion bonus Florida won from the industry two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday lawyers for the state asked a judge to formally
approve a deal with cigarette makers giving the state $1.7 billion
over the next five years _ elevating the total settlement to $12.7
billion _ and expanding restrictions on advertising of tobacco
products.
</P>
<P>
   A judge must approve the deal so its provisions can be enforced
by the court.
</P>
<P>
   But retired state Supreme Court Justice James Alderman, the
seventh judge to oversee the suit since 1995, said he could not
approve the deal because some of the lawyers are seeking a new
hearing before the Florida Supreme Court on their fees. Until the
high court decides on the hearing or grants him jurisdiction, he
can't rule, Alderman said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Licko, a lawyer for the state, said the deal must be
ratified soon if the state is to collect its first payment under
the agreement, $123 million, on Jan. 4 as scheduled. The state
won't get the money until 30 days after the agreement is approved,
when the time for appeals has expired.
</P>
<P>
   Additional restrictions, such as the ban on sales of T-shirts
and other merchandise bearing the logos of cigarette brands, are
set to be in place on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Three trial lawyers hired by the state _ Bob Montgomery of West
Palm Beach, Sheldon Schlesinger of Fort Lauderdale and Bob Kerrigan
of Pensacola _ have sought to be paid under a contract they and
other lawyers signed with the state; that would give the trial team
25 percent of the settlement. The rest of the trial team has agreed
to have fees determined by arbitrators, a plan proposed in the
state's 1997 settlement with the industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13, the Florida Supreme Court ruled the lawyers had a
valid fee contract, but could not file liens against the money
being paid to the state. To collect their fee, the lawyers would
have to file a breach-of-contract lawsuit against the state,
something they are loath to do because they would still need
legislators'approval to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, for one, said he was ready to give up his case _ and
another suit he filed against other trial team members _ after the
high court's ruling. But now he's reluctant to go to arbitration
because doing so requires the ``consent'' of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very difficult time believing what anyone says,''
Montgomery said.

 &HT;    Rare shark fatality remains mystery
 &HT;    By staff reporters
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When 9-year-old James Willie Tellasmon
vanished from the surf under a sunny sky about 40 yards off the
Vero Beach shoreline Saturday, chance as much as nature conspired
against him.
</P>
<P>
   James became one of the very rare victims of a fatal shark
attack, an event that hasn't occurred at a Florida beach in 22
years.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities and shark experts say they might never know exactly
what happened to the boy as he swam in 8 to 9 feet of water with
his mother's boyfriend. The attack happened fast, and left little
evidence. Moments later, the only trace was a toy gun floating in
the water, one rescuer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any fin, any thrashing, any lifting the person
out of the water,'' said William ``Billy'' Heffelfinger, 30, who
helped pull the boyfriend, Jimmy Wilson, to shore before returning
to search for James.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the kid had vanished and . . . a shark crossed my
mind because I said, you know, as much fight as (James) was putting
up, he's got to at least splash or show some bubbles or something.
It was like he fought his last battle.''
</P>
<P>
   James had a far better chance being struck by lightning, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida leads the world in the number of shark attacks _
25 occurred off its beaches last year _ they are seldom deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to the family on this. It doesn't make them
feel any better this was the result of a statistically rare
event,'' said George Burgess, a University of Florida biologist and
curator of the International Shark Attack File at the school's
Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess theorizes that a large shark _ any shark over 6 feet is
a threat to humans _ was in the area hunting for bait fish on a
small reef in the area, in front of a sharp drop in the ocean
floor. Sharks had been sighted earlier. On Nov. 11, about 2 miles
away on a stretch of unguarded beach 300 yards south of South Beach
park, a 13-year-old boy was bitten by a small shark as he walked
through the surf, said Vero Beach Police Chief Jim Gabbard, who
fielded calls Tuesday from reporters across the country and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark could have grabbed him and pulled him over the edge
of the bar,'' said Burgess.
</P>
<P>
   In October and November, mullet and other fish begin migrating
from rivers and lagoons into deeper, warmer water. Sharks follow.
Some species head south for warm water while others remain offshore
foraging, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically when sharks mistake swimmer for bait, they immediately
release their hold and rarely cause serious injury. Scientists call
this a hit-and-run attack. Bigger sharks will bump their prey
before biting. Sometimes, but more seldom, a shark will launch a
sneak attack, usually in deep water. In both cases the shark
continues the attack with repeated bites.
</P>
<P>
   James' small size could have played a part in the shark not
releasing him, Burgess said. He also could not say whether other
sharks scavenged the body after that.
</P>
<P>
   Along the east coast, migrating sharks are often closer to
bathers because the continental shelf narrows, unlike the Gulf
Coast where attacks are far more infrequent, said Dr. Carl Luer of
the Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, James came to the beach for a family outing, said
Vero Beach Detective Dan Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 2 p.m., he and Wilson were swimming when
Heffelfinger, who was playing football with a half dozen friends,
noticed them struggling in water 100 yards north of the guarded
shore on Jaycee Beach and raced down the beach, Heffelfinger said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he reached Wilson, James had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I looked at (Wilson), another five to 10 yards, that's
where I last saw the boy. When I didn't see him come up any more, I
took the father and got to beach. I said, `Where's the boy, where's
the boy?' It was apparent he was already in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Heffelfinger said he handed Wilson off to his friend, Chad
Taylor, and swam back to look for the boy. He said he dove under
again and again until three lifeguards arrived minutes later.
Within 15 minutes, police and fire department divers arrived,
Gabbard said.
</P>
<P>
   The search continued until dark without any trace of the boy or
a shark, and resumed about 5:45 a.m. Sunday. About 7:22 a.m.,
divers found James' torso and legs. His head and arms are still
missing, Gabbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess plans to review autopsy findings in hopes of getting a
better idea of what happened to James.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, we'll certainly be able to tell the size (of
the shark). The species may never be known. If a tooth fragment was
left behind, we can usually tell. But more than likely, we'll never
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Coast Medical examiner Frederick Hobin's office said no
teeth were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   While yellow and blue flags warning of currents, bait fish,
jellyfish and Portuguese man-of-war flew along Vero's beaches
Tuesday, there was no sign of sharks, said lifeguard Capt. Tom
Adams. Guards typically keep an eye on bait fish for splashing or
jumping that would indicate predator fish, he said. There are no
plans to change the way the area's seven beaches are guarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't control what's out there in the ocean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Sheriff's Office might sweep the beach with its
helicopter during routine patrols, Gabbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Burgess suggests swimmers use common sense: get out
of the water if there's a shark and get out of the water if there
are a lot of bait fish. Sharks are attracted to irregular
splashing. In 1988, a swimmer diving from a boat with a small dog
off Bay County was killed by a shark. The dog probably lured the
shark, Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic this is all happening now because over the last 15
years the story on sharks has not been shark attacks man, but man
attacks shark. The reality is in Florida, as well as other areas,
shark populations are in very sharp decline as result of over
fishing by sport and commercial fishermen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key to the whole situation, one bathers tend to forget, is
when you enter the ocean, you're entering a wilderness.''
</P>

 &HT;    Settle in for good acting, action from negotiators Jackson,
Spacey
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Negotiator'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   In this crisply acted thriller, Samuel L. Jackson plays a
hostage negotiator who's framed for skimming millions from the
police department's disability fund. Refusing to be jailed on false
charges, he takes four Internal Affairs officers hostage, then
insists on a jackpot negotiator (Kevin Spacey) to act as mediator
between himself and his former colleagues, who are outside the
building hoping to smoke Jackson out. Or kill him. The movie's main
kick is the duel of bluffs and counterbluffs between Spacey and
Jackson, but director F. Gary Gray remembers the meat and potatoes
of this genre: lots of action scenes. Match that with some terrific
acting, and the movie takes no hostages. Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Also directed by F. Gary Gray: ``Friday'' and ``Set It Off.''

EDITORIAL: SLOVAKIA'S DEMOCRATIC TURN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25:
</P>
<P>
   Recent parliamentary elections in Slovakia have freed the
country from the heavy boot of Vladimir Meciar, its dominant figure
since the end of communism. Meciar engineered the breakup of
Czechoslovakia, turned Slovakia's institutions into his political
machine and allowed his friends to loot the treasury. The coalition
of parties that defeated him has made a promising start, but it
will need sustained unity and help from the West to solve the many
problems Meciar left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Although Meciar is skilled at blaming others _ Gypsies, the
Hungarian minority, the Czech Republic _ for his failures, voters
got wise. A get-out-the-vote drive by the opposition resulted in 85
percent turnout and a defeat for Meciar's nationalist party.
</P>
<P>
   The new government is a coalition of rightist parties, former
communists and Hungarians. But it quickly agreed on a program that
emphasizes economic reform. The center-right prime minister,
Mikulas Dzurinda, and his partners also agree that Slovakia must
look toward Europe, rather than Russia and Ukraine as Meciar had.
</P>
<P>
   Slovakia's health and education systems are bankrupt and its
banks teetering. The treasury is empty, in part because many of the
state's factories were sold at fire-sale prices to Meciar's party
colleagues, which also kept foreign investment out.
</P>
<P>
   The harm Meciar did to Slovakia's political culture was just as
great. He routinely ignored constitutional court decisions and made
the state intelligence agents into his political thugs. The new
government has restored a respected former director to the
intelligence service and plans to establish some oversight. Tuesday
Dzurinda met with his Czech counterpart and pledged closer ties,
reversing Meciar's policy of hostility. The government is also
promising to end harassment of the media, unions and
nongovernmental groups. It has already created the post of deputy
prime minister for minorities and human rights and appointed an
ethnic Hungarian, a positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of compromise suffocated in Slovakia under communism
and then under Meciar. The new government could easily unravel in
partisan bickering. It will take pressure from European
institutions and the Slovaks themselves to keep the coalition
focused on Slovakia's daunting problems.

SPORTS COLUMN: DIMAGGIO, FAILING, IS 84 WEDNESDAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the press room of Yankee Stadium not long ago I
saw Joe DiMaggio sitting at a table with a few friends. Even in
repose he looked elegant, still trim in his dark suit, hair graying
and thin but neatly coiffed. I was reminded of a remark by Henry
Kissinger when he sat near DiMaggio in the owner's box in Yankee
Stadium. The Yankees had lost a playoff game and Kissinger, on the
way out, had said, ``Joe, put on a uniform _ they can use you.'' In
the mind's eye, Joe still could lope after a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   When I saw DiMaggio then, I related to him an unfortunate
incident that happened to him some 45 years ago and which he didn't
know about.
</P>
<P>
   I was a small boy growing up in Chicago in the 1950s, I told
him, and aware of the DiMaggio legend, as was anyone else who
followed baseball in America. I had written to the Yankees for a
photograph of him, was sent a glossy head shot with him in his
baseball cap, and nailed the picture to my bedroom wall. The
unfortunate part, I told DiMaggio, was that I hammered the nail
right through his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You did?'' he said, wincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like it's OK now,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah,'' he said. ``I heal fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marks DiMaggio's 84th birthday, and one wonders if he
can heal as he lies in a hospital in Hollywood, Fla., amid reports
that he has been battling lung cancer as well as pneumonia. He is
fighting for his life. One wonders whether the man who once hit in
56 straight big-league games, a record that has stood for 57 years,
can summon the energy and, perhaps, the requisite miracle to regain
health.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his admission to the hospital on Oct. 12, DiMaggio's
name was in the news, in an indirect fashion. The Yankees' sterling
center fielder, Bernie Williams, the American League's leading
hitter and Gold Glove fly-chaser, heir to DiMaggio and Mickey
Mantle, and a free agent, has been in controversial negotiations
with the Yankees. Williams is as distinguished a ballplayer, if not
as iconic, as his famous predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult for fans to imagine that their athletic heroes
are vulnerable to everything human. The youth of the ballplayer,
or, sometimes, even the coach, is eternal, if only in photographs
and film _ DiMaggio in his baggy pinstripes is still rapping out
hits in his familiar long stride and sweeping stroke of the bat _
and in our memory.
</P>
<P>
   Red Holzman can still be seen in that fashion in the huddle,
instructing Bradley and Frazier, and Weeb Ewbank may be forever
visualized discussing strategy with a mud-splattered Joe Namath on
the sidelines. In that sense, Coach Holzman of the New York Knicks
and Coach Ewbank of the New York Jets, both who died recently,
remain vital to us.
</P>
<P>
   And Catfish Hunter, because of the Lou Gehrig's disease he has,
may soon lose such control in his muscles that he will be unable to
even grip a baseball. Such thoughts seem to fall off the radar
screen of our comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with Joe D., that intensely proud man, that
sometimes impatient and unforgiving man, who, the Yankee management
knew, would be insulted if, at Old-Timers' Day, he should not be
the last announced.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I apologized for pounding that nail into his head, I
gave DiMaggio a photograph of him and Marilyn Monroe taken by
Richard Sanborn, who is now a judicial magistrate living in
Maryland. Sanborn had been a sergeant in the Army stationed in
Tokyo in 1954 when DiMaggio and Monroe went on their honeymoon to
Japan. I had done a column on DiMaggio and Sanborn sent the photo
to me to give to DiMaggio, saying he had always wanted Joe to have
it and didn't know how to get it to him. Would I do it? I did.
</P>
<P>
   As most people know, bringing up his former wife to DiMaggio
would end any conversation with him. It was too personal. But I
handed DiMaggio the photograph. He thought it was great. ``And this
guy was just an amateur photographer?'' DiMaggio said. ``I've got
to send him a note and thank him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, alone with DiMaggio, I said, ``Marilyn looked
beautiful in the picture.'' ``She was beautiful,'' DiMaggio said,
as though relating an insight.
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Joe, there's a question I've always wanted to ask you,
if you don't mind.'' He nodded, knitting his brow. ``There's that
great anecdote first written by Gay Talese,'' I went on, ``about
when you were in Japan and Marilyn was asked by the brass to
entertain the troops in Korea. When she returned to your hotel
room, you asked how it went and she said, `Oh, Joe, you never heard
such cheering!' And you said quietly, `Yes I have.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it happen?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' DiMaggio said, ``it did.''

MARKET PLACE: CAN RHONE-POULENC AND HOECHST BE EQUAL PARTNERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After engaging in one of the slowest-moving courtships ever
between two companies, the French drug maker Rhone-Poulenc SA and
Hoechst AG of Germany are expected to announce their merger as
early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   The two drug giants have spent much of the last year discussing
a possible deal, but have only recently begun to complete the
details. One executive involved in the negotiations confirmed
Tuesday that Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst had agreed on a management
team for the new company but remained stumped on how to structure a
merger of equals.
</P>
<P>
   The problem appears to be twofold. There is a large difference
in the market capitalizations of the two companies. If
Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst were to merge, the German company would
control 59 percent of the new entity. Further complicating matters,
executives at both companies believe the French government will
reject a deal that allows Rhone-Poulenc's pharmaceutical holdings
to be controlled by a foreign company.
</P>
<P>
   Rhone-Poulenc officials have traveled to Frankfurt, where
Hoechst has its headquarters, to complete the negotiations,
according to the executive, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity. Once the structure of the deal is completed, it will be
presented to both companies' boards. Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst
executives hope their boards will begin deliberations on the merger
as early next week. Both companies declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal is announced, it will rival in scope the three
failed drug-industry mergers earlier this year. Many drug makers
are scrambling to become life-sciences companies, with holdings in
biotechnology, agriculture and pharmaceuticals, and a combination
of Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst would be the world leader.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the two companies would vault themselves to the
top of two industries simultaneously. After being second-tier drug
makers for years, Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc would have $11.25
billion in global drug sales, a narrow second to Merck &AMP; Co.,
according to IMS Health, a consulting firm. Hoechst and
Rhone-Poulenc would also knock off Novartis as the world's leading
seller of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts appear irritated at the slow progress of the
merger discussions, the companies' investors have seldom enjoyed
such a robust ride. Even though Hoechst's American depository
receipts closed yesterday at $45.9375, down $1.125, the company's
ADRs have jumped 26 percent since Oct. 13. Rhone-Poulenc's ADRs,
which rose 56.25 cents Tuesday to close at $50.9375, have increased
38 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   While many analysts have been skeptical that a deal would ever
be completed, many have begun to change their minds, given the
progress Rhone Poulenc and Hoechst have made in the negotiations.
The industry's three other megadeals _ involving American Home
Products, SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome _ failed largely
because the companies could not agree on who should run the merged
entities.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc have already agreed on several key
issues. Richard Markham, who heads Hoechst's pharmaceuticals unit,
will head the merged company's drug division, while Alain Godard,
Rhone-Poulenc's top agribusiness executive, will manage the
combined agrochemicals business, according to the executive
involved in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company will have a management board led by Hoechst
chief executive Juergen Dormann and a supervisory board headed by
Rhone-Poulenc chief Jean-Rene Fourtou.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc will structure a
merger of equals. The executives have discussed forming a holding
company, in which Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst would each own a 50
percent stake. While that will make both companies equal, it is
certain to spark criticism among Hoechst's investors, who may feel
short-changed by their 50 percent take.
</P>
<P>
   With the extended negotiations, analysts have been given plenty
of time to scrutinize the companies' balance sheets. While many
European and American analysts never liked the pairing of Hoechst
with Rhone-Poulenc, they now have a growing list of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One major concern is the heady amount of debt on both companies'
balance sheets. Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a
biopharmaceutical investment research firm in New York, calculated
that debt minus cash and its equivalents of a combined Hoechst with
Rhone-Poulenc would total 75 percent of its market value. European
analysts say levels of 30 percent to 40 percent are generally
acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analysis about this deal is not to do it,'' Mehta said.
``The two companies can't change their fundamentals. They can't
seem to agree on the basics; that's why they're considering all
these structures. If they decide on a holding company, that
structure is just inherently inefficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though a combined Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc will be the
world's second-leading drug seller, many analysts doubt the company
will remain there. Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc each need a stronger
U.S. presence, and their merger does little to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc complete their merger, the
two companies would still be Munchkins in a land of American
giants. Despite being the second-leading drug seller in the world,
they would rank 12 in the United States, according to IMS Health,
with slightly more than half the sales of Merck and Pfizer. Hoechst
and Rhone-Poulenc would need another $1.2 billion in U.S. drug
sales just to break into the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to see how Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc are going to
achieve a critical mass to make more of a dent than they already
have,'' said Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst with Southeast
Research Partners. ``We'll just have to wait and see the details of
the merger.''

WHERE THERE'S LIFE AFTER `THE END'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   Margalit Fox is an editor for The New York Times Book Review.  
 (af)  
 By MARGALIT FOX   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the beginning, there was simply ``The End.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, there are gaffers, best boys and Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood movie credits, which began as modest lists, have grown
over the years into lumbering behemoths as extravagant _ and
seemingly as time-consuming _ as the films they accompany.
</P>
<P>
   ``End credits have become completely absurd,'' said Andrew
Sarris, the film critic of The New York Observer. ``There was one
movie _ I don't remember the name _ where the credits went on and
on. I happened to be tired and just sat there. And one of the
credit lines was, `If you left at the beginning of these credits,
you'd be home by now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   For today's movie directors, end titles have become a place
simultaneously to acknowledge indebtedness, flaunt the size of
one's budget, make a final bid to woo audiences and, occasionally,
to have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers, for their part, must now routinely decide whether to
stay till the last gaffer has gasped his last gasp or to unstick
their feet from the floor and flee as soon as the credits begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can tell how much people like the movie by the
percentage of the audience that stays,'' said the director John
Waters, whose most recent film is ``Pecker.'' ``If the entire
audience jumps up when the credit roll starts, then they didn't
like the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Among recent contenders, the hands-down favorite for sheer
credit volume is the 197-minute, $200-million ``Titanic.'' Its
final credit crawl acknowledges (among hundreds of others) Steward
No. 4 and Slovakian 3-Year-Old Boy; First-Class Husband and
Third-Class Woman; a Drapes Master and Drapes Assistants;
Production Accountants and Construction Accountants; a Children's
Guardian, some Lead Inferno Artists and a Union Doctor; a Water
Systems Engineer and a Tank Technician; Lifeguards, Model Makers
and a Choreographer/Etiquette Coach.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond necklace is by Asprey London and the cast album by
Sony Classical; thank-you's go to the Mexican Minister of Tourism
and the Nova Scotia Film Commission _ all scrolling by as Ms. Dion
bleats out the film's treacly anthem. Seven and a half minutes have
seldom felt longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all right,'' Waters said. ``Because then all those
people who are sobbing can pull themselves together: the women to
fix their makeup, the men to blot away the tears so they're not
embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. Early silent films barely had credits
at all. By the 1920s, movies would open with a short list, usually
lasting less than a minute, naming the principal actors, the
director and the producer. Closing credits were almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, as a way of reinforcing stars' names in the public
mind, cast lists began to be reiterated _ briefly _ at the end of
movies. In the early 1930s, Universal Studios started prefacing its
closing credits with the signature line ``A Good Cast Is Worth
Repeating.'' (The phrase was dusted off this year for ``Gods and
Monsters,'' about James Whale, the director of the first first two
Universal ``Frankenstein'' films.)
</P>
<P>
   Literary adaptations might acknowledge their source material as
well, sometimes with hilarious results. ``Mary Pickford and Douglas
Fairbanks did a 1929 version of `Taming of the Shrew,' '' Sarris
said. ``And the credit read: `Play by William Shakespeare.
Additional Dialogue by Sam Taylor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the wardrobe designer, members of the technical crew
were seldom billed. Camera operators, sound men and the like were
employees of the studios; their weekly paycheck was deemed
sufficient credit. But over the years, as the studio system
crumbled and the apparatus of moviemaking grew larger, opening
credits became more crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casablanca'' (1942) is typical of its day. Besides the actors,
producer and director, the opening credits acknowledge a dialogue
director, a makeup artist, ``gowns,'' ``montages'' and ``orchestral
arrangements,'' all in just over a minute. The closing credit?
Still a simple ``The End.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and 60s, new cinematic technologies gave opening
credits even more to account for. The credits of ``An Affair to
Remember'' (1957) are nearly two minutes long and, right up front
with Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr, give the nod to ``Cinemascope
Lenses by Bausch &AMP; Lomb,'' ``Color by De Luxe'' and the title song,
``sung by Vic Damone.'' It's a wonder anyone stuck around to watch
the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The longer credits also reflected larger changes in the
moviegoing experience. ``I grew up in the 30s and 40s in the age of
double features,'' Sarris said. ``In those days, they showed a lot
of other things: newsreels, sometimes short subjects, cartoons.
They had free-plate night and sweepstakes. So it was a very
cluttered evening in the theater. And the tendency of the studios
was not to add to the clutter with a lot of titles.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the rise of television and the resulting decline of B
movies, a single feature eventually had to carry an entire bill.
Expanding the opening credits helped flesh out the evening. By the
1950s, the best of these credit sequences were art forms unto
themselves: witness the stunning title designs of Saul Bass
(``Vertigo,'' ``Anatomy of a Murder'') and, in the 60s and 70s, the
jazzy, animated openings of the ``Pink Panther'' films.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If a movie's credits were especially unwieldy, a director could
choose to open with a precredit sequence designed to reel audiences
into the narrative before the onslaught of names began. Sometimes,
as in ``The Horse Whisperer,'' the whole film is a precredit
sequence, with the title appearing only at the end.
</P>
<P>
   The growing clout of Hollywood labor unions also meant longer
credits. Today, under the rules of the Screen Actors Guild, an
actor who utters even a word on camera must often be billed. Then
there are the crew members, like the gaffer (the chief
electrician), best boy (an assistant or apprentice), key grip (the
head handyman) and Foley artist (who creates postproduction sound
effects).
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that producers add copyright acknowledgments
for songs on the soundtrack. And for films shot on location,
courtesy may compel heartfelt thanks to the citizenry of entire
burgs.
</P>
<P>
   By the 70s and 80s, films threatened to bog down under the
accumulated weight of their opening credits. ``Somewhere along the
line, all of this material, which would include drivers and
caterers, got pushed to the end,'' said Damien Bona, a co-author of
``Inside Oscar: The Unofficial History of the Academy Awards.''
``Now in the opening credits, one tends to get only `major workers'
on the film.''
</P>
<P>
   With the credits shunted to the back, contemporary filmmakers
must resort to tricks to induce the audience to stay. Some, like
Peter and Bobby Farrelly (``There's Something About Mary''), leaven
their credits with snippets from the cutting-room floor.
</P>
<P>
   The martial arts virtuoso Jackie Chan (``Rush Hour'') intercuts
outtakes of stunts that went comically _ sometimes painfully _
awry. Comedy directors, like the team of Zucker, Abrahams and
Zucker (``Airplane!''), may weave pseudocredits (``Topping for
Brownies,'' ``Things To Do After the Movie'') in among the real
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``By making the credits interesting, you are enabling people to
see the so-called `little people' that worked on the movie,''
Waters said. ``So a director that does that is being very
supportive of his crew.''
</P>
<P>
   Waters himself is no stranger to artful closing credits. At the
end of ``Serial Mom,'' for instance, he ran a line that read, ``No
Flies Were Harmed in the Making of This Film.''
</P>
<P>
   Closing credits are also a last chance for the filmmaker to
seduce the audience. ``The most important thing with any movie is
word of mouth; (italics)that(end italics) you cannot buy,'' Waters
said. ``So when those credits come on, that's when people are
thinking whether they liked it or not and what they're going to say
to the person they're with. That's the beginning of word of
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   A director doesn't need deep pockets to have long credits.
``It's not just the big-budget movies with 2,000 special effects
and the big rock tunes: it's also the small independent movies that
look like they were made in a garage,'' Sarris said. ``They credit
somebody who lent the beach chairs for the beach scene and also
people who lent moral encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a medium where product endorsements have become ever more
blatant, producers are only too happy to give credit where credit
is due _ if it means they can snag a freebie in return.
</P>
<P>
   Bona savors the memory of one such acknowledgment, from the
credits of ``He Knows You're Alone,'' a 1981 slasher picture most
notable for being Tom Hanks's first film. ``In the listing of
special thanks,'' Bona recalled, ``the producers gave special
thanks to the Hoffritz cutlery company.''
</P>

 &HT;    NTSB to look at Viagra connection in crash
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELRAY BEACH _ Federal investigators are wondering whether
Viagra played a role in the deadly crash of a Delray Beach, Fla.
man's airplane in a Maryland creek Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   William G. Knight, 56, a former stockbroker, safari hunter and
sometime actor, carried a prescription bottle of Viagra in his
luggage, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Matthew
Furman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-impotence drug can affect a pilot's ability to
distinguish between different colors, including blue and green,
Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said.
Those colors are used in runway lighting and in cockpit
instruments, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB knows of no crashes related to Viagra, Furman said.
</P>
<P>
   But an FAA pamphlet issued in October to doctors who perform
physicals on pilots recommends ``six hours from Viagra to
throttle.'' That's enough time for the drug to pass through the
body.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB sent Knight's blood and tissue samples to an FAA lab in
Oklahoma Tuesday to test for alcohol and drugs, Furman said. The
results are expected within two weeks.

   Furman stressed that the NTSB simply is gathering information to
do a thorough investigation and has cast its net wide to include
possible Viagra use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be remiss if we didn't find out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Greer of Lake Park, who routinely gives pilots
required physicals, said he doubts Viagra had a direct effect on
Knight's crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would a guy take it if he's going to get in his plane
alone?'' Greer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Maryland medical examiner determined that Knight died from
head injuries and drowning.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Knight's plane sputtered before crashing about
5:43 p.m., and Larry Walker, chief pilot for Anne Arundel County
Police, surmised that Knight overshot the runway, then crashed in
the creek as he turned to make another pass.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB will investigate whether Knight refueled at two
scheduled stops along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a former naval intelligence officer, had flown 30 hours
in his RV-6 two-seater, which professionals had built from a kit.
Knight had landed at the Lee Airport outside of Annapolis, Md.,
before, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Family members recalled Knight as an adventurer who played small
roles in Oliver Stone movies, including Born on the Fourth of July
and Wall Street. The thrice-divorced father of two loved living on
the edge, wrote articles for magazines, restored World War II
planes and flew in air shows, his brother, Morton F. Knight said.

 SECURITY COUNCIL GETS IRAQ REPORT AND TAKES NO ACTION  (jw) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The chief arms inspector for Iraq, Richard
Butler, told the Security Council on Tuesday that he was
disappointed with Iraq's cooperation with resumed inspections,
particularly the refusal to produce any documents that the
inspectors requested.
</P>
<P>
   The council took no action beyond noting his report and agreeing
to continue discussing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats described the meeting as not confrontational, with no
real challenges to Butler, as the Iraqis have demanded. He was
asked by some council members to explain why the U.N. Special
Commission, which monitors the weapons program, needed to see the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The tension and crisis atmosphere of the last two weeks is gone
from the council, and there seems to be a general agreement by
critics and supporters of Iraq that President Saddam Hussein of
Iraq should have time to demonstrate amply how he intends to
proceed before punishment or rewards are rendered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a crisis,'' Shen Guofang of China said. ``This is
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Lavrov of Russia also took a low-key approach, diplomats
said, describing the confrontation over documents as something that
should be worked out between Butler and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington officials sought to portray firm resolve in
dealing with Iraq a day after having signaled a new policy of
patience. Officials used somewhat tougher language than they did on
Monday in addressing the refusal on documents that relate to
suspected weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe Iraq should be in the position of declaring
unilaterally that documents are irrelevant to the needs and
requests of the UNSCOM inspectors,'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen sai at a news session with Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping
of Germany. ``So we will continue to follow it. But much depends
upon the level and degree of cooperation on the part of the
Iraqis.''
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart would not say whether
Iraqi resistance would set off American military action. ``We
remain very skeptical of their intentions,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a National Security Council spokesman, said
Washington was not satisfied with Iraq since it agreed 10 days ago
to resume unfettered access.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations on Tuesday morning the Security Council
voted, over Iraqi objections, to renew for an additional six months
the program under which limited quantities of oil are sold to pay
for civilian programs. The unanimous vote without a debate was
taken after several delegations, led by Russia, had proposed
changes to the plan at the behest of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The changes received no support, diplomats said, because the
plan is demonstrating some success at improving conditions in Iraq.
Childhood malnutrition has, for example, leveled off, officials
say, and more than $444 million in medicine has been imported in
two years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``These delegations dropped their requests in favor of a very
quick consensus,'' said Antonio Monteiro of Portugal, chairman of
the council's Iraq sanctions committee. ``This is very positive. It
shows the awareness of the humanitarian impact of this operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has not said whether it will continue in the program,
however. It is left to the Iraqis to decide in consultation with
the United Nations how the money will be allocated, and the Iraqi
proposals have to be reviewed in New York before goods are bought.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Iraq has expanded its requests from basic goods
like food and medicine to items like telephone equipment and
computers for schools. Under the program Iraq has built up or
renewed commercial ties with a range of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf wrote to the
council, asking that the current six-month phase be extended only
an additional two months because Iraq was incapable of producing
the $5.2 billion in oil now allowed to be sold every 180 days.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials would also like a shorter renewal period,
because they are pressing to have sanctions lifted so that oil can
be sold freely, making the program irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that the United States and Britain are holding up
approval of imported equipment and chemical supplies that
independent experts said Iraq needed to upgrade its oil fields and
pipelines. The first shipment, barrels of chemical agents to clean
crude oil, did not begin to arrive in Iraq until this week.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials say much of the reason that Iraq has been unable
to meet the target stems not as much from missing parts and
supplies as from the fall in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations takes nearly one-third off the top of
earnings under the program for a compensation fund that benefits
victims of Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait and for
protected Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. The program also pays the
expenses of the U.N. Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of what could be drawn-out negotiations on several
fronts with Iraq, officials in Baghdad confirmed Tuesday that the
Iraqi representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, would
leave at the end of the year and that his replacement would be his
deputy, Saeed Hasan, an economist educated at the Sorbonne.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdoon, the ambassador to Washington in the 1980s who is widely
considered to have been an effective voice for Iraq there and in
New York since 1992, said in an interview that he expected to
return to a post in the Foreign Ministry.

REPORTS OF MILITARY EXECUTIONS IN EAST TIMOR TO BE INVESTIGATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia's National Commission on Human
Rights will investigate accusations that soldiers executed as many
as 50 people this month in the troubled province of East Timor in a
military operation against armed rebels, the government said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marzuki Darusman, the commission's vice president, said a senior
commission member would investigate allegations of the executions
and of arbitrary arrests by the armed forces between Nov. 10 and
Nov. 16 in the subdistrict of Alas on East Timor's southern coast.
</P>
<P>
   He said the investigator would be Clementino Dos Reis Amaral, a
commission member from East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``very reliable sources,'' the former Portuguese governor
of East Timor, Mario Carrascalao, said Tuesday that he has been
told that 42 people had been executed and more than 40 wounded and
that 200 others were missing in the Alas area.
</P>
<P>
   Carrascalao, speaking in Jakarta, said he was willing to go
himself to help investigate the allegations. He said the area where
the killings were reported was also a site for resettlement of
Javanese under a contentious government program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know the real truth about what happened,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Committee of the Red Cross said Tuesday that a
team it sent to the area had found ``no confirmation of large-scale
atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, the former colonial ruler of East Timor, suspended
U.N.-brokered talks with Indonesia in New York on Friday after
receiving the first reports that civilians had been killed in an
area where guerrillas are active. Carrascalao said the talks were
to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor was invaded by Indonesia in 1975 and annexed the
following year in a move never recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the East Timor capital, Dili, as many as 2,000 East Timorese
students continue to occupy the local parliament building in
protest against the alleged killings by the Indonesian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian-based East Timor Human Rights Center, considered
the main watchdog group for East Timorese rights, issued a
statement Tuesday accusing the Indonesian military of executing 50
East Timorese and arresting 30 others, including two teen-age
girls. It said it had identified 14 of those killed and expressed
grave fears for the safety of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killings and arrests in the Alas subdistrict have followed
the recent buildup of Indonesian troops in the area,'' the report
said, adding that the alleged killings may have been in retaliation
for an attack on the troops by rebels of the East Timorese Armed
Resistance in which three Indonesian soldiers were killed and 13
captured.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that following the rebel attack on Nov. 9,
troops attacked a village on Nov. 13, arresting and later killing
the chief and four other people.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the Dili-based newspaper Suara Timor Timur quotes
the Indonesian military chief of East Timor, Col. Tono Suratman, as
confirming the death of the chief, Vicente Xavier, and calling him
a ringleader of the rebel attacks.

 &HT;    Education Commission wants to toughen TAAS By Sharon Jayson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Education Commissioner Mike Moses said
Tuesday he wants to toughen up the TAAS by raising passing
standards on the state's achievement test and adding new elements
to the statewide accountability system used to grade schools.
</P>
<P>
   Moses will announce his ideas at a news conference Dec. 4, but
said they would include continuing to raise the TAAS passing rate
for a campus to be considered acceptable and adding the Algebra I
end-of-course exam into the accountability equation. ``We're
looking at additional changes to the assessment system and some
tweaking of the accountability system,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Assessment of Academic Skills lies at the heart of the
accountability system that rates campuses according to how well
their students perform on the test. Ratings are based on standards
for all students at a school and for each student group _
African-American, Hispanic, white and economically-disadvantaged.
The standard for an acceptable rating has been increasing by 5
percent every year, with 40 percent as this year's acceptable
standard. The increases were due to end in 2000, but Moses said he
favors a 70 percent acceptable standard by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools have been by-and-large showing the growth to be able
to meet that standard,'' he said. ``When I became commissioner, 25
percent was considered acceptable. This next year it will be 45
percent. In 2000 it will be 50 percent. I'd like to see us continue
to talk about raising the bar at five percent increments.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Moses' ideas would require action by the Legislature,
but he has the authority to implement others on his own. A
commissioner's advisory committee on accountability also will offer
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Moses said adding the end-of-course Algebra 1 exam into
calculations for a school's accountability rating might draw
attention to the test in which only 39 percent of students received
a passing grade of 70 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems when you put things in the accountability system
schools pay more attention to it,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   In the three years the Algebra 1 exam has been given, the
passing rate was 28 percent in 1996, 35 percent in 1997 and 39
percent this year. In comparison, the passing rate for the
comparable Biology 1 end-of-course exam was 80 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hopkins, who oversees math curriculum for the Texas
Education Agency, said Algebra 1 exam scores have been especially
poor because it's up to schools to decide if they want to include
those scores in a student's grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been improvement in the scores, but they are still
extremely low. Part of the thinking has been that there's no real
motivation for students to pass the exam,'' he said. ``The
commissioner is thinking if they raised it to accountability status
there would be more emphasis on encouraging students to pass the
exam.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cole, president of the Texas Federation of Teachers, said
``there's no doubt there's a need to be making the standards
higher, but the algebra problem is a tough one'' due to factors
like a shortage of math teachers and promotion of students who are
flunking. He's sure that factoring the math test into ratings
calculations would cause school ratings to drop, but he said it
would get districts to pay attention to the end-of-course test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that a fairly high percentage of teachers assigned
to supervise algebra classes are not qualified to be there. Parents
and students are not told. Nobody knows that they're not qualified
except the teacher and principal,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   Algebra 1 is one of three math classes required for graduation
from Texas schools. Some students take the class in middle school,
while others take it in high school. Schools must give the
end-of-course exam during a two-week period at the end of the term.
``Many kids in Algebra 1 classes never passed a math class in their
life and have been promoted from grade to grade. They ended up in
Algebra 1 because they have to take it,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Austin school district, Bowie High School's math
department chair Lloy Lizcano said the algebra exam counts 25
percent toward the final exam. She said difficulties in
administering the test could account for lower passage rates. ``We
don't have enough calculators nor the time or place to put 650 kids
to take it all at the same time so we run it in shifts. It's a
massive scheduling problem and some students are cut short,
especially at end of the day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lizcano said she would like some kind of accountability system
for math before students get to high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have students who start 9th grade here who haven't passed a
math class since third grade. You can fail a math class and be
promoted and fail TAAS and be promoted,'' said Lizcano.
</P>
<P>
   With a nationwide shortage of teachers in certain subjects like
math, science, bilingual and special education, a spokeswoman for
the 82,000-member Texas State Teachers Association said teacher pay
also figures into the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Annette Cootes, the organization's spokeswoman, said there were
10,000 teaching vacancies in Texas last year that were never
filled.

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republicans' post-election power struggle
spilled into the Senate on Tuesday as Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska
said he would seek the leadership post overseeing campaign
fund-raising and election strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In a challenge to Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Hagel came
out against ``constant, demonizing, negative campaigning'' and said
Republicans should help clean up the nation's political culture.
``I think one of the things Republicans learned in 1998 is you
can't just win by beating up on your opponent and giving America no
positive alternative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' election showing _ in which they held their own
in the Senate but lost five seats in the House _ led to the
resignation of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the toppling of two
of his lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader,
is unopposed in leadership elections next week, as are Sen. Don
Nickles of Oklahoma, the majority whip; and Sen. Larry Craig of
Idaho, the Republican policy chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But McConnell, the chairman of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee chairman and the Senate's most ardent opponent
of overhauling the campaign finance law, was criticized by some
Senate Republicans who said he put too much energy and money into
his quest to defeat Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., a leading
sponsor of campaign finance legislation, and to elect Rep. Jim
Bunning to the Senate from his home state of Kentucky. Feingold won
but so did Bunning.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell's post will be particularly important in 2000 because
Republicans will have 19 Senate seats to defend while only 14
Democrats will be up for re-election. McConnell is also in line
this year to become chairman of the Rules Committee and the two
posts combined will give him enormous power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel confident of our vote count,'' said Mike Russell, a
spokesman for McConnell, ``and we are sensing a lot of unease about
the idea of turning the committee over to a two-year freshman in a
cycle when our majority is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel said, ``If I didn't believe I could win I wouldn't be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott all but endorsed McConnell on Tuesday, saying, ``It is
critical that we elect a chairman of the senatorial committee with
the seasoned experience and skill to lead us to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel said he would emphasize raising money for individual
Senate candidates and concentrate less on ``soft money,'' which
political parties have used increasingly to get around federal
limits on donations to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the sides in the battle over the campaign
finance law should ``find a common denominator.'' But like
McConnell, he said he opposed a soft money ban.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the House the incoming speaker, Robert Livingston, met with
Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, Tuesday to
discuss issues including the Democrats' demand for 43 more
committee seats because the next Congress will be nearly evenly
divided between the two parties. The Republicans have 91 more seats
than Democrats hold.
</P>
<P>
   There was little sign the two leaders were off to a less
partisan start. Mark Corallo, a spokesman for Livingston, said
Republicans ``made some good faith offers'' that Democrats have not
accepted. Laura Nichols, a spokeswoman for Gephardt, said the
Republicans had offered seven more seats, which she called
``anything but good faith.''

CARDINALS FIDDLE WITH SECONDARY,  LASSITER REPLACES TILLMAN AS
STARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeing the Washington Redskins score touchdowns on six
consecutive drives last Sunday has prompted Cardinals Coach Vince
Tobin to make two moves in his secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-year pro Kwamie Lassiter was promoted to starting free
safety ahead of rookie Pat Tillman, and second-round draft pick
Corey Chavous was moved from strong safety to right cornerback,
where he could start Sunday at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter moved to the first team after his game-saving
interception in the final 70 seconds of the 45-42 victory over the
Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Playing mostly in nickel back situations, Lassiter has four
interceptions, second most on the team. He also has forced three
fumbles and recovered another on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter began training camp as the starting free safety but
lost his job to Tillman the week of the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kwamie didn't sulk,'' Tobin said. ``He played extremely well.
He has been in the right spot. He has made the right calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Lassiter said he didn't think he should have been demoted in the
preseason but that he got over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised,'' he said of Tuesday's move. ``I thought it
would be a lot harder to get the starting job back. But I feel I've
been playing my best football. I feel a lot more comfortable out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he hasn't lost faith in Tillman, the seventh-round
pick from Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not blaming Pat for our woes in the second half of the
Washington game,'' Tobin said. ``I haven't given up on Pat Tillman
by any stretch of the imagination. We think he's getting better and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch of Chavous to cornerback came after the Redskins
picked on veteran J.B. Brown throughout the second half. Brown
played the entire half because of Tom Knight, who began the season
as the starter, aggravated a hamstring injury that caused him to
miss four consecutive games earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said Chavous will be evaluated at cornerback in practice
the next three days before a decision is made on a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Chavous started at left cornerback for four seasons at
Vanderbilt and had 12 career interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams, such as the Minnesota Vikings, considered him one of
the best cornerbacks in the 1998 draft. Most teams, including the
Cardinals, felt he was more suited for strong safety, where he has
backed up Tommy Bennett most of the season but played in nickel
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think of a corner, you think of a (fleet-footed),
turn-on-a-dime kind of guy,'' Tobin said. ``Cory doesn't have that
kind of quickness, but he has plenty of attributes that let him
play that position _ he's strong and has the size.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavous (6 feet, 204 pounds) said he is excited about the
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible challenge and a position that's very
demanding, but it's the one I feel comfortable playing,'' Chavous
said. ``I have to meet the challenge because this team is in a
position to do a lot of good things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I can play either position in this league. There were
some questions about me playing (corner) in some schemes because I
was a bump-and-run corner in college. Bump-and-run corners who
don't run 4.3 (in the 40-yard dash) . . . teams have some
reservations. But I competed against some great college receivers _
Ike Hilliard, Reidel Anthony, Marcus Nash _ and I felt I held my
own.''
</P>
<P>
   J.J. McCleskey will move from cornerback to strong safety to
back up Bennett. &QL;

REGENT AND KING IN A PROCESSION OF NEW FORMS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Gehry has changed Philip Johnson's place in history, and
both architects are the beneficiaries. If Gehry hadn't come along,
Johnson's work might well be remembered as an emblem of a time when
American architecture lost its way.
</P>
<P>
   His restless rovings from movement to movement and style to
style offered giddy architectural entertainment, particularly
during his high-flying days of big corporate commissions in the
1980s. But they demoralized many who think that architecture should
stand for something more than a flirtation with forms.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry's emergence, and Johnson's early recognition and support
of his talent, have changed that. Now Johnson's flirtatiousness has
come to seem like a benign precursor of Gehry's more patient,
continuous development of an architecture without clear rules.
</P>
<P>
   If you'll pardon the royal analogy, Johnson has come to seem
like a regent and Gehry like a king who has re-established
architecture as a field for boldness and conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Though they belong to different generations and live on opposite
coasts, the two architects are close friends. They have also
collaborated on two projects to date. Neither was built.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry the Lewis Residence, designed over many years, was
never realized. The building would have given me a chance to write
something uncomplimentary about Gehry's work for a change. With its
dumb horse-head roof, the design looked like an assault on the
silly million-dollar houses rich people build.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm glad the Atlantic City casino project on which the two
conspired for Steve Wynn came to nothing. The only way it could
have worked was if they had made it out of sand and let it wash
away.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has moved far esthetically from the days when he
collaborated with Mies van der Rohe on the Seagram Building, but
his identity and outlook have remained as firmly anchored as the
corner table he has faithfully occupied at the Four Seasons since
he designed the place 40 years ago. He was and remains a formalist,
an unreconstructed mover and shaper.
</P>
<P>
   This fixation could be obnoxious when he was turning out forms
as flimsy as the cardboard tube turrets at 52 Maiden Lane. Still,
if Johnson's appetite for forms was less insatiable, it's unlikely
that he would have become such an ardent Gehry supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying out some ideas,'' Gehry said of the house he
designed for his family in 1977. Gehry's ideas _ exposed wooden
studs, a tumbling cube window, screens of chain-link fence, the
incorporation of an existing dwelling _ differed radically, but the
experimental spirit much the same.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference was this: Gehry was finding a way to convey
that spirit in the individual building. With each project, he was
moving closer to an architecture of the mutable, polymorphous,
heterogeneous vocabulary that culminated last year in the
Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, Johnson has never quite managed to do
this. His buildings might vary in style, but each is stylistically
self-consistent. All elements of the Lipstick Building harmonize
with the dominant theme of telescoping ovals.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Television and Radio may be a hybrid of Gothic and
Classical, but each aspect supports the idea that styles once
considered antithetical can be comfortably fused. The same fusion,
prefigured by Charles Barry's Houses of Parliament, occurs in
Johnson's design for the PPG Industries headquarters in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is the Glass House, the home Johnson built for
himself in New Canaan, Conn., in 1949. This landmark edifice
changes according to light and season, and dematerializes in a play
of reflection and transparency.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's New Canaan compound, if seen as a whole, is also
polymorphic, a landscape accented with variations on the
International Style, Moorish architecture, German Expressionism,
Gehry's urban grit vernacular and other stylistic motifs.
</P>
<P>
   In his design for the Fort Worth Water Garden, completed in
1975, Johnson did adopt a vocabulary of irregularity and
fragmentation. The garden's ravines, pools and terraces anticipate
the fluid forms later developed by Gehry and by Peter Eisenman as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But Fort Worth was a work of landscape design as much as it was
architecture. It is as if water dissolved visual consistency and
launched Johnson toward a looser, more sculptural approach.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with a regent so long as he knows his
place, and I doubt that Johnson ever regarded himself as more than
that. I think he believed that the period after the passing of the
great modern pioneers _ Wright, Mies, Le Corbusier _ was not
destined to be a time for great architecture, and that the best way
to endure the Spenglerian gloom was to dress buildings up in party
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   And probably no one is happier than Johnson that the gloom has
lifted. Bilbao is at least as great a work of architecture as any
this century has produced. Besides its intrinsic merits as an
object of design and urbanism, it has banished the belief that the
highest aspiration of our time should be the recycling of history's
greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Johnson acknowledged that none of the
post-modernists were all that good. I basically agree with that
position. Now that the regency is over, however, it's much easier
to appreciate the architectural merits of Johnson's works.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, for instance, these include the New York State
Theater, the Sculpture Garden at the Museum of Modern Art and the
Elmer Holmes Bobst Library on Washington Square.
</P>
<P>
   These buildings all illustrate the most valuable lesson Johnson
has taught: the importance of procession. Read his 1947 essay on
Wright's Taliesin West. It's the best account I know of the
experience of moving through a great building.
</P>
<P>
   Then check out the State Theater (now scheduled for
restoration). the procession _ across the plaza, through the outer
and inner lobbies and up the grand staircases to the great
promenade _ still projects a more glamorous sense of occasion than
any performance space in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Johnson's entire oeuvre can also be seen as a
procession, or at least a magical mystery tour, a series of
surprises, many of them pleasant. The stops along the way include
not only his own buildings but also the spaces between them: the
anticipation of where he'll go next.
</P>
<P>
   At 92, the man who founded the world's first museum department
of architecture and design is organizing a show on Philippe Starck,
a designer whose work could not be more alien to the Machine Age
esthetic he originally promoted. Johnson's curiosity may be more
that of a curator than of an architect, but it's an invaluable
asset all the same.
</P>
<P>
   On a return visit to Bilbao earlier this year, Johnson was moved
to tears. I hope he felt that his work helped make this building
possible. Bilbao stretches the idea of procession to urban scale,
and also compresses it to daydream dimensions. The forms are like a
blend of resonating waves coming from the city, the architect's
head and those of visitors as they approach and move through the
building, alive with the discovery that this procession has led to
something great.

JUDGE GROWS WEARY OF SLOW PACE AT MICROSOFT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Va.)   (jw) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An economist testifying on behalf of the government
in its antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corp. sat through
another day of hostile cross-examination Tuesday, but Microsoft's
lawyer failed to budge him from his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lacovara, the Microsoft lawyer who questioned Frederick
Warren-Boulton for a third day Tuesday, at one point referred him
to a treatise that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates had written in
1996 about the Internet and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's approach is to make Windows so Internet friendly
that no one will want a separate browser,'' Gates wrote. ``Our goal
is to meld the best of the PC with the best of the Web, creating a
single world of great promise.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lacovara asked Warren-Boulton if he had any problem with
that, the witness said the result would be ``a world of great
promise _ to Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   So it went through the day. The court adjourned for a
Thanksgiving break, and Warren-Boulton was to take the stand again
Monday morning. U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
clearly impatient with the slow pace of this cross-examination,
admonished Lacovara that he expected him to finish on Monday.
Lacovara promised to work through the weekend cutting his
questions.
</P>
<P>
   With an impish smile, Warren-Boulton asked: ``Would you like
some help?''
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton is an important witness in the sense that the
government wants him to lay the factual foundation for the its case
_ that Microsoft is in fact a monopoly, meaning that the antitrust
laws do apply.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's approach appears to be to challenge him in so many
areas that he will end up making one or two statements,
inadvertently or otherwise, that Microsoft can use against him.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after Lacovara questioned the witness for a full
day on Monday, Mark Murray, Microsoft's spokesman, stood on the
courthouse steps and declared: ``The government's own witness,
under oath, said he saw nothing wrong with Netscape adding new
features to its Web browser, even back when Netscape had a dominant
share of the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is offering a double standard here _ one
standard for Netscape and another for Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   That resulted from an off-hand observation Warren-Boulton had
made on the stand that Netscape had added features and additional
small applications to its World Wide Web browser over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, America Online's acquisition of Netscape
Communications worked its way into the trial. Microsoft eagerly
asserted that the deal was sufficient grounds for the government to
drop its lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   To that, David Boies, the government's lead attorney said:
``That's about the sixth time during this trial that Microsoft has
declared that the government's case is dead. The government has no
intention to withdraw the case, and I think Microsoft knows that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his eagerness to embrace the deal as part of Microsoft's
defense, Lacovara overstepped at one point, asking a question based
on the assertion that Sun Microsystems, Microsoft's arch
competitor, would, as Lacovara put it, acquire Netscape's Web
browser as part of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Startled by that, Jackson leaned forward in his chair and asked,
``Is that really the case?''
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara assured him that it was. ``It was reported on MSNBC
this morning,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But it was inaccurate. As part of the three-way deal, Sun
Microsystems will distribute Netscape's business-level server
software for three years. America Online will maintain control of
Netscape's Web browser. &QL;

BONNER LIKELY TO SIGN DEAL WITH FALCONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rattlers quarterback Sherdrick Bonner left for Atlanta on
Tuesday and is expected to sign with the Falcons today, Rattlers
Coach Danny White said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonner, who led the Rattlers to the ArenaBowl two years ago and
holds all of the franchise's passing records, was given a tryout
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons Coach Dan Reeves was impressed enough to inform Bonner
that he would be signed once a slot opened.
</P>
<P>
   It did this week, White said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons on Tuesday tracked down Bonner on a Phoenix golf
course, where he was playing in a charity tournament with White.
White informed Bonner of the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obviously pleased,'' White said. ``He couldn't wait to
get home and pack. I'm sure his head is spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves was an assistant coach with the Dallas Cowboys when White
played quarterback. They've remained close friends.
</P>
<P>
   White said last week he went to Atlanta to talk to Reeves more
about Bonner, who was the ArenaBowl Most Valuable Player in 1994
when the 6-foot-4, 225-pound left-hander led the Rattlers to their
first title.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reeves is) aware not only what kind of thrower he is, because
he's seen him, but he's also aware that Sherdrick has thrown 11
touchdown passes to every interception he's thrown and he's only
been sacked once in three years,'' White said. ``Those are things
he can't show in a tryout.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner will remain Rattlers' property and go on their exempt
list, White said.
</P>
<P>
   White said Bonner will start out on the Falcons' practice squad.
Chris Chandler suffered an injury Sunday and is questionable this
week. His backups are Steve DeBerg and Tony Graziani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great opportunity,'' White said. ``He's with a
good team, a good program, a great head coach. He's got a
legitimate shot not only to make the team but to play. I think
within a couple of weeks, he could have the system down well enough
to play if they needed him to. I'm sure they hope they don't have a
need for him to play. But the way injuries are, two of those guys
could get hurt.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: STRIKING DOWN THE SODOMY LAWS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25:
</P>
<P>
   When Michael Hardwick looked up from the privacy of his
apartment in Atlanta one day 16 years ago, he was stunned to see a
policeman standing in the door. ``What are you doing in my
bedroom?'' he asked. It is a question that took on a special
bitterness for gay men and lesbians after the U.S. Supreme Court in
1986 upheld the Georgia law against sodomy under which Hardwick was
arrested that day. The law was 170 years old. It prohibited oral
and anal sex by anyone, homosexual or heterosexual, and like all
such laws in the United States it was modeled on old English law,
which was shaped by religious teachings.
</P>
<P>
   In his argument to the Supreme Court, Georgia Attorney General
Michael Bowers attacked homosexual sodomy as ``anathema to the
basic units of our society _ marriage and the family.'' Five
justices bought the argument, upholding the law in a decision that
removed any claim homosexuals had to privacy or to protection from
government intrusion in their bedrooms. To decide otherwise, Chief
Justice Warren Burger said, would ``cast aside millennia of moral
teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   But the critical constitutional question, Hardwick's lawyer
later wrote, ``was not what Michael Hardwick was doing in his
bedroom, but rather what the state of Georgia was doing there.'' On
Monday, ruling in another case, the Georgia Supreme Court agreed,
and struck down the law. This case arose from heterosexual acts
between a man and woman, but the court made clear that Georgia's
Constitution guarantees rights of privacy that make no distinction
between homosexuals and heterosexuals. ``We cannot think of any
other activity that reasonable persons would rank as more private
and more deserving of protection from governmental interference
than consensual, private, adult sexual activity,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia decision follows one by a city circuit judge in
Baltimore last month who held that Maryland law could not
discriminate by making sodomy illegal for homosexuals and not for
heterosexuals. In Rhode Island, the legislature voted to repeal its
anti-sodomy law earlier this year. One way or the other, in almost
two-thirds of the states, outdated legal restrictions on private
sex have fallen away. The remaining holdouts should drop the last
traces of this assault on privacy.

 &HT;    Body of missing woman identified
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett and Alexandra Navarro Clifton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For five days, police officers who were
friends and relations of Christopher Benedetto and Janette Piro
used the couple's Singer Island home as the command post to solve
their disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives with decades of homicide experience in New York City
searched the house for clues and could find none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did notice when I first went into the house I was struck by
the smell of cleanliness,'' said Arthur Esposito, Benedetto's
cousin and a Titusville police detective. ``I smelled Clorox, Lysol
maybe. But I didn't think much of it because Chris always kept his
house immaculate.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to lock up the home Monday morning and return
to their jobs, Esposito said they decided to check the box freezer
in the corner of the garage to make sure it contained nothing that
would spoil.
</P>
<P>
   What they would find inside was more than even hardened New York
cops could handle.
</P>
<P>
   It was Janette Piro's hunched and frozen body. It had been there
in the house full of detectives all along.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Benedetto, Christopher's brother and a Nassau County
officer, raised the freezer lid and screamed in horror at seeing
his dead sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul stumbled back and ran inside the house and into the
living room,'' Esposito said. ``He was screaming and he was going
into shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Benedetto, another brother who is retired from the New York
force, then saw the grisly contents and broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike was extremely upset,'' said Esposito. ``I could see the
body from where I was standing and I went right for the phone. I
called 911 and told them we needed the police to come right over
because we had a homicide. Then I called for an ambulance because I
could see Paul needed help.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Benedetto used the freezer to store fishing bait,
Esposito said, and none of the officers staying in the house
thought to look in it until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tucked underneath a counter, like a work bench,''
Esposito said. ``You had to walk around the BMW parked on the far
side of the garage to get to it. You couldn't open the lid without
pulling it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Riviera Beach police identified the body Tuesday as Piro, who
along with her husband, Christopher, had been missing since the
evening of Nov. 11 when they failed to show up for a dinner date
with friends. Neighbors, worried over the Benedettos'
disappearance, called the family in New York on Sunday, Nov. 15,
and the brothers and Esposito arrived Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is a suspect, including Mr. Benedetto,'' Riviera
Beach police Detective Pat Galligan said. ``Family, friends,
associates; we're exploring every avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they identified the body through photographs of
Piro. The Palm Beach County Medical Examiner's Office will use
super-glue to lift any fingerprints from the body and an autopsy is
scheduled early next week, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County sheriff's crime scene technicians tested the
couple's home, two cars and boat Tuesday night with a chemical
called Luminol. The liquid, which must be applied in total
darkness, will glow to reveal any traces of blood.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a week, at least eight people, including neighbors
who had spare keys and family members, had walked through the
house, Riviera Beach police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we walked through the house Friday, there was no evidence
of a crime,'' police Major David Harris said. ``If we had any
inkling, we would have kicked everyone out.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito said several fellow New York City officers flew down to
help search for the couple and also had inspected the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had briefly thought about the house,'' Esposito said, ``but
you have to understand that by the time we got in there, the
neighbors had been all through it. It had been like Grand Central
Station in there. The crime scene was already contaminated by the
time we walked through the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Esposito said he and the Benedetto brothers ``examined
the house in small sections,'' looking for blood or signs of a
struggle. They checked the carpet for discoloration but could find
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   They moved their focus outside the home, handing out flyers
throughout the neighborhood and searching hotels on the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to stay in the background and not interfere with the
Riviera Beach police investigation,'' Esposito said. ``We didn't
want to give the wrong impression and make the detectives here
think we were taking over the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Jacqueline Martin said the fact that
Piro's body was frozen could make it easier to determine the cause
of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial characteristics are intact for evaluation,''
Martin said. ``The freezing period will stabilize the body in its
same state.''
</P>
<P>
   But this will also make it difficult for examiners to calculate
when Piro died.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell the time of death when (the body) is frozen,''
Martin said. ``Once the body starts to thaw, the decomposition will
start to take place . . . I don't think we will be able to
establish an exact time of death.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are several other factors which will help them
establish a reasonable time of death, Martin said. The condition of
the body and whether it was partially decomposed before freezing
are factors they will consider.

   Esposito, 50, spent 25 years with the NYPD before taking a job
with the Titusville department three years ago. He said he has
worked hundreds of homicide cases, but none has come so close to
him.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-figure settlement Benedetto received three years ago for
back injuries from a construction accident may be at the root of
his cousin's disappearance, Esposito believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut tells me this probably had something to do with
money,'' he said. ``You can make a whole lot of guesses, but I
think someone went after Chris and Janette for money.''

RED-ZONE SCORING RATE TOPS NFL

   No NFL team has been more successful in the red zone this season
than the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   They lead the league in scoring touchdowns inside the opponents'
20-yard line with 25 in 38 possessions, a success rate of 65.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get down there more often to exploit our ability to
get in the end zone,'' Coach Vince Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin attributes the success to excellent play-calling by the
offensive coaches and the continued improvement of second-year
quarterback Jake Plummer, who led the team to six touchdowns in
Sunday's 45-42 victory over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   All six of the scores came after the team was in the red zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake has the ability to make (big) plays, and we haven't
forced the ball in there much, which is extremely critical,'' Tobin
said. &QL;  &QL; 
Road warriors
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' three road victories this season put them one
away from their most in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   They have two chances to get a fourth road win, beginning Sunday
at Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who also play at Philadelphia on Dec. 13, are 3-3
on the road for only the second time since moving to Arizona in
1988, the last time coming in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three seasons, the Cardinals have gone 1-7, 2-6 and
1-7 on the road, a combined 4-20. But they've beaten St. Louis,
Detroit and Washington on the road this season.
</P>
<P>
   Short shots &QL;  &QL; 
The Cardinals have signed former Georgia guard Antonio Fleming, a
seventh-round draft pick of Dallas, to their practice squad.
Fleming had been on Carolina's practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals continue to lead the NFL in takeaways with 29, one
more than Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Frank Sanders is tied with Cris Carter of
Minnesota for the NFL lead in third-down receptions with 23.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Simeon Rice's two sacks against the Redskins gave
him a team-high nine, tying him for 11th in the league. &QL;  &QL;

EDITORIAL: COMPETITION ON THE INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Nov. 25:
</P>
<P>
   America Online's effort to acquire Netscape and set up a
partnership with Sun Microsystems is a reminder of how rapidly the
corporate landscape can change in fast-moving technical fields. But
it does not lessen the need for the Justice Department to
vigorously pursue its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the
dominant player in software. The department has presented solid
evidence that Microsoft has used its monopoly in operating systems
to muscle rivals and partners so as to head off competition in
other software realms.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has risen so quickly as an information medium that
only four years ago, in his book ``The Road Ahead,'' Bill Gates
scarcely mentions it. In addition, only a couple of years ago
America Online, the world's biggest online service, was having so
much trouble getting rid of the bugs in the system it was widely
derided as ``America On Hold.'' Now Microsoft has moved so
aggressively into the Internet that the Justice Department is
accusing it of predatory behavior, and America Online has rocketed
forward to make deals with other Internet players.
</P>
<P>
   In its antitrust suit against Microsoft, the federal government
charges that the company has illegally bundled its own browser with
its Windows operating system to smother Netscape's chances of
marketing its browser. Now in the corridors outside the antitrust
trial Microsoft's lawyers maintain that Netscape has found a new
partner in America Online and has no need of protection from the
government. But it could be as easily argued that Microsoft has
bludgeoned Netscape into dissolution, forcing a distress sale to
America Online. Nor is it clear that customers of America Online
will choose Netscape's browser as a vehicle for buying and selling
on the Internet. Even in its newly musclebound form, America Online
remains dependent on Microsoft's good will for favorable placement
of an AOL icon on the main desktop screen.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that, years hence, America Online, Netscape and Sun
will put together an alternative means to the Internet through
telephone lines, cables or the like. But until that day, fairness
requires Justice Department action to insure that Microsoft not use
its current position to thwart consumer choice. Only when companies
know they can get their products to the consumer will they have the
incentive to innovate and turn the Internet into the revolutionary
medium it promises to be.

BATTLING AN INVISIBLE OPPONENT  
 ARTHRITIS HOBBLES SUN DEVILS' LANG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes when Rechelle Lang calls to New Zealand, it's easier
to talk about something else.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of topics: her parents' move from TeKuiti
to Auckland and the sale of the business they owned for 16 years;
her brother Brent, married two years ago when she last visited
home, already with a 7-month-old child and another baby on the way;
the Arizona State women's basketball upcoming tour of Australia in
May, after which Lang will go one direction and the Sun Devils
another.
</P>
<P>
   Any of those subjects is preferable to another lecture about
inflammatory arthritis and the unfairness of it striking a
24-year-old and ruining her brief Division I basketball career.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get upset knowing the things I'm going through,'' said
Lang, referring to her parents, John and Lynne. ``I want to share
the good times and what's happening back home. I don't know if they
know the extent of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``extent'' of it includes:
</P>
<P>
   A mysterious eruption of her left knee that caused it to grow to
3-4 times its normal size during a three-hour plane flight to
Eugene, Ore., in January, which transformed their daughter from
starting point guard to DNP (did not play) for 12 consecutive
games, including ASU's opener Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A long, confusing ordeal to correctly diagnose the problem, let
alone treat it.
</P>
<P>
   An occasional easing of the pain, only to always return when she
optimistically practices just a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   And a growing admiration from her coaches and teammates for how
Georgie, as Lang is known, is coping.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to watch her be miserable, but she doesn't show
it to the team very much at all,'' said ASU Coach Charli Turner
Thorne. ``Knowing how good she is and what she could be doing, but
having to watch every day in practice. And knowing how much she
could help us, but not being able to play a game she loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can imagine how difficult it's been for her. But she's not
standing around pouting.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead Lang quietly goes about her business during practice.
Riding a stationary bike, shooting and participating in some
half-court drills. Dreaming of when the three or four medications
she ingests and lubricating injections in her knee will allow her
to train full court and eventually play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of it is learning about my body and what I can and
can't do, when I have to cut back,'' Lang said. ``If I play for
even five minutes, I'd call that a start.''
</P>
<P>
   A transfer from Casper (Wyo.) College, Lang started the first 14
games last season and was averaging 22.4 minutes. She had eight
assists in ASU's upset of then-seventh-ranked Washington on Jan. 8
and six assists and nine points two days later in a 20-point win
over Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   But during practice the week before the Oregon trip, Lang took a
hard hit on the shin that developed into a large bruise, then the
swollen knee.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Thorne now wonders about the 32 minutes Lang played that
weekend. ``She was almost like a pylon,'' due to her immobility
against Oregon. ``We just didn't know what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   And they wouldn't for months.
</P>
<P>
   The knee was drained and tested for infection. There was a
magnetic resonance imaging test and arthroscopic examination for
structural damage. Not until April was Lang able to describe the
pain in other joints that provided the answer. She was referred to
a specialist, Dr. Paul Howard, who immediately recognized the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the start, it was pretty overwhelming,'' Lang said.
``Having such limitations, and no one knew what it was and what I
should do. Now it's a different frustration of dealing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard told Lang that he is pleased with how she is responding
to aggressive treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that the clock is ticking on her athletic career
because she already has gone to the NCAA once to successfully
petition for eligibility this season because of a question over
trade school classes taken in New Zealand before she started at
Casper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire the way she's kept at it,'' said Natalie Tucker,
Lang's roommate who unintentionally is benefiting from her absence
as the new starting point guard. ``A lot of people would have said
they're not going to be able to come back and given up their senior
year. But she keeps in shape, just in case. She puts in more
shooting practice than anyone else on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone would be so happy for her,'' if she plays again.
``But we don't want her to do anything to make her hurt herself
more.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Lang has company in street clothes. Ebony Edwards and
Theresa Jantzen have knee injuries, and Kisha White is academically
ineligible until the second semester. But by the first of the year,
when the Pac-10 schedule starts, she could be the lone inactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is doing everything she possibly can to help herself and
help the team,'' Turner Thorne said.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, betrayed by Lang's sad eyes, is that might not be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to handle it in an affirmative way, sometimes to the
point of ignoring it,'' Lang said. ``It feels just like an injury
rather than arthritis. Instead of debating why, I just treat it.
You show your character by how you deal with it.'' &QL;

MONEY FLOWING BACK INTO EQUITY FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mutual fund investors had little stomach for making
new investments while the stock market was jittery and share prices
were down, but money is flowing into equity funds again now that
stocks have returned to near-record territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Investment Company Institute, a mutual fund trade group,
reported Tuesday that $2.5 billion flowed into stock funds in
October, the second lowest monthly total in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   October was the third straight month of greatly reduced cash
flows for stock mutual funds. After receiving an average of $21
billion of net new investments in each of the year's first seven
months, mutual funds lost $11 billion to investor withdrawals in
August followed by $6.3 billion of new cash investments in
September.
</P>
<P>
   But after stock prices continued their rebound late last month,
investors again returned to buying fund shares. Through Monday,
stock funds were receiving new investments at a monthly rate of
nearly $13 billion, according to Trim Tabs Financial Services,
which tracks fund cash flows.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, several of the largest sellers of mutual funds
reported significantly stronger cash flows. Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.
has sold about $1.75 billion of stock funds this month, it said
Tuesday; in the previous two months, money flowed out or measured
just a few million dollars of net deposits. Both Fidelity
Investments and the Vanguard Group also reported heavy sales of
stock funds so far this month.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the money flowing into equities this month
continues to go into funds that invest primarily in American
stocks; international funds, which suffered net withdrawals in each
of the last three months, appear to be barely breaking even in net
flows.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock market gyrated from August and into October, mutual
fund investors demonstrated growing interest in bond funds,
generally a more conservative category of investment. Last month,
bond funds added $4.6 billion in net new deposits, down from $5.6
billion in September.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrid funds, which invest in both stocks and bonds, saw
investors withdraw $258 million last month, compared with
withdrawals of $518 million in September. But money-market funds,
generally the safest haven for mutual fund investors, received
nearly $46 billion in new deposits last month, six times their
September intake.
</P>
<P>
   Those amounts, combined with the more than $50 billion that
money-market funds received in August, mean that plenty of money
remains on the sidelines that could be moved into equities if the
market continues to rise.
</P>
<P>
   About 26 percent of total mutual fund assets, which measure
$5.12 trillion, now rest in money-market funds. That is up from 23
percent of fund assets at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Within equity funds alone, 6 percent of assets are being held in
cash reserves by portfolio managers. While that is down from 6.3
percent in September, it remains higher than in any other month in
the last year.

WNBA PONDERS EXPANSION OF PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter how well both teams play, the Mercury and two-time
champion Houston Comets probably won't meet in a rematch for the
1999 WNBA title.
</P>
<P>
   That's because an expanded playoff format proposed at league
meetings last week keeps teams playing within their conference
until the championship series.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs would grow from four to six teams as the WNBA adds
expansion teams in Orlando and Minnesota and increases to 12 teams
and 32 regular season games for its third season.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a tight playoff time frame, the new round would
consist of a single game between the second- and third-place
finisher in each conference. Those winners would advance to
best-of-three semifinals against the conference champions, who get
a first-round bye. The West and East champions then would play in a
best-of-three final round.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of three plans to be discussed by the WNBA
competition committee, which will make a recommendation to the
operating committee. The other options are to continue the current
format or to expand to four playoff teams per conference.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and '98, the conference champions earned the right to
host a playoff semifinal, with two other teams qualifying based on
best record, regardless of conference. Semifinals and finals were
one game in '97 but were increased to best-of-three in '98.
</P>
<P>
   If the six-team proposal is adopted for 1999, the Mercury would
have to get past the two-time defending champion Comets before
reaching the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy if they decide to go East-West because they know
which conference is the stronger,'' Mercury Coach/General Manager
Cheryl Miller said. ``Wait until the balance is a little even.
You've potentially got four or five teams killing each other in the
West to get out of it to get to the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with it, but it's not like I have a choice. I'm
not looking forward to that format. I guess we just have to make
sure we have the best record (in the West).''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury was closer to missing the playoffs last season than
to surpassing the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Houston ran away with the West at 27-3, eight games ahead of
Phoenix (19-11), which for the second straight year had to win its
regular season finale to clinch a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   If the six-team playoff format had been in effect last season,
the Mercury would have faced the Los Angeles Sparks (12-18) in a
one-game playoff for the right to meet the Comets in the West
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, the New York Liberty (18-12) would have played the
Charlotte Sting (18-12), with the winner meeting the Cleveland
Rockers (20-10).
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota goes into the West for 1999 along with Houston,
Phoenix, Los Angeles, Sacramento (8-22) and Utah (8-22). Orlando
joins the East along with Cleveland, Charlotte, New York, Detroit
(17-13) and Washington (3-27). Of the four expansion teams added
since 1997, three are in the East, with Houston having been shifted
to the West. &QL;

ADVERTISING: MILLER AND VISA RE-EXAMINE THEIR AD AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two big advertisers are asking agencies for ideas on large,
significant portions of their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Miller Brewing Co. is placing in review the creative account of
its biggest brand, Miller Lite, which has been handled for less
than two years by Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis. And Visa USA is
seeking proposals for comprehensive campaigns that will coordinate
variegated pitches promoting the Visa credit card's sponsorship of
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by Miller and Visa speak to the increasingly unsettled
nature of agency-client relations as more marketers constantly
re-examine agency rosters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a never-satisfied approach to our advertising,'' said
Susan Henderson, a spokeswoman in Milwaukee for Miller, a unit of
Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henderson declined to speak about the review for Miller
Lite, which was reported this week in the trade publication
Advertising Age, because, she said, ``we do not discuss our
advertising and marketing plans.'' Representatives of Fallon
McElligott and other Miller agencies referred inquiries to the
company.
</P>
<P>
   But the Miller decision to re-evaluate the creative portion of
the account, with billings estimated at $150 million, was confirmed
by advertising executives who were told about the company's intent.
The review comes after a sales decline for Miller Lite this year
and continued criticism of an unconventional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The review is confined to the three principal Miller roster
shops, said the executives, who spoke on the condition they not be
identified. In addition to Fallon McElligott, the agencies are
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., which creates campaigns for the
Miller Genuine Draft brand, and Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising in New
York, which handles ads for Icehouse and Molson; Miller is the U.S.
distributor of Molson, brewed by Molson Cos. of Canada. Media
services for all Miller brands are handled by Starcom Media
Services, a unit of Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett had also handled the creative chores on Miller Lite from
1991 until December 1996, when Miller shocked Madison Avenue by
shifting those duties without a review to Fallon McElligott. The
decision to add Fallon McElligott to the Miller roster was followed
a month later by a radically different campaign for Miller Lite,
which had lost its sales supremacy in the light-beer category to
the Bud Light brand brewed by Anheuser-Busch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign, initially centered on a make-believe adman
named Dick, presented off-kilter vignettes that reintroduced the
theme ``Miller time.'' To appeal to men aged 21 to 27, the prime
beer-drinking market, the Miller Lite ads were replete with
cutting-edge elements like self-referential in-jokes about
advertising and such startling imagery as a pants-less man and a
woman with furry underarms.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign instantly became one of the most contentious ever
for a mainstream consumer product. Miller executives repeatedly
backed the campaign, describing it as provocative for a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But many Miller distributors began complaining that the
campaign's quirky humor and offbeat images were too nontraditional
and narrowly focused to stimulate sales. Weeks ago, after the ads
were broadened somewhat to be less off-putting, top Miller
executives conceded at a wholesalers' meeting that the campaign was
not sufficiently product-focused and would be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the verdict is in and it didn't work,'' Benj Steinman,
president of Beer Marketer's Insights, a trade publication in
Nanuet, N.Y., said Tuesday. ``The advertising didn't help the
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many distributors started out reserving judgment,'' Steinman
said, ``but I've heard nothing positive about the ads from them in
the last six months.'' Steinman's publication estimates that
shipments of Miller Lite will decline about 2 percent in 1998 after
rising last year.
</P>
<P>
   The present campaign for Miller Genuine Draft will also be
changed, the distributors were told, but that revamping is being
handled by that brand's agency, Wieden &AMP; Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to Visa, Becky Saeger, executive vice president for
brand marketing in Foster City, Calif., confirmed a report this
week in the trade publication Adweek about the company's plans.
Visa, she said, had asked three roster agencies for proposals for
broadly focused marketing programs to integrate traditional
advertising, sales promotion, interactive ads, direct marketing and
other forms of peddling that remind football fans Visa is the
``official'' credit card of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mission here is to push the envelope on integrated
marketing,'' Ms. Saeger said, ``because we're more and more
committed to making sure all the elements of our marketing mix work
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL work we have in the marketplace is strong and I'm
happy with it,'' she added. ``But we pay a lot for our sponsorship
and this exercise is to see how far we can push the marketing
value.''
</P>
<P>
   The agencies are: BBDO New York, a unit of Omnicom Group that
handles creative duties for Visa like television advertising; CKS
Partners in Cupertino, Calif., a unit of CKS Group that handles
Internet marketing, and Highway One in San Francisco, a part of the
D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications unit of MacManus Group
that handles sales promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies will consult with siblings that handle the tasks
they do not; BBDO, for instance, will collaborate with sales
promotion agencies owned by Omnicom.

   The ideas to be presented to Visa will be for the 1999-2000
season, the fifth year in the five-year Visa professional football
sponsorship contract. After the presentations, said Ms. Saeger,
Visa would decide _ most likely by mid-December _ whether ``to have
one agency lead the whole process'' or continue dividing the pro
football tasks among the three shops.
</P>
<P>
   The work being done by the three agencies for the 1998-99 NFL
season ranges ``from the mass market down to the grass roots, if
you will,'' Ms. Saeger said. There are humorous spots from BBDO New
York featuring Steve Young and Jerry Rice of the San Francisco
49ers, promotions and sweepstakes from Highway One and an area on
the Visa Web site (www.visa.com) from CKS devoted to pro football.

PURCHASE TALKS FOR YANKEES COLLAPSE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just when it appeared that Cablevision was on the
verge of buying a majority interest in the Yankees, talks between
the cable company and George Steinbrenner III, the team's principal
owner, have broken down over the amount of control Steinbrenner
would retain over the team, two people familiar with the
negotiations said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cablevision Chairman Charles Dolan encountered problems in a
telephone conversation with Steinbrenner on Monday night, a
development that threatened to unravel the deal, according to one
person familiar with the developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Dolan is not a guy who is dictated to in a business
deal,'' said another person, a business associate of Cablevision.
</P>
<P>
   Because the principals were not talking Tuesday, it was unclear
whether the breakdown was irreparable or if the deal could be
rescued. What seemed evident, however, was that Dolan was not happy
that some details of the talks had emerged publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The issues included control of the team, the sale price, which
apparently has been generally overstated, and Steinbrenner's
possible involvement with the Knicks and the Rangers, the teams
Cablevision already owns. The breakdown in negotiations is
considered surprising because on Wall Street, it was generally
regarded as a nearly completed deal and a good, logical match.
</P>
<P>
   Before the breakdown, Cablevision was planning to buy about 70
percent of the team for something between $350 million and $365
million, according to those close to the talks. The price, said a
business associate of Cablevision, was based on a valuation of the
team at between $500 million and $525 million.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, who has been principal owner of the Yankees for 26
years, has never acknowledged publicly that he and Dolan were close
to a deal, even though associates of both sides said they were.
Steinbrenner has said only that they were talking.
</P>
<P>
   But he had stated bluntly that if he did reach agreement to sell
a majority interest, he would remain in day-to-day control as
managing partner of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is done,'' Steinbrenner said in an interview that
appeared in The New York Times Monday, ``the Steinbrenners will be
in control. That's what sets Cablevision apart from others. There
are those who would pay a lot of money and take control, but that
won't happen. We've been in control for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long he and his family would run the Yankees under a
different ownership, he said, ``It would have to be a long-term
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Steinbrenner and Dolan were negotiating a 25-year
contract that would have paid the best known owner in sports $5
million a year as well as bonuses for post-season appearances and
championships, according to those close to the talks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the people who told of the breakdown said that Dolan
``could not accommodate'' the kind of control Steinbrenner wanted.
He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, in the interview that appeared Monday, also raised
the possibility that he would run the Knicks and the Rangers or at
least have some role in their operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``George has said so many things through the media,'' said the
business associate of Cablevision. ``That's not the way Cablevision
does business. Cablevision does deals very quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   When corporations discuss a sale or a merger, they typically
conduct secret negotiations for weeks or months and say nothing
about their talks publicly. The sale of sports teams, however, has
traditionally taken on a more public nature. When the Fox Group was
negotiating to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers last year, for example,
the effort was widely known.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Steinbrenner had said very little about his
talks with Dolan, and even in the past week continued to deny that
a deal was imminent. But his few comments were still more than
Dolan and Cablevision had said publicly. They, in fact, have never
acknowledged that they were negotiating to buy any part of the
Yankees. Company statements have always been vague, saying only
that Cablevision is always interested in its relationship with the
Yankees; the network has a contract to broadcast Yankees games on
cable.

COMMENTARY: CUCUMBER CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Bill Clinton has been an exhausting president. He
requires too much work and stirs up too much sturm und drang. After
Clinton leaves, everyone will surely be in the mood for a little
peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In the election, Americans sent vengeful Republicans and
evangelical scolds the message that they do not want intrusive,
hectoring politicians who are always demanding that they get
outraged over something. Baby boomers don't want to spend a lot of
time on moral umbrage. They want to spend a lot of time checking
their stocks and reserving tee times at golf retirement resorts.
</P>
<P>
   So, perhaps, after this tumultuous period of overstimulation,
the time is right to go bland. Maybe the White House needs a
politician with a restful personality. Or better still, no
personality at all. A low-maintenance leader. The sort of guy you
could just elect and then forget about. The sort of guy who would
just fade into the West Wing woodwork. The sort of guy who has, in
fact, been compared to a wood chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, are you running for president?'' I ask George Elmer
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to do my best to make this a better state,'' replies
the governor, sitting in his office, occasionally rolling a
basketball around with his foot. ``We had a meeting just before you
came here with our budget director ...''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has a unique quality for a successful politician: You can
actually forget, for long periods, that he's in the room with you.
Even his wife, Libby, has described him as ``the softer shades of
gray.''
</P>
<P>
   He is swishing around a Diet Coke bottle, trying to make the
bubbles go away. ``I like soda flat,'' he sighs. ``I know. It is
the perfect metaphor.''
</P>
<P>
   He apologizes for his socks. ``I hate short socks but I figured
today nobody was going to be around,'' he said. ``I want to cross
my legs but I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup. He's perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Michael Dukakis said his idea of a great evening
was laying black mulch on the tomatoes in his back yard? Well, the
New York governor has written a biography that offers a loving
homage to his family farm in Peekskill, with its ``spectacular
cucumbers.'' The Pataki family motto, printed at the beginning of
the book, is: ``Pray for a good harvest, but keep hoeing.''
</P>
<P>
   So, I ask him, what about a Bush-Pataki ticket? ``I know Bush,''
the governor replies. ``He was a year behind me in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he know anything about that alleged wild side of George W.?
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head. ``At Yale, they have 12 colleges. His and
mine were next to each other and we were rivals, Pierson and
Davenport. He was at Davenport. I was at Pierson. I actually met
him a few times. ... He was a very competitive guy. He wasn't
involved at all in college politics. He was more involved in either
sports or playing poker. He's a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Could this genial, sleepy-eyed governor, who has been called
lazy by his political rivals, handle the grinding hours of a
national campaign?
</P>
<P>
   He says he wouldn't mind long hours if they were ``productive''
hours. ``I'll just give you an example: Saturday we had a bus with
my old friends, going up to the Harvard-Yale football game. We
spent the entire morning talking about America in the 21st century.
It was tremendous fun and it was stimulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup. He's the one.
</P>
<P>
   He could very well ride that blandness into the White House. His
rival in New York City, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who has been making
trips to Iowa and getting flummoxed by questions about hog policy,
may not suit the public mood. The revulsion with Kenneth Starr may
cause voters to turn away from any more self-righteous, puritanical
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's softer focus could be a tonic after the nasty intensity
of the impeachment crusade. The governor faults Newt Gingrich and
other GOP leaders for the disastrous election results. ``The idiot
Republican Party was running commercials nationalizing what is an
inside Washington problem,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is proposing that what Washington needs is a nicer
atmosphere and less partisan sniping. ``I'm not naive,'' he says.
``But to the extent you can minimize that through the personal
relationships and through the pursuit of an agenda that advances
not a political interest but a common interest, then everyone is
better off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yup. He's ideal.

   Although editor &UR; David Remnick  &LR; had high praise in Berkeley on
Monday night for  &UR; Joan Didion &LR; 's recent New Yorker essay
criticizing the publication of an unfinished  &UR; Ernest Hemingway &LR; 
novel, it turns out that he is disregarding Didion's main point.
New York magazine reports that the New Yorker has bought rights to
publish a portion of the novel, despite Didion's view that
Hemingway, who committed suicide, was less than satisfied by the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Scribner's decision to publish ``True at First Light''
represents a ``systematic creation of a marketable product,'' she

Hemingway in his lifetime.''

   Remnick told New York that Didion's essay ``made a brilliant
case for not publishing incomplete work of any kind. ... And yet,
there's a case to be made that without publishing such work, we
would never have had Kafka's `The Trial' and `The Castle' or
Virgil's `Aeneid.' We'll publish an excerpt of the Hemingway
manuscript in the spring,'' said Remnick, ``and let the reader

DAVIS EYES IRISH GAME WITH USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's in UCLA's best interest for USC to beat Notre
Dame in football on Saturday, but one Bruin will be rooting for the
Fighting Irish. Baron Davis is a Notre Dame fan.
</P>
<P>
   No, check that. He's a Notre Dame nut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching Notre Dame football since I was 5,'' said
Davis, an L.A. native. ``And even without (injured quarterback)
Jarius Jackson, they're going to smack SC.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has Notre Dame media guides and reads the school's
football newsletter. During his Pop Warner days, Davis wore No. 9 _
after ex-Notre Dame quarterback Tony Rice _ and dreamed of playing
safety for the Irish. Then he enrolled at Crossroads School in
Santa Monica, which doesn't have football, and turned his attention
to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   His Irish allegiance is so strong, he even liked Lou Holtz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved Holtz,'' he said. ``I loved every single person to
play for Notre Dame, except one.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Powlus.
</P>
<P>
   __ In doubt: Davis will travel with UCLA this week to the Puerto
Rico Shootout, which begins Thursday against San Francisco, but he
is not expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   Davis was cleared for full-contact practice last week, but he
has not received permission to play competitively on his surgically
repaired left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been no official word,'' coach Steve Lavin said.
``We're still working on the assumption that he won't play in
Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not have full strength or range of motion,
Davis is moving well in practice and slowly regaining his timing
and conditioning. Patience is another problem. He wants to play,
and he wants to play now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I've got to do,'' he said. ``It's extremely
hard (to stay patient) when you know you're ready, and when you've
proved it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ One Bailey to another: Sophomore guard Ryan Bailey, Toby's
brother, scored nine points in 17 minutes against Santa Clara and
is the backup point guard _ at least until Davis returns.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey was the starting point guard for Penn State as a freshman
in 1996-97, then transferred to UCLA as a nonscholarship player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played better in games than practice,'' Lavin said,
smiling. ``The Baileys are all gamers. It's a gene.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Game change? The Bruins might change the 7:30 p.m. tipoff
time of their Jan. 4 game against Arizona State if the football
team is in the Fiesta Bowl that evening. The Fiesta Bowl starts at

YANKS MEET WITH WILLIAMS; ORIOLES SHOW SUDDEN INTEREST IN BELLE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bernie Williams met with Yankees officials in Tampa, Fla.,
Tuesday night, wielding a substantial seven-year offer from the
Boston Red Sox and apparently giving the Yankees one last chance to
match the Boston bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had the opportunity to increase their five-year, $60
million pitch to Williams, a member of their organization since
1985. But Boston's offer apparently dwarfs that of the Yankees.
Some within the Red Sox organization are saying the team has
offered a seven-year deal worth perhaps $13 million a season, and
the Red Sox are also believed to be working on a way to add an
eighth-year option to the contract. The largest contact in basebal
history currently belongs to Mike Piazza, who signed a seven-year
$91 million deal with the Mets in October.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the Yankees owner George Steinbrenner met with Williams
Tuesday, his team was actively negotiating with Albert Belle,
although the Yankees must now contend with the Baltimore Orioles'
sudden interest in the controversial slugger. In addition, the
Orioles are aggressively pursuing free-agent pitcher Kevin Brown,
who pitched for Baltimore in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' agent, Scott Boras, had told Yankees officials all
along that they would get one last chance to sign the center
fielder, and with Williams deep into negotiations with the Red Sox
and the Yankees ready to strike a deal with Belle if Baltimore
doesn't interfere, Tuesday's meeting in Tampa, Fla. represented
that final opportunity. Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general
manager, who also participated in the meeting, would not confirm
the gathering occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner and Williams had years of shared history to discuss
_ the eight seasons Williams played in Yankee Stadium, his two Gold
Gloves, the batting title he won this summer, and the two World
Series championships the Yankees won with Williams in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a complete reversal by Steinbrenner, however, it
appeared the gap in negotiations is untenable. While the Yankees
have held fast to their offer, Boston's proposed deal with Williams
would far surpass any other offer disclosed publicly. Boras had
maintained to executives with other teams that he already had
multiple offers for Williams for as many as seven and eight years,
and the Red Sox apparently are heeding his assertions with an offer
of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who met with Boston officials Sunday and Monday and
was said to have an instant liking for the Red Sox Manager Jimy
Williams, would change the dynamics of an organization that has
relied on slow-footed power hitters for much of its frustrating
history. If Bernie Williams signs with Boston and, in effect,
replaces the slothful slugger Mo Vaughn, the strength of the team
would shift toward speed and defense, and its offense would be at
least partially built on singles and doubles, rather than the
long-time devotion to home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Williams would also assume extraordinary pressure as the more
expensive substitute for the immensely popular Vaughn, to whom the
Red Sox offered a five-year, $63 million contract, which Vaughn
rejected. Vaughn is now expected to sign for more money with the
Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees officials, long convinced that Williams will sign
elsewhere, are believed to have made a four-year offer to Belle for
between $48 million and $50 million, and Cashman, negotiated with
Belle's agent for much of Tuesday. Belle's asking price could climb
as high as $60 million. A deal could be completed as soon as
Wednesday, although the emergence of the Orioles in the chase for
Belle could delay resolution until after the holiday weekend. Arn
Tellem, Belle's agent, would not say whether Baltimore had entered
the bidding. He did say this: ``There have been some interesting
developments, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles, coming off a hugely disappointing 1998 season, have
lost the second baseman Roberto Alomar (who agreed to a four-year,
$32 million contract with Cleveland) and negotiations with the
first baseman Rafael Palmeiro _ offered four years and $32 million
_ seem to have bogged down. B.J. Surhoff, another free agent, is
being courted by the Mets and Pittsburgh, and Eric Davis has signed
with St. Louis. The Orioles bid $40 million for Brian Jordan, but
lost out to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Given those repeated failures and perhaps fearful of what
appears to be a poor offensive team in 1999, Baltimore is exploring
the option of signing Belle; according to a major-league executive,
an offer likely was forthcoming, perhaps as soon as Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have not been as tenuous in their approach to Brown:
They have informed the pitcher's agent they are willing to give him
a five-year deal, knowing full well that Brown wants at least $12
million annually and a six-year contract. Signing Brown would give
Baltimore perhaps the strongest pitching rotation in the American
League, with Mike Mussina, Scott Erickson, Juan Guzman and the
youngster Sidney Ponson also included. Their catcher could be Todd
Hundley, because the Mets have proposed a trade in which they would
get Orioles reliever Armando Benitez in return. But the Orioles are
wary of the possibility that Hundley's surgically repaired right
elbow will prevent him from being an everyday player behind the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   If Williams signs with the Red Sox or the Arizona Diamondbacks
(the other team with a stated interest in the center fielder) and
Belle somehow lands with the Orioles, the Yankees suddenly would be
without a slugger for the middle of their lineup. Cashman said
Tuesday that his priority for the off-season is ``to get something
done with the final piece to our puzzle _ a position player.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing a free agent, he said, would be the ``more realistic''
way to get that done. Without Belle or Williams, the Yankees could
pursue Vaughn, a first baseman who would not fit naturally into
their lineup. Or the Yankees could attempt to trade prospects for
Montreal's Rondell White or Anaheim's Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are not among those teams in the running for the
pitcher Randy Johnson. The Houston Astros, who traded for Johnson
late in the 1998 season and were rewarded when he drove them to the
playoffs, pulled out of the bidding for the left-handed pitcher
Tuesday. The Anaheim Angels, Texas Rangers and Diamondbacks appear
to the front-runners for Johnson, the four-year bids of both teams
approaching $13 million annually. The San Diego Padres seem to have
dropped out of the running for Brown, while St. Louis and Colorado
remain among the clubs still hoping to land the hard-throwing
right-hander.

HURRICANE DAMAGE STIRS DEBATE ON IMMIGRANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The devastation wrought by Hurricane Mitch in
Central America has kicked up a political and policy storm over the
Clinton administration's policy toward illegal immigrants and
refugees from that region.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Immigration and Naturalization Service said that
because of the devastation left by the hurricane, people from El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua who are in the United
States illegally and are detained by the INS will not face
deportation proceedings until Jan. 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most tangible, concrete, rapid action that we
could take to help these governments cope with this disaster,''
said Andrew Lluberes, an INS spokesman. ``The last thing that they
needed was to have people deported back to their countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also considering granting temporary
protective status to refugees and illegal aliens from the four
Central American nations that bore the brunt of the storm:
Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua. That designation
would allow such people to avoid deportation and work legally in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of immigrant rights organizations Tuesday also called
upon the Justice Department to ease the standards under which some
refugees and undocumented workers who arrived in the United States
from El Salvador or Guatemala before fall 1990 can avoid being
deported altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely the wrong time to begin a massive
deportation to this region,'' said Raul Yzaguirre, president of the
National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic organization.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly mixed message on the issue of Central American
immigrants reflects the dilemma facing policy makers between
obeying the law regarding illegal immigrants and understanding that
deporting people to the devastated economies of Central America
could only exacerbate a terrible situation there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a double-edged problem here for those countries with
the immigrants,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said at a briefing Tuesday
on her trip to the region. ``One is, they cannot accommodate people
at this time. There's literally nowhere for people to live or be
put. They also would collapse completely, in some cases, without
the funds coming in from the people who are working and sending, in
some cases, in at least one of the countries, up to $1 billion a
year, which is a huge part of their gross domestic product.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House subcommittee on
immigration, said he expected that refugees from Honduras, which
sustained the most damage and loss of life, to be given temporary
protected status. But, Smith said, the administration should be
careful not to provoke a rush of illegal immigration of Central
Americans seeking to escape the chaos following the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing we can do is precipitate an immigration
emergency by signaling that individuals currently in Central
America should abandon their countries in their countries' time of
greatest need,'' said Smith, the leading congressional advocate of
reduced immigration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the moment, the policy toward Central American refugees is
being played out over regulations governing how a group of about
260,000 Guatemalans and Salvadorans can apply to become permanent
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The group is part of a wave of refugees who fled as their
countries became mired in civil wars in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrant rights groups have long accused the federal government
of a double standard, saying these refugees were deported because
Washington supported their governments while others from Communist
countries like Cuba and Nicaragua were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Congress passed legislation that set up two separate
procedures. People from Cuba and Nicaragua who arrived in the
United States before December 1995 were automatically given amnesty
from deportation. Salvadorans and Guatemalans, and some Eastern
Europeans, have to prove to immigration authorities that they are
of sound moral character and that deporting them would cause them
extreme hardship.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration rights advocates Tuesday complained that the new
regulations do not offer a blanket determination that anyone
deported to Central America would automatically suffer extreme
hardship because of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Mitch, it is hard to believe that the administration
proposes that each individual prove that he will suffer extreme
hardship,'' said Frank Sharry, executive director of the National
Immigration Forum, an immigrant rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Lluberes said hearing officers would be trained on the impact of
the hurricane, although the law required that hardship findings
must be determined on a case-by-case basis.

 What's in A Name? Plenty  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I am at the preliminary stage of starting a business. 1)
Do I need to get a fictitious business name? 2) Do I need to
trademark or register the name through the federal government?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  If you plan to do business under your own name, you do
not need to apply for a fictitious business name. But if it is
under an assumed name, you should file a DBA (doing business as)
statement in the county where you plan to incorporate. Contact your
county clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what you call your business, if you plan to form a
corporation, you will need to register with the secretary of
state's office in the state in which you plan to incorporate.
</P>
<P>
   But neither applying for a fictitious name nor filing for
incorporation is the same as clearing the name for use as a
trademark. To do that, San Francisco trademark attorney Michelle
Kahn suggests getting a trademark attorney to conduct a legal
availability search.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring what does and does not constitute trademark
infringement often requires expert analysis. Even if no one is
using the name you want to use, that doesn't mean you have rights
to it. For example, say you want to use the name McBagel for a
fast-food bagel outfit. If you do, be prepared to get creamed by
McDonald's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing your business name can get costly. Paul Frohlich, a
mutual fund portfolio manager turned chef turned entrepreneur, came
up with the name Yum for his gourmet-food retailing concept. He
paid $35 to file for the fictitious name at the San Francisco
clerk's office, after first paying a $75 business tax registration
fee. He also paid $20 for a name search with the secretary of
state's office, a $100 filing fee to incorporate under the name Yum
and another $600 for the annual franchise fee.
</P>
<P>
   Costs did not end there. Frohlich, 39, wanted to make sure
someone else hadn't already made use of Yum as a trade name or
trademark on the same or similar goods.
</P>
<P>
   An informal screen search on the Internet turned up nothing, but
he consulted an attorney who cleared the name and is in the process
of &UR;  &LR; obtaining registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. It costs $250 to file for each industry classification, and
in Frohlich's case, he could have filed for as many 13. Then there
are lawyer fees, which easily can top $5,000. But that's cheaper
than most legal battles if someone challenges your name and
business later.
</P>
<P>
   Books and online guides to starting a business offer much more
information on protecting your intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   Partner Problems
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Question: What are the top management problems faced by
principals in a partnership?
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &LR; Answer: Resolving disputes without ending up dissolving the
business is the main problem partnerships have, according to
Richard Harroch, an attorney at Orrick, Herrington &AMP; Sutcliffe and
author of the new book ``Small Business Kit for Dummies'' (IDG
Books, $24.99).
</P>
<P>
   In a corporation, key decisions typically are decided by
majority vote of the directors. Partnerships need to spell out what
decisions require unanimous approval of all partners, or two-thirds
or majority approval, and what decisions can be made by the
president or individual partners.
</P>
<P>
   Other issues include:
</P>
<P>
   _How much will each partner invest? This includes initial
investment, additional contributions if needed and investment caps.
</P>
<P>
   _What services and time commitment are expected of each partner?
</P>
<P>
   _How will profits be divided?
</P>
<P>
   _Can partners work on their own outside the partnership, either
in competition with the company or in unrelated fields?
</P>
<P>
   _What happens if a partner wants to leave the partnership, dies
or is disabled? Is there a buy-out formula so that the business can
continue?
</P>
<P>
   Betting on Brunch
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Question: I am interested in finding out how to go about
opening my own breakfast/lunch cafe. I currently am a chef but
don't know where to go to get the information I need about costs,
budgeting, finding locations, etc.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Answer: You might start your quest at your local chamber of
commerce. Also contact the Service Corps of Retired Executives for
more personal attention. Its office in San Francisco is 455 Market
Street, sixth floor. Volunteer Barry Livingston says SCORE has
plans, including detailed cost analysis, for about 150 types of
businesses from antiques and carpet cleaning to sandwich shops and
taverns. Would-be entrepreneurs can study these businesses on
computers at SCORE and also talk with volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants are one of the riskiest businesses. The failure rate
is daunting, and there is plenty of competition, especially in the
Bay Area. But consumers' appetite for new culinary experiences also
remains high. Experts suggest doing a lot of homework and market
research to help ensure that your concept is not half-baked.
</P>
<P>
   It can be very expensive setting up a restaurant. Livingston,
whose family once ran a local department store of the same name,
suggests that a good real estate broker can help find the right
location at the right price. In addition to base rent, it is
important to negotiate who pays for what share of taxes, insurance
and improvements.

U.S. venture capital investments flow to local startups.
</P>
<P>
   But non-high-tech innovations also are getting to market. And
they don't necessarily require a Ph.D. or terribly deep pockets.
They just needed imagination, patience and perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   The Swatch of Pens?
</P>
<P>
   After drafting for six hours a day with a conventional pencil,
architect Charles Debbas decided to design a more ergonomic writing
instrument three years ago. He molded Play-Doh into different
shapes before baking it in the oven. In less than two months,
Debbas arrived at a design, a bit like a chile pepper, which felt
right in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Ergo ballpoint pen comes in right-hand and left-hand
versions, in leather-clad aluminum for $85 retail or bright plastic
for $16 to $20. The pen can be found at various outlets, including
Nordstrom, the Nature Co. and San Francisco Museum. The biggest
customer, Disney, sells a version with a cap shaped like Mickey
Mouse's head.
</P>
<P>
   Debbas avoided the mistakes of many entrepreneurs by testing the
market for his product before rushing it into production.
</P>
<P>
   He had prototypes of his pen produced by Plynetics in San
Leandro and did the drawings and engineering work himself, as he
did for his patent applications. By the time he took a booth at the
New York Stationery show in May 1997 to gauge public reaction,
Debbas figures he had invested about $30,000 of his own money.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the response was ``phenomenal,'' he said. ``People
lined up for four-and-a-half days.''
</P>
<P>
   He raised another $130,000 from family and friends to produce
molds and get into production.
</P>
<P>
   But launching Ergo has not been without problems. The first
manufacturer in Grass Valley (Nevada County) could only produce
about 300 plastic pens a week, and there were glitches like blotchy
color and rubber thumb grips that peeled off. Debbas changed
contract manufacturers, but not before production was halted for
four months early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he plans to produce as many as 15,000 pens this
year in Colorado and California. Orders are flowing in from as far
as Italy and Japan, and Debbas plans to add new tropical colors and
versions for people with larger hands next year. Eventually he
hopes to become ``the Swatch of pens.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, about $600,000 has been invested in the business,
including some reinvested revenues. Debbas figures he needs to
raise about double that amount with the hope of breaking even in
about 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to other innovators: ``Follow your gut feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Better Basket
</P>
<P>
   Chris Flink, 26, came up with his ergonomic shopping basket four
years ago as a senior at Stanford. His assignment for mechanical
Engineering 116c was to find a need and then develop a product to
fill it.
</P>
<P>
   After searching for a few weeks, he settled on the handheld
shopping basket _ a product used by millions of people that hadn't
evolved very much. ``It was basically a crate with wire handles
that fold out of the way,'' Flink observed.
</P>
<P>
   After studying shops and shoppers, interviewing friends and
strangers, and researching patents and basket manufacturers, Flink
figured he could come up with a better design. What he designed for
class was a prototype that replaced the two thin metal handles that
can pinch fingers and dig into the hand with a plastic handle
rising from the center of the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, the handle was like one you would find on a
briefcase. The shape of the basket was slightly curved and could be
held more easily against the body. In addition, it could still be
stacked like conventional baskets.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Flink worked in New York for a design
consultant for a year but then returned to his basket concept. To
reduce the ``financial peril'' of launching a product, he did the
drawings and filed for a provisional patent himself. Then Flink met
with purchasing agents for such potential customers as Safeway,
Thrifty Payless and Orchard Supply.
</P>
<P>
   With ``letters of interest'' from some of the main buyers of
shopping baskets, Flink went to Russell &AMP; Miller, a major Southern
California supplier to the retail trade and licensed the company to
produce his design.
</P>
<P>
   The market for handheld shopping baskets in the United States is
about 7 million units a year, and Flink hopes to capture a big
chunk of it. His baskets, priced about the same as conventional
baskets at $5 each, are starting to show up at A&AMP;P, Ralph's,
Orchard Supply and Co-Op markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletproof Idea
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Holden, one of five brothers who all ended up opticians,
created Zurich International after a Tahoe ski outing in 1985. His
wraparound glasses keep out wind and dust as well as ultraviolet
and some infrared rays. Because they are made from the same
$50-per-pound Lexan polycarbonite used in jet windshields, the
glasses reportedly can stop a speeding bullet or flying shrapnel.
</P>
<P>
   Holden, 57, makes a living selling about 20,000 pairs of the $50
to $60 glasses a year, primarily to ski and other outdoor
enthusiasts at fairs and by direct marketing. But sales of the
specs have not been spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people buy sunglasses because they are good-looking,''
said Bill Seidel, a Sebastopol marketing expert who is advising
Zurich on how to develop a broader market. Holden acknowledges that
the glasses ``are designed for protection and performance rather
than style and fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's glasses are going through required ballistics
testing to qualify for sales to military and police units. Zurich
also hopes to raise $1.2 million in a public offering and use some
of the proceeds to develop an infomercial. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Seidel, who also teaches entrepreneurship, innovation and direct
marketing at UC Berkeley Extension, notes that it can take a long
time to launch a new product. The average span from idea to product
introduction is about seven years.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of best-selling products take longer than that.
Television, which was invented in 1884, took 46 years of research
and development before reaching the market in 1930, and then
another 15 years to become popular.
</P>
<P>
   The original 1948 Pluto Platter took only two years to develop.
But it wasn't until 1964 when it was rechristened as the Frisbee
and aimed at an older, teenage market that the product took off.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Focus on Needs
</P>
<P>
   One of the main problems innovators have, according to Seidel,
``is not knowing what the market is looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Rosa consultant Lawrence MacDonald, who helps
entrepreneurs develop electronic commerce and other products,
agrees. ``People get fixated on products rather than satisfying
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   He emphasizes the importance of developing a market for your
product, especially since only one out of 100 or 1,000 ideas ever
becomes a moneymaker. MacDonald subscribes to management guru Peter
Drucker's maxim that a new idea has to offer 10 times as much value
or cost one-tenth as much as an existing product to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   Some product ideas, which might save lives or prevent injuries,
are harder to measure.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Orinda anesthesiologist Nicholas Hyde came up with
a concept for a safer football helmet after he saw Denver Bronco
star Terrell Davis injure his neck after he was grabbed by the face
mask during last year's Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who practices medicine 60 percent of the time, is talking
with one of the major helmet manufacturers about testing his idea
for reducing cervical spine injuries and developing a prototype
helmet. To save development costs, he got an engineer to design the
accessory device in exchange for a 20 percent stake in the company
if the idea pays off.

 Service Provider Netcom Is for Sale Again  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Barely a year after it was sold to ICG Communications Inc., Netcom
is going on the block again.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Internet service provider, which sold for $225
million in a stock-swap in October of 1997, is for sale, according
to ICG officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICG bit off more than they could chew,'' said Laura Crowley, a
spokeswoman for Netcom.
</P>
<P>
   ICG of Englewood, Colo., said it wants to sell Netcom so it can
concentrate on its core business of providing local telephone
service and data communications to business customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to keep Netcom's Internet backbone _ one of
the main reasons ICG bought Netcom _ to route traffic, but does not
want to be involved in the dial-up Internet access business. ICG
officials said they plan to sell Netcom's operating assets within
the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The sale will not affect existing Netcom customers, who will
continue to get dial-up Internet access, said Heatherecq &LR; 
Evans-Keenan, a spokeswoman for ICG.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really focusing on what our customer base is asking for
_ the core telecom voice and data products,'' Evans-Keenan said.
``We got what we wanted when we purchased them. It doesn't make
sense for us to offer some of Netcom's products as part of our
customer portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   When ICG bought Netcom, officials said the purchase would help
it compete against regional phone companies, such as Pacific Bell,
which offer both voice and data products.
</P>
<P>
   Evans-Keenan said retaining Netcom's backbone will allow ICG to
continue that goal. She added that the company spend the next 12
months deciding which parts of Netcom to sell and retain.
</P>
<P>
   For Netcom, the outcome of being sold is not as clear. Analysts
said they don't expect ICG to have a problem selling Netcom, but
said ICG may not get as good a price as it would like.
</P>
<P>
   With so many Internet access providers on the market, Netcom's
value may not be as high as it was last year, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they'll be bought by somebody, but I don't know what
the price will be,'' said Frank Governali, who follows ICG for
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He said the decision to sell Netcom is wise because it does not
fit in with ICG's main business line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's smart for (ICG) to get rid of it. They have so much to do
and so many things to concentrate on,'' Governali said. ``Were they
overly aggressive or optimistic with that purchase? Well, probably.
But a lot of other companies have done the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Netcom's Crowley said the company's 750 employees are not
concerned about the sale and don't expect any layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things here are business as usual,'' she said.

TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATIONS ON THE POSSIBILITIES OF FORM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Roslyn Sulcas has been writing about William Forsythe's work since
1990.  
 By ROSLYN SULCAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In Europe, the choreographer William
Forsythe is widely considered the most important dance maker on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   In his own country, the United States, his name is probably
known only to dancers and a limited number of balletgoers who have
seen his works in the repertories of the New York City Ballet, the
San Francisco Ballet or the Joffrey Ballet, or perhaps performed by
a touring company from across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The visit of Forsythe and the company he directs, the Frankfurt
Ballet, to the Brooklyn Academy of Music for six performances
starting Wednesday marks a decade since the troupe's last
appearances in the United States _ a surprising absence for a
company that has put its hometown on the dance map, held a 10-year
residence contract at the Chatelet Theater in Paris and is coveted
by programmers all over the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a surprising absence also for Forsythe. Born in 1949, he
grew up in New York City, made his first dances to rock-and-roll
and for school musicals, and took his first professional steps with
the Joffrey Ballet junior company.
</P>
<P>
   He left home in 1973, however, to join the Stuttgart Ballet
(becoming the last dancer hired by the renowned choreographer John
Cranko before Cranko's untimely death that year), and like many
others, John Neumeier and Jiri Kylian among them, made his first
serious works in the creative context of that company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, after a short period as a freelance choreographer
(during which time Rudolf Nureyev commissioned ``France/Dance'' for
the Paris Opera Ballet from him), Forsythe was invited to take over
the directorship of the Frankfurt Ballet, a competent provincial
troupe with a conventional ballet repertory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the intervening years, Forsythe has transformed this company
into a unique instrument for his choreographic meditations on the
possibilities of the dancing body _ and in the process has formed
many dozens of exceptional artists. Forsythe has developed an
idiosyncratic, personal style of movement into a complex physical
language that encompasses, utilizes and often transcends classical
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a Forsythe work is to enter a thrilling theatrical
universe with its own laws and logic, in which movement, sound,
lighting and space draw the spectator into unexpected and
compelling realms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 34 ballets that Forsythe has made for his own
company are evening-length works that incorporate speech,
theatrical events, dazzling lighting effects, sets and costumes.
Others are pared-down events in which dancers in practice clothes
seem to be engaged in their own explorations of movement, or are
caught up in dreamlike states in bare, open spaces subtly colored
by blue shadows or blanched by white light. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite a long absence from the American stage, the slow
filtration of Forsythe ballets into the repertories of most major
ballet companies worldwide means that American dancers and
choreographers _ and thus audiences _ have probably been
unobtrusively influenced by his distinctive eye and style.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the Frankfurt Ballet in the full-length ``Eidos:
Telos'' at BAM is nonetheless likely to astonish those for whom
Forsythe is synonymous with the extreme off-balance extensions of
his 1987 work ``In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,'' or the
deceptively easy-on-the-eye allegro footwork and witty partnering
of ``Herman Schmerman,'' of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Divided into three parts, the 1995 ``Eidos: Telos'' (loosely
translated as ``The Form: The End,'' or ``Genre: The End'') is one
of Forsythe's large-scale works that brings out his big creative
guns. Framing a dramatic narrative act with two pure-dance
sections, Forsythe fully demonstrates his gift for creating
theatrical effect, as well as the complex, contrapuntal movement
style that is a result of more than a decade of choreographic
exploration. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He began to introduce improvisational techniques into the
creative process with the making of the ballet ``The Interrogation
of Robert Scott'' in 1987. ``Ballet is a body of knowledge, not an
ideology,'' says Forsythe, whose analytical approach and fondness
for citing philosophers and thinkers in program notes have won him
a reputation as an intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   His choreography, however, is animated by very concrete ideas.
``With `Robert Scott,' '' he says, ``we developed the idea of
`kinetic isometries,' which are ways of imagining the geometric
relationships between different parts of the body as they move.
Ballet is in our bodies, but we began to see that we could also
create our own language.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forsythian language now contains so many terms for
compositional techniques, or ``operations,'' that in 1994 Forsythe
created a CD-ROM as a learning tool for new dancers in the company,
a process that led to the creation of ``Self Meant to Govern,'' the
first part of ``Eidos: Telos.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an extraordinary compilation of slippery, intricately
connected, densely coordinated sequences for six dancers on a bare
white-lighted stage populated by ticking clocks, a metronome and a
violinist. (The music, with sources in Stravinsky's ``Apollo,'' is
by Thom Willems, a Dutch composer who has worked with Forsythe
since 1984.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Using the ``135 little sequences,'' cued to them by letters on
the clocks, the dancers can apply various operations _
``iterations, reversing a movement, repeating it using another part
of the body, and so on,'' Forsythe explains _ within specific time
frames, and the resulting movement is like nothing one can imagine:
knees buckle, bottoms push up into the air, elbows skew into
elaborate angles, shoulders trace complex trajectories in space in
fluid counterpoint.  &QL;

 PG&AMP;E to Sell Power Plants For $1 Billion  &HT;       
 By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said yesterday it will sell three big
gas-fired power plants and a network of 14 geothermal plants for
$1.01 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The plants sold for nearly double their book value. Altogether,
the sale brings the utility's total take from asset sales to $1.5
billion, all of which were stimulated by deregulation of the
state's $23 billion electricity marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Purchasers include Southern Energy Co. of Atlanta, which is on a
nationwide buying spree. In addition to buying $801 million worth
of PG&AMP;E plants, the Georgia firm said yesterday it will buy $480
million worth of New York power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Net proceeds from the PG&AMP;E divestiture will bypass shareholders
and flow directly to PG&AMP;E's rate-paying customers. That's because
every dollar utilities reap from power plant sales, by order of the
state's deregulation law, must be used to offset billions of
dollars in utility debts that ratepayers otherwise are on the hook
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   In this latest round of sales, the second of three, buyers were
solicited for power plants constructed between 1954 and 1985 that
collectively produce 4,289 megawatts of power or enough electricity
to light four-and-a-half million homes.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Energy will pay $801 million for the gas-fired Potrero,
Pittsburg and Contra Costa power plants that provide power and
electric stability to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   FPL Energy Inc. of Florida will pay $213 million for The Geysers
power plants in Lake and Sonoma counties, the largest system of
geothermal generating plants in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The price paid for gas-fired plants, at $396 per kilowatt,
slightly surpassed the average price of $370 per kilowatt for other
oil and gas plants sold previously, primarily in the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, approximately 40,000 megawatts of capacity has been
sold by former monopoly utilities in the past 18 months for $17.5
billion, according to Resource Data International, a Colorado
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The plant sales reflect a concerted push by federal and state
energy regulators to make the generation and sale of electricity
competitive enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are being divested at the behest of regulators who
don't want companies with a stranglehold on supply to be in a
position to set prices in emerging electricity markets.
</P>
<P>
   But in many cases, operators have decided to go beyond plant
sales mandated by regulators.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E, for example, was ordered to sell half its gas-fired plants
but decided, instead, to sell everything except its 2,200-megawatt
Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. It sold three plants to Duke Energy
Power Services late last year for $501 million, or about 1.3 times
book value. Its hydroelectric resources, consisting of 68 power
houses on 16 river systems, will be part of a future transfer that
is expected to occur next year.

 FRANKFURT, Germany: fluid counterpoint.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While straightforward balletic works like ``In the Middle,
Somewhat Elevated'' play overtly with the dancers' technical
abilities, there is no exhibition of prowess in ``Eidos: Telos.''
</P>
<P>
   Every movement is full of understated, elaborated detail as
different body parts appear to initiate their own small dance
simultaneously; no step ever serves as a transition to another,
more important visual effect.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the way Forsythe joins movements together is a
particular pleasure of all his work. Exquisitely beautiful shapes
coalesce and vanish, like objects moved by water.
</P>
<P>
   And though the shapes of these movements and the dispositions of
weight have little to do with ballet's formal positions and clean
lines, the dancers' classically trained bodies hold balletic
clarity and articulation as a perpetual, elusive point of
reference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forsythe is chary of the word ``improvisation''; rather, he
likes to think of the dancers' responsibilities in this section as
similar to those of virtuoso musicians who make choices about order
and timing when performing sequences in a cadenza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of memorizing intellectually,'' he says.
``It's about the body being a form of memory; the physical patterns
in your body are listening to the music and recalling
themselves.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the third section, the sequences are expanded into complex
formal groupings that align and dissolve like a shaken
kaleidoscope. Performing when you are partly responsible for the
material, Forsythe stresses, takes both courage and years of
training. ``What I wanted to show in ``Eidos,' '' he says, ``is the
extent of the dancers' accomplishment.'' (They also perform in more
conventional fashion; Forsythe most recently made two balletic,
on-point works for his company.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That accomplishment extends to other arenas, too. Dana
Caspersen, an American who has been a member of Frankfurt Ballet
for 10 years and is one of its most striking performers, dominates
the middle section of ``Eidos: Telos'' with a tour de force
speaking role that she wrote herself, drawing inspiration from
Robert Calasso's ``Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony,'' a book about
the myths that underpin Western culture.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caspersen's lengthy, mesmerizing monologue is dominated by
the myth of Persephone and evoked in fragmented poetic segments as,
bare-breasted in a long flame-colored skirt, she strides and crawls
around the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Forsythe's theatrical skills _ his ability to give structure and
rhythm to a dreamlike domain, to explode and contract the space,
and to conjure up moments of hallucinatory beauty _ are fully
evident in this section, as the corps de ballet in long
jewel-colored silks swirl across Ms. Caspersen's mythological
universe.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Eidos: Telos'' was made in the wake of the death of Forsythe's
wife, the American dancer Tracey-Kai Maier, and Ms. Caspersen says
she wrote the text ``thinking about the appearance of radical
change in people's lives, and how these sudden experiences of
insolidity alter your vision of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing one's vision of the world might well describe
Forsythe's modus operandi, too, insofar as he seems always to want
to break up or interrupt any comfortable response to his work; to
strive for beauty, yet resist its seduction. While his works never
display a linear narrative, they often contain multiple narrative
elements that create strong emotional overtones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's about shifting frames and perspectives,
reimagining contexts,'' Forsythe says. ``In `Eidos' there are
sublime moments and grotesque moments; it forces you to keep moving
away from and back towards what is happening on stage. But you can
always come up with explanations afterward. What I always want to
say is that you don't have to understand this, you just have to
watch it, and then maybe something will happen to you without
thinking.''

 AOL Deal May Doom Netscape  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Netscape Communications would end up as a subsidiary of America
Online if yesterday's $4.2 billion buyout goes through. But whether
Netscape has any future at all is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; As part of a sidecar deal, AOL and Sun Microsystems said they
will develop future versions of Netscape's software, including its
popular Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Netscape personnel would be involved in the
products, Sun's chief strategy officer Bill Raduchel said simply,
``There is no Netscape anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If the merger spells trouble for Netscape, it promises to be a
boon to Sun of Mountain View, which would be in position to mount a
major challenge to Microsoft in the fast-growing area of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, a leading maker of business computers, already is one of
the star players on the Internet. Its computers run the majority of
the world's Internet service providers, and the Java programming
language it developed has become a staple in creating interactive
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under a three-year agreement with AOL, Sun now also will have
Netscape's corporate software _ the stuff that lets corporations do
business online.
</P>
<P>
   In return for marketing rights to the Netscape software, Sun has
agreed to pay AOL more than $350 million up front, plus what the
companies termed ``significant minimum revenue commitments'' over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sun will recoup some of that investment because the deal also
calls for AOL to purchase $500 million worth of Sun's computer
systems and services at list price.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the deal a good one for Sun. ``It's a very
finite investment with a very good potential for return,'' said
Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Raduchel insisted that Sun was not to blame for holding up the
AOL-Netscape deal, denying speculation that his company held out
for better terms than AOL wanted to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us bargained hard, and both sides had to protect our
shareholders,'' he said. ``We finally had an agreement at 2:05
(Tuesday) morning.''
</P>
<P>
   By combining Sun's computers and Netscape's e-commerce software,
Internet service providers and online businesses would be able to
get all of their technology from one company.
</P>
<P>
   This will make Sun a more formidable competitor to Microsoft,
which went head to head with Netscape in e-commerce software but
does not sell hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Sun the tools to be the competitor to Microsoft
they've always wanted to be,'' said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Sun also said they will develop new Internet devices
that will help users access the Web or AOL from anyplace. According
to Raduchel, those devices could be pagers, smart phones, set-top
boxes and portable Internet-only appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The new devices promise to be fertile ground for Java, and
perhaps a Java-based operating system that could rival Windows CE,
Microsoft's OS for handheld computers and other portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge over the next 20 years will not be speed or cost
or performance,'' said Raduchel. ``It will be a question of
complexity, and we're going to try to eliminate an awful lot of
that complexity.''

CLINTON CRITIC SEEKS CENSURE RATHER THAN IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's fiercest Democratic critic in
the House on Tuesday called upon Speaker Newt Gingrich to abandon
the impeachment process in favor of a strong censure against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The critic, Rep. Paul McHale of Pennsylvania, who in August
became the first House Democrat to demand that Clinton resign, said
he now supported censure. It is unlikely, McHale said, that a
two-thirds majority in the Senate would vote to remove Clinton, and
national security crises, like the confrontation with Iraq, demand
the commander in chief's undivided attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's now clear that impeachment is a blind alley, it's time
to resolve the matter as quickly and as responsibly as possible,''
he said Tuesday night in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Gingrich, McHale urged censure, at a time when
House Republicans and Democrats are counting heads to see if there
are enough votes to impeach the president. His suggestion
underscores how Republicans, already faced with mounting
defections, cannot rely on a handful of Democrats thought to be
leaning in favor of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   McHale's proposed resolution would ``censure and condemn William
Jefferson Clinton for having engaged in a pattern of deceitful and
dishonest conduct that was grossly inconsistent with his
constitutional obligation and sacred duty to faithfully execute the
laws of the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders Tuesday sought to dismiss McHale's gesture as
a premature move to short-circuit the House Judiciary Committee's
impeachment proceedings, led by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``First things first,'' said Christina Martin, Gingrich's
spokeswoman. ``Chairman Hyde and his committee have to send a
report to the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., whom Republicans have chosen as
Gingrich's successor, also sought to distance himself from McHale's
suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not change his personal view that the Constitution
does not provide for censure in the House,'' said Mark Corallo,
Livingston's spokesman. ``That's like a plea bargain,'' a penalty
that Livingston himself has said would be more appropriate for the
Senate to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston appeared to indicate Sunday that censure was not his
first preference, but he did not close the door either, saying that
censuring or rebuking the president would ``certainly be a
possibility'' for the Judiciary and House Rules committees to
study.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats reacted with glee to McHale's proposal,
embracing the retiring three-term former Marine who had been
ostracized by many in his party after his stinging criticism of
Clinton. McHale said on the House floor in October that Clinton's
conduct was ``predatory, reckless and breathtakingly arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   Julian Epstein, the Judiciary Committee's Democratic staff
director, observed, ``It's another nail in the impeachment coffin,
and it's a really big one.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, James Kennedy, said, ``While we don't
agree with Congressman McHale's view of the allegations, as we said
before, it's up to members of Congress to decide how to bring this
whole matter to a prompt and just conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Gregory Craig, a special White House counsel, signaled
that the White House was open to any ``serious and reasonable''
compromise that allowed Clinton to put the yearlong scandal behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   With the Judiciary Committee scheduled to begin considering
articles of impeachment the week of Dec. 7, amid the growing
likelihood that the panel will approve at least one article, the
House is set to receive the recommendations the week of Dec. 14.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McHale, who said he had not consulted with any other lawmaker,
proposed that the House consider his resolution after the committee
vote as ``an alternative to and in lieu of further impeachment
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   His four-paragraph resolution also states that Clinton, ``in
violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the
office of president of the United States and in violation of his
constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully
executed, has prevented, obstructed and impeded the administration
of justice by providing false and misleading testimony under
oath.''
</P>
<P>
   It also says that Clinton ``engaged personally and through his
subordinates and agents in a course of conduct or plan designed to
delay, impede and obstruct the investigation into and the
disclosure of information about the president's improper and
reprehensible relationship with'' Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   By engaging in an affair with Ms. Lewinsky, Clinton ``has acted
in a manner contrary to his trust as president, impairing the due
and proper administration of justice in the conduct of lawful
inquiries, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice
and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,''
the resolution says.
</P>
<P>
   Even before McHale sent his letter to Gingrich, the Judiciary
Committee rejected the idea of circumventing its proceedings with a
reprimand.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Republican members on the committee have publicly
rejected the idea of censure either because it's not
constitutionally prescribed or because it would set a bad
precedent, given the seriousness of the allegations,'' said Paul
McNulty, a Republican committee spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass., a member of the panel, drew
McNulty's response after announcing he would offer a resolution to
censure Clinton rather than impeach him. Another committee
Democrat, Rep. Thomas Barrett of Wisconsin, immediately seconded
Delahunt's proposal.  &QL;

ANALYSIS: WITH CLOUD OF INQUIRY LIFTED, GORE IS ENERGIZED FOR
2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (see also GORE-FUNDRAISING)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno's decision not to seek
an independent counsel to investigate Al Gore frees the vice
president from a daunting political millstone just as he is gearing
up to begin soliciting millions of dollars for his presidential
campaign in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's closest advisers had viewed the federal inquiry
concerning campaign fund raising as the most potentially
debilitating obstacle to his capturing the Democratic presidential
nomination. They had feared that a protracted investigation would
have discouraged people from making contributions, distracted Gore
and his aides for months and handed the vice president's rivals in
both parties ammunition to impugn his integrity. Now, Gore advisers
predict that Reno's move will discourage other Democrats from
taking him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in the beginning and there's nothing in the
end but a lot of finger pointing by Republicans,'' said Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, who is close to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would really have been a heavy burden for him to bear while
he's running for president,'' Harkin said. ``I don't think it would
have been a death blow, but it would have been a couple of good
punches to the head. It would have made it much harder for him to
raise money.''
</P>
<P>
   One close adviser to Gore, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said that virtually every move by the vice president
would have been ``suspect and potentially subpoenaed.'' Instead,
the adviser said, it will now be ``a suicide mission'' for any
Democrat to challenge ``a very well financed and well organized
vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Gore said Reno's decision came at a fortuitous time
because in January the vice president planned to shut down his
political action committee _ set up to generate good will by
donating to the campaigns of candidates around the country _ and to
establish an organization to collect money for his presidential
bid.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's decision is the latest encouraging
development for Gore, who was buoyed by the unexpectedly potent
showing of Democrats in this month's elections. Gore had campaigned
around the country for many Democrats who were victorious. And
advisers to Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri said the House
Democratic leader might be discouraged from challenging Gore for
the nomination because Gephardt would probably become speaker if
Democrats regain control of the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Given his role as an unusually influential vice president _ and
the aggressive support of President Clinton and the White House
staff _ Gore has long been by far the best positioned Democrat to
mount a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But questions about his fund-raising practices had dogged Gore
for nearly two years, and had raised serious doubts about what some
Democratic strategists had considered the inevitability that he
would capture the nomination. Questions about his fund raising had
also threatened Gore's Boy Scout image and had so put him on the
defensive that he refused to discuss the matter with reporters for
more than eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Woodburn, chairman of the Democratic Party in New
Hampshire, which traditionally holds the first primary, said voters
in the state had never been particularly concerned about the
accusations that enveloped Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's worked New Hampshire very hard and been very aggressive
here,'' Woodburn said. ``He starts with quite an advantage over
most everyone else just by virtue of his position. The biggest
question is can he go through the fire of ground campaigning in
this state?''
</P>
<P>
   Roxanne Conlin, who on Saturday was elected chairman of the
Democratic Party in Iowa, which traditionally holds the first
caucuses, said she did not believe Reno's decision would alter the
field because most of Gore's prospective rivals never expected a
prosecutor to be appointed. ``Will it lock other people out of the
process?'' she asked. ``I don't think so. The people who are
looking at it will continue to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   A top aide to Gore, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
that while ``I knew all along he had done nothing wrong, I had no
idea how the decision would come out.'' The aide added that he was
relieved because ``obviously, it's never pleasant to deal with this
sort of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president is still lampooned for his awkward
performance at a news conference in March 1997 when he repeatedly
defended his telephone solicitations from the White House by
declaring there was ``no controlling legal authority'' on whether
they were permissible. And future political opponents are likely to
dust off photographs of Gore attending an event at a Buddhist
temple in California that improperly funneled contributions to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just going to remove any tinge of impropriety,'' Rachel
Gorlin, a Democratic strategist, said of Reno's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``But any time you're playing high-stakes politics, they're
going to throw everything at you _ from the kitchen sink to the
nuns and the temple,'' Ms. Gorlin said. ``You can guarantee that.''

   BETTING ON WIRED FUTURE, INTERNET PIONEERS COMBINE
</P>
<P>
   Banking on forecasts of rapid, lucrative growth in electronic
commerce and a long-term vision of a thoroughly networked world,
America Online laid out the details of its agreement to buy
Netscape Communications for $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   AOL hopes that by moving quickly toward what both companies have
recently come to see as the inevitable convergence of technology
and media, it will secure a solid lead in a battle for market share
that will pit the merged company against giants like Microsoft and
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   An economist testifying for the government in the Microsoft
antitrust suit sat through another day of cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY SHOWS SURPRISING STAMINA
</P>
<P>
   The latest snapshot of the U.S. economy showed the
long-predicted slowdown is still more forecast than fact. The
economy performed better during the summer than first reported and
consumer confidence bounced back this fall. But corporate profits
weakened in the July-September quarter.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYPENS POSE DANGER TO CHILDREN
</P>
<P>
   The government announced that nearly 10 million playpens must be
repaired or destroyed because children could strangle themselves in
them. Companies are offering refunds or repair kits to consumers
who own the playpens, which carry brand names like Kolcraft,
Playskool, Strolee, Bilt-Rite, Evenflo, Gerry, Graco and
Pride-Trimble.
</P>
<P>
   TELMEX PHONE VENTURE CHALLENGED
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission said it had received
significant evidence that a joint venture created by the Sprint and
Telefonos de Mexico had committed anti-competitive practices in the
long-distance market. FCC Chairman William Kennard said the high
rates charged by the venture affected ``the most vulnerable
consumers,'' recent Hispanic immigrants who used the service to
call home.
</P>
<P>
   BANK LANDSCAPE SHIFTING IN EUROPE
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank's $9.7 billion bid for Bankers Trust is merely the
most visible sign of a much broader upheaval in European finance.

   MEXICO FACES NAFTA COMPLAINT
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials have acknowledged that their labor laws do not
adequately protect the rights of Mexican workers, according to
documents obtained by Canadian union officials who have filed a
complaint under the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS FALL ON CONCERN OVER PROFITS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell on concern that the euphoria that sent the Dow Jones
industrial average up 21 percent in six weeks was unjustified by
the outlook for corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Money is flowing into stock mutual funds again now that stocks
have rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   COURTSHIP MOVES TOWARD MARRIAGE
</P>
<P>
   After engaging in one of the slowest-moving courtships ever
between two companies, the French drug maker Rhone-Poulenc and
Hoechst of Germany are expected to announce their merger as early
as next week. The companies' investors have seldom enjoyed such a
robust ride. Hoechst's American depository receipts have jumped 26
percent since Oct. 13, and Rhone-Poulenc's ADR's have risen 38
percent.
</P>
<P>
   NOVELL PROFIT EXCEEDS FORECASTS
</P>
<P>
   Novell reported fourth-quarter earnings that exceeded estimates
and attributed the performance to strong sales of the new version
of its network operating system.

<P>
   Intuit reported a fiscal first-quarter loss, reflecting the
costs of developing tax preparation products to sell in coming
months.

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ Joe DiMaggio, hospitalized here since Oct. 12,
turns 84 on Wednesday amid mounting concern over his condition.
</P>
<P>
   WPIX in New York, which had long televised Yankee games,
reported Tuesday night that DiMaggio had lung cancer and had a
tumor removed from his left lung last month. The station also said
the Hall of Famer had a heart attack last week, basing its report
on three people who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Tony Segreto, a longtime news anchor at WTVJ, a
Miami television station, said he confirmed the WPIX report from a
person at Memorial Regional Hospital, where DiMaggio is a patient.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami station said DiMaggio was on a ventilator, but ESPN
reported Tuesday that DiMaggio's condition had improved enough so
that he was off life support.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Engelberg, a lawyer and a friend of DiMaggio's who has
been serving as his spokesman since he entered the hospital, denied
that DiMaggio had had a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``DiMaggio never had a heart attack _ this is totally false _
and he is not in grave condition,'' Engelberg said in a statement
from his Fort Lauderdale, Fla., office. `` DiMaggio and his family
heard this information on the television and were very upset.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Engelberg, in referring to the reported heart
attack, said, ``We were all shocked by this false rumor.''
Engelberg did not comment on the report that DiMaggio has lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio remains in intensive care at the hospital, where he was
admitted for what was described as pneumonia and a lung infection.
</P>
<P>
   His birthday will be limited mostly to family. Among those
expected to visit are his granddaughter Paula and her husband,
their two daughters, Joe's brother Dom and Engelberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take a ride down there,'' Dom DiMaggio said
Tuesday night from his Boynton Beach, Fla., home. ``I'm hoping
maybe we'll have a celebration of some kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Dom DiMaggio, the former Boston Red Sox center fielder, declined
to discuss his brother's condition, saying Engelberg is the
spokesman. Engelberg said in his statement that DiMaggio has
advised him to no longer discuss his health with anyone other than
DiMaggio's doctors and immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Joe Nachio, an old friend of DiMaggio's, said the
former Yankee felt better after talking to Engelberg on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morris just told me now that he's wide awake, he's gained 20
pounds, he's starting to smile and he recognizes a conversation and
the people around him,'' Nachio said from his office in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Memorial Regional Hospital have refused to comment
on DiMaggio's condition.

 Merger Means Uncertain Changes for Netscape   By Jon Swartz and Jamie Beckett  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Finalizing a deal that will create a formidable rival to Microsoft,
America Online agreed yesterday to purchase Netscape Communications
for $4.21 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process, Internet pioneer Netscape may end up as just
a shell of its former self.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to build a 21st century media company that
reaches the biggest possible audience,'' AOL Chief Executive
Officer Steve Case said in a telephone interview yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal elevates AOL to kingpin of the Net and marks an
unceremonious ending for Netscape's fairy tale rise from scrappy
startup to Internet icon.
</P>
<P>
   The Mountain View firm will cease to exist as an independent
company and will become the West Coast subsidiary of AOL, run by
AOL Chief Operating Officer Bob Pittman.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale will join AOL's board of directors
after the deal closes this spring but will not have any day-to-day
responsibilities. Netscape co-founder and Internet prodigy Marc
Andreessen is negotiating to work at AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the combination with AOL is a killer deal,'' an
apparently buoyant Barksdale said during a five-minute press
conference at Netscape's headquarters yesterday. But despite
executives' optimism, employees seemed worried. At lunchtime
yesterday, several stood together in tight knots on Netscape's
campus, sullenly telling reporters, ``No comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Case said AOL and Netscape are in the process of poring over
company ranks to determine possible cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, which acquires Netscape's Navigator Web browser and popular
Netcenter site for online news content and shopping, intends to
continue running Netcenter as a separate Internet gateway site
catering to a different audience than AOL, said Mike Homer,
Netscape's manager for Netcenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same as having MTV and VH1. Each is targeted to a
different audience,'' he said. While AOL.com caters to the Internet
novice who uses the service at home, Netcenter is intended for more
experienced Net surfers who access the Internet primarily at work
during the day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related three-year deal between AOL and Sun, the Mountain
View workstation-maker will develop and market e-commerce software
that makes it easy to set up shop in cyberspace. Sun will
co-develop future versions of Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   One Sun official said Netscape would no longer be involved in
the products that made it an Internet pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   While the pacts align three of Microsoft's staunchest rivals,
surprisingly, AOL will not drop Microsoft's Internet Explorer as
the browser on its online service in favor of Netscape's Navigator
browser. AOL will continue to offer both browsers, with Internet
Explorer the primary choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to maintain our presence on Windows-based computers
(through a reciprocal agreement with Microsoft),'' Case said. ``We
need to continue working with Microsoft where we can and compete
with them when necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Both AOL and Microsoft have benefited greatly from that
relationship. AOL gained prominent placement on computer screens
running Microsoft's Windows operating system, while Microsoft's Web
browser emerged as the standard on the largest online service.
</P>
<P>
   Case balked at suggestions that the Department of Justice's
antitrust case against Microsoft forced the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The deal was not dictated by the DOJ (Department of Justice)
case. It's about e-commerce,'' Case said. ``This is about building
a company for the next century. The government has a strong case,
which is based on Microsoft leveraging its operating system to gain
a monopoly. Our acquisition of Netscape had nothing to do with the
antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   He said AOL's motivation is to capture a sizable chunk of the
booming e-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Both AOL and Netscape have megasites, called portals, that
are doorways to the rest of the Internet. The portals were designed
to be the first place Web surfers go online, and the home base for
all their Internet activities.
</P>
<P>
   The potential payoff is astronomical: Net advertising is
expected to hit $7.7 billion by 2002, and e-commerce sales could
balloon to $37.5 billion this year, according to market researcher
Jupiter Communications in New York.
</P>
<P>
   By combining Netscape's services with its own, AOL will reach a
staggering 70 percent of all people who access the Internet,
industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always thought there would be three major portal players
_ ourselves, AOL and Microsoft,'' Yahoo Chief Operating Officer
Jeff Mallett said.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett and others predict the AOL-Netscape arrangement will
affect midrange portal players, forcing Excite, Infoseek and Lycos
to either seek a buyer or merge with one another to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge for Excite, Yahoo and other portal sites will be
to figure out how to compete with this new creature lumbering
through the underbrush _ is it going to start stomping everybody or
chasing its tail?'' said Jeff Tarter, publisher of Softletter in
Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord, Netscape shareholders will receive 0.45 shares
of AOL stock for each share of Netscape stock.
</P>
<P>
   The blockbuster deal's big winners are Case _ the 40-year-old
online mogul _ and Pittman, AOL's marketing whiz who is nicknamed
``Pitchman.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman _ a diligent cost-cutter who began the practice of
selling space on the AOL service to retailers and advertisers, such
as Amazon.com, Preview Travel and 1-800-Flowers _ will be
responsible for overseeing Netcenter and Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth-quarter results announced yesterday, Netscape said
revenues for Netcenter rose 24 percent from the previous quarter,
to $48 million. Netscape's Enterprise software and services
business posted a 2 percent increase in sales, to $114 million.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape reported a better-than-expected profit of $2.7 million
(3 cents per share) on record sales of $162 million, compared with
a profit of $10.2 million (10 cents) on sales of $152 million in
the same quarter a year ago.

AMERICA ONLINE TO BUY NETSCAPE FOR $4.2B IN STOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kicking off an expected round of consolidation among Internet
companies, America Online Inc. said Tuesday it would purchase
Internet software maker Netscape Communications Corp. for about
$4.2 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was widely anticipated, as was a side accord in which
AOL said it will license Netscape software to Sun Microsystems Inc.
for $350 million and will buy $500 million of electronic commerce
services and equipment from Sun. Together these assets will add
significantly to AOL's reach on the World Wide Web and boost the
pressure on smaller Internet firms in the race for revenue &UR;  &LR; and
users.
</P>
<P>
   The race centers primarily on a dozen or so ``portal'' sites on
the Web, which offer users everything from stock quotes to pet-care
tips. Such sites have been among the fastest-growing on-line
businesses to date, but in the long run many doubt whether the
Web's 62.5 million domestic users will support more than a handful.
</P>
<P>
   Already popular before its Netscape purchase, AOL now poses more
of a threat to smaller on-line companies like AltaVista and
InfoSeek, which also are trying to become gateways to the Internet,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   A ``portal shakeout'' is how Forrester Research analyst Chris
Charron describes the situation, which he said will force smaller
players to become more specialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing more of the opportunities going to the larger
players,'' Charron said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is natural Darwinism, and it happens in every other
industry as well,'' said Tim Koogle, chief executive of the portal
company &UR;  &LR; Yahoo Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif. ``There's no  &UR;  &LR; reason to
believe the Internet shouldn't follow a similar trend.''
</P>
<P>
   The terms of AOL's deals with Netscape and Sun were in line with
AOL's previous disclosures. Under the terms of the agreement, AOL
will exchange 0.45 share of its stock for each of Netscape's
roughly 100 million common shares, valuing Netscape stock at $41.12
apiece, based on Tuesday's closing price for AOL.
</P>
<P>
   AOL executives said the agreements will enable the Dulles, Va.,
company to eventually introduce a new browser _ software used to
surf the Web _ based on Netscape's popular Navigator technology.
For now, AOL will continue to buy Web-browsing software from
Microsoft. In addition, AOL will take control of Netscape's popular
NetCenter Web site, giving it a business audience in addition to
AOL's traditional consumer base.
</P>
<P>
   AOL also said it plans to roll out new electronic commerce
services, such as on-line banking built around Sun's versatile Java
programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Together, said AOL president Bob Pittman, the new assets will
give AOL ``an unparalleled array of interactive services.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape chief executive Jim Barksdale will step down from daily
operations but will join AOL's board. Netscape will remain at its
Mountain View, Calif., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said it expects to complete the buyout in the spring of
1999, pending antitrust reviews and approvals from Netscape
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Investors drove up shares of AOL and Sun following the
announcement. AOL stock rose 2 1/8 to 91 3/8 Tuesday. Sun stock
rose 1 5/8 to 72 15/16, while Netscape fell 2 1/16 to 39 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's shares rose rose 2 1/2 to 121 11/16 on expectations
that the deal would weaken the government's ongoing antitrust
prosecution of the Redmond, Wash., software giant.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Consumer Project on Technology, affiliated
with Ralph Nader, said it will urge officials to reject the planned
purchase of Netscape. The group's leader, James Love, said the
proposal would lead to undue concentration of the market for
software used to display images on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape pioneered that market four years ago with the
introduction of its Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   But since then a bevy of on-line service companies has sprung
up, putting pressure on &UR;  &LR; Netscape. As of October, Netscape's
various sites could claim visits from 33 percent of the Web's
users, according to Media Metrix Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That market share trailed significantly behind AOL, Microsoft,
Yahoo, and Lycos Inc., each of which had a market share in the
mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   Like AOL, other leading portal companies have scrambled to buy
up content they believe will attract new users to their sites.
Microsoft's offerings include a partnership with NBC television and
the on-line magazine Slate.com; Lycos in October agreed to buy
closely held Wired Digital Inc. for stock worth $83 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is becoming a lot like television,'' said Lycos chief
executive Bob Davis. ``There will be four to six general-interest
portals, just like there are about four big networks in the
television environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, many smaller Web services are becoming more
like ad producers, piping material over others' networks.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: HOLIDAY GAMES YOU CAN SINK YOUR TEETH INTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanksgiving Day games have become such a tradition in the
National Football League that teams other than Detroit and Dallas
would like a special serving of the day's sweets _ especially the
competitive edge that they say is allowed the hosts.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Detroit Lions and the Dallas Cowboys are host for
Thanksgiving Day games, Detroit almost every year since 1934 and
Dallas all but two years since 1966. Detroit owns a 29-27-2 record
in those games; Dallas is 20-9-1. Their opponents vary.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing NFL teams say that the short turnaround _ playing on
the previous Sunday and then having to travel to Detroit or Dallas
to play on Thanksgiving _ gives the Lions and the Cowboys a
competitive edge. The thinking goes that the Lions and the Cowboys
are more used to the short work week. Lions and Cowboys players and
coaches are supposedly more tuned for the annual clash than the
opposing players because the opponents change.
</P>
<P>
   In recent league meetings, several owners discussed the idea of
rotating the Thanksgiving games among NFL sites each year.
Basically, they were told to sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Some traditions, it was decided, were worth keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit plays host to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday, and
the Minnesota Vikings visit Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Each Thanksgiving Day team this year remains in playoff
contention. Detroit, barely. Pittsburgh, mightily. And Minnesota
and Dallas? Both are the gravy of this day. Both are division
leaders. Both will use this game as a playoff-type test. Both will
give us a festive affair.
</P>
<P>
   And with these two teams, we find a generous portion of what so
far has been the gravy of the 1998 NFL season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHAN GAILEY &LR;  _ The former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive
coordinator rose from the bottom, leaping over a pile of names more
familiar and famous, and took the job as head coach of the Dallas
Cowboys. He said from the start that he realized he was coaching
more than a team but an institution. One of the most famous and
fabled sports franchises ever. A 6-10 team last season.
</P>
<P>
   An 8-3 team this season, and the front-runner in the National
Football Conference East.
</P>
<P>
   Quite an about-face. Quite a makeover. It is said that the NFC
East is a scrap heap. Better to be at the top of a pile of junk
than in the bottom of the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has won with and without Troy Aikman at quarterback. He
has made the Dallas offense fun and imaginative. There has not been
a bushel of wild off-field stories floating from Dallas so far this
season. Stability. Victories. Gailey's got them. What more could
Dallas ask?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RANDY MOSS &LR;  _ Pssssst. He's trouble. Watch out. Don't take a
chance. He'll make you pay. Not a cornerstone on which to build
your franchise.
</P>
<P>
   That was the pre-draft chatter. That was the draft-day chatter.
But Minnesota plugged its ears. It did its homework on Moss, and
Coach Dennis Green and receiver Cris Carter took him in. Now the
rookie receiver is turning every team on its ears.
</P>
<P>
   He is exciting on the run and in the air. Acrobatic and
athletic. Speedy, quick. Courageous. He has the entire package at
receiver and is so much fun for fans to watch. But more important
to the Vikings, he is fun for his teammates to watch. He excites
them. He gives them a jolt. He makes those around him better and
helps them to excel. That is a great gift.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE AFC EAST &LR;  _ The American Football Conference Central
features three teams with winning records. Four other divisions in
the NFL feature only two winning teams apiece.
</P>
<P>
   But the AFC East features four winning teams (the Jets, Miami,
Buffalo and New England). The first three are deadlocked at the top
with 7-4 records. New England is close behind at 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   This division features cunning, mind-game-playing Super
Bowl-winning coaches (Bill Parcells and Jimmy Johnson), a
quarterback legend (Dan Marino) and physical teams built with
defense as a priority. This division race will stretch until the
last day of the regular season. As many as three from the East
could make the playoffs. And then they get to knock each other
silly all over again in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DOUG FLUTIE &LR;  _ It is hard not to enjoy watching him. Not just
because he is a little guy and because he is back from playing in
Canada. Not just because the NFL did not think he could play
quarterback and has returned to prove his doubters wrong. Not just
because he has skill at the position and is a thinker.
</P>
<P>
   It is fun to watch Flutie play because he has fun. He makes
football fun. He runs, he jumps, he throws in the air, off balance,
on the sly, on the move. He keeps the game on the move. Catch him.
Catch up to him. Flutie helping to bring Buffalo back to
respectability and beyond is some of the smoothest gravy this
season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DENVER BRONCOS &LR;  _ This team will most likely do it. The Broncos
will most likely win them all, go 16 and Oh! Unbeaten, untied. If
they achieve that, it will make the 1998 season a dramatic one, one
that historians will recall forever, much like the 1972 season,
when Miami went 14-0. It is a mission now for the Broncos, and for
them the Super Bowl will be their gravy.

 How Internet Stocks Are Like Beanie Babies and Cabbage
Patch  Dolls  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Perhaps we should think of recent Internet initial offerings in the
same vein as Beanie Babies and Cabbage Patch dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, this is the grounded thinking of financial analyst
Lise Buyer of CS First Boston in Palo Alto, who tries to make sense
out of a lot of this Net nonsense. Besides, while we contemplate
the global implications of the America Online-Netscape marriage, we
can reduce the rationalization of betting junior's college fund on
Internet stocks to child's play.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Buyer suggests that Beanie Babies are today's Cabbage
Patch dolls as far as toy hysteria goes. And at a recent
presentation before venture capitalists, she produced two Beanie
Baby dolls that already were out of production and named them
Theglobe.com and EarthWeb. Both are newly minted Internet IPOs
that, at their peak, saw their share prices multiply like stuffed
bunnies. (After peaking in the 60s, both companies' shares are
slumping in the 40s _ still three and four times their offering
prices of two weeks ago.)
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike these Internet IPOs, you can't buy these particular
Beanie Babies from the manufacturer. You now must purchase these
``retired'' models from holders in the open market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You no longer can get them, ergo their prices have gone up,''
Buyer explains.
</P>
<P>
   After trying to buy one of the out-of-circulation Beanie Babies
on eBay, the online auction site trading at 11 times its initial
offering price, Buyer found the toy going for about $25 _ or at
least four times the doll's initial offering price (the suggested
retail price charged by stores).
</P>
<P>
   Thus, even dolls with thin floats and intense demand are able to
fetch premium prices beyond their original value. And in the midst
of a Beanie Babie craze, there are more buyers than sellers bidding
up demand. Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   In order to predict what might happen to Beanie Baby valuations
after the frenzy falters, Buyer studied the demise of Cabbage Patch
dolls _ the Beanie Babies of their day, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, a Cabbage Patch doll would go for about $49.95
off the shelf if you were fortunate enough to procure one. As you
may recall, the average Cabbage Patch doll's value soared well
above its fifty-buck ``issue price'' to as high as $500 a doll on
the open market. That's 10 times the IPO value of your average
Cabbage Patch doll.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, eager-to-please parents bidding for a finite number of
stuffed-toys drove the price of these dolls into another
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But like many things that are too good to be true, the Cabbage
Patch craze died and was replaced by, among other things, Beanie
Babies. Guess what happened?
</P>
<P>
   The Cabbage Patch market tanked. The cuddly little things are
now underwater, with new issues going for about $32.50. That's
about $17.50 off their mid-'80s initial offering price, Buyer says.
</P>
<P>
   Will Theglobe.com and EarthWeb _ Internet juggernauts that they
are _ suffer demises similar to the erstwhile Cabbage Patch dolls?
You can bet your Beanie Baby they will, Buyer contends.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not all Internet stocks are created equal. And
certainly, Theglobe.com should not be confused with the likes of
electronic commerce superstars Amazon.com and Yahoo, she adds. But
beware the majority of Internet companies that have gone, or have
yet to, go public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along the line, one of these companies is going to
turn out to be a fraud,'' Buyer warns.
</P>
<P>
   IN PLAY: With the dramatic return of the buyout boom, at least
one merger expert admonishes individual investors not to bet on
acquisition targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to pick companies that would get taken out takes a lot
of (home)work,'' says Judy Cohen, editor of Mergers &AMP; Acquisitions
Report in New York.
</P>
<P>
   If investors are lucky enough to own shares in a company that
gets taken over, they should sell their stock immediately after the
deal is announced, she suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the takeover premium _ or the rise in stock price
triggered by a sale _ already is built into the shares by the time
a deal is struck.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you insist in investing in companies you think will
get bought, be careful, she warns. If anything, look for companies
that are good investments based on their fundamentals regardless of
the potential for takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``But make sure it's not already trading with a takeover premium
built into the price,'' Cohen says.
</P>
<P>
   Because if a buyout candidate gets abandoned at the alter,
investors are left holding the bag, she says.

LUBA ELIANOFF, 96, MAKER OF ELEGANT LINENS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Luba Elianoff, a Latvian-born little old linen lady
whose bearing was a bit too regal, whose spirit was a bit too fiery
and whose embroideries were a bit too elegant to be called that to
her face, died on Nov. 17 at her Manhattan apartment. She was 96
and had much preferred to be called the Queen of Linens.
</P>
<P>
   A full 50 inches tall in her prime, Mrs. Elianoff, who had
shrunk somewhat by the time she retired at 86, may not have had the
stature of a queen, but during the more than four decades she spent
designing and manufacturing delicately embroidered towels, sheets,
pillowcases and the like, no one ever accused her of not charging
queenly prices.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for a woman who catered to those who routinely paid
several hundred dollars for a set of sheets, Mrs. Elianoff, who
worked in a second-floor studio above what is now the Fairway fruit
and vegetable market at Broadway and 75th Street, was remarkably
democratic.
</P>
<P>
   It was she, after all, who claimed to have been the first to
persuade the Swiss embroidery industry, which handled her
production, to work in polyester rather than cotton, a
high-maintenance material better suited to the dwindling number of
households whose staffs included maids and laundresses.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, when it came to decorating sheets with borders of
a range of intricate, imaginative designs, Mrs. Elianoff drew the
line at substituting printed (shudder!) fabrics for stitching.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of a prosperous Latvian businessman, Mrs. Elianoff,
a Riga native whose maiden name was Levitt, learned to sew as a
child, but her girlhood heart belonged to the theater. At 16, when
the Russian empire was in the throes of collapse, she escaped
military patrols by hiding in a hay cart and made her way to
Moscow, where she studied drama under Stanislavsky and others.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sideline, as an English tutor, that changed her life
twice over, leading her both to Martin Elianoff, a lawyer who
became her husband, and to Armand Hammer, the American businessman
who helped the couple immigrate to the Philippines in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   In Manila, she began managing and later bought a chic fashion
boutique catering to the city's American and European elite. When
Mrs. Elianoff began supplementing its line of fine imports with
embroideries made of an indigenous pineapple fiber known as pina,
her customers were captivated by her designs. The Philippine
government was so delighted with her efforts to bolster the local
economy that it awarded her a series of medals.
</P>
<P>
   With war clouds looming (and many of her Western clients being
evacuated) Mrs. Elianoff brought her daughter, Anna Lou, to the
United States in March 1941 and she eventually became a citizen.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief reunion when the war was over, she and her husband
separated but never divorced. He died in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   After working in a series of Manhattan linen shops, Mrs.
Elianoff soon struck out on her own, using a sewing machine in her
Riverside Drive apartment to embroider satin lingerie and hosiery
cases for sale in local stores.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until full domestic textile production resumed in
1946 that Mrs. Elianoff expanded into sheets, towels, pillowcases
and shower curtains, typically buying stock sheets at wholesale
prices, replacing the standard border with lace and other elaborate
embroidery and reselling them to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and
Lord &AMP; Taylor at what seemed to some exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
   As one store buyer once told her: ``That's not a price. It's a
telephone number.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Elianoff found such an enthusiastic market for her
Luba Elianoff line of luxury linens that she soon had to move her
business to her Broadway workroom, where a staff handled the
sewing.
</P>
<P>
   In time, demand for her elegant work grew so strong that about
200 stores carried her line, and she contracted out the
manufacturing of borders to Swiss factories.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because Mrs. Elianoff was such a perfectionist that she
did most of her design work in Switzerland, where she worked
closely with production specialists, and partly because her local
production staff used a special flat seam that made the attached
borders seem like a natural extension of the mass-produced sheet,
she was widely recognized as one of the finest designers of
decorative linens.
</P>
<P>
   Always open to change, when Wamsutta began producing sheets in a
variety of colors, Mrs. Elianoff responded enthusiastically, her
once dainty designs blossoming into big, bold flowers and other
colorful designs.
</P>
<P>
   As an American, Mrs. Elianoff began to see herself as more than
the Queen of Linens. Recalling that as a teen-ager she had made a
flag for a Zionist parade in Riga, she came to regard herself as
the Betsy Ross of Zionism.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her daughter, Anna Lou Aldrich of Manhattan,
five granddaughters and two great-grandsons.

JUDGE BARS LIBRARY FROM FILTERING INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ohio, Pa., Texas, Fla.)   (bl)  
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   A ruling by a federal judge Monday that barred public libraries
in Loudoun County from limiting how patrons use the Internet is
binding only in southern Virginia, but it seemed sure to have
national implications as librarians across the country began to
review their own Internet policies in the wake of the decision in
the closely watched case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Leonie Brinkema of U.S. District Court in Alexandria,
Va., is a former librarian herself and wrote that the county
library's decision to install computer programs that seek to block
sexually explicit material on the Internet ``offends the guarantee
of free speech in the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Such ``filter'' programs have been widely criticized by civil
libertarians as ineffective because they fail to screen out all
material that might be harmful to minors and in the process block a
wide spectrum of material that is not inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the Loudoun case, represented by the American
Civil Liberties Union, included the proprietors of sites on the
World Wide Web about safe sex, banned books and gay and lesbian
teen-agers. All claimed to have been blocked by the software.
</P>
<P>
   In striking down the Loudoun County Library board's policy,
which required that all library computers connected to the Internet
be equipped with a filtering program, Judge Brinkema cited Reno vs.
ACLU, the 1997 Supreme Court decision that upheld a ruling that
overturned a federal law that sought to prohibit the distribution
of indecent material to minors over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has long been a matter of settled law that restricting what
adults may read to a level appropriate for minors is a violation of
the free speech guaranteed by the First Amendment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes as a federal judge in Philadelphia last
Thursday issued a temporary restraining order on a new federal law
intended to protect children from Internet pornography. And several
congressional attempts to require schools to install filter
programs failed to pass in the last session.
</P>
<P>
   But particularly because public libraries provide free access to
the Internet to those who may not have any other means of using it,
they have been seen as a crucial site of the struggle over how the
medium will be regulated. In the absence of any precedent,
librarians and patrons have cobbled together various compromises in
an attempt to strike a balance between providing access to the vast
array of information on the Internet and protecting children from
portions of it that may be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, several librarians in communities where the decision to
use filters has been particularly controversial said they were
carefully reviewing the Loudoun decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be helpful for decisions in the future,'' said Mike
Harris, interim director of the Medina County District Library in
Ohio, where last year community members organized an unsuccessful
campaign to cut the library's funding unless it installed filters.
``We've been flying a little bit blind here and this gives us a
good referral point.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Branch, director of the Austin Public Library, where the
decision to install filters has endured sustained protest from
civil libertarians over the last year, said she had asked the city
attorneys to review the Virginia court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Field, director of the Orange County Library system in
Orlando, Fla., said she would not consider removing the filtering
system there. ``We have exercised our role as librarians to choose
the material for our selection,'' she said. ``What happens in
Loudoun County is not going to change anything here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia decision raised the possibility that less
restrictive methods, such as using privacy screens or installing
filters on terminals that are set aside for children, might be
acceptable under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the decision, and we are hopeful that
the library board will now put a constitutional policy in place and
that this will be the end of the issue,'' said Jeri McGiverin, a
retired schoolteacher who helped organize the group of Loudoun
residents who initially filed the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Librarians in Loudoun cut off the Internet connections on
Tuesday pending a library board meeting next week where a decision
will be made on whether or not to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect to win on appeal,'' said John Nicholas, the
former chairman of the library board who helped install the old
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue of the library following its historical
mandate, which is to select material which is appropriate to the
community at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nicholas said the composition of the board had changed since
the policy was instituted, and he did not expect a vote to appeal
to pass.

VLADIMIR DEMIKHOV, 82, PIONEER IN TRANSPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Vladimir P. Demikhov, a Russian surgeon whose pioneering
work in performing organ transplants on dogs set the stage for
similar operations on humans in later years, died Nov. 22. He was
82 and lived in a small apartment on Moscow's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Itar-Tass news agency, which reported his death,
said it came after a long illness. But the agency did not report
what caused his death or where he died.
</P>
<P>
   Itar-Tass also said that Demikhov was the first to perform a
heart transplant on a dog, in 1946. The agency reported that the
dog, which kept its old heart and the new one, survived for five
months after the surgery. In 1947, the agency said, Demikhov
carried out the first animal lung transplant, which was also
performed on a dog; and in 1952 he conducted the first coronary
bypass on an animal, another dog.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Itar-Tass' account, Dr. Dennis Franco, a Yale
Medical School professor of surgery who does organ transplants,
said that he would not dispute that Demikhov was the first to do
these operations, although skimpy record-keeping makes it hard to
document.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions among American experts differ as to the importance of
Demikhov's work in the history of organ-transplant surgery. Dr.
John Conte, the director of heart and lung transplantation at the
Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, said Tuesday : ``In the
history of heart and lung transplantation he's very well known; he
did some of the seminal work.'' He added, ``Everybody who performs
heart and lung transplantations is to a certain extent'' indebted
to Demikhov.
</P>
<P>
   Conte, who has performed about about 200 heart and lung
transplantations on humans, said that, after Dr. Alexis Carrel, an
American surgeon and experimental biologist who won a 1912 Nobel
Prize for his work in organ transplantation and in other fields,
Demikhov ``probably had the biggest early impact on the field of
heart and lung transplantation, because during the '40s and '50s he
did hundreds and hundreds of experiments on dogs that showed
different techniques of how to actually do heart and lung
transplants. The guy clearly had to have a very creative mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco said that Demikhov's work was very significant in leading
to transplants of hearts and lungs in humans in later years,
because the work demonstrated that the operations could be
performed.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco emphasized that the subsequent history of organ
transplants was protracted and complex. He said, ``I'm sure that
anyone who was interested in transplantation at the time was aware
of Demikhov's work and of the work of other pioneers in the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Franco said, Dr. Norman Shumway of Stanford University
and Dr. Richard Lower of the Medical College of Virginia ``did a
lot of heart transplants in dogs in the late '50s and early '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And after they did their laboratory work, that geared
everybody up to performing heart transplants in humans,'' Franco
went on, and ``Christiaan Barnard was the first surgeon to do a
human heart transplant,'' in South Africa in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the patient didn't do very well because we
didn't have the immunosuppression'' that was necessary, Franco
said, and then ``in the late 1970s cyclosporine became available.''
Cyclosporine prevents the rejection of a transplanted organ by the
body of the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now,'' Franco continued, ``once we had that drug, then
people began to look at transplanting the heart and the lungs in
humans, and Dr. Bruce Reitz and Dr. Shumway performed the first
human heart-lung transplant, at Stanford'' in the early 1980s.
Thus, Franco said, almost 40 years passed after Demikhov's early
work in animal transplants before that operation was performed
clinically on humans. And yet, despite that time lag, he said,
Demikhov's achievement was ``an important stepping-stone'' toward
organ transplants in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard White, a professor of neurosurgery at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland said of Demikhov, ``He was a
fascinating man, an amazing experimental surgeon; he transplanted,
using dogs almost exclusively, almost every organ you could
possible think of.''
</P>
<P>
   Demikhov is said to have been born in Moscow and to have
attended the First Medical Institute, a hospital and medical school
in Moscow. It was after World War II that he undertook his
experimental work, at the Vishnevsky Surgical Institute of the
Academy of Medical Sciences of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Itar-Tass reported that Soviet medical leaders had regarded his
experiments as only ``tricks.'' But earlier this year, he was
awarded a high Russian honor, the Order for Services for the
Fatherland, by a presidential decree. Late in his life, the news
agency said, he was the director of the Russian Health Ministry's
Republican Center for Human Reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Demikhov's wife, Liya, died earlier this year. No further
information on survivors was immediately available.

AN EXHILARATING `ON THE TOWN' SPREADS SOME JOY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 29) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Manhattan is transformed. The potholes are gone, as are the
cabdrivers who don't know that the Bronx is up and the Battery's
down. Nobody is trying to sweep the place clean of corruption or
sin. The women are free and easily available.
</P>
<P>
   The Coney Island cooch shows still feature girls who can pick up
hand-kerchiefs with their teeth. The eccentrics are benign and even
the bores walk in grace, which makes them good company.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan is an uproarious, singing, dancing time-out city,
where nothing is impossible and the future is without limits, at
least for a single day.
</P>
<P>
   That is something of the effect of George C. Wolfe's
exhilarating new production of ``On the Town'' at the Gershwin
Theater. If you don't leave this show with an enhanced awareness of
the meaning of joy, take out your cell phone immediately: beep your
therapist.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town'' is the seminal 1944 musical that, arriving the
year after ``Oklahoma!,'' demonstrated that ``new'' in the American
musical theater need not mean simply pastoral. Here is a love
letter to Manhattan as the biggest, craziest beehive on earth.
</P>
<P>
   More important, ``On the Town'' introduced Broadway to the
prodigious talents of Leonard Bernstein, the composer; Betty Comden
and Adolph Green, who wrote the book and lyrics, and Jerome Robbins
as a choreographer, rather than as the dancer he was in several
Broadway shows before he joined Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The original collaborators, led by the director George Abbott,
took only six months to get ``On the Town'' written and on its
feet, using as their inspiration the Robbins-Bernstein ballet,
``Fancy Free.'' This revival has been somewhat longer en route,
beginning with the Joseph Papp Public Theater production in Central
Park in the summer of 1997, which received mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The initial intention had been to transfer the Central Park
production to Broadway intact. When the principal Broadway
producers withdrew, Wolfe, the Public Theater's producer as well as
the show's director, decided that the Public would go it alone. A
risky decision, considering the reported $5 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a couple of choreographers have come and gone, and
several of the principals have been replaced. During the preview
period, there were the usual downbeat rumors attending any new
production that elects to take its shakedown cruise in the middle
of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Then, 10 days before the scheduled Nov. 19 opening, the first
night was put off three days. At the same time, it was announced
that Joey McKneely, who received a Tony nomination as the
choreographer of ``The Life,'' was being brought in to fine tune
the major dance routines designed by Keith Young, the show's
choreographer of record, who is making his Broadway debut with ``On
the Town.''
</P>
<P>
   You might think the coroner should be called. Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   The news this morning: Wolfe has, indeed, worked a miracle. He
has located the essence of the show that eluded him in the park,
and cast it with spirited young performers who can sing, dance and
levitate at will. ``On the Town'' is on its way. Not in a very long
time have you heard a score as richly complex and romantic,
combined with a book and lyrics that are so gloriously bright,
witty and off-the-wall.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you know the show because you have seen the 1949
movie, directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, you are in for a
major surprise. All that you probably remember about the movie is
the opening number in which Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin
sing Bernstein's ebullient ``New York, New York'' while capering
across the Brooklyn Bridge, atop the Empire State Building and
around Rockefeller Center and other postcard sites.
</P>
<P>
   It's a superb bit of filmmaking, but after that, the film is
very different from the show. Because Louis B. Mayer, the MGM
studio head, thought the original score either too esoteric or too
``suggestive'' (a favorite adjective of the Legion of Decency, the
Roman Catholic censorship group), the only other Bernstein music is
essentially used for background.
</P>
<P>
   Discarded by Hollywood are the rambunctious comedy numbers and
some of the most beautiful and haunting melodies Bernstein ever
composed, among them: ``Lucky to Be Me,'' ``Lonely Town'' and
``Some Other Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Town'' is a mysteriously bewitching show, originally
conceived and staged in its own time and place, about three wildly
energized sailors unleashed in wartime New York on a 24-hour pass.
Wolfe has made no attempt to update the material or give it the
benefit of hindsight. Yet it plays today as if it had been written
last week, not as a piece of nostalgia but as living literature.
</P>
<P>
   The show is dated by its wartime period, but its blithe manners,
which are those of a cockeyed fable, are timeless. That it can
still refresh, surprise and bring you close to tears (both of
helpless laughter and sweet melancholy) is because it's so resolute
in the way it avoids kitsch.
</P>
<P>
   For each of the three sailors at the heart of the adventure, a
lifetime is compressed into this single day, no encounter is by
chance and every connection has meaning. At the beginning of the
show, Gabey, Chip and Ozzie emerge, as if uncaged, into the
intoxicating light of New York; at the end, they disappear back
into their ship. Blackout. The end. Maybe curtains.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of this sort is ever acknowledged overtly, certainly not
by the sailors themselves. They are too intent on seeing the sights
and meeting women as quickly as possible to worry about what comes
after. They have no pasts that are recollected and no futures that
are foreseen. They exist entirely in the present tense,
unencumbered.
</P>
<P>
   The unspeakable is obliquely defined in the gorgeous score, in
lyrics that can be elegantly discreet (listen to ``Some Other
Time'') and in the choreography. But, except for one brief, quite
lovely pas de deux and a more extended, less successful dreamlike
ballet, the dances are more intent on expressing soaring spirits
than anything remotely resembling angst.
</P>
<P>
   Gabey (Perry Laylon Ojeda) is the romantic one. He falls
obsessively in love almost as soon as he touches land. The woman:
Miss Turnstiles, nee Ivy Smith (Tai Jimenez), the celebrated (he
assumes) subway girl-of-the-month, whose poster he sees. In this
show in which miracles never cease, he finds her at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chip (Jesse Tyler Ferguson), a skinny, red-headed fellow with a
bendable frame, is more or less captured by the robustly
proportioned Hildy Esterhazy (Lea DeLaria), who drives a cab. He
wants to visit the Hippodrome and buy a ticket to ``Tobacco Road,''
because that is what his father did in 1934, though both landmarks
have now vanished. Hildy's purpose is seduction; they can talk
later.
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie (Robert Montano), who has gone to the American Museum of
Natural History thinking it was the Museum of Modern Art, finds his
soul mate in Claire DeLoone (Sarah Knowlton). She is an
anthropologist drawn to him initially because he looks so much like
the prehistoric man that is her life's study. Both Ozzie and Claire
share a weakness: each seethes with sexual desires they can't
easily suppress.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLaria, the discovery of the show's Central Park
production, is bigger and better than ever on Broadway, where,
three times at the performance I caught, she came close to
arresting the show and leaving the audience numb with pleasure: in
``Come Up to My Place'' and ``I Can Cook Too,'' both sung to the
elusive Chip, and as one member of the quartet that tears up the
stage in Act II with ``Ya Got Me,'' in which the friends attempt to
cheer Gabey, whose Ivy has somehow been misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeLaria is a big, assertive stage personality with the
implacable presence of the young Ethel Merman. She can sing
sweetly, she can scat and she can belt in a way to test the
capacity of most sound amplification systems. She is also genuinely
funny. She would seem to be every inch and ounce a star.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of the sextet of leading performers are also
immensely appealing: Ferguson, who is sly, knowing and very funny
as Ms. DeLaria's cooperative victim; the lantern-jawed Montano and
the sweet-voiced, model-pretty Ms. Knowlton; and Ojeda, who
delivers two of the show's best numbers (``Lonely Town'' and
``Lucky to Be Me'') and Ms. Jimenez, a former principal dancer with
the Dance Theater of Harlem and a charmer as Ivy Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Note also the splendid Mary Testa, who appears as Ivy's
heavy-drinking, quite severe vocal coach, and Jonathan Freeman as
Claire DeLoone's mild-mannered fiance, a judge. He trails Claire
through much of the show, patiently picking up the nightclub tabs
left by her and her new-found pals.
</P>
<P>
   When, as it must, the worm turns, it's deliciously expressed in
the convoluted lyrics of a quintessential Comden and Green comedy
number, ``I Understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The choreography is a vast improvement over what was seen in the
park, where the high point of one number was the sight of Miss
Turnstiles being pushed around the stage as she huddled on a
footstool. The dancers now dance. They fill the stage with movement
that soars, though without affecting the mind or emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins's ballet was not only the inspiration for the show; he
was also an integral part of the team that put it together. I
didn't see the 1944 production, but I can't imagine that his
artistry could be duplicated by anyone else. The
Bernstein-Robbins-Comden and Green collaboration was something very
special.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular asset of Wolfe's Delacorte production was
the park itself and the New York skyline, which dominated Adrianne
Lobel's set design. At the sun's setting on a soft summer night,
``On the Town'' seemed to have come home.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to reproduce that feeling in a theater, even one
as vast as the Gershwin. The show looks good and moves efficiently
without ever astonishing the eye, which Paul Tazewell's costumes
often do.
</P>
<P>
   The Gershwin's sound system is something else. It is, of course,
a necessity, but it is also a compromise. One can recognize good
voices from bad and, when seated in the orchestra, one has no
trouble telling which members of the cast are singing. That is a
definite plus. Yet a price is paid: the voices take on a metallic,
bionic edge.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a new choreographer was working on the dances,
virtually right up until the opening night, explains, I assume, a
certain looseness in the show's pacing. This, I also assume, will
be corrected as the run progresses.
</P>
<P>
   And progress it should. ``On the Town'' has become a classic,
but it clearly hasn't grown old. As it celebrates a very particular
time and the marvelous muddles of its exuberantly inchoate
characters, it also celebrates life itself. Sometimes, a day is all
there is.

PARENTS, STUDENTS COPE WITH JERSEY CITY STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ Arlene Pacheco and her two children walked
past Public School 9 on Brunswick Avenue here, where teachers were
marching in a circle and carrying signs that said, ``Dignity, not
Dollars.'' It was 9 a.m. and her children were not in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, what are they doing?'' her 4-year-old daughter, Aja,
asked. ``It's a strike, honey,'' her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Her 5-year-old son, Xavier, who is in kindergarten at P.S. 42
and was holding her hand, said he knew what a strike was: ``A
strike is when a kid can't go to school anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   For Xavier and many of the district's 32,000 other children,
that is exactly what a teachers' strike, now in its fourth day, has
meant. District officials said that 65 percent to 70 percent of the
students were absent from school Tuesday, about the same as the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents staying home to watch their children, sometimes at
the risk of losing their jobs. Some are hiring baby sitters they
can barely afford, or are enlisting neighbors and relatives to help
out during a strike with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is affecting all of us,'' Ms. Pacheco said. ``A lot
of parents are not able to go to work, or they have to find a baby
sitter at the last minute. And the kids are not getting an
education.''
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of the hardship, Ms. Pacheco, like many parents,
was on the teachers' side. ``Yes, I am supporting them, very
much,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey City is a school district of working-class parents, where
many teachers have been in the system so long they are now teaching
the children of their old students. Many parents feel a loyalty to
the teachers. And while low test scores and other failings prompted
the state to take over the schools here a decade ago, teachers and
school officials say there has been some improvement in test scores
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the teachers do a hell of a job,'' said Juan Bonilla,
whose son attends P.S. 34, and who shouted his support to the
striking teachers he passed on Brunswick Avenue. ``I think they
ought to give them everything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The district has canceled classes in all five high schools since
the strike's second day. The elementary schools, pre-kindergarten
to eighth grade, have been on a half-day schedule, inconveniencing
parents.
</P>
<P>
   District representatives and the Jersey City Teachers
Association, which represents 2,500 teachers and 1,000 support
workers, reported making some pogress in overnight talks that ended
early Tuesday.

   In Hudson County Superior Court Tuesday, Judge Martin Greenberg
ordered the teachers to return to work on Monday morning or lose
their jobs. The judge also ruled that starting this week the union
would face a fine of $100,000 for each day of the strike, or
$200,000 thus far. But he rejected the district's plea that
teachers be fined two days' pay for every day they remained on
strike and that union leaders be fined $1,000 a day each.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents are choosing not to send their children to school
because they do not believe much learning is going on. Others, like
Ms. Pacheco, said that the chaos and near-riots at some schools on
Thursday, the first day of the strike, made them decide their
children would be safer at home than at school. Both fears can be
traced to the fact that district officials found fewer than 200
substitute teachers to supervise the district's students in 39
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw police and I saw the rioting,'' Ms. Pacheco said,
recalling the scene on Thursday morning, when she walked her son to
P.S. 42. ``I was afraid to leave my son. The kids were running up
and down the streets. It was chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep him home, Ms. Pacheco has had to be absent from her job
as a sales clerk at a mall. ``As a result of this, I may lose my
job,'' she said. ``But maybe because I've been a good employee,
they'll let me come back when this is all over.''
</P>
<P>
   While most parents interviewed sided with the teachers, some
were not sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting paid how much?'' asked Mercedes Colon, as she
left her 7-year-old son at P.S. 9 before she rushed off to her job
as a home health attendant. ``I wish I made half as much as they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Colon said that because of the trouble in the schools the
first two days of the strike, she kept her son out of school, and
took him with her one day to her job tending to old people in their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But imagine, those are sick people, so how can I keep taking
him?'' she said. ``I tried hard to find somebody to help me out,
but so far I haven't.''

J.C. PENNEY TO BUY GENOVESE DRUGSTORE CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, New Jersey, Connecticut)  (rl) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ J.C. Penney Co., the Texas-based retailer, has agreed
to buy Genovese Drug Stores Inc., a leading chain in the
metropolitan region, for $492 million in stock and debt, the two
companies announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts saw the agreement as a further sign that huge
pharmacy chains are in a better position to survive the challenges
posed by managed care, which has steadily been reducing the amount
it reimburses pharmacies for filling prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   One of only two family-controlled drugstore chains in the
country _ the other is Longs Drugs, which operates in six Western
states _ Genovese was founded in 1924, when Joseph Genovese opened
his first store in Astoria, N.Y. With headquarters in Melville,
N.Y., Genovese has 141 stores in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut and employs 5,000 people. Sales for the fiscal year
ending on Jan. 30, 1999, are projected to reach $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Genovese is dwarfed by the Eckerd chain, which was acquired by
J.C. Penney in 1997. Eckerd is the third-largest drugstore chain in
the nation, after CVS Pharmacy Inc., and the Rite Aid Corp. Eckerd,
which has stores in 20 states, has continued to expand, and now has
2,800 stores and sales of $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Genovese stores will be renamed Eckerd during a one-year
transition.
</P>
<P>
   Given recent consolidation trends, the proposed acquisition of
Genovese _ which is subject to the approval of shareholders and
regulators _ came as no surprise to Wall Street. Pharmacies make
less and less of their profit by filling prescriptions and have to
rely on sales of other products to make money. To cut labor costs,
they are expected to rely increasingly on automation for such tasks
as counting pills. The investment that Genovese would have needed
to make in technology to compete effectively was considered
prohibitive for a company of its size.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bosshard, an analyst at Midwest Research of Cleveland, said
it was inevitable that Genovese would be swallowed up by a larger
company. ``Genovese as a part of Eckerd has a greater ability to
succeed over the long term _ as a national company rather than a
regional company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan Muir, a spokesman for J.C. Penney at its headquarters in
Plano, Texas, said it was too early to say how many employees would
lose their jobs. Genovese's headquarters in Melville on Long
Island, where about 200 people are employed, was expected to close
after a year, he said. But those lost jobs are expected to be
offset by new positions as Eckerd adds stores.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal involves an exchange of $432 million in stock.
Genovese shareholders would receive J.C. Penney stock valued at $30
for each share of Genovese common stock they own. The exchange
ratio would be determined by the average trading value of J.C.
Penney common stock in 10 of the 20 days prior to closing. J.C.
Penney also agreed to assume $60 million in Genovese debt.

 IN THE TELEVISION'S BEGINNING, THERE WAS RISK-TAKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 29)  
(rl) 
 By JEFF KISSELOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tube in my hand would have earned an F in glass-blowing
class. It was thick and ungainly with stubby limbs extending at odd
angles and was painted a kind of mustard yellow.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it was beautiful. What Elma ``Pem'' Farnsworth had
just dropped into my sweaty palms represented the dreams of her
husband, Philo, in 1926, when he was 19 years old. It was his first
attempt at a picture tube after being told by experts in the
growing television field that his plan to create an all-electronic
system was impossible on his limited budget, not to mention that
this was a boy without a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   And at first they were right: The tube didn't work. But the
experts underestimated Farnsworth's genius. While they were still
toying with their mechanical systems, which used spinning disks to
scan pictures, Farnsworth and his plucky team produced the first
all-electronic television picture on Sept. 7, 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that was some day,'' recalled Mrs. Farnsworth with a gleam
in her eye in the living room of her modest Salt Lake City home.
``I was just so excited. Afterward, we sent a telegram to the
backers.'' It just said that the thing worked.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Farnsworth's continued devotion to her husband, who died in
1971, and his legacy had her audienc _ an interviewer and a
two-person camera crew _ wiping their eyes. We were videotaping her
for the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Archive of
American Television.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1996, the archive has been sending video crews
around the country in a race against the actuarial clock to
interview the dwindling stock of television pioneers. Eventually
the videotapes will go into a library, which will be open to the
public, in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The list includes not only the Berles and the Caesar-Cocas but
also the technical geniuses like Farnsworth and the unrecognized
heroes of television's early years. Charlie Andrews, for example,
inspired the influential Chicago School of Television, which
brought Studs Terkel, Dave Garroway and Hugh Downs to national
prominence. Terkel's show, ``Studs's Place,'' was truly remarkable.
It was a live, ad-libbed comedy-drama set in a bar. Back then, that
kind of risk taking was typical.
</P>
<P>
   That's what makes the stories so important to preserve. They
recount a time when creativity, intelligence and the ability to
think by the seat of one's pants was paramount. Out of that came
the golden age of television. It was all about risk taking and
freedom. At a time when the television industry seems as desperate
for good programming as viewers are, these veterans have something
important to say.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Farnsworth, the earliest pioneers vividly recall the
thrill of exploration, of building something from nothing, to
please not some corporate sponsor but themselves. Nobody knew what
television was or would be, so there were no molds to fit into.
Mostly, they proceeded on curiosity and raw intelligence and a
willingness to experiment in an atmosphere that not only tolerated
resourceful thinking but depended on it.
</P>
<P>
   It is this thread that runs through nearly all the interviews
for the archive: the enormous dividends that are accrued by
allowing creative people to create under conditions in which there
is no margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   You heard this repeatedly. Because no spare parts were
available, Arch Brolly used a pickle jar to complete his
transmitter and keep WBKB, Chicago's most important station, on the
air during World War II. When Brolly's boss, the redoubtable
Captain Bill Eddy, needed a camera base that could be raised and
lowered, he created one from a barber chair. When Eddy desperately
needed a show to fill his schedule, he called a staff meeting.
While puffing on his pipe (which doubled as a hearing aid), Eddy
recalled a young puppeteer he worked with at the 1939 World's Fair,
and ``Kukla, Fran and Ollie'' was born.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy was a master at this. He created the first microwave
network because it was the only way to bring Notre Dame football to
Chicago. Lighting was a major hurdle in television's earliest days.
Cameras were so insensitive that tons of light had to be poured on
the subject to get a picture. Eddy wrote the book on television
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had enough light when the model's hair began to
smoke,'' he later joked.
</P>
<P>
   Eddy, who is virtually unknown today, was also one of the first
to regularly televise wrestling. And it was the popularity of
Gorgeous George and his crowd, not Milton Berle or Ed Sullivan,
that sold television to the American public.
</P>
<P>
   Noel Jordan worked with Eddy at RCA before the war. He recalls
the excitement of just being there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody worked 60 to 80 hours a week,'' said Mr. Jordan.
``We slept in a first-aid room where they had a couple of cots. We
felt pretty cocky about being in the forefront of something new.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth literally worked while he slept, his wife said. She
told the archive interviewer how her husband had trained himself to
dwell on a problem in his sleep so he would have it solved by the
time he woke up.
</P>
<P>
   But then Farnsworth, who was mulling over the limitations of
mechanical television while still in his teens, was always
thinking. One day while out plowing on the family farm, he noticed
the lines in the field that his harrow had just made.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said to himself, `I can just magnetically deflect those
electrons across the screen in the same way you plow a field, line
after line,' '' said Pem Farnsworth. ``That's the way he did it,
and that's the way it's done today.'' He was 14 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years later, she still reveled in the romance of it all.
Philo had told his first serious girlfriend about television, and
she promptly dumped him, so he was a little apprehensive when it
came time to let Pem in on his secret. He took her for a horseback
ride to Bridal Veil Falls in a nearby town. It was there that he
nervously told her his dreams. She told him that not only did she
believe he could do it but that she would help him any way she
could. She did, by keeping his patent books and doing other work in
the lab.
</P>
<P>
   Long after Farnsworth got his patents, the medium remained a
forum for experimentation. Well into the 1950s, the DuMont network
was an exercise in bargain-basement programming.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Sheen went up against Milton Berle (Tuesday nights at 8)
with just a blackboard for a set. The DuMont studios were located
in Wanamaker's department store in Greenwich Village, so when the
producers of ``Captain Video'' needed a ray gun, Charles Polachek,
the director, grabbed a spark plug, muffler, rearview mirror and
ashtray from the automotive department, glued them together himself
and called it the opticom scillometer.
</P>
<P>
   When they did chase scenes for ``Rocky King, Inside Detective,''
cameramen focused on the actors' feet. Otherwise, viewers would see
they were running through Wanamaker's piano department.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Smith, NBC's legendary makeup man, found that his job
called for constant problem solving. On a live show set around a
boxing match, he had to figure out how to make bruises suddenly
appear on the fighter's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dressed up as a corner man. In between rounds I got in the
ring,'' Mr. Smith recalled in one of the archive's first
interviews. ``While I pretended to be mopping the guy off, I was
really making him up to look bruised.''
</P>
<P>
   The rewards from that kind of thinking may be the archive's most
valuable legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hollywood has become a pretty joyless corporate affair,'' says
Dean Valentine, president of UPN, who was instrumental in setting
up the television archives, ``and the art and the joy seem to have
disappeared. But for them it hadn't. That's what keeps coming
through again and again in a lot of the interviews. I think the
lesson is to bring some of that back.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutsy behavior extended beyond the technical achievements.
Joseph Wershba, who as a young reporter located Milo Radulovich,
the dismissed Air Force lieutenant whose story became a symbol of
rampant McCarthyism, recalled the evening of March 9, 1954, when
``See It Now'' devoted an entire broadcast to Joseph McCarthy at
the height of the senator's power.
</P>
<P>
   That night, CBS threatened to dismiss the program's production
manager, Palmer Williams, because they had learned that his ex-wife
was a member of the Communist Party. But Edward R. Murrow and his
producer, Fred Friendly, would have none of it. Still, tension ran
high. Opinions differed as to whether the program should go on,
considering the risks it posed to everyone involved. The feeling
was that CBS probably wouldn't back them in the event that McCarthy
counterattacked.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting that evening, Mr. Wershba gave the archive some of
its most vivid moments. ``Ed said: `The terror is right here in
this room. No one man can terrorize a whole nation unless we are
all his accomplices.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, they went ahead. Creativity wasn't the only
kind of freedom at stake.

COURT EXPANDS LIABILITY OF LANDLORDS IN ATTACKS ON TENANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a series of decisions, New York state's highest
court Tuesday expanded the opportunity for tenants to obtain
damages from landlords when they are attacked by intruders who gain
access to buildings because of broken or nonexistent locks.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals issued three decisions, involving five
cases, that tried to broaden the circumstances under which
landlords _ including the New York City Housing Authority _ can be
held liable for damages when faulty building security contributes
to criminal assaults.
</P>
<P>
   To collect damages in such cases under New York law, a tenant
must convince a jury that the landlord was negligent in maintaining
building security and that the assailants were outsiders who got
into the building specifically because the door locks were broken
or nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   It is often difficult, if not impossible, to prove that a broken
lock was directly responsible for an assault, that it was the
``proximate cause,'' as the principle is known in the law. An
assailant's identity is often unknown; he might have lived in the
building or been visiting someone, or he might have followed a
tenant through a locked door.
</P>
<P>
   State appeals courts in recent years have generally limited
landlords' liability in such cases. But the thrust of most of the
court's rulings Tuesday was to make it easier for tenants to
collect damages from landlords, even when the identity of an
assailant is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant case involved Norma Burgos, who lived in a
privately owned building on West 182nd Street in Manhattan. Ms.
Burgos was robbed and beaten by two men who pushed into her
apartment when she opened her door to go out one afternoon. Ms.
Burgos said that locks on the front and back doors of her building
were broken and that she had not known her assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the building, Aqueduct Realty Corp., moved to have
the case dismissed because Ms. Burgos could not prove conclusively
that her assailants were strangers who had entered the building
uninvited. The trial court denied the landlord's motion to dismiss,
but a state appeals court reversed the ruling, throwing out the
case.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous decision, the Court of Appeals reversed the
appellate decision, reinstating Ms. Burgos' case. While the court
did not decide whether the landlord was liable, it said Ms. Burgos
had offered enough information to enable that decision to be made
by a jury. Ms. Burgos' assertions ``are sufficient to raise a
triable issue of fact as to whether the assailants were intruders
who entered the building through a negligently maintained door,''
Chief Justice Judith Kaye wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A related case was brought on behalf of a 12-year-old girl from
the Bronx, who was raped and sodomized by an unidentified man who
had entered her building in a city housing project by walking
through a back door that could not be closed or locked. A jury
found that the New York City Housing Authority was liable for
damages, but the judge dismissed the case because the girl could
not prove that her assailant was an intruder. A state appeals court
affirmed the decision, saying that just because the victim did not
know the rapist was insufficient proof that he was an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals reversed the appellate decision Tuesday,
and ordered the case returned to state Supreme Court. Kaye said
there was significant evidence that the rapist was an intruder. He
was seen entering the building through the broken and unlocked
door, she wrote. He made no attempt to conceal his identity when he
rode on an elevator with the victim and other residents, and he did
not select a floor. He simply followed the young woman when she
exited at her floor.
</P>
<P>
   Even if an assailant is not identified, Kaye wrote, a tenant can
successfully sue a landlord for negligence over an assault ``if the
evidence renders it more likely or more reasonable than not that
the assailant was an intruder who gained access to the premises
through a negligently maintained entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   But in another case decided Tuesday, the court upheld lower
court rulings that found that the Housing Authority was not
responsible for the sexual assault and robbery of a Manhattan girl,
17. Even though the front door of the girl's building in a city
housing project had no lock _ and even though her attacker was
clearly an intruder _ the court found that the Housing Authority's
negligence had not caused the assault. The attacker was a serial
rapist who had assaulted women in many buildings, including some
that had been locked, the court said in a 5-1 ruling.

AS TELMEX EYES US, FCC HAS PRICING QUERIES

 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Ever since President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico
unplugged the country's telephone monopoly in January 1997 and
opened up its $3.5 billion long-distance market to private
competition, the bruising battle for customers has read like the
storyline from a classic Mexican soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   In a plot filled with drama, schemes, backbiting, unlikely
alliances, and angry accusations of abuse and betrayal, Telefonos
de Mexico, the giant that still dominates the local market here,
has fought aggressively against a half-dozen foes, including US
giants AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Things just got uglier.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months after it received approval to be the first
foreign long-distance carrier to operate in the United States,
Telmex is now being questioned by American authorities about
whether it unfairly blocks competition back home. Late Tuesday, the
US Federal Communications Commission issued an order calling for
Telmex officials to explain their pricing and accounting practices
to prove they are not overcharging competitors in an effort to
squeeze them out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC action is in response to increasing pressure brought on
this year by AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom, who say Telmex charges them
seven cents a minute _ seven times higher then the actual cost to
Telmex _ for interconnection rates to the local network.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has oversight over Telmex's partnership with another
American company, Sprint Communications, to market long-distance
service in US cities with large Mexican-American populations.
Telmex has 30 days to respond to the FCC's order.
</P>
<P>
   Although Telmex no longer holds a monopoly inside Mexico, it is
still one of the nation's largest and most influential corporations
and it still controls the switches that provide access to local
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies have managed to lure more than a quarter of
Mexico's long-distance customers in less than two years. Both AT&AMP;T
and MCI, however, say Telmex's monopolistic practices are costing
them hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues and violate a
world trade agreement signed in February to open up
telecommunications services to foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Avantel, S.A., which is half-owned by MCI, has halted $900
million of investment planned for Mexico because of the dispute.
The Mexican company Alpha, one of three partners in Alestra, the
AT&AMP;T-developed Mexico enterprise, disclosed last month that it had
lost nearly $50 million so far this year from the long-distance
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of behavior is impacting the viability for us and
others who want to compete'' in Mexico's market, Dianne Bernez, an
AT&AMP;T spokeswoman, said last week. ``You won't see competitive
pricing in Mexico if we don't have access to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   When it approved the Telmex-Sprint partnership, which AT&AMP;T and
MCI vehemently opposed, the agency attached several conditions,
most of them aimed at Telmex's willingness to open Mexico's market.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, FCC officials said this week that they have grown
frustrated with the company's seemingly unfair business practices
and the lack of regulatory and legal muscle that exists in Mexico
to force Telmex to change its behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pricing structure is so far askew in favor of Telmex that
it has become an economic liability issue'' for American
competitors, one FCC official said this week on background. ``There
is the feeling that'' Mexico's Federal Telecommunications
Commission ``has not done enough. They need to step up to the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Telmex's foreign competitors also want the company to reduce its
settlement rates _ the fees carriers pay each other to terminate an
international call _ which have ranged about 39 cents a minute,
making them the highest in the world. Settlement rates to Canada
are about 10 cents and even less for calls to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate decision Tuesday, the FCC rejected a settlement
rate agreement of 37 cents between Telmex and its American partner,
Sprint Communications, because the rate was still too high.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials said the license granted to Telmex is not in
immediate jeopardy of being rescinded _ because of the company's
right to respond. But Telmex must now answer to American
authorities, who are believed to be stricter than their Mexican
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex officials did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday
seeking comment. But Mexican regulators and company officials have
said that the settlement rates were clearly spelled out in a 1997
agreement, and that the fees will be reduced to 19 cents by 2000, a
benchmark that US officials agreed to previously.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexico's long-distance market was opened, government
officials on both sides of the border pointed to it as proof of the
merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But with
government bodies in both countries now involved in the
cross-border long-distance dispute, the battle for telephone
service in Mexico is likely to escalate further.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, Telmex had been controlled by Carlos
Slim Helu, a 58-year-old stockbroker who bought the company when
the government privatized it in 1991. He is now considered to be
the richest man in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   As competition has been introduced into Mexico, every company,
including Telmex, has become even more aggressive. Long distance
rates have declined by nearly half since February 1997 _ as Telmex
lowered prices to undercut new companies _ while local rates have
gone up 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican customers now also get something many Americans are all
too familiar with: the dinnertime phone call from a long-distance
company representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been called about three times in the last two
weeks by the same company,'' said Emilio Barraza, a 40-year-old
Mexico City banker. ``I don't know what to say. It's always been
Telmex. I'm not saying I'm happy, but that's what I'm used to.''

   In 1955, Oppi Untracht, a New Yorker who now lives in Finland,
was spellbound by an exhibition of Indian textiles and jewelry he
saw at the Museum of Modern Art. Since then, Untracht has traveled
the highways and byways of the subcontinent, studying
jewelry-making techniques and buying jewelry. (For many years he
was accompanied with his wife, the Finnish glass designer Saara
Hopea, who died in 1984.) Trained as a photographer by Berenice
Abbott, he also photographed people he encountered wearing
ritualistic finery.
</P>
<P>
   When Nina Stritzler-Levine, the director of exhibitions at the
Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts in
Manhattan, was in Finland organizing last year's show on Finnish
Modernism, she met Untracht and asked him to curate the first
comprehensive exhibition of Indian jewelry in New York. His
collection of jewelry and photographs along with loans from museums
and other private collectors make up ``India: A Jewelry Spectrum,''
a dazzling exhibition on view through Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the more than 300 ornaments on display could qualify as
a work of art in itself. In reality, the ornaments were intended to
be worn in clusters, literally covering the body from head to foot.
For a woman, her jewelry was her dowry, her only personal
belongings; and for security reasons she generally wore all of it.
Seeing the assortment of beads, amulets, necklaces, anklets and
rings, emblazoned with figures of gods or religious symbols, is a
reminder of the power that the jewlery held over the people who
wore it.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Waterman, Bard's in-house designer, lined the walls of
the intimate galleries with handwoven silk in the colors worn by
Indian women _ green, purple, saffron and rose red. The ornaments
are arranged in the galleries according to their origins: bead and
metal work from isolated tribal regions in one, silver jewelry from
rural villages in another and gold and gemstones from the cities in
the last gallery. Within each area, Untracht has grouped similar
objects, beginning with head ornaments followed by earrings,
necklaces, armlets, bracelets, belts and ankle bracelets. The
overall effect of the exhibition is like walking into an
overflowing treasure chest.
</P>
<P>
   An important insight gained from the show is that designs were
often dictated by available technology rather than esthetics. A
necklace from the state of Nagaland, for example, uses three conch
shells, brass trumpet-shaped pendants and beads made of carnelian,
glass and conch shell separated by bone. Although the tribesmen who
made it had devised complex bead technologies, they used very
little metal because they were dependent on metal workers from
outside the tribal area. What made the jewelry precious to the
inland tribes, though, were the raw materials that came from
distant seashores, like coral or conch and cowrie shells.
</P>
<P>
   In the villages, silver amulets that hung around the neck often
depicted the wearer's personal deity or the animal upon which the
deity rode _ like the bull that carried Shiva. One amulet in the
form of a container was shaped to represent the bull's horns, and
for festivals, sacred bulls wore silver head ornaments encrusted
with glass stones. The wearing of animal parts was also thought to
impart the power of the beast to the wearer: A brooch with tiger
claws set in a silver and garnet mount became a potent motif.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the pieces on view are intricate, others, like a
silver-wrapped torque of coiled wire that was part of a dowry,
demonstrate a simplicity that seems both contemporary and timeless.
</P>
<P>
   Weddings offered sumptuous displays of jewelry, especially in
cities where gold was prevalent. A groom might be festooned with a
gold tinsel plume like a parade horse, while his bride in a red
sari might have worn a nose ring, bangles and a cobra-shaped braid
ornament. If she were a second wife, she wore an ornament of rock
crystal to ward off the spirit of the former wife. With all the
glitter, the gallery takes on the festivness of a wedding itself.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and silver, much in demand in India in the 19th century,
were also scarce natural resources. ``Since Roman times, Indians
would only trade their spice, ivory and textiles for silver or
gold,'' said Untracht, ``and the ships came laden in bullion.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the gold came from the 1849 California gold rush. Little
could a Forty-Niner imagine that the gold he gathered would crown a
young groom on his wedding day in the Punjab. But gold was more
than a luxury. In the foreword to the catalog, Susan Weber Soros,
the director of the Bard Graduate Center, writes, ``Hindu belief
holds that gold is a sacred metal, symbolizing the warmth of the
sun.''

CONSUMER GROUP LISTS TOYS IT CONSIDERS DANGEROUS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As parents prepare for the official start of the
holiday shopping season, a consumer advocacy group Tuesday
announced its annual list of the 20 most dangerous toys of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular toys to make the list was the roly-poly
Teletubby Po doll, which has a plush body and is intended for
babies. Other toys on the list included Duplo's Preschool Building
Set, Playskool's Arthur Figure Set and Kenner's Big Girl Baby Play
Set.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Tuesday, leaders of the New York Public
Interest Research Group said that the face of the Teletubby Po
doll, molded into a perpetual grin, and the vinyl television screen
set into its belly were made with a type of chemicals known as
phthalates. The chemicals have been shown to cause liver damage in
laboratory mice and rats.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates worry that children who chew and suck on the
Po doll could ingest the dangerous chemical. ``Parents have reason
to be really concerned about this,'' said Tracy Shelton, staff
attorney for NYPIRG, which has been conducting safety studies on
toys since 1986. ``This chemical can result in chronic health
problems, especially to the kidney and the liver.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, the manufacturer, dismissed the claims in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us be clear,'' said the statement from Wayne Charniss, a
senior vice president at Hasbro, ``we believe our Teletubbies are
safe. The preponderance of scientific evidence supports the safety
of phthalates in toys and we believe parental worries have been
unjustly stimulated by special interest groups with their own
agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Po doll is one of several Teletubby dolls on the market. But
the others were not included on the list because NYPIRG officials
said they had not been tested.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the toys cited by NYPIRG have sharp edges, small parts
that can choke, or long cords that could strangle a child. Many
carry warning labels, required by the Consumer Product Safety
Commission, making it clear that they are not intended for children
under 3.
</P>
<P>
   But new to the list this year are several plastic toys _ all
perfectly soft and squishable _ that are considered dangerous
because they are made with phthalates (pronounced THAY-lates). The
chemical, used by toy manufacturers since the early 1980s, makes
vinyl soft and malleable, much like water does for a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of the chemical's effects on rats prompted Greenpeace to
call for a ban on its use by toy manufacturers. Manufacturers of
the chemical say that phthalates do not cause damage to humans or
other higher animals, including monkeys. The Consumer Product
Safety Commission is considering the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shelton said that her group is urging the government to
conduct more tests on phthalates. She said the controversial
chemical is also found in teething toys. Two that made her group's
list of most dangerous toys are Gerber's Looney Tunes water-filled
soother, each one shaped like a cartoon character, and the Cool
Animal Teether by The First Year.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous toy on NYPIRG's list, and one that has
appeared on every list since 1986, are balloons, Ms. Shelton said.
Children can choke on deflated balloons, or on pieces of popped
balloons, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other toys that made Nypirg's list include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mattel's ``Baby Dil's World'' Rugrats Play Set, which NYPIRG
said had several pieces that could be swallowed or cause choking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Playskool's Talking Pay Phone, a large yellow telephone with
several plastic coins that can get lodged in a child's throat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unique's Flying propellers, party favors with several sharp
pieces that could cause injuries to a child's eyes or face.
</P>
<P>
   For a complete list, contact NYPIRG at (212) 349-6460.

AS TELMEX EYES US, FCC HAS PRICING QUERIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Ever since President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico
unplugged the country's telephone monopoly in January 1997 and
opened up its $3.5 billion long-distance market to private
competition, the bruising battle for customers has read like the
storyline from a classic Mexican soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   In a plot filled with drama, schemes, backbiting, unlikely
alliances, and angry accusations of abuse and betrayal, Telefonos
de Mexico, the giant that still dominates the local market here,
has fought aggressively against a half-dozen foes, including US
giants AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   Things just got uglier.
</P>
<P>
   Just three months after it received approval to be the first
foreign long-distance carrier to operate in the United States,
Telmex is now being questioned by American authorities about
whether it unfairly blocks competition back home. Late Tuesday, the
US Federal Communications Commission issued an order calling for
Telmex officials to explain their pricing and accounting practices
to prove they are not overcharging competitors in an effort to
squeeze them out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC action is in response to increasing pressure brought on
this year by AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom, who say Telmex charges them
seven cents a minute _ seven times higher then the actual cost to
Telmex _ for interconnection rates to the local network.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has oversight over Telmex's partnership with another
American company, Sprint Communications, to market long-distance
service in US cities with large Mexican-American populations.
Telmex has 30 days to respond to the FCC's order.
</P>
<P>
   Although Telmex no longer holds a monopoly inside Mexico, it is
still one of the nation's largest and most influential corporations
and it still controls the switches that provide access to local
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies have managed to lure more than a quarter of
Mexico's long-distance customers in less than two years. Both AT&AMP;T
and MCI, however, say Telmex's monopolistic practices are costing
them hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues and violate a
world trade agreement signed in February to open up
telecommunications services to foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Avantel, S.A., which is half-owned by MCI, has halted $900
million of investment planned for Mexico because of the dispute.
The Mexican company Alpha, one of three partners in Alestra, the
AT&AMP;T-developed Mexico enterprise, disclosed last month that it had
lost nearly $50 million so far this year from the long-distance
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of behavior is impacting the viability for us and
others who want to compete'' in Mexico's market, Dianne Bernez, an
AT&AMP;T spokeswoman, said last week. ``You won't see competitive
pricing in Mexico if we don't have access to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   When it approved the Telmex-Sprint partnership, which AT&AMP;T and
MCI vehemently opposed, the agency attached several conditions,
most of them aimed at Telmex's willingness to open Mexico's market.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, FCC officials said this week that they have grown
frustrated with the company's seemingly unfair business practices
and the lack of regulatory and legal muscle that exists in Mexico
to force Telmex to change its behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pricing structure is so far askew in favor of Telmex that
it has become an economic liability issue'' for American
competitors, one FCC official said this week on background. ``There
is the feeling that'' Mexico's Federal Telecommunications
Commission ``has not done enough. They need to step up to the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Telmex's foreign competitors also want the company to reduce its
settlement rates _ the fees carriers pay each other to terminate an
international call _ which have ranged about 39 cents a minute,
making them the highest in the world. Settlement rates to Canada
are about 10 cents and even less for calls to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate decision Tuesday, the FCC rejected a settlement
rate agreement of 37 cents between Telmex and its American partner,
Sprint Communications, because the rate was still too high.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials said the license granted to Telmex is not in
immediate jeopardy of being rescinded _ because of the company's
right to respond. But Telmex must now answer to American
authorities, who are believed to be stricter than their Mexican
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Telmex officials did not immediately return a phone call Tuesday
seeking comment. But Mexican regulators and company officials have
said that the settlement rates were clearly spelled out in a 1997
agreement, and that the fees will be reduced to 19 cents by 2000, a
benchmark that US officials agreed to previously.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexico's long-distance market was opened, government
officials on both sides of the border pointed to it as proof of the
merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement. But with
government bodies in both countries now involved in the
cross-border long-distance dispute, the battle for telephone
service in Mexico is likely to escalate further.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, Telmex had been controlled by Carlos
Slim Helu, a 58-year-old stockbroker who bought the company when
the government privatized it in 1991. He is now considered to be
the richest man in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   As competition has been introduced into Mexico, every company,
including Telmex, has become even more aggressive. Long distance
rates have declined by nearly half since February 1997 _ as Telmex
lowered prices to undercut new companies _ while local rates have
gone up 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican customers now also get something many Americans are all
too familiar with: the dinnertime phone call from a long-distance
company representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been called about three times in the last two
weeks by the same company,'' said Emilio Barraza, a 40-year-old
Mexico City banker. ``I don't know what to say. It's always been
Telmex. I'm not saying I'm happy, but that's what I'm used to.''

 HEDGE FUND SEEKS BUYER OR PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co, a big New York hedge fund and broker,
is seeking a partner or buyer for its stock-related trading
business, an indication that the shakeout in the hedge fund world
continues despite calmer markets.
</P>
<P>
   The unit had been part of a broad strategic alliance between
Shaw, a hedge fund founded by a former computer science professor,
David Shaw, and the BankAmerica Corp., one of the country's largest
banks. The alliance collapsed last month when BankAmerica announced
that it had lost $372 million on a bond trading venture with Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   David Coulter, BankAmerica's president, resigned his position
shortly after the loss was made public.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said it hoped to attract a new major bank that would
replace BankAmerica as the main backer for its stock-linked
business financial products group. It would otherwise seek to find
a buyer for the group, which employs more than 100 traders. The
group specializes in trading convertible bonds and derivatives tied
to stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The offer to sell the unit, which Shaw maintained had been
highly profitable, suggests continued turmoil at the
once-unstoppable hedge fund, which in recent years made 25 percent
annual investment returns from secretive trading strategies. The
private investment house has not sought to recruit partners
publicly in the past, and Shaw has repeatedly denied that the fund
faces even minor financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to raise fresh capital also shows how many hedge
funds now have to scramble to adjust their business strategies and
lower their risk profiles. Though financial markets have
stabilized, many hedge funds still face net withdrawals of money
from investors, who became more cautious about taking big risks
following the summer crisis in world stock and bond markets,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   A Shaw spokesman said that the hedge fund remained in excellent
financial health and that its losses were confined to previously
reported troubles at its fixed-income trading units. He said the
effort to seek fresh capital or a buyer for the equity-linked unit
was necessary because Shaw does not have a high enough credit
rating to borrow money on the most favorable terms, and that higher
borrowing costs could render some of its low-margin trading
strategies unprofitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``To run the equity business successfully, you need a double A
credit rating,'' said Nick Gianakouros, a Shaw executive. ``You
also need relationships with corporate officers and treasurers.
When BankAmerica was not longer willing to provide these functions
for this business, we decided that we needed another partner.''
</P>
<P>
   BankAmerica had provided the hedge fund with investment capital,
loans and access to the bank's list of blue-chip clients around the
world. Through cooperation with BankAmerica, Shaw became a leading
trader _ in some cases, it contends, the single largest buyer and
seller _ of some equity-linked products. Areas of specialty
included Japanese warrants, and Southeast Asian and European
convertible bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Gianakouros said the alliance with BankAmerica wound down
because the bank acquired the in-house capability to trade and make
markets in equity products after it merged with Nationsbank. He
said the bank is under contract to provide services to the hedge
fund through the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But the relationship suffered what would appear to be a fatal
blow from heavy bond-trading loss. To cover expected losses on a
$1.3 billion loan to Shaw, BankAmerica took charges in October of
$372 million and it bought all of Shaw's $20 billion bond portfolio
in an attempt to recoup some losses.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's stumble in fixed-income trading was not unlike that
suffered by another big hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management.
Both speculated that prices for riskier bonds would rise relative
to benchmark U.S. Treasury offerings. Such bets went bad when a
worldwide flight to safety in the late summer and early fall pushed
up Treasury prices dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Shaw maintained that its other businesses remained
highly profitable. But if the hedge fund ends up selling its
equity-linked businesses, its trading on behalf of customers, as
opposed to its propriety trading for investors, would be greatly
reduced in scope.
</P>
<P>
   The fund said it had hired Wasserstein Perella &AMP; Co. to help
recruit partners or find buyers for the unit.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   America Online built itself into the most potent force in
cyberspace largely by appealing to families with chatty teen-agers
who want to flirt online and adults looking for an easy way to send
electronic mail while checking the weather and sports scores.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the company has to get serious if it is to win the hearts
and minds of corporate executives in pin-stripe suits.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly lost in the complexity of America Online's deal to buy
Netscape Communication Corp. is America Online's announcement that
it will enter an entirely new market: working behind the computer
screen to help companies open and operate online stores.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape already has created software that made it a player in
providing support for what is already known as electronic commerce.
But America Online now says it has ambitions to offer a much wider
array of software, consulting and services for online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies that sell to consumers realize that they need
to get into the e-commerce space,'' said America Online president
Robert Pittman in a news conference Tuesday. ``We see a major
business in offering them an end-to-end solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is big and growing bigger by the day. Forrester
Research estimates that $325 million will be spent this year on
electronic commerce software and another $5.3 billion on services
that range from graphic design to the turn-key operation of entire
online stores. By 2002, Forrester estimates, the combined market
for electronic commerce services and software should top $35
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce services are the silver bullet that will enable
companies to be able to take advantage of the true business
opportunities on the Web,'' said Traci Gere, an analyst at
International Data Corp. ``The market is growing very rapidly, but
it is very fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the leader today in e-commerce services is IBM,
which has a full line of offerings from sophisticated software
products to hand-holding consulting.
</P>
<P>
   Other competitors include well-known information technology
consulting companies such as Andersen Consulting, the spin-off from
the Arthur Andersen accounting firm; Electronic Data Systems, which
runs computer systems for big companies, and
PricewaterhouseCoopers, which offers accounting and consulting
separately but under one umbrella. Software companies like
Microsoft and Netscape sell packaged programs, typically with
little or no consulting to help customers use them.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plenty of new companies that have sprouted up to
provide electronic commerce services. Some, like Agency.Com and
Organic Online, started basically as advertising and design firms.
Others, including U S Web and Viant, have emphasized programming
and consulting. In fact, those two strains are blurring together,
as exemplified by U S Web's pending merger with CKS Group.
</P>
<P>
   America Online argues that its advantage in this increasingly
crowded bazaar is its ability to combine a broad subscriber base of
about 15 million customers with Netscape software, plus hardware
from Sun Microsystems, which has joined in America Online's venture
into electronic commerce engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone has put a true end-to-end
solution that starts with the silicon and ends with the audience,''
said Barry Schuler, America Online's president for interactive
services. ``We start with Sun's line of servers, then the commerce
tools to build a store, the support services to process orders and
then a deal for online real estate that can drive the traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advantages Netscape and Sun bring, analysts say that
America Online faces a variety of problems in its new quest.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is whether it can appear to have the
consistency, focus and follow-through that corporate customers
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL is not the first company that comes to my mind when it
comes to business-quality software,'' said Robert Chatham, a senior
analyst with Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Its decision to keep Netscape as a separate unit and offer
electronic commerce services in partnership with Sun will not
enhance its credibility, Chatham said. ``America Online doesn't
look like a homogenous vendor,'' he added. ``It looks like
customers will have to tangle with a menage a trois of AOL,
Netscape and Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor have Internet service providers and other
telecommunications-oriented companies shown much evidence, Ms. Gere
of International Data said, that they are capable of offering the
highly specific customized services that big corporate clients
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecommunications companies that try to do things efficiently
for a large number of customers have not been able to offer
customized one-to-one relationships,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said that America Online had been driven to the
e-commerce business because companies that approached it wanting to
sell their goods needed more help than simply advertising online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are finding people who are expert in running
bricks-and-mortar stores are limited by their infrastructure,'' he
said. ``They have an online store, but their square footage is too
small.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Netscape deal, America Online was moving to
provide some electronic commerce software and services. It has been
rewriting the software that lets companies open online stores to be
based on universally accepted Internet standards rather than the
specific computer language used only on America Online. This new
software, which now will be combined with Netscape's online store
services, will be available for companies to use both on America
Online and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it has developed a service that lets users create a
file with their credit card numbers and shipping address so they
can make online purchases without retyping all that information
each time. America Online is working to offer it _ for a fee _ to
stores on the broader Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide range of services that are incorporated in
electronic commerce. These include high-end strategy consulting to
help companies decide whether and how to sell online without
hurting their traditional sale in stores. There are all sorts of
computer systems to be developed, ranging from the online stores
themselves to connecting those sites to a company's existing
inventory and accounting systems.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are creative services that include graphic design, media
buying, customer list analysis and other marketing and promotional
efforts. And there are operational services that involve actually
maintaining the big servers that users connect to when they use the
online stores that display catalogs, take orders and process
payments.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, Schuler said, will emphasize services that
relate to marketing rather than back-office functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will consult on how to merchandise and sell online,'' he
said. ``We understand the consumer piece of the puzzle.''
</P>
<P>
   Some competitors worry that America Online's electronic commerce
services may simply be a device to sell its software and hardware.
``The challenge is to prove that clients are getting the best
possible solution for their business,'' said Robert Gett, the chief
executive of Viant. ``If they offer AOL and Netscape and Sun, their
answer is a bit tainted.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape does have an expanding force of about 700 people who
provide consulting and custom programming. But they have been most
competitive, Gett said, in competing for nuts-and-bolts projects
rather than the more lucrative assignments to develop and carry out
a full-fledged strategy on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Who knows our software better than Netscape?'''
Gett said. ``We help customers decide which platform is best for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But America Online argues that the combined might of it,
Netscape and Sun is just what the business needs. ``We always
believed that commerce, that is buying goods and services, is the
huge revenue stream of the future,'' Schuler said. ``We have only
seen the tiniest tip of the iceberg.''

 COMMENTARY: A KILLING LEAVES A VACANCY ON 106th ST.  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gloria Denard is a jazz singer, so she knows how to
improvise. Thirty-one years ago she relied more on ingenuity than
income to start Manna House Workshops, an East Harlem school
dedicated to jazz and dance. Grants helped her buy a five-story
building on East 106th Street, where the school occupies the first
two floors and the rest are rented to tenants.
</P>
<P>
   One was Jason Adams, who moved there in 1989. Last year, he
became the building's handyman, giving new meaning to that job
title. He was a big brother to the school's students and took them
to movies or on trips to the park. He bought flowers for the ladies
in the building and tucked Christmas cards under everyone's door.
Using his own money, he even paid the neighborhood youths who
helped him clean the building.
</P>
<P>
   Adams was killed last month in his apartment, police said, by
two young men who stole his computer and video game system and some
cash. He was stabbed more than 50 times.
</P>
<P>
   His death has Ms. DeNard improvising again, this time as
building custodian. Unable to afford a replacement, she begins her
days checking the halls for litter, putting out garbage bags and
tending the boiler.
</P>
<P>
   Her new tasks sap her time and energy, since she is already busy
writing grant proposals, promoting recitals and handling other
school activities. A few volunteers help out, but she has learned
that many are jittery about venturing to the neighborhood because
of fears about crime. That leaves Ms. DeNard in a bind: the
negative perceptions she hoped to fight with the transforming power
of music have scared off the very people who could help her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started Manna House to show we had a culture of our own, so
people would value what we had to offer,'' Ms. DeNard said. ``We've
been made to feel we're inferior, but the one thing I want to say
is we are beautiful people with a creative spirit who can create
anything we choose. But I can't create volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although as the handyman he got a break on his rent, Adams did
more in return. Friends and neighbors remembered him as always
smiling and willing to help, helping carry packages, looking after
the younger students or lending an artistic touch to the classroom
where neighborhood people gathered on Saturday nights for jukebox
dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``He designed all the Christmas decorations,'' Ms. DeNard said.
``He designed a tree from lights that he put up on the wall. Just
like you see downtown in the department stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever people passed by the building they waved to Adams. He
was in front early each day to sweep away the scattered remains of
cigars that had been gutted and stuffed with marijuana the night
before by the get-high crowd right in front of the signs that read
``Say No to Drugs'' and ``No Trespassing.'' Perhaps he was too
trusting, but he refused to think the neighborhood was beyond hope.
He told Marjorie Roberson, Ms. DeNard's assistant, that everyone
could change for the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him why he spent so much time with young kids,'' Ms.
Roberson said. ``He said he wanted to keep them off the street,
since they were not working and had time on their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the sight of some of those youths on the street kept
volunteers away. They would not have seen the countless young
people who have learned jazz and dance at the school and have gone
on to appear on stage, in movies or in concert with musicians like
Miles Davis or Lena Horne.
</P>
<P>
   Some people do come by, but make a polite excuse and never come
back. It has turned Ms. DeNard into a volunteer herself, since she
pays herself a monthly stipend of only $150 so that her teaching
staff won't have to take a pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't express how they really feel,'' Ms. DeNard said.
``Who knows how many people have stayed away from working here
because of what happened?''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have suggested she move her school to someplace less
threatening, but Ms. DeNard refuses even to consider a move that
would be tantamount to admitting defeat. Instead, she is trying to
find a way to finish some of the work Adams left undone: hallways
that need painting, walls that need to be stripped, mailboxes that
have to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   One task remains. In a few days she will put a plaque in the
lobby in honor of Adams, a friend, neighbor and employee who came
and never left. She plans to put a spotlight on it, so people can
see it from the street when they walk by. Maybe a few will stop.

LEWIS IN SYNC WITH HOLYFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The champagne has been chilling for so long it has
frostbite. After six weeks of haggling over such things as the
shape of the bargaining table, the deal for the heavyweight
unification bout between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis is
finally done.
</P>
<P>
   All sides have agreed to terms and a news conference is
scheduled next Monday at Madison Square Garden, which will be the
site of the bout March 13. Don King will be the promoter and the
bout will be televised on pay-per-view by TVKO.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, the World Boxing Association and International Boxing
Federation champion, will receive $20 million and Lewis, the World
Boxing Council champion, will receive between $8 million and $10
million. The winner can look forward to two years of mandatory
defenses against guys like Henry Akinwande.
</P>
<P>
   King Has the Edge
</P>
<P>
   Don King has won Round 1 of his legal fight with Felix Trinidad,
the idle IBF welterweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   Monday a federal judge in Manhattan refused to grant Trinidad a
preliminary injunction to set aside his contract with King,
derailing the fighter's attempt to sign another promotional deal
with Main Events and scuttling a Jan. 9 bout against Pernell
Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad had sought the injunction based on his belief that his
contract with King had expired. But King believes that the contract
is in force because it is tied to Trinidad being a champion.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Medina, Trinidad's Puerto Rico based lawyer, said his
fighter was weighing his option on what to do next. Medina said
Trinidad could appeal the judge's ruling on the preliminary
injunction or proceed with a juror trial on the other issues of his
lawsuit. Both options are time consuming and will hurt Trinidad, a
brilliant boxer whose career is in neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad was supposed to fight Ike Quartey two weeks ago under
an agreement he signed with Main Events. But that fight was
canceled. Now that his fight against Whitaker has been snatched
away, there is no telling when Trinidad will get back into the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   HBO Sports, which has a separate contract with Trinidad, is
still holding the Jan. 9 date, apparently looking to put Roy Jones
Jr. in the ring for that date. If so, it would be the third time in
10 months that Jones filled in for a broken fight for the cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had more saves this year than Trevor Hoffman,'' Mike
Boorman of Main Events, said citing the San Diego Padre relief
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor Mill Is Spinning
</P>
<P>
   Jay Larkin, the Showtime senior vice president of sports and
events programming, said he was waiting for someone to call him
with a rumor that Mike Tyson had been kidnapped by aliens and would
not be around for his heavyweight bout against Frans Botha on Jan.
16.
</P>
<P>
   ``These rumors that the fight is in jeopardy are getting
ridiculous,'' Larkin said. ``But has there ever been a Mike Tyson
fight where there haven't been rumors running rampant?''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin said there was no truth to a rumor that the MGM Grand was
not satisfied with its deal for the fight and might be backing out.
</P>
<P>
   A news conference scheduled in Manhattan last week to announce
the fight was canceled because Tyson did not want to break the
rhythm of his training in Phoenix and fly to the East Coast.
Instead there will be a news conference at the Century Plaza Hotel
in Los Angeles next Thursday.

<P>
   The International Monetary Fund is out of dough. Politicians
from Tokyo to Moscow lack the mandate or the will to fix their
economies. Intervention has failed the central banks and
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   All that now seems to stand between the world and a slide into
global recession are U.S. consumers, armed with wallets full of
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh at this unlikely superhero _ these notoriously
casual savers who already strain under a mountain of debt are
stronger than they look. But don't overestimate what they'll be
able to pull off, either.
</P>
<P>
   At best, U.S. consumers can buy the global economy some time and
prevent a worldwide panic. But they won't be able to stop the Asian
flu from infecting Latin America, and they can't, by themselves,
turn the situation around.
</P>
<P>
   How did the global economy get to this pass? More than a year
after the collapse of the Thai baht triggered an avalanche that
buried all of Asia, the International Monetary Fund's program of
huge loans, higher rates, and big cuts to government spending
hasn't stabilized the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   That medicine did indeed stop the feverish descent of Asia's
currencies (particularly the South Korean won, which is worth more
today than it was in January), but overall, the economies of the
region have become sicker, not healthier.
</P>
<P>
   High interest rates, for example, have helped choke off growth.
Indonesia's gross domestic product will fall an estimated 15
percent this year. (For context, Mexico's GDP sank 7 percent in
1995 after the peso crisis.)
</P>
<P>
   And Japan is, even its traditionally optimistic bureaucrats
admit, officially in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now the IMF is almost out of money. The bankers are so close to
the bottom of the vault that in mid-August they elected not to
throw more cash into Russia. A bailout, the IMF felt, would have
depleted reserves without offering the slightest chance that
Russia's problems would be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Latin American countries such as Venezuela and Brazil
aren't likely to get a warmer welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The standard remedy for recession is to generate spending,
either by running budget deficits to pay for public works or by
cutting taxes to stimulate private demand.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, that extra money soaks up the supply of unsold goods
and services, stimulates new capital investment, and creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But even when governments in Asia have been able to muster the
political will to take these steps, the program hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Asia isn't in the grip of your standard-issue, plain-vanilla
recession. Nope, this is the deluxe model that combines falling
economic activity, constantly shrinking asset values, and a
seemingly endless credit crunch. Efforts to stimulate growth
disappear into these devastated economies without a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, for example, has poured trillions of yen into
infrastructure projects and cut taxes _ albeit timidly _ without
noticeable effect. Consumers are too afraid to spend _ the Japanese
and Koreans are clearly saving more in response to the crisis _ and
who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The official unemployment rate in Japan, the land of lifetime
employment, is now at 4.3 percent, and the real rate is probably
closer to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are spending every dollar they have
and then some. Personal income rose 0.2 percent in June, according
to the Department of Commerce, after an increase of 0.4 percent in
May. Personal expenditures rose 0.6 percent in June, after a 0.9
percent climb in May.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers are doing exactly what their counterparts in Asia
aren't willing to do. In June, the U.S. trade deficit with the ten
major Asian nations totaled $15 billion _ that's up more than 40
percent from the deficit in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear where at least some of the dollars headed to
Asia are coming from. U.S. consumers are saving less and running up
more debt. In the first quarter of 1998, according to the
Department of Commerce, U.S. consumers saved just 0.6 percent. At
the same time, consumer debt grew at an annual rate of better than
6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are now paying a record 15 percent of after-tax income
in interest and principal, according to Economic Analysis
Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   If you judge from those trends, the U.S. consumer sounds pretty
tapped out and poorly cast as the hero who will save the world
economy. But these numbers ignore the ``wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve estimates that since 1994 the stock market
has added $12.5 trillion to the assets of U.S. households. Using
traditional estimates of the way this wealth effect flows from the
financial markets into consumer spending, that asset explosion will
add about $600 billion annually to consumer purchasing power in the
U.s.
</P>
<P>
   That number is both reassuring and scary. Reassuring because it
suggests the United States will be able to continue its role as
consumer of last resort into 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scary because it suggests that U.S. consumers will play this
role only as long as a buoyant stock market makes them feel
wealthy. No one has any real idea, unfortunately, of how far the
market would have to fall before consumers would stop feeling
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of buying by U.S. consumers can fix the structural
problems in the Korean, Japanese, or Brazilian economies. But it
can buy time for those economies to right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It can pump liquidity into cash-starved companies in these
countries. And it can give countries _ China most importantly _ an
incentive for working to help fix the global economy rather than
pursuing a ruinous policy of beggar thy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it offers the hope that hard-pressed countries have
a way out of this fix. That's pretty important in a world that, for
the moment, seems to be out of alternative ideas. &QL;

BRAGGING OF A SNUB FOR `DR. DEATH' 
TRADING TENORS 
PEEKABOO SUITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the anything-for-a-ratings-point world of
television, on-camera personalities often want to spread the word
when they pass up a blockbuster. Consider Oprah Winfrey, who said
that she had turned down a pay-for-chat proposal involving Monica
S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Walters landed the Lewinsky interview with no money
down. But Ms. Walters said no to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who went on to
make a videotape of the death of a Michigan man that was shown on
the CBS News program ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for ABC News, said that a lawyer
for Kevorkian had contacted Ms. Walters last year. But Ms. Murphy
said that Ms. Walters and her bosses decided not to do a Kevorkian
segment on ``20/20,'' which had shown parts of a Dutch documentary
on assisted suicide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision at that time that we would not include
the moment of death,'' she said, ``out of respect for the audience
or the privacy of the person who died.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversations with the lawyer for Kevorkian, Geoffrey
Fieger, ``never went that far along,'' Ms. Murphy said. ``What they
wanted Barbara to do was witness a death and presumably film it.
Her immediate reaction was that was not something she was
interested in doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Trading Tenors
</P>
<P>
   Call it a three-for-three swap. Luciano Pavarotti bowed out of
three performances of ``Tosca'' at the Metropolitan Opera earlier
this month when recuperation from a midsummer hip-replacement
operation took longer than he had expected. Richard Leech was
tapped to fill in for him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Sunday, Pavarotti returned to the Met for a gala
performance that celebrated the 30th anniversary of his Met debut.
It went well, and Tuesday the Met said that Pavarotti, 63, would
sing three performances of ``Tosca'' that Leech had been scheduled
to do in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what it means to the audience to have the experience of
hearing his Cavaradossi in person,'' Leech said, explaining why he
had agreed to step aside in March. ``To be honest, I can't wait to
hear it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Leech's days in ``Tosca'' are not over yet, though. In January
2000, he will sing Cavaradossi in a broadcast performance of
``Tosca.''
</P>
<P>
   Peekaboo Suite
</P>
<P>
   There were few short skirts at the party for Nest magazine at
the Beekman Place town house that belonged to Paul Rudolph until
his death last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph, an architect who embraced modernism in all its
eccentric formulations, was well known in interior-design circles
for see-through Plexiglas floors.
</P>
<P>
   So if a thoughtful partygoer happened to be on one of the lower
floors of the Rudolph house and happened to look up, he or she
might have caught a glimpse of something more than just a plain
white ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But the partygoers on Monday night _ who all behaved and didn't
look up _ had other plans. The group _ which included the hotelier
Andre Balazs, the designer Robert Isabell, the designer Mary
McFadden and a vice president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
Ashton Hawkins _ had gathered to celebrate the third winter issue
of Nest. (Remember Nest? It is an interior design magazine.) But by
Tuesday, it was clear that some of the guests had had something
else in mind: buying the house, which Sotheby's International
Realty has had on the market for $6.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nadine Johnson, who planned the party with Joe Holtzman, Nest's
editor, said she had had two phone calls from interested buyers:
Balazs and Isabell. But Ms. Johnson is a publicity agent, not a
real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   One word of caution to the adventurous buyer: You will get the
see-through floors, but the skylighted Jacuzzi with the clear
bottom has been boarded over.

   How did the global economy get to this pass? More than a year
after the collapse of the Thai baht triggered an avalanche that
buried all of Asia, the International Monetary Fund's program of
huge loans, higher rates, and big cuts to government spending
hasn't stabilized the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   That medicine did indeed stop the feverish descent of Asia's
currencies (particularly the South Korean won, which is worth more
today than it was in January), but overall, the economies of the
region have become sicker, not healthier.
</P>
<P>
   High interest rates, for example, have helped choke off growth.
Indonesia's gross domestic product will fall an estimated 15
percent this year. (For context, Mexico's GDP sank 7 percent in
1995 after the peso crisis.)
</P>
<P>
   And Japan is, even its traditionally optimistic bureaucrats
admit, officially in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Now the IMF is almost out of money. The bankers are so close to
the bottom of the vault that in mid-August they elected not to
throw more cash into Russia. A bailout, the IMF felt, would have
depleted reserves without offering the slightest chance that
Russia's problems would be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Troubled Latin American countries such as Venezuela and Brazil
aren't likely to get a warmer welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The standard remedy for recession is to generate spending,
either by running budget deficits to pay for public works or by
cutting taxes to stimulate private demand.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, that extra money soaks up the supply of unsold goods
and services, stimulates new capital investment, and creates jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But even when governments in Asia have been able to muster the
political will to take these steps, the program hasn't worked.
</P>
<P>
   Asia isn't in the grip of your standard-issue, plain-vanilla
recession. Nope, this is the deluxe model that combines falling
economic activity, constantly shrinking asset values, and a
seemingly endless credit crunch. Efforts to stimulate growth
disappear into these devastated economies without a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, for example, has poured trillions of yen into
infrastructure projects and cut taxes _ albeit timidly _ without
noticeable effect. Consumers are too afraid to spend _ the Japanese
and Koreans are clearly saving more in response to the crisis _ and
who can blame them?
</P>
<P>
   The official unemployment rate in Japan, the land of lifetime
employment, is now at 4.3 percent, and the real rate is probably
closer to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. consumers are spending every dollar they have
and then some. Personal income rose 0.2 percent in June, according
to the Department of Commerce, after an increase of 0.4 percent in
May. Personal expenditures rose 0.6 percent in June, after a 0.9
percent climb in May.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consumers are doing exactly what their counterparts in Asia
aren't willing to do. In June, the U.S. trade deficit with the ten
major Asian nations totaled $15 billion _ that's up more than 40
percent from the deficit in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty clear where at least some of the dollars headed to
Asia are coming from. U.S. consumers are saving less and running up
more debt. In the first quarter of 1998, according to the
Department of Commerce, U.S. consumers saved just 0.6 percent. At
the same time, consumer debt grew at an annual rate of better than
6 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are now paying a record 15 percent of after-tax income
in interest and principal, according to Economic Analysis
Associates of Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   If you judge from those trends, the U.S. consumer sounds pretty
tapped out and poorly cast as the hero who will save the world
economy. But these numbers ignore the ``wealth effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve estimates that since 1994 the stock market
has added $12.5 trillion to the assets of U.S. households. Using
traditional estimates of the way this wealth effect flows from the
financial markets into consumer spending, that asset explosion will
add about $600 billion annually to consumer purchasing power in the
U.s.
</P>
<P>
   That number is both reassuring and scary. Reassuring because it
suggests the United States will be able to continue its role as
consumer of last resort into 1999 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Scary because it suggests that U.S. consumers will play this
role only as long as a buoyant stock market makes them feel
wealthy. No one has any real idea, unfortunately, of how far the
market would have to fall before consumers would stop feeling
wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of buying by U.S. consumers can fix the structural
problems in the Korean, Japanese, or Brazilian economies. But it
can buy time for those economies to right themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It can pump liquidity into cash-starved companies in these
countries. And it can give countries _ China most importantly _ an
incentive for working to help fix the global economy rather than
pursuing a ruinous policy of beggar thy neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, it offers the hope that hard-pressed countries have
a way out of this fix. That's pretty important in a world that, for
the moment, seems to be out of alternative ideas. &QL;

REST OF PRESEASON NIT IS GRAVY FOR THE RED STORM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ind., N.C., Calif.)   (jw) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Jarvis could not be happier. His St. John's team
is playing excellent basketball, and he is about to make his
Madison Square Garden debut in a situation that will almost
certainly work in his club's favor.
</P>
<P>
   In competing in this week's power-packed Chase National
Invitation Tournament, St. John's can go no place but up.
Respectable losses to Stanford, North Carolina or Purdue, all
ranked above No. 23 St. John's, would do nothing to harm the Red
Storm's confidence or march back toward national acclaim. On the
other hand, a victory in the tournament would catapult the Red
Storm into the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we beat Stanford by even a half-point, the nation will take
notice,'' Jarvis quipped Tuesday at a news conference at the
Marriott Marquis hotel.
</P>
<P>
   With four of the top 25, and three of the top 15 teams in
college basketball's sea of parity, the tournament should be
something special.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday night's first game, at 6 p.m., St. John's (3-0)
faces Stanford, which is also 3-0 and ranked third by the
Associated Press poll but first in eight other national polls. No.
9 North Carolina (3-0) and No. 14 Purdue (4-0) will play at 8:30.
The championship game will be Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, with all five starters and 11 lettermen back from last
year's Final Four finisher, is out to show that it can thrive as
something other than the underdog. Led by the senior point guard
Arthur Lee, the 6-foot-8 junior forward Mark Madsen and the 7-1
center Tim Young _ all-America candidates all _ the Cardinal will
be tough for St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   With Young, Madsen and five other players taller than 6-7,
Stanford will have a tremendous size advantage, and Lee and
backcourt mate Kris Weems should be able to handle the Red Storm's
attempt to take advantage of its quickness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wednesday night's game will serve as a solid test for St. John's
rising stars, the sophomore forward Ron Artest and the freshman
point guard Erick Barkley. Artest will face the Cardinal's
physical, fundamentally sound front line, while Barkley will
face-off with Lee.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Purdue are hoping to find their identities.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the all-Americans Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter
to the NBA, North Carolina is being forced to rely on freshmen for
one of the few times in its history. The freshman forwards Jason
Capel and Kris Lang will play significant roles, while the junior
point guard Ed Cota and the senior forward Ademola Okulaja, the
club's only returning starters, provide leadership. Cota, a
Brooklyn native who led the Atlantic Coast Conference in assists
the last two years, is being asked to score for the first time
since high school.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue has solid players in guard Jaraan Cornell and forwards
Brian Cardinal and Mike Robinson but the Boilermakers lack star
power.

   The International Monetary Fund is out of dough. Politicians
from Tokyo to Moscow lack the mandate or the will to fix their
economies. Intervention has failed the central banks and
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   All that now seems to stand between the world and a slide into
global recession are U.S. consumers, armed with wallets full of
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh at this unlikely superhero _ these notoriously
casual savers who already strain under a mountain of debt are
stronger than they look. But don't overestimate what they'll be
able to pull off, either.
</P>
<P>
   At best, U.S. consumers can buy the global economy some time and
prevent a worldwide panic. But they won't be able to stop the Asian
flu from infecting Latin America, and they can't, by themselves,
turn the situation around.

HIS LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Officials are often infuriated by his antics.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably to be expected. UCLA senior linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo looks you square in the eye and says, ``I want to play
on the edge of insanity. I don't want to go overboard. I want to be
right on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   So he negotiates that fine margin, yelling, stomping about,
riotously celebrating his big plays (which have been many this
year), grinding an opponent into the turf until the very instant of
the first whistle _ well, maybe a little bit after.
</P>
<P>
   Last Saturday against USC, a game for which Ayanbadejo's
contributions earned him Pacific-10 defensive player of the week
honors, this exuberance threatened to bubble over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played with so much fire,'' said fellow linebacker Tony
White, ``that the refs were, like, `Calm down, No. 50.' `Blue
captain! Come take your guy, calm him down.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Get a look at Ayanbadejo off the field and this image is only
enhanced. He has a tattoo on each arm and another _ the Egyptian
eye of Horus _ on the back of his skull. He has a pierced nose, a
pierced eyebrow, a pierced nipple. His head is shaven and his chin
bears a 1{-inch tuft of wavy black beard.
</P>
<P>
   When he's angry or there's a USC tailback in front of him _ or
both _ he can deliver a scowl that would buckle your knees.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe more people should see the smile. That big generous
one that he seems to break into the instant he steps off the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm going to be some lunatic or something,''
Ayanbadejo said this week. ``They think, `Oh, you must be some type
of party animal like Dennis Rodman.' . . . They say, `Oh, your face
is so scary sometimes.' They get to know me and they find out quite
the opposite about me.''
</P>
<P>
   At Warner Avenue Elementary School in Westwood, they've seen
this other side. Ayanbadejo volunteers there three times a week,
working with fifth-graders in theater arts. He and other UCLA
students, through a program called Equal Opportunities Production,
help the kids put together all aspects of a live play. Now in the
works: ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him on television,'' said principal Jeff Felz, ``at
first we were almost saying, `Is that our guy?' But in person here
at the school, he is so relaxed and such a sweet guy, if I can use
that term.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayanbadejo, a history major who aspires to teach, was so
unassuming in his approach to this project that he didn't inform
anyone of his athletic fame when he arrived last April to help with
``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids really didn't know him as a football player,'' said
Lynda Edmundson, the teacher of the class. ``They didn't know who
he was. But we had a number of kids who would hang onto him and
think he was really great.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, they know who he is. They watch him on TV. The kids
seem to really like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for Ayanbadejo's jersey number over the weekend
got a tutorial in big-play football. And when he walked in on
Monday, the kids chanted, ``50's in the house!''
</P>
<P>
   In a 34-17 victory over USC, Ayanbadejo sacked quarterback
Carson Palmer four times, had a team-leading nine tackles and also
forced a Chad Morton fumble that set up a UCLA field goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was output the unbeaten Bruins have gotten accustomed to this
season. Ayanbadejo leads the team in sacks (nine) and tackles for
loss (13), making him personally responsible for the opposition
going 156 yards in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of those guys,'' said coach Bob Toledo, ``where he
thinks he's the only guy on the football field on defense, that if
he doesn't make the play, it will be a touchdown or a big play. He
has got to make every play and that's the sign of a great defensive
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the excitability is a direct byproduct of that.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ayanbadejo produced a sack against Arizona, but he
was so intent on rising to celebrate that he didn't realize a
fumble had occurred on the play. The ball was knocking about his
high-stepping knees as his teammates scrambled beneath him to get
it.
</P>
<P>
   A former high school wrestler, he has been known to don a
Spandex outfit and tear around the locker room, looking for players
_ usually freshmen, ``just to humble them a little'' _ to wrestle.
</P>
<P>
   And Toledo raved about the inspiring remarks Ayanbadejo made to
the assembled Bruins the night before the USC game.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I wanted to convey to them was to take advantage of your
time at UCLA,'' the linebacker said, ``and every time go out there
like it's your last game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I was just going to go out there and play wild and go
out with a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins are off this week before concluding their regular
season at Miami on Dec. 5. If they win _ subject to the vagaries of
the Bowl Championship Series rankings _ they could be headed to the
Fiesta Bowl for a shot at the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins reach that game, they might have to chain this guy
up the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Whoops. There are those perceptions again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a normal person and everything, but on the field,
that's the only place I can be on the edge of insanity,''
Ayanbadejo said. ``On the street, I can't go out and start acting
like a nut.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he has never had alcohol. Or cigarettes. Or illegal
drugs. Let the kids at Warner Avenue Elementary get that message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love being around them,'' Ayanbadejo said. ``It brings
me down to earth. I'm in L.A., with the glitz and the glimmer, but
the kids are so innocent and natural. I think it's part of my
spirituality. It brings me back to a sense of who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And buries the impression of what he might appear to be.

   The U.S. Federal Reserve is the most powerful central bank in
the world. It can send stock markets around the world soaring or
crashing with merely a word, and wipe out or create billions of
dollars with a hint. But it cannot fix what ails Japan with any
number of interest-rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That spells continued global economic trouble, since Japan is
the key to ending the economic slump in Asia. But the Fed believes
the current global financial and economic crisis is so serious that
even the recovery of the world's second-largest economy isn't the
most pressing problem of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the dilemma. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues know that Japan is the key to global economic recovery.
But they also know that there's almost nothing they can do in the
short run to pull that country out of its paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Fed has decided to put its muscle to work simply holding
the line in places like Brazil and the U.S. The hope is to prevent
a global recession _ even if that makes problems in Japan more
intractable.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is caught in what's called a liquidity trap, a kind of
economic black hole that shrugs off interest-rate reductions, huge
public-works programs, and even direct infusions of trillions of
yen.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the run-of-the-mill economic slowdown, a country's
government and central bank throw money at the problem. The
government adds to the country's money supply by running a budget
deficit _ funded by printing more dollars or yen or reals _ and
then puts that cash into the hands of businesses, which use it to
build roads or aircraft carriers or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   That creates demand for products from tar to tarmacs and, later,
for tires and shoes when the money trickles down to consumers in
the form of wages.
</P>
<P>
   An interest-rate cut by the central bank has much the same
effect. Lower rates makes it more attractive for banks to borrow
funds from the central bank _ which increases the money supply.
Lower rates encourage companies to borrow and expand and consumers
to put a few more dollars on their credit cards. That increases
demand and keeps the economy humming.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enough foot-dragging and posturing to get any sumo
wrestler booed out of Tokyo, the Japanese government has generally
followed that prescription recently. The government has thrown
trillions of yen into building roads.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent interest-rate cut by the Bank of Japan took the
official number down to a minuscule 0.25 percent: Banks can borrow
for what is effectively nothing. And last year the Bank of Japan
increased the country's money supply by more than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But throwing money at the Japanese economy hasn't worked.
Business investment in the quarter that ran from April to June fell
by 9 percent from the same period a year earlier. The economy,
measured by gross domestic product, shrank by 0.8 percent in the
quarter and shows no signs of bottoming.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening to all the money that's being pumped into the
Japanese economy? It's getting stuffed into mattresses. Consumers,
for example, have increased their savings rate during this
downturn. This is characteristic of a liquidity trap.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers are so scared about the future that they save every
cent they can. Businesses use every cent they can find to pay back
debt, since they worry that lenders will demand their money back
tomorrow. This behavior, of course, creates the very situation
businesses and consumers fear.
</P>
<P>
   The liquidity crunch has virtually paralyzed Japan's banking
system. What does a bank do right now when, thanks to the growth in
the money supply, it gets a credit to its account from the Bank of
Japan? It could make loans or even pay off some debt. Instead, most
Japanese banks are just keeping the money in reserve to meet the
demand for cash by Japanese households.
</P>
<P>
   A cut in U.S. interest rates won't fix Japan's liquidity problem
_ in fact, a cut could actually make it worse.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. interest rates weaken the dollar and increase the
value of the yen, giving Japanese hoarders of yen one more reason
to hold on to their cash. And the Federal Reserve knows a U.S. rate
reduction makes it easier for the Japanese to avoid the painful
fundamental reforms needed to get the Japanese economy started on
the road to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But those are minor issues for a Federal Reserve that is staring
at a global financial and economic crisis. Rate cuts may not help
Japan, but they should prevent the U.S. economy from slowing
further.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cannot take the slightest risk of having the U.S. slide
into recession. The U.S. is one of only two growth engines left in
the world _ and is also the crucial market for the struggling
economies of Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   An interest-rate cut is the Fed's line in the sand _ the
recession stops here.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. interest-rate cut will also increase the pressure on
reluctant European central banks to follow suit. Greenspan would
prefer to make coordinated cuts with the Europeans. The Europeans,
however, have been resisting.
</P>
<P>
   Lower U.S. rates mean a cheaper U.S. dollar against the deutsche
mark, for example, and a more expensive currency spells trouble for
a country such as Germany, which is so heavily dependent on
exporting.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, preoccupied with their monetary union, may still
hold out, but they know the Federal Reserve is willing to act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   There's no guarantee that even rate cuts by the Federal Reserve,
the Bundesbank, and the Bank of England can stop the spread of
crisis. Interest-rate cuts in the U.S. could re-ignite inflation
here and re-inflate the stock market bubble.
</P>
<P>
   If the Federal Reserve moves and the crisis deepens, the bank
will lose crucial psychological capital. But when you run the most
influential central bank in the world, you really don't have the
option of sitting out a crisis like this. &QL;

   The U.S. Federal Reserve is the most powerful central bank in
the world. It can send stock markets around the world soaring or
crashing with merely a word, and wipe out or create billions of
dollars with a hint. But it cannot fix what ails Japan with any
number of interest-rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   That spells continued global economic trouble, since Japan is
the key to ending the economic slump in Asia. But the Fed believes
the current global financial and economic crisis is so serious that
even the recovery of the world's second-largest economy isn't the
most pressing problem of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the dilemma. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan and his

<TEXT>
<P>
   At 9 a.m., Jon Grossman, 43, is sitting behind a rosewood desk,
making weighty decisions about intellectual property, being called
``sir'' by the minions _ fitting for a partner in a major D.C. law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours earlier, Jon Grossman was facedown in the dirt,
doing pushups as a drill instructor called him ``muffin ass.''
</P>
<P>
   The only weighty decision on Grossman's mind was whether he
could lift his sweaty carcass off the ground one more time so Sarge
would move on to torturing Hairy Legs, Ritalin, Honeybaby, or one
of the two dozen other boot campers _ including me _ sprawled
beside him who paid good money to enlist in the Sergeant's Program.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Hell Lite, also known as fitness boot camp for
civilians _ a regimen of outdoor, co-ed stretching, running, and
calisthenics led by former military personnel at an obscenely early
hour of day.
</P>
<P>
   Drill instructors spend three weeks bullying your body into
shape through hand-holding, butt-kicking, name-calling, and
encouragement. Your mission: to be all you used to be. And to pass
a modified military fitness test _ a ten-minute mile, 100 crunches,
50 push-ups, 35 bench dips, and four pull-ups.
</P>
<P>
   If you're among those who graduate (about half do), you move on
to an even more intensive program. If not, you reboot until you
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military drill instructor is the foremost known imposing
presence,'' says the Sarge, owner, instructor, and former naval
petty-officer Patrick Avon. ``And fear is an incredible
motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's motto sums up its philosophy: No music. No
dancing. No mirrors. No machines. No juice bars. No spandex. No
crybabies. No refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Sergeant's Program, which Avon has operated for nine
years in parks around Washington, D.C., is totally unlike joining a
gym or exercise class, where nobody knows if you show up, nobody
watches you work out, and nobody monitors your progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Sergeant's Program, which has about 650 enlistees and 25
instructors, takes its accountability for your body seriously.
Instructors call if you skip class. In fact, whole troops have been
known to show up at homes and offices to drag in MIAs.
</P>
<P>
   Drill instructors tell you how to eat. They show you the right
way to stretch, the right way to breathe when you run, the right
way to do push-ups. They watch you, correct you immediately when
you make mistakes, and they get you to do more than you'd ever do
on your own.
</P>
<P>
   That works for Jack Dolan, 35, a systems engineer from
Gaithersburg, Md. ``If I'm alone, I'll do 100 crunches,'' he says.
``If the instructor's there, he'll push and push and push until I
do 250. He yells at you and says, `Come on, man, you're better than
that!' And he does make you better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the pressure is on and the sweat is pouring, the
Sergeant's Program is also about having fun. Instructors keep
recruits smiling with hijinks, jokes, and plenty of verbal rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The sweaty masses of sleep-deprived survivors bond together,
too, in almost cult-like fashion. They coach one another in class.
Some become golf buddies outside class.
</P>
<P>
   And they learn how to be kids again. ``When children see a mud
puddle, they jump into it,'' says the 36-year-old Avon. ``When
40-year-olds see a mud puddle, they bitch about it. I get the
people who bitch about it and make them want to jump into it.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be in great shape to enlist. (But you will get
a health evaluation. And if you're over 40, you'll need a doctor's
note verifying that all parts are in working order.)
</P>
<P>
   Grossman couldn't do one unassisted pull-up when he started; a
couple of weeks later, he can do three. He used to falter after 40
crunches. Now 200 is no big deal.

   At 9 a.m., Jon Grossman, 43, is sitting behind a rosewood desk,
making weighty decisions about intellectual property, being called
``sir'' by the minions _ fitting for a partner in a major D.C. law
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours earlier, Jon Grossman was facedown in the dirt,
doing pushups as a drill instructor called him ``muffin ass.''
</P>
<P>
   The only weighty decision on Grossman's mind was whether he
could lift his sweaty carcass off the ground one more time so Sarge
would move on to torturing Hairy Legs, Ritalin, Honeybaby, or one
of the two dozen other boot campers _ including me _ sprawled
beside him who paid good money to enlist in the Sergeant's Program.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Hell Lite, also known as fitness boot camp for
civilians _ a regimen of outdoor, co-ed stretching, running, and
calisthenics led by former military personnel at an obscenely early
hour of day.
</P>
<P>
   Drill instructors spend three weeks bullying your body into
shape through hand-holding, butt-kicking, name-calling, and
encouragement. Your mission: to be all you used to be. And to pass
a modified military fitness test _ a ten-minute mile, 100 crunches,
50 push-ups, 35 bench dips, and four pull-ups.
</P>
<P>
   If you're among those who graduate (about half do), you move on
to an even more intensive program. If not, you reboot until you
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military drill instructor is the foremost known imposing
presence,'' says the Sarge, owner, instructor, and former naval
petty-officer Patrick Avon. ``And fear is an incredible
motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   The program's motto sums up its philosophy: No music. No
dancing. No mirrors. No machines. No juice bars. No spandex. No
crybabies. No refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Sergeant's Program, which Avon has operated for nine
years in parks around Washington, D.C., is totally unlike joining a
gym or exercise class, where nobody knows if you show up, nobody
watches you work out, and nobody monitors your progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Sergeant's Program, which has about 650 enlistees and 25
instructors, takes its accountability for your body seriously.
Instructors call if you skip class. In fact, whole troops have been
known to show up at homes and offices to drag in MIAs.
</P>
<P>
   Drill instructors tell you how to eat. They show you the right
way to stretch, the right way to breathe when you run, the right
way to do push-ups. They watch you, correct you immediately when
you make mistakes, and they get you to do more than you'd ever do
on your own.
</P>
<P>
   That works for Jack Dolan, 35, a systems engineer from
Gaithersburg, Md. ``If I'm alone, I'll do 100 crunches,'' he says.
``If the instructor's there, he'll push and push and push until I
do 250. He yells at you and says, `Come on, man, you're better than
that!' And he does make you better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the pressure is on and the sweat is pouring, the
Sergeant's Program is also about having fun. Instructors keep
recruits smiling with hijinks, jokes, and plenty of verbal rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The sweaty masses of sleep-deprived survivors bond together,
too, in almost cult-like fashion. They coach one another in class.
Some become golf buddies outside class.
</P>
<P>
   And they learn how to be kids again. ``When children see a mud
puddle, they jump into it,'' says the 36-year-old Avon. ``When
40-year-olds see a mud puddle, they bitch about it. I get the
people who bitch about it and make them want to jump into it.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be in great shape to enlist. (But you will get
a health evaluation. And if you're over 40, you'll need a doctor's
note verifying that all parts are in working order.)
</P>
<P>
   Grossman couldn't do one unassisted pull-up when he started; a
couple of weeks later, he can do three. He used to falter after 40
crunches. Now 200 is no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Basic training costs $345 for three weeks, five days a week, 45
minutes to an hour a day. (Plus running homework if your instructor
is particularly sadistic.) Maintenance and rebooting costs $80 to
$120 a month, depending on the duration of punishment you sign up
for.
</P>

   Variable annuities were once the hottest thing going in the
investment business. Despite the horrible battering they've
received in the press, they sold like crazy even last year _ a
whopping $87.8 billion worth, up almost 18 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news. The 1997 tax law cut capital-gains tax
rates on long-term investments to as low as 10 percent and left
ordinary income-tax rates the same. This made mutual funds more
attractive, since the income from an annuity isn't considered a
capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of variable annuities fell 2.6 percent in the first
quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises the question: Do variable annuities make sense
for anyone anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A variable annuity is essentially a mutual fund in a
life-insurance wrapper. You pay a lump sum up front or structure a
series of investments as you see fit; money can be put into stocks,
bonds, or mutual funds (each vehicle is known as a sub-account).
You then set up a series of payouts, usually to start at a
specified later date.
</P>
<P>
   Your assets are guaranteed by a death benefit _ if you die
before collecting all of your money, your estate will receive at
least as much as the initial cost of the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Your returns are not guaranteed (hence ``variable'' versus
``fixed'' annuities), but you are allowed considerable freedom to
select where the money goes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a mutual fund, which incurs capital-gains taxes each
year, a variable annuity allows you to invest tax-deferred _
meaning you put funds into one now and pay income taxes later as
you receive the money. You can also transfer money from sub-account
to sub-account without creating a taxable event.
</P>
<P>
   To help spur sales, the variable-annuity industry has made moves
over the past year or so to cut its charges and fees.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Mutual Life introduced its MarketPlace Variable
Annuity, which has lower mortality fees and no surrender charges.
Mortality expenses often run about 1 to 1.5 percent of the annual
value of the policy and pay for the guaranteed death benefit;
MarketPlace's mortality fees are just 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of surrender charges means that buyers no longer have
to pay hefty fees to withdraw their money early, though other
expenses still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, USAA, and Vanguard have also lowered their mortality
expenses. Variable Annuity Research and Data Service (based in
Marietta, Ga.) expects sales of variable annuities to increase this
year by 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these positive steps, most people still should not buy a
variable annuity as an investment or an insurance vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Their fees are too high _ 2.09 percent a year on average, more
than 40 percent higher than the fees on the average mutual fund.
And the insurance coverage is negligible _ you have to die while
the account value is underwater for the death benefit to be
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tax-deferred aspect entices the uninformed. ``People
have such an aversion to taxes that they will buy anything,
including variable annuities,'' says Meir Statman, a finance
professor at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif., who
studies investor behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``How useful will they be? Who knows! It depends on your
situation when you cash it out.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 550. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Here are five scenarios that might help to make sense out of
variable annuities:
</P>
<P>
   1) YOU'VE HIT THE LIMIT ON RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS. Investing
in a variable annuity is a great way to stash cash tax-deferred if
you're investing the maximum in your IRA and your 401(k) or Keogh
plan. If this is the case, make sure the next scenario also applies
to you.
</P>
<P>
   2) YOU HAVE AN EXTREMELY LONG INVESTMENT TIME HORIZON. Don't
think you can tap the kitty for a rainy day, like paying for your
child's college education, buying a second home, or purchasing a
Jaguar. The typical surrender charge is steep _ 7 percent if you
cash out in the first year, declining a percentage point every year
until it gets to zero by the seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   If you bail out before you're 59 and a half, you'll also have to
pay a 10 percent tax penalty. Figuring in all the fees, the
break-even point for a variable annuity with respect to a mutual
fund used to be seven to ten years. With the 1997 tax law, it's now
more like 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   So plan on holding on for 20 to 25 years, says Lynn Hopewell, a
financial planner in Fairfax, Va. ``It takes a long time to make it
pay off,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   3) YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED THE INCOME IN RETIREMENT. Have you
lived the high life? Sent your kids to private schools? Taken fancy
vacations? Bought expensive toys? Haven't stashed away enough money
for retirement? Then you may need those monthly annuity payouts
later. Buy a deferred annuity now, which pays off down the road a
ways, and switch in retirement to an immediate annuity, which
starts paying instantly. But remember: The monthly income payment
you receive will fluctuate with the value of the underlying fund.
</P>
<P>
   4) YOU'RE FIFTYSOMETHING AND SINGLE WITH NO DEPENDENTS, OR YOUR
SPOUSE OR HEIRS DON'T DEPEND ON YOU FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. Peter
Katt, a life-insurance advisor in Kalamazoo, Mich., likes to give
the example of Maxine Potter, a fictitious college professor who's
making good money from two books she has written.
</P>
<P>
   A widow with no children, she wants to retire early and buy a
house in Tucson, Ariz., so she can golf all year. So, starting at
age 53, she plows $1,200 a month in extra income into a deferred
variable annuity and then at 62 transfers it to an immediate
variable annuity, which sends her a check every month _ for life.
``That way, she's maximizing her income for when she needs it
later,'' Katt says.
</P>
<P>
   5) YOU MIGHT BE SUED OR HAVE TO FILE FOR PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY.
This is an extreme case, of course. But many states, including New
York, Florida, and Texas, protect some assets in variable annuities
from creditors. Doctors susceptible to malpractice lawsuits, take
heed and see your attorney.
</P>
<P>
   If any of these cases applies to you and you decide to buy a
variable annuity, then shop around. Many companies offer no-load _
i.e., no sales commission _ variable annuities with zero surrender
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best-performing: Janus Retirement Advantage, Vanguard
Variable Annuity Plan, and Ameritas No-Load Variable Annuity. Also,
respected teachers' pension-fund system TIAA-CREF plans to offer a
no-load variable annuity to the general public next year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, do some homework. Morningstar (800-735-0700), the
Chicago-based research firm, can give you an independent appraisal
of a company's financial strength, charges, and fees. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Your assets are guaranteed by a death benefit _ if you die
before collecting all of your money, your estate will receive at
least as much as the initial cost of the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Your returns are not guaranteed (hence ``variable'' versus
``fixed'' annuities), but you are allowed considerable freedom to
select where the money goes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a mutual fund, which incurs capital-gains taxes each
year, a variable annuity allows you to invest tax-deferred _
meaning you put funds into one now and pay income taxes later as
you receive the money. You can also transfer money from sub-account
to sub-account without creating a taxable event.
</P>
<P>
   To help spur sales, the variable-annuity industry has made moves
over the past year or so to cut its charges and fees.
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Mutual Life introduced its MarketPlace Variable
Annuity, which has lower mortality fees and no surrender charges.
Mortality expenses often run about 1 to 1.5 percent of the annual
value of the policy and pay for the guaranteed death benefit;
MarketPlace's mortality fees are just 0.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of surrender charges means that buyers no longer have
to pay hefty fees to withdraw their money early, though other
expenses still apply.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, USAA, and Vanguard have also lowered their mortality
expenses. Variable Annuity Research and Data Service (based in
Marietta, Ga.) expects sales of variable annuities to increase this
year by 10 to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these positive steps, most people still should not buy a
variable annuity as an investment or an insurance vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Their fees are too high _ 2.09 percent a year on average, more
than 40 percent higher than the fees on the average mutual fund.
And the insurance coverage is negligible _ you have to die while
the account value is underwater for the death benefit to be
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tax-deferred aspect entices the uninformed. ``People
have such an aversion to taxes that they will buy anything,
including variable annuities,'' says Meir Statman, a finance
professor at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif., who
studies investor behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``How useful will they be? Who knows! It depends on your
situation when you cash it out.'' &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Here are five scenarios that might help to make sense out of
variable annuities:
</P>
<P>
   1) YOU'VE HIT THE LIMIT ON RETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS. Investing
in a variable annuity is a great way to stash cash tax-deferred if
you're investing the maximum in your IRA and your 401(k) or Keogh
plan. If this is the case, make sure the next scenario also applies
to you.
</P>
<P>
   2) YOU HAVE AN EXTREMELY LONG INVESTMENT TIME HORIZON. Don't
think you can tap the kitty for a rainy day, like paying for your
child's college education, buying a second home, or purchasing a
Jaguar. The typical surrender charge is steep _ 7 percent if you
cash out in the first year, declining a percentage point every year
until it gets to zero by the seventh year.
</P>
<P>
   If you bail out before you're 59 and a half, you'll also have to
pay a 10 percent tax penalty. Figuring in all the fees, the
break-even point for a variable annuity with respect to a mutual
fund used to be seven to ten years. With the 1997 tax law, it's now
more like 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   So plan on holding on for 20 to 25 years, says Lynn Hopewell, a
financial planner in Fairfax, Va. ``It takes a long time to make it
pay off,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   3) YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED THE INCOME IN RETIREMENT. Have you
lived the high life? Sent your kids to private schools? Taken fancy
vacations? Bought expensive toys? Haven't stashed away enough money
for retirement? Then you may need those monthly annuity payouts
later. Buy a deferred annuity now, which pays off down the road a
ways, and switch in retirement to an immediate annuity, which
starts paying instantly. But remember: The monthly income payment
you receive will fluctuate with the value of the underlying fund.
</P>
<P>
   4) YOU'RE FIFTYSOMETHING AND SINGLE WITH NO DEPENDENTS, OR YOUR
SPOUSE OR HEIRS DON'T DEPEND ON YOU FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. Peter
Katt, a life-insurance advisor in Kalamazoo, Mich., likes to give
the example of Maxine Potter, a fictitious college professor who's
making good money from two books she has written.
</P>
<P>
   A widow with no children, she wants to retire early and buy a
house in Tucson, Ariz., so she can golf all year. So, starting at
age 53, she plows $1,200 a month in extra income into a deferred
variable annuity and then at 62 transfers it to an immediate
variable annuity, which sends her a check every month _ for life.
``That way, she's maximizing her income for when she needs it
later,'' Katt says.
</P>
<P>
   5) YOU MIGHT BE SUED OR HAVE TO FILE FOR PERSONAL BANKRUPTCY.
This is an extreme case, of course. But many states, including New
York, Florida, and Texas, protect some assets in variable annuities
from creditors. Doctors susceptible to malpractice lawsuits, take
heed and see your attorney.
</P>
<P>
   If any of these cases applies to you and you decide to buy a
variable annuity, then shop around. Many companies offer no-load _
i.e., no sales commission _ variable annuities with zero surrender
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best-performing: Janus Retirement Advantage, Vanguard
Variable Annuity Plan, and Ameritas No-Load Variable Annuity. Also,
respected teachers' pension-fund system TIAA-CREF plans to offer a
no-load variable annuity to the general public next year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, do some homework. Morningstar (800-735-0700), the
Chicago-based research firm, can give you an independent appraisal
of a company's financial strength, charges, and fees. &QL;

<P>
   Variable annuities were once the hottest thing going in the
investment business. Despite the horrible battering they've
received in the press, they sold like crazy even last year _ a
whopping $87.8 billion worth, up almost 18 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news. The 1997 tax law cut capital-gains tax
rates on long-term investments to as low as 10 percent and left
ordinary income-tax rates the same. This made mutual funds more
attractive, since the income from an annuity isn't considered a
capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of variable annuities fell 2.6 percent in the first
quarter of 1998 compared with the fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises the question: Do variable annuities make sense
for anyone anymore?
</P>
<P>
   A variable annuity is essentially a mutual fund in a
life-insurance wrapper. You pay a lump sum up front or structure a
series of investments as you see fit; money can be put into stocks,
bonds, or mutual funds (each vehicle is known as a sub-account).
You then set up a series of payouts, usually to start at a
specified later date.
</P>
<P>
   Your assets are guaranteed by a death benefit _ if you die
before collecting all of your money, your estate will receive at
least as much as the initial cost of the annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Your returns are not guaranteed (hence ``variable'' versus
``fixed'' annuities), but you are allowed considerable freedom to

to sub-account without creating a taxable event.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As New York City's largest used-book seller, Strand, at the
corner of 12th Street and Broadway, is a place where Manhattanites
go to browse through treasures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few flights up in the same building, however, the
employees of Wit Capital have their attention fixed almost entirely
on the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wit, a registered broker-dealer, is a pioneer in the use of the
Internet to trade stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike online brokerages, which communicate with customers via
the Net but execute trades on the traditional exchanges, Wit is
attempting to create a whole new way for companies to sell stock to
investors and for investors to buy and sell directly with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by 37-year-old Andrew Klein, Wit was little known on
Wall Street when it opened for business in September 1997. That
changed abruptly last spring, when Robert Lessin, one of Wall
Street's best-connected mergers-and-acquisitions bankers, left his
position as vice-chairman of Salomon Smith Barney to become Wit's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, other topflight investment-banking pros, including
Matthew Carbone from Salomon and William Tkacs from Cowen &AMP; Co.,
joined the 43-year-old Lessin.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ronald Readmond, formerly vice-chairman of Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co., announced that he was signing on as Wit's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   What drew the likes of Lessin and Readmond to Wit was nothing
less than an opportunity to revolutionize the process of capital
formation _ or, as Lessin puts it, to ``democratize'' Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to the extent that Wit or some other organization like
it one day succeeds, Wall Street's role as a middleman between the
owners and users of capital could be profoundly altered _ and
perhaps sharply diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within ten years I think we'll see the death of the floor on
the New York Stock Exchange and possibly the end of open-outcry
trading,'' says Bill Burnham, the senior analyst of electronic
commerce at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be fewer exchanges globally, and individual retail
investors will have access to 24-hour trading worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street isn't exactly quaking in its boots just yet, and
Wit, for its part, has a long row to hoe just to survive as a
business, let alone threaten the established positions of the major
Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Its true significance at the moment is as a harbinger of the
upheaval that lies ahead for the Street. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will make such dramatic change possible (and
inevitable) because it is the first medium capable of creating a
public market _ an electronic version of a trading pit or stock
exchange, where multiple participants can get together to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wit founder Klein was among the first to recognize this. As a
young securities lawyer for Cravath, Swaine and Moore in New York
in the late 1980s, he was exposed to the huge fees that Wall Street
firms command _ particularly the sums spent as companies attempted
to raise capital through initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Klein resigned his lucrative job at Cravath to start a
microbrewery. Two years later, he took Spring Street Brewing public
in the first Internet-based IPO, raising $1.6 million for Spring
Street _ without any help from investment bankers _ from 3,500
individual investors. Many were fans of Wit beer, a spicy, cloudy
concoction akin to Belgian wheat beer.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Klein launched the first Web-based trading
mechanism that enabled investors to buy and sell Spring Street
shares. A month later, he formed Wit Capital, borrowing the name _
and distinctive red exclamation-mark logo _ from the beer.
</P>
<P>
   His goal for Wit: ``To include individual investors in the
capital-raising process and create a better way for people to buy
and sell stocks,'' he says. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though little more than a year old, Wit has already participated
in more than 30 IPOs of common stock. It also recently won its
first assignment as an ``e-manager'' _ a term Klein coined to
describe Wit's role as the co-manager charged with distributing an
allotment of IPO stock through the electronic-brokerage community. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings have long been a source of frustration
to individual investors because Wall Street firms have
traditionally used their clout to reward only their favored
customers with allocations of new shares.
</P>
<P>
   Lessin notes, for example, that this was a common practice at
his former firm, Salomon Smith Barney, which reserved only a tiny
percentage of shares for the firm's retail customers _ even though
a retail broker at Solomon might have as much as $60 million under
management.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when Wit co-manages an initial public offering, it
offers shares on a first-come, first-served basis both to its
clients and to those of other online brokers that join its
electronic syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Lessin and Klein also say that, by reducing underwriting fees
and broadening the base of prospective customers, Wit's process
provides a better deal for corporations issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
   As Klein learned when he took Spring Street public, the Internet
can be used to identify buyers who are more likely to feel some
loyalty to the issuing company and view their purchase as a
long-term investment, as opposed to an opportunity to make a quick
buck by flipping the stock (reselling it quickly on the open
market). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, Wit's success will hinge to a large degree
on its ability to deliver as an e-manager. It received a major vote
of confidence in August when EarthWeb, the Internet-based
online-services provider, agreed to place Wit smack alongside
bulge-bracket underwriters J.P. Morgan and Bear Stearns as a
co-manager of its initial stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   To win many more such assignments, Wit still needs to persuade
other online brokerage firms to join its e-syndicate. As of
September 1, it had reached agreements with Quick &AMP; Reilly,
Suretrade, Datek Online, and Wall Street Access.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and E*Trade may prove more difficult to
crack because they already offer customers at least some access to
IPOs through relationships with more traditional investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   An equally important test of Wit's business strategy is just
beginning as the company unveils its next, and by far its most
ambitious, project _ the Digital Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   The DSM is a sophisticated Internet-based trading system
designed to allow individual investors to negotiate directly with
one another and buy and sell stocks within listed bid-asked spreads
in much the same way that institutional investors have long been
able to do.
</P>
<P>
   The concept itself is simple. DSM lets investors call up an
order book that includes the official bid and asked prices, as well
as indications from other investors who want to buy or sell a given
number of shares at various price points in between. Investors can
accept one of the existing orders, enter a new order, or try to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Wit modeled this system after the private
electronic-communications networks _ such as Instinct _ that
institutional investors, dealers, and market makers have long used
to trade stocks with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should like the look and feel of the Digital Stock
Market, but a larger question is whether it will be able to attract
the order flow that markets need to run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Atkin, president and CEO of Instinct, has seen other
technically advanced trading systems disappear into obscurity for
this very reason. ``Building the technology is only a quarter of
the battle,'' he says. Retail investors, says Atkin, want to know
that when it's time to sell there will be buyers ready and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   To provide that assurance, Wit, which has only 7,500
active-brokerage accounts of its own, is looking to broaden its
base of potential buyers and sellers by forming partnerships with
other firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is in talks with a number of electronic brokers, hoping to
entice them to use its Digital Stock Market by agreeing either to
split fees or to share equity stakes in the new market.
</P>
<P>
   One firm unlikely to participate: Datek Online, which already
operates a small-scale trading network for Nasdaq stocks, called
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Klein and Lessin have high hopes for the Digital Stock Market.
Even if it fails, they believe the paradigm shift that has already
begun in the capital-raising process is unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   As capitalists, they would like to cash in on this change as
well _ and perhaps if they succeed, they'll one day find their
story told in a book on sale downstairs at Strand. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   As New York City's largest used-book seller, Strand, at the
corner of 12th Street and Broadway, is a place where Manhattanites
go to browse through treasures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few flights up in the same building, however, the
employees of Wit Capital have their attention fixed almost entirely
on the future.
</P>
<P>
   Wit, a registered broker-dealer, is a pioneer in the use of the
Internet to trade stock.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike online brokerages, which communicate with customers via
the Net but execute trades on the traditional exchanges, Wit is
attempting to create a whole new way for companies to sell stock to
investors and for investors to buy and sell directly with one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Founded by 37-year-old Andrew Klein, Wit was little known on
Wall Street when it opened for business in September 1997. That
changed abruptly last spring, when Robert Lessin, one of Wall
Street's best-connected mergers-and-acquisitions bankers, left his
position as vice-chairman of Salomon Smith Barney to become Wit's
chairman and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, other topflight investment-banking pros, including
Matthew Carbone from Salomon and William Tkacs from Cowen &AMP; Co.,
joined the 43-year-old Lessin.
</P>
<P>
   Then Ronald Readmond, formerly vice-chairman of Charles Schwab &AMP;
Co., announced that he was signing on as Wit's president and chief
operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   What drew the likes of Lessin and Readmond to Wit was nothing
less than an opportunity to revolutionize the process of capital
formation _ or, as Lessin puts it, to ``democratize'' Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to the extent that Wit or some other organization like
it one day succeeds, Wall Street's role as a middleman between the
owners and users of capital could be profoundly altered _ and
perhaps sharply diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within ten years I think we'll see the death of the floor on
the New York Stock Exchange and possibly the end of open-outcry
trading,'' says Bill Burnham, the senior analyst of electronic
commerce at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be fewer exchanges globally, and individual retail
investors will have access to 24-hour trading worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street isn't exactly quaking in its boots just yet, and
Wit, for its part, has a long row to hoe just to survive as a
business, let alone threaten the established positions of the major
Wall Street firms.
</P>
<P>
   Its true significance at the moment is as a harbinger of the
upheaval that lies ahead for the Street. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet will make such dramatic change possible (and
inevitable) because it is the first medium capable of creating a
public market _ an electronic version of a trading pit or stock
exchange, where multiple participants can get together to trade.
</P>
<P>
   Wit founder Klein was among the first to recognize this. As a
young securities lawyer for Cravath, Swaine and Moore in New York
in the late 1980s, he was exposed to the huge fees that Wall Street
firms command _ particularly the sums spent as companies attempted
to raise capital through initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Klein resigned his lucrative job at Cravath to start a
microbrewery. Two years later, he took Spring Street Brewing public
in the first Internet-based IPO, raising $1.6 million for Spring
Street _ without any help from investment bankers _ from 3,500
individual investors. Many were fans of Wit beer, a spicy, cloudy
concoction akin to Belgian wheat beer.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Klein launched the first Web-based trading
mechanism that enabled investors to buy and sell Spring Street
shares. A month later, he formed Wit Capital, borrowing the name _
and distinctive red exclamation-mark logo _ from the beer.
</P>
<P>
   His goal for Wit: ``To include individual investors in the
capital-raising process and create a better way for people to buy
and sell stocks,'' he says. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though little more than a year old, Wit has already participated
in more than 30 IPOs of common stock. It also recently won its
first assignment as an ``e-manager'' _ a term Klein coined to
describe Wit's role as the co-manager charged with distributing an
allotment of IPO stock through the electronic-brokerage community. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initial public offerings have long been a source of frustration
to individual investors because Wall Street firms have
traditionally used their clout to reward only their favored
customers with allocations of new shares.
</P>
<P>
   Lessin notes, for example, that this was a common practice at
his former firm, Salomon Smith Barney, which reserved only a tiny
percentage of shares for the firm's retail customers _ even though
a retail broker at Solomon might have as much as $60 million under
management.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, when Wit co-manages an initial public offering, it
offers shares on a first-come, first-served basis both to its
clients and to those of other online brokers that join its
electronic syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   Lessin and Klein also say that, by reducing underwriting fees
and broadening the base of prospective customers, Wit's process
provides a better deal for corporations issuing stock.
</P>
<P>
   As Klein learned when he took Spring Street public, the Internet
can be used to identify buyers who are more likely to feel some
loyalty to the issuing company and view their purchase as a
long-term investment, as opposed to an opportunity to make a quick
buck by flipping the stock (reselling it quickly on the open
market). &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, Wit's success will hinge to a large degree
on its ability to deliver as an e-manager. It received a major vote
of confidence in August when EarthWeb, the Internet-based
online-services provider, agreed to place Wit smack alongside
bulge-bracket underwriters J.P. Morgan and Bear Stearns as a
co-manager of its initial stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   To win many more such assignments, Wit still needs to persuade
other online brokerage firms to join its e-syndicate. As of
September 1, it had reached agreements with Quick &AMP; Reilly,
Suretrade, Datek Online, and Wall Street Access.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. and E*Trade may prove more difficult to
crack because they already offer customers at least some access to
IPOs through relationships with more traditional investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   An equally important test of Wit's business strategy is just
beginning as the company unveils its next, and by far its most
ambitious, project _ the Digital Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   The DSM is a sophisticated Internet-based trading system
designed to allow individual investors to negotiate directly with
one another and buy and sell stocks within listed bid-asked spreads
in much the same way that institutional investors have long been
able to do.
</P>
<P>
   The concept itself is simple. DSM lets investors call up an
order book that includes the official bid and asked prices, as well
as indications from other investors who want to buy or sell a given
number of shares at various price points in between. Investors can
accept one of the existing orders, enter a new order, or try to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Wit modeled this system after the private
electronic-communications networks _ such as Instinct _ that
institutional investors, dealers, and market makers have long used
to trade stocks with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should like the look and feel of the Digital Stock
Market, but a larger question is whether it will be able to attract
the order flow that markets need to run smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Atkin, president and CEO of Instinct, has seen other
technically advanced trading systems disappear into obscurity for
this very reason. ``Building the technology is only a quarter of
the battle,'' he says. Retail investors, says Atkin, want to know
that when it's time to sell there will be buyers ready and waiting.
</P>
<P>
   To provide that assurance, Wit, which has only 7,500
active-brokerage accounts of its own, is looking to broaden its
base of potential buyers and sellers by forming partnerships with
other firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is in talks with a number of electronic brokers, hoping to
entice them to use its Digital Stock Market by agreeing either to
split fees or to share equity stakes in the new market.
</P>
<P>
   One firm unlikely to participate: Datek Online, which already
operates a small-scale trading network for Nasdaq stocks, called
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Klein and Lessin have high hopes for the Digital Stock Market.
Even if it fails, they believe the paradigm shift that has already
begun in the capital-raising process is unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   As capitalists, they would like to cash in on this change as
well _ and perhaps if they succeed, they'll one day find their
story told in a book on sale downstairs at Strand. &QL;

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ Hitler's Alpine retreat, from where he plotted the
invasion of the Soviet Union, is to become a Shangri-la for rich
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bavarian government has announced plans to build a 200-room
luxury hotel and spa complex on the majestic slope of the
Obersalzberg, crowned with the mountaintop cafe formerly known as
the ``Eagle's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years the government in Munich has been looking for a
private investor to develop the precious 260-acre site, but its
searches have proved only half successful. The enterprising new
lease-holder is the semi-public Bayerische Landesbank, whose
subsidiary will be spending DM70 million on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies remain unconvinced of the Obersalzberg's
tourist potential. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the
location. On a clear day the view over the mountain ranges of
southern Bavaria and northwest Austria is magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   But the tranquility sought by the Fuhrer as he pored over battle
charts is no longer there. Despite the hotel's remoteness, guests
will find it difficult to get away from the maddening crowds,
especially of the neo-Nazi variety.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the U.S. Army moved out in 1995, the peak has been
attracting shaven-headed pilgrims, who climb the summit in search
of memories of wartime glory or Nazi memorabilia. There is a
special gathering every year on April 20, Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Obersalzberg was nothing more than Hitler's summer
residence. He received many foreign visitors there, notably Neville
Chamberlain and Benito Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   But since he hated Berlin, the Fuhrer spent as much time
communing with Alpine nature as he could. His most important aides,
including Martin Bormann, Hermann Goering and Albert Speer, had to
get chalets in the neighborhood to be close to their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Second World War was planned from the biggest chalet
of them all, the Berghof.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the war the Berghof and most of the other
Nazi residences were destroyed by allied bombers. In 1952, the
ruins were blown up on the orders of the Bavarian government.
Hitler's guest house was taken over by the U.S. army, and used as a
resort. Three years ago, the Americans pulled out, handing the
property back to the Bavarians.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plans unveiled Friday, the guest house will be
demolished, and in its place will the new hotel be built. The
project has attracted a great deal of controversy, with one Jewish
group describing it as a ``shameful concept.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter criticism that it is insensitive to the past, the
Bavarian government is also erecting a historical documentation
center on the summit. This will focus on the rise of the Nazi party
and Hitler's reign of terror. Other sections will show Hitler's
early connections with the Alps, and the history of the mountain up
until the American retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The museum should be completed by the middle of next year. The
hotel will not be ready until 2002. &QL;

   BONN _ Hitler's Alpine retreat, from where he plotted the
invasion of the Soviet Union, is to become a Shangri-la for rich
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The Bavarian government has announced plans to build a 200-room
luxury hotel and spa complex on the majestic slope of the
Obersalzberg, crowned with the mountaintop cafe formerly known as
the ``Eagle's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   For three years the government in Munich has been looking for a
private investor to develop the precious 260-acre site, but its
searches have proved only half successful. The enterprising new
lease-holder is the semi-public Bayerische Landesbank, whose
subsidiary will be spending DM70 million on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies remain unconvinced of the Obersalzberg's
tourist potential. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the
location. On a clear day the view over the mountain ranges of
southern Bavaria and northwest Austria is magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   But the tranquility sought by the Fuhrer as he pored over battle
charts is no longer there. Despite the hotel's remoteness, guests
will find it difficult to get away from the maddening crowds,
especially of the neo-Nazi variety.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the U.S. Army moved out in 1995, the peak has been
attracting shaven-headed pilgrims, who climb the summit in search
of memories of wartime glory or Nazi memorabilia. There is a
special gathering every year on April 20, Hitler's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Obersalzberg was nothing more than Hitler's summer
residence. He received many foreign visitors there, notably Neville
Chamberlain and Benito Mussolini.
</P>
<P>
   But since he hated Berlin, the Fuhrer spent as much time
communing with Alpine nature as he could. His most important aides,
including Martin Bormann, Hermann Goering and Albert Speer, had to
get chalets in the neighborhood to be close to their leader.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Second World War was planned from the biggest chalet
of them all, the Berghof.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the war the Berghof and most of the other
Nazi residences were destroyed by allied bombers. In 1952, the
ruins were blown up on the orders of the Bavarian government.
Hitler's guest house was taken over by the U.S. army, and used as a
resort. Three years ago, the Americans pulled out, handing the
property back to the Bavarians.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plans unveiled Friday, the guest house will be
demolished, and in its place will the new hotel be built. The
project has attracted a great deal of controversy, with one Jewish
group describing it as a ``shameful concept.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter criticism that it is insensitive to the past, the
Bavarian government is also erecting a historical documentation
center on the summit. This will focus on the rise of the Nazi party
and Hitler's reign of terror. Other sections will show Hitler's
early connections with the Alps, and the history of the mountain up
until the American retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The museum should be completed by the middle of next year. The
hotel will not be ready until 2002. &QL;

<P>
   The possibility that babies with defects might be cured inside
the womb came a step nearer Friday with the announcement that
doctors in America had successfully performed fetal surgery on a
boy with spina bifida.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Kipfmiller, now aged six months, is doing well after the
groundbreaking operation, carried out when he was a 23-week-old
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the treatment will bring hope to other parents
whose babies are shown to have defects during screening early in
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The world's first operation on a fetus was carried out at Guy's
Hospital in London five years ago, when surgeons used a fine needle
to clear a blockage in the heart. A handful of similar operations
has been carried out in Britain since but much of the experimental
work is now conducted in America.
</P>
<P>
   The operation on Noah was much more complex, involving closing
the spine in the middle of the back where the skin and bone had
failed to form, leaving the spinal cord exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Spinal bifida is a congenital defect that varies in severity and
children born with it may be paralyzed and suffer hydrocephalus
(water on the brain), which can cause brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Scott Adzick, the surgeon who led the research team at
the Children's Hospital, Philadelphia, said the child's mother,
aged 27, and father had refused the offer of an abortion. ``They
were going to take care of the child either way so they decided to
give the baby the best possible chance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The operation involved lifting the mother's womb through an
incision in her abdomen, and opening it so that the baby's back was
exposed. Skin taken from its back was grafted over the exposed
spinal cord to protect it and a drainage tube fitted to remove
fluid accumulating in the skull.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons then replaced the amniotic fluid with a solution,
put the womb back and sewed up the woman's abdomen. The baby was
born seven weeks later by Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to gauge whether the boy will have a limp
but he has been spared the worst effects of the condition. He has a
slight abnormality in his left foot and a right club foot, which
can be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Adzick, who describes the case in The Lancet, said:
``He is a very nice baby. The orthopedic specialists are looking
after him and he has an exercise program. We are pleased with the
way he is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Professor Adzick has previously operated on a fetus who was
found to have a benign tumor growing in his chest that threatened
to obstruct the normal development of his lungs.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to correcting birth defects that would cause
paralysis or death if left until after birth, fetal surgery offers
other potential benefits. Incisions heal without scarring and
researchers believe transplants carried out while the immune system
is still immature may overcome the problem of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   However, the developments raise acute ethical difficulties.
Transplants would involve using organs from aborted fetuses, which
might have to be kept alive until the organs were at the right
stage of development to make them suitable for transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Public disquiet at the prospect of ``farmed fetuses'' makes the
introduction of such transplants unlikely. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Here is the joke going the rounds of the French National
Assembly. ``Q: How can you tell that Daniel Cohn-Bendit is German?
A: He invades France every 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny the Red is back, and this time he is Green.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years after leading the French student revolt of May
1968, Cohn-Bendit has become a mainstream French politician, even
though he is not French. He will head the list of the main French
Green party, Les Verts, in the European Parliament elections next
June.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, the born troublemaker, the
eternal boy, has become almost the first truly European politician,
able to operate successfully in two EU countries.
</P>
<P>
   He sits at present in the European Parliament as a member of the
German green party, the Grunen. His close friend and one-time
revolutionary disciple, Joschka Fischer, is foreign minister in the
pink-green coalition running Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit, 53, cannot claim to be the first pan-European
politician because there is one rather perverse precedent. The late
Sir James Goldsmith bankrolled two viscerally anti-European
political movements and stood for election in both Britain and
France. How successful he was is a matter of opinion.
</P>
<P>
   How successful will Cohn-Bendit be? Judging by his first week in
the job, very successful, very entertaining _ and very destructive.
</P>
<P>
   In the space of a few days, the youthful revolutionary turned
middle-aged European federalist and ecologist has caused huge
problems within the pink-red-green coalition running France.
</P>
<P>
   He has infuriated the Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin,
by throwing salt in the wound of the one issue most calculated to
divide the French left: illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit called in his acceptance speech before the Green
conference for all illegal immigrants to be legalized. Worse, he
said that such a grand gesture would help Jospin win the
presidential election in 2002, another taboo subject for the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, annoy the prime minister? Nooooo,'' Cohn-Bendit said
afterwards, opening wide his big boyish, mischievous blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As energetic, eloquent and hirsute as ever, he has also
infuriated the Communists, who remember the embarrassment he caused
them in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit has set a target of making the Greens the second
party of the French left, overtaking the ``fuddy-duddy'' Parti
Communiste. He tried to soothe the Communists last week by
describing their dull, gnome-like leader, Robert Hue, as
``obviously not a Stalinist.'' Somehow this did not help.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit is also far from universally loved within the French
green movement. There is residual jealousy that such a ``German
cuckoo,'' as one green activist described him, should take the top
place on their European election list, pontificating about ``my
ideas'' rather than ``our ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel claims a ``double identity.'' He is German, but feels
French. His parents fled Nazi Germany in 1933, and he was born at
Montauban, just north of Toulouse in the French southwest.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, to his great grief at the time, returned to Germany
in 1957, when he was 12. He insisted on returning to France to
study when he left school, with consequences which briefly shook
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit was expelled from France after the events of May
1968. He became a German revolutionary, a kindergarten teacher,
then a local politician in Frankfurt in the 1980s before emerging
as a green and extreme European federalist in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He is able to run for election in France because the Maastricht
treaty allows any EU citizen to stand in any EU country in European
or local elections.
</P>
<P>
   He remains an engaging, playful figure, capable of generating
great emotion, but also mocking himself. Until his return to
France, he played football in a Frankfurt park with his friends
every Sunday, wearing a shirt carrying the number 68.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn-Bendit now describes his revolutionary ideas of the 1960s
as a mistake. He emigrated late, following many left-wingers of his
generation, into the ecological movement. But he was always
regarded as an awkwardly internationalist figure by the
inward-looking German greens. He argued for German military action
against the Serbs in Bosnia, and for wholesale support of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   His present position is an unusual mixture of European
federalism, standard leftism and libertarianism: in favor of much
greater power for Brussels; against nuclear energy; in favor of
more government intervention to create jobs; for the legalization
of soft drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Such views cut a jagged line across the Socialist, Radical,
Communist and Green coalition which has been governing France, with
remarkably few family rows, since last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists are skeptical on Europe and keen on nuclear
power; the radicals are anti-Europe and tough on immigration. The
Socialists are pro-European but cautious on immigration and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin is struggling to keep all these factions talking from one
bland script. But Cohn-Bendit famously refuses all scripts, and
talks off the cuff.
</P>
<P>
   He is threatening to take on all the other parties _ including
the Greens' Socialist and Communist allies _ by travelling around
making speeches in the political fiefdoms of the party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He says he intends to break away from the normal dreary
exchanges about federalism versus nationalism, the failings of the
Brussels bureaucracy and the dangers of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   He intends to purvey ``une idee jouissive de l'Europe.'' This
means, strictly speaking, a ``joyous concept of Europe'' but could
also be translated ``an orgasmic sense of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in the space of a few days, to Jospin's great
alarm, Daniel Cohn-Bendit has achieved the impossible. He has made
the European Parliament elections interesting. &QL;

power; the radicals are anti-Europe and tough on immigration. The
Socialists are pro-European but cautious on immigration and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin is struggling to keep all these factions talking from one
bland script. But Cohn-Bendit famously refuses all scripts, and
talks off the cuff.
</P>
<P>
   He is threatening to take on all the other parties _ including
the Greens' Socialist and Communist allies _ by travelling around
making speeches in the political fiefdoms of the party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He says he intends to break away from the normal dreary
exchanges about federalism versus nationalism, the failings of the
Brussels bureaucracy and the dangers of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   He intends to purvey ``une idee jouissive de l'Europe.'' This
means, strictly speaking, a ``joyous concept of Europe'' but could
also be translated ``an orgasmic sense of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, in the space of a few days, to Jospin's great
alarm, Daniel Cohn-Bendit has achieved the impossible. He has made
the European Parliament elections interesting. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The good news about ``Aerobics with an Attitude,'' a
popular workout class offered by Crunch, a gym with several
branches in New York City, is that only the trainer is expected to
get into character. The rest of us, thankfully, were just fine in
T-shirts, shorts and trainers.
</P>
<P>
   But our teacher, Anthony Truly, once a dancer with the Tennessee
Ballet, is expected to dress up _ and how.
</P>
<P>
   As 16 of us waited for the music to start pumping to kick off
our class, Truly was prepping himself in the workout studio's
wall-to-wall mirror. He smeared on a last layer of lipstick,
adjusted his long black wig and tied his leopard-spot chiffon scarf
just so.
</P>
<P>
   At the dot of 6 o'clock, he is ready. The remainder of his
costume consists of squeaky-tight spandex shorts, fishnet stockings
and a pair of preposterous platform plimsolls that give him at
least another five inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this my beauty routine,'' he declares. ``Well,
darlings, watch me: because I am THIN!''
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a 60-minute sampling of an aerobics course that
has become one of the most talked-about in the city. It is an
invigorating and muscle-shredding experience that offers
participants both the opportunity to sweat off some unwanted
calories and to enter, if only for an hour, the bitchy, man-hating
(and, of course, man-worshipping) world of the New York drag queen.
</P>
<P>
   Truly's lessons _ he teaches another class called ``Abs, Thighs
and Gossip'' _ are examples of a series of fantasy aerobics
routines on offer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   They are proliferating across the U.S. as gyms struggle to find
gimmicks to compete for members in an industry that, while it
exploded in the past decade, is showing signs of flattening out.
</P>
<P>
   The choices in Manhattan get dottier by the week. At the New
York Sports Clubs chain there are classes taught by a former
American football player who gets his students working on
exhausting patterns of dodges and tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, you can find a ballet-themed class taught by a dancer
with the New York City Ballet and _ for those who really feel the
need to suffer _ a ``boot camp'' class led with a touch of sadism
by a former U.S. Marine.
</P>
<P>
   Most eccentric, perhaps, are the fireman workouts at Crunch,
taken by Eric Torres, a real-life fireman. Classes begin with a
tape of an emergency telephone call and the crackle and hiss of the
dispatcher sending out the engines.
</P>
<P>
   Red lights flash and Torres orders his class to heft bundles of
fire hose _ the real thing, weighing up to 25 lb. _ and begin
stepping as if they are rushing up 80 flights.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy workouts are an attempt by gyms to keep their members
from getting bored _ and going elsewhere, to their sofas or to
competitors. With more and more gyms entering the market,
maintaining membership is a constant battle. On average, a gym will
lose a third of its members each year.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle comes against a backdrop of disappointing growth.
According to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub
Association, fewer than 10 percent of Americans belong to gyms. In
New York, the figure is 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gyms are beginning to understand that if someone has been
exercising for a few years, they want to keep their workouts
invigorating and experience something new,'' says Maeve McCaffrey
of the IHRSA. ``Now they have these choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men who may feel a bit awkward in the ballet class, who might
worry that their feet will never keep up, are going to feel more
comfortable with the firefighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Truly himself is not exactly modest about his classes, which are
also broadcast weekly on the ESPN sports cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people want me,'' he vamps. ``They depend on Truly, they
live vicariously through her, because they see she's so
wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the only two other men joining me in Truly's class the other
evening, one, Juan Fortino, who is a singer, is a loyal regular.
``I like it, because he has no fears about his own body,'' Fortino
enthuses. ``He is totally without inhibitions and that helps me
feel more comfortable with my body.''
</P>
<P>
   This reporter would like to be able to say the same. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   An Internet site is advising childless couples to take advantage
of $500 ``embryo adoption'' procedures as a money-saving
alternative to other fertility treatments. The advice has been
denounced as ``scandalous'' by one of the world's leading fertility
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Macnamee, director of operations at Bourn Hall in
Cambridge, England, where Louise Brown, the first test-tube baby,
was conceived, said such entreaties ``exploited the devastating
emotions which surround infertility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky-based website, ``Conceiving Concepts,'' tells
prospective parents that embryo adoption is a ``lower cost'' option
than in vitro fertilization treatment and ``comes with little or no
paper- or legal work.''
</P>
<P>
   British couples wishing to follow the advice would probably need
to travel to the United States to obtain a ``cheap'' embryo, as it
is unlawful to import embryos into Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Embryo adoption is the term used when a couple who are both
infertile receive a spare frozen embryo created by another couple
during their own in vitro fertilization. The biological parents
have to give their permission for their embryo to be used in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Watson, a fertility consultant who runs Conceiving
Concepts, does not organize embryo adoption herself but gives
couples information on where to go for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost can range from $500-$1,500 per cycle,'' she said.
``It usually has a 10-15 percent success rate. I'm not involved in
doing embryo adoption myself. I am just giving information about
what embryo adoption is and how to go about getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, embryo adoption is tightly regulated. Various
centers such as Bourn Hall, the Midlands Fertility Services and the
Centre for Assisted Reproduction at Park Hospital, Nottingham,
carry out the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Macnamee said Bourn Hall's success rate was the world's best
but treatment costs are expensive at his clinic and he could only
think that such low prices meant clinics were offering to sell
embryos rather than including the price of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible to treat someone for $500... It is a
scandalous trade in gametes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority
said that, at present, embryo adoption was not widespread. However,
the authority could not prevent people going abroad for treatment. &QL;

IT'S OFFICIAL: THE FRENCH DO NOT WASH

newspaper in London.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It is official. The French do not wash.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one in two French people take a bath or shower every
day; the French buy less than half as much toilet soap as the
Germans and the British.
</P>
<P>
   This statistical manna to Francophobes everywhere is provided by
a series of studies carried out by the French government and
perfume and health industries.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures should, perhaps, be taken with a pinch of bath
salts. Personal experience on crowded Metro and Tube trains in
recent years suggests that the British smell more often, and worse,
than the French.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, that discrepancy can be explained by another
statistic. Although the French do not wash very much, they are
Europe's biggest consumers of perfume and deodorants.
</P>
<P>
   According to a synthesis of opinion polls and surveys published
Friday in Le Figaro, only 47 percent of French people take a shower
or bath every day, compared to 70 percent of Britons and 80 percent
of the fanatically clean Dutch, Germans and Scandinavians.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Italians wash more than the French, it seems. (The
cleanliness of the Spanish, Portuguese and Greeks is best
discreetly passed over.)
</P>
<P>
   The statistics are reinforced by a sad comment by a
near-anonymous French doctor (Dr. J.-F. H. of Saint Cloud). ``For
many of us (French doctors),'' he said, ``the deodorant spray is a
tool of the trade at least as important as the stethoscope.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H., practicing in one of the wealthiest Paris suburbs,
complained that he dealt with unwashed bodies and dirty
underclothes every day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Edouard Zarifian, an eminent French medical psychologist,
explained the phenomenon this way. For the French, he said,
``eating and drinking are natural functions. Washing is not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the northern European countries and the United States, he
said, washing had long been associated with hygiene in the mind of
the public. In France and other Latin countries, it never had. Even
French doctors, he said, were very lax about washing their hands
after examining patients.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics gathered by Le Figaro suggest that the French buy
very little soap: 600 grams a year each, compared to 1,300 grams
for each German and a sparkling 1,400 grams for each Briton.
</P>
<P>
   However, these figures are for toilet soap only. They fail to
take account of the thrifty French habit of buying blocks of cheap,
kitchen soap to place in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of such evil-smelling soap are ten time higher in France.
Small wonder the French do not wash. &QL;

<P>
   The phone rings, but nobody is there. Or rather, nobody human.
``A call is coming through for you,'' says a computer voice.
``Please don't hang up.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice sounds at once authoritative and almost comical:
evidently, the call has come through at such lightning velocity
that even the person who dialed the number is a few seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause. A long pause. ``Please stay on the line,'' the
computer voice resumes. ``An agent will be with you shortly.'' An
agent? All of a sudden this doesn't sound so promising.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a seemingly innocent incoming business call
is threatening to turn into a clammy encounter with some
salesperson trying to flog household insurance or dental floss.
</P>
<P>
   There is a further pause. Finally, the computer voice announces:
``We are sorry, but all of our agents are unavailable.'' And the
line goes dead.
</P>
<P>
   No explanations. No chance to find out who inflicted this
infuriating tease on an unsuspecting telephone subscriber. Not even
an opportunity, as the law theoretically demands, to tell the
organization in question never to make such a call again, ever.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the hazards of telecommunication in modern-day America,
a place where computers are gradually taking over from human beings
and the poor human being, increasingly, is being given no right of
reply.
</P>
<P>
   For several years now _ and not just in America _ the phone user
has been confronted with a dizzying range of mechanized responses,
from home answering machines to voice mail to answering services.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who calls the switchboard of a medium-to-large
organization can expect to be talked through an often bewildering
range of options without ever encountering a live human voice.
(``For a full schedule of post-cosmetic surgery therapy classes,
press 5; to find out more about our rhinoplasty techniques teaching
seminar, press 8; to hear a review of these and other options,
press...'').
</P>
<P>
   In a country quaintly attached to the use of letters as well as
numbers on the telephone dialpad, the services of a receptionist
are rapidly being discarded in favor of recorded messages such as:
``If you know the name of the person you are calling, please dial
the first three letters of their name now.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are calling the company for the first time and don't have
any particular name at hand, all you can do is howl with
frustration or wait in the ever vainer hope that the computer will
eventually shut up to be replaced, as the jargon has it, by a
representative who will assist you shortly.
</P>
<P>
   These experiences are alienating enough, but the new trend in
U.S. telephony goes even further. Computers not only receive phone
calls; they make them, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wish to try our great range of household cleaning
products, please stay on the line while...'' Slam. ``Good morning!
Have you ever...'' Click.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it doesn't take more than a millisecond to pick up on
the mechanized sales patter and hang up, but every now and again
there is an opportunity to marvel at the sheer mechanical nuttiness
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parr-pp!'' blares a now-familiar sound on my answer machine,
apparently unprompted by any human agency. ``If you wish to make a
call, please hang up and try again. Parr-pp! If you wish to make a
call...''
</P>
<P>
   Even more insidious than the computers doing their pathetic best
to sound like human beings, though, are the human beings on the
line who sound disconcertingly like computers. These are the
telemarketers, the women (for they are almost always women) paid
some miserable piece rate to recite a carefully prepared list of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning sir I'd like to ask you a few questions about the
car you recently acquired was it a lease or a purchase what was the
make of the vehicle was it new or used how did you finance the
vehicle...''
</P>
<P>
   You could probably tell them you bought a space shuttle with a
stolen credit card and they wouldn't flinch. Any register of
emotion only slows them down and cuts into their pay rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you describe the experience of buying a car with
us?'' the marketer asked me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most horrendous experiences of my life,'' I
answered, truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   She barely skipped a syllable. ``And what color was the
vehicle?`` There was no getting around it. She had to get to the
bottom of her list, like a computer reading out all the options
before allowing you to return to the main menu.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone communication in America may be getting faster and
slicker, but old honest to goodness human contact seems to be going
seriously out of fashion. &QL;

the mechanized sales patter and hang up, but every now and again
there is an opportunity to marvel at the sheer mechanical nuttiness
of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parr-pp!'' blares a now-familiar sound on my answer machine,
apparently unprompted by any human agency. ``If you wish to make a
call, please hang up and try again. Parr-pp! If you wish to make a
call...''
</P>
<P>
   Even more insidious than the computers doing their pathetic best
to sound like human beings, though, are the human beings on the
line who sound disconcertingly like computers. These are the
telemarketers, the women (for they are almost always women) paid
some miserable piece rate to recite a carefully prepared list of
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning sir I'd like to ask you a few questions about the
car you recently acquired was it a lease or a purchase what was the
make of the vehicle was it new or used how did you finance the
vehicle...''
</P>
<P>
   You could probably tell them you bought a space shuttle with a
stolen credit card and they wouldn't flinch. Any register of
emotion only slows them down and cuts into their pay rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you describe the experience of buying a car with
us?'' the marketer asked me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most horrendous experiences of my life,'' I
answered, truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   She barely skipped a syllable. ``And what color was the
vehicle?`` There was no getting around it. She had to get to the
bottom of her list, like a computer reading out all the options
before allowing you to return to the main menu.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone communication in America may be getting faster and
slicker, but old honest to goodness human contact seems to be going
seriously out of fashion. &QL;

TEXT OF RENO STATEMENT ON GORE PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following is the text of Attorney General Janet
Reno's notification to a special federal court Tuesday that she had
decided against seeking appointment of an independent counsel to
investigate the campaign fund-raising activities of Vice President
Al Gore:
</P>
<P>
   On. Aug. 26, 1998, I notified this court of the initiation of a
preliminary investigation of Vice President of the United States
Albert Gore Jr. The preliminary investigation has now been
concluded, and I have determined that there are no reasonable
grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted of the
matters that were under investigation. Therefore, appointment of an
independent counsel is not being sought. In accordance with the
requirements of 28 U.S.C. (SS) 592 (b), this notification will
summarize the information received and the results of the
preliminary investigation.
</P>
<P>
   This preliminary investigation explored the question of whether
there is sufficient evidence to warrant further investigation into
whether the Vice President violated Federal law, 18 U.S.C. (SS)
1001, when he told attorneys and investigators last fall that he
did not know, at the time he made fund-raising telephone calls from
his West Wing office, that the beneficiary of the solicitations,
the media campaign run by the Democratic National Committee, was
funded in part with Federal money, and that he believed at the time
of his telephone calls that Federal money contributions to the
D.N.C. were limited to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION RECEIVED
</P>
<P>
   a. The 1997 Investigation
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997, the department conducted a preliminary
investigation into the question of whether the Vice President may
have violated 18 U.S.C. (SS) 607 when he made fund-raising
telephone calls from his White House office (hereinafter, 1997
investigation). The 1997 investigation led to my conclusion that
there were no grounds to seek appointment of an independent counsel
for two independent reasons: first, the overwhelming weight of the
evidence supported the Vice President's statement that he was
soliciting soft-money contributions, outside the scope of Section
607's ban on political fund-raising from the Federal workplace,
when he made the telephone calls, and second, established
departmental policy precluded prosecutions under Section 607 in the
absence of aggravating circumstances, such as coercion, that were
absent there.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the 1997 investigation, we interviewed the Vice
President. The Vice President explained that he believed he was
soliciting soft money when he was making the telephone calls. The
Vice President further explained that the telephone solicitations
were intended to raise funds for the D.N.C.'s media fund, which
financed a series of so-called ``issue advertisements'' that ran
during late 1995 and 1996. He further explained that he believed at
the time he made the calls that the D.N.C. media campaign was
financed entirely with soft money, and that donors were limited to
$2,000 in hard-money contributions. This belief was erroneous, but
as a result, when he requested large contributions to the media
fund, he believed that he could only have been requesting
soft-money contributions. The Vice President understood that there
was a hard-money component to the D.N.C.'s overall budget and that
some of its activities had to be financed with hard money, but
believed that because the media fund involved so-called ``issue
ads,'' it could be financed entirely with soft money.
</P>
<P>
   We explored this question further with the Vice President at the
time, because we had obtained a number of memoranda addressed to
the Vice President, among others, that mentioned the fact that the
media campaign was funded with both hard and soft money, and we
knew that a Nov. 21, 1995, D.N.C. budget meeting focused on the
budget for the media fund. The agenda for the Nov. 21 meeting
suggested that the amount of funding for the media campaign and how
to raise it was to have been a topic of discussion at the meeting,
which we knew was attended by the Vice President .
</P>
<P>
   The Vice President stated that he did not recall a discussion at
this or any other meeting about the D.N.C.'s specific need for both
hard and soft money in late 1995 to keep the advertisements on the
air. The Vice President said that he believed that the fund-raising
phone calls probably were discussed during the meeting and that the
general topic of the media fund budget being increased was raised
and discussed. As for the memoranda that reflected a hard-money
component to the media fund, the Vice President said that as a rule
he did not read memoranda on these topics, particularly from this
author. This general practice was corroborated in the course of
separate interviews with members of the Vice President's staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Vice President's statements about his beliefs and intentions
were a factor in my final conclusion in 1997 with respect to the
alleged violations of 18 U.S.C. (SS) 607, although a relatively
minor one. Far more weighty was the substantial evidence derived
from interviews of the donors themselves which substantiated my
conclusion that they were in fact solicited for large soft-money
contributions to the D.N.C., to support the DNC's media campaign.
</P>
<P>
   b. The New Information
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 1998, long after the conclusion of the 1997
investigation, the Vice President's counsel provided the department
with a six-page set of newly discovered documents, responsive to
document requests we had made during the 1997 investigation. The
documents were a copy of a set of documents already in our
possession, which were distributed at the November 1995 meeting
referenced above. The copies provided by the Vice President's
counsel, however, included handwritten notes by a member of the
Vice President's staff that suggested that the hard-money component
to the media fund may have been expressly mentioned during the
November 1995 meeting, which was attended by the Vice President.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the notes _ which set forth ``65 percent soft/35
percent hard'' opposite the term ``media fund'' _ appear to reflect
a phrase that may have been used at the meeting to describe the
approximate proportions of hard and soft money used by the D.N.C.
to purchase television ads during this period. The notes also
include what may be a statement of the hard-money limit for gifts
to the D.N.C. Specifically, the note just below the ``65 percent/35
percent'' includes what appears to be an attempt to explain that
soft-money contributions are ``corporate or anything over $20K from
an individual.'' In addition, while not clearly written, a second
notation that appears to say ``hard limit $20K'' appears on page 2
of the set of documents.
</P>
<P>
   These new documents, then, raised some new questions concerning
the Vice President's statements about his understanding of the
D.N.C.'s efforts to fund the media campaign. The notes suggested
that during the November 1995 meeting, both the fact that the
hard-money limit on donations to the D.N.C. was $20,000 and that
the media campaign was funded by a mix of hard and soft money may
have been discussed in the Vice President's presence. This could
give rise to an inference that his subsequent statements that he
believed at the time that hard-money donations to the D.N.C. were
limited to $2,000 and that the media campaign was funded only by
soft money may have been false.
</P>
<P>
   I therefore initiated a preliminary investigation of this matter
to fully explore the evidence concerning the Vice President's
knowledge and intent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   APPLICABLE LAW
</P>
<P>
   The false-statement statute provides, in pertinent part:
</P>
<P>
   (W)hoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the
executive, legislative or judicial branch of the Government of the
United States, knowingly and willfully . . . makes any materially
false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation shall
be (guilty of a felony). _ 18 U.S.C. 1001.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a conviction under Section 1001, the Government must
prove (1) a statement, (2) falsity, (3) materiality, (4) specific
intent and (5) agency jurisdiction. United States v. Herring 916 F.
2d 1543, 1546 (11th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 946 (1991).
</P>
<P>
   The elements in issue here are falsity and criminal intent; the
other elements of the offense are not in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION
</P>
<P>
   The handwritten notes alone are not sufficient to warrant a
conclusion that the Vice President made a false statement. In an
effort to determine whether the apparent disparity between what the
Vice President told us he believed at the time he made the calls
and what the notes indicate may have been said at a meeting he
attended on these topics warrants further investigation, we
interviewed the attendees of the meeting and others involved with
these topics. These witnesses included the Vice President, current
and former members of his staff, other current and former White
House officials, officials of the Clinton-Gore '96 Committee and
various officers and employees of the D.N.C. Documents were also
obtained from the White House, the D.N.C., Clinton-Gore '96 and
others, including an affidavit from the Vice President's counsel.
We also reviewed depositions and testimony provided by various
witnesses in the course of previous Congressional and task force
inquiries into various campaign fund-raising matters. Finally, we
reviewed all other documents and evidence that might support an
inference that the Vice President's statements were false.
</P>
<P>
   We were seeking to determine whether there was any evidence from
which one might reasonably infer that the Vice President actually
knew about the hard-money component of the media campaign or the
$20,000 contribution limit at the time he made the telephone calls
seeking contributions. Such an inference might be supported, for
example, by information that these facts were discussed in
sufficient detail and focus at the meeting that many other
attendees specifically recall them, that the Vice President made
comments or asked questions in the course of the discussion that
would seem to reflect an active understanding of the details, that
the participants recall any affirmative discussion of a need to
raise hard money for the media fund, that the Vice President read
memoranda that made these points or that anyone spoke directly to
the Vice President on any occasion about the need to raise hard
money for the media campaign.
</P>
<P>
   RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION
</P>
<P>
   As a threshold matter, the evidence we gathered during these
interviews does support a conclusion that the Vice President
attended a D.N.C. budget meeting on Nov. 21, 1995, and that at some
point in the course of the meeting, the D.N.C. media fund was
discussed. The evidence also supports a conclusion that some
reference was made in the course of the meeting to the fact that
there was a hard-money component to the financing of the media
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen individuals, including the President and Vice President,
attended the meeting. All 15 were interviewed, with two exceptions:
one who testified under oath in the course of a Congressional
investigation that he had no recollection of the meeting, and that
if he attended at all, he likely would have left after just a few
minutes; and the President, who provided us with a statement that
he had no independent recollection of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   No attendees recall any particular questions or comments by the
Vice President. No one who arrived at the meeting without a working
knowledge of the D.N.C. financing issues left with an accurate
understanding of the fact that both hard and soft money were
necessary to pay for the media campaign. Only 2 of the 15 attendees
at the meeting even recall the topic of a hard-money component to
the media fund being raised during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   While the author of the notes had no specific recollection of
the meeting, he did confirm, based on his habit and practice, his
belief that the words noted in his handwriting were things said
during the meeting that he recorded as they were said.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing his notes, this attendee could not recall who might
have uttered the words ``65 percent soft/35 percent hard'';
``corporate or anything over $20K from an individual''; or
``hard-money limit $20K''during the meeting. He was also unable to
provide an explanation about what each of the phrases might have
meant within the context of the meeting. He did not recall the
issue of ``hard''and ``soft''money being discussed by those
attending but noted that these issues were often discussed at
D.N.C. budget meetings. He was also unable to say whether the words
were used with regard to the media fund, the D.N.C.'s operating
budget or something else. Notably, this individual, who attended
the meeting and was paying enough attention to what was being said
to take verbatim notes of some points, also told us during his
interview that he believed that the media campaign was financed
entirely with soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Two attendees specifically recall references to hard money in
connection with the media fund being made at the meeting. The
first, a White House official, recalls that the hard-money
component to the media fund was discussed. He also recalls a
discussion of how much would have to be raised both in hard and in
soft dollars for the media fund during the meeting. However, he has
no specific recollection of any of the statements recorded in the
notes.
</P>
<P>
   The other, a D.N.C. official, was the individual who made one of
the quoted statements. He recalls answering a question about the
``spending side''of the media campaign by noting that the expenses
were generally averaging ``65 percent soft/35 percent hard.'' The
answer, according to this attendee, was one sentence without any
elaboration. He does not remember who asked the question but
volunteered that he did not think it was the Vice President, since
the Vice President did not often get into ``that level of detail.''
He had no memory of anyone else mentioning hard or Federal money
during this preliminary discussion of the ``spending side''of the
media campaign. He does not recall a specific use of the terms
hard, soft, Federal or non-Federal money during the discussion that
centered around the ``spending side'' of the D.N.C.
</P>
<P>
   He did remember some discussion about the fact that the D.N.C.
had sufficient funds available to borrow on their hard-money line
of credit but no borrowing capacity on the soft-money side. There
was a discussion about direct-mail contributions to the D.N.C.
operating budget _ all in hard money _ that were available, if
needed, for the media purchases. He recalled that both of these
facts were mentioned as reasons why there was sufficient hard money
on hand to keep the advertisements on the air through the end of
the year, but that soft money would need to be raised. According to
this witness, after these points were made at the meeting the
ensuing conversation about the funding of the media campaign and
the money needed to be raised by the President and Vice President
would have been focused on the need for soft money.

MASS. LAWMAKERS WILLING TO TALK TO PATRIOTS OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH   AND TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Signaling an apparent new flexibility on behalf of
House members, Majority Leader William P. Nagle Jr. said Tuesday
that Democratic legislators stand ready to negotiate with New
England Patriots owner Robert Kraft if his plan to move the team to
Connecticut falls through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sense of the Democratic members is that there
would be some willingness to at least talk,'' Nagle said. ``I think
the fact that there would be discussions would be different, and I
think he should hear that the membership is interested in doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagle, the second most powerful man in the House after Speaker
Thomas M. Finneran, wouldn't say whether he was offering an olive
branch on behalf of his boss. Pressed repeatedly on whether
Finneran had authorized him to float the possibility of further
negotiations, Nagle said: ``I think the fact that I am saying it is
significant in itself. I am the number two guy in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's philosophical opposition to using tax dollars to
support professional sports teams, as well as his power to
single-handedly block legislation, has been the team's biggest
obstacle to winning approval for a new stadium in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, who spoke with Nagle earlier Tuesday, insisted he has
been flexible all along on the stadium. However, he admitted that
Nagle's outreach _ particularly his insistence that ``almost
anything can be compromised'' _ struck a different tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is somewhat different than what you heard from me,''
Finneran conceded. ``There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Nagle emphasized that ``my position is the
speaker's position. We are on the same page, singing the same song
in the same church.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with some State House sources saying Finneran was
surprised Kraft signed a deal with Connecticut, and some House
members worrying about the long-term image of the House as a
chamber where representatives don't dare cross the speaker, Nagle
clearly wanted to signal a new stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think almost anything can be compromised,'' said Nagle, a
Northampton Democrat. ``I think there is a general interest in
trying to do something so that everybody's needs are met in
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Finneran has struck an antagonistic stance toward
Kraft, essentially saying the team owner would have to take a deal
on the speaker's terms. Asked Monday whether he would reconsider
his position on the stadium _ which at last offer was $57 million
in publicly-financed infrastructure along Route 1 in Foxborough _
Finneran first shrugged off questions. But later, turning to
several House members, he suggested that the House had little
interest in revisiting its stance.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the message from Nagle Tuesday, who said several
times that Democratic representatives want to find a way to keep
the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House would be interested in entering into some sort of
discussion,'' Nagle said. ``It would probably redefine the
parameters of what we have been discussing with Bob Kraft. There is
an opportunity for movement that I think is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagle stressed that he didn't think the House would move on the
fundamental issue where Finneran has balked: Buying land that Kraft
owns around the current stadium and having Kraft lease it back from
the state.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nagle said he thought there were other ways to solve
Kraft's needs. ``There are a whole host of things that could be
looked at,'' he said. ``We could look at who owns the land and who
would acquire it.'' Nagle offered no further elaboration on that
point, saying he didn't want to negotiate in the pages of the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Patriots declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the memorandum of understanding that Kraft and
Governor John Rowland signed last Thursday, the team owner has
placed $2 million in an escrow account to show good faith that he
will not negotiate with another state until Dec. 31 or after the
Connecticut Legislature votes on the issue, whichever comes first.
Kraft would forfeit the money if he breaks the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said Tuesday that legislators
could be called back to vote on the stadium proposal as early as
Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Finneran is taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ball is in the court of the Connecticut
Legislature,'' he said. ``But we never said never. That's not an
appropriate style of negotiations.''

 (Update1 - Editors: Rewrites first paragraph)   AOL Deal May Doom Netscape  
   
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chrnicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Netscape Communications' operations will remain in Mountain View if
yesterday's $4.2 billion buyout by America Online goes through. But
whether Netscape has any future at all is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; As part of a sidecar deal, AOL and Sun Microsystems said they
will develop future versions of Netscape's software, including its
popular Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Netscape personnel would be involved in the
products, Sun's chief strategy officer Bill Raduchel said simply,
``There is no Netscape anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If the merger spells trouble for Netscape, it promises to be a
boon to Sun of Mountain View, which would be in position to mount a
major challenge to Microsoft in the fast-growing area of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, a leading maker of business computers, already is one of
the star players on the Internet. Its computers run the majority of
the world's Internet service providers, and the Java programming
language it developed has become a staple in creating interactive
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under a three-year agreement with AOL, Sun now also will have
Netscape's corporate software _ the stuff that lets corporations do
business online.
</P>
<P>
   In return for marketing rights to the Netscape software, Sun has
agreed to pay AOL more than $350 million up front, plus what the
companies termed ``significant minimum revenue commitments'' over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sun will recoup some of that investment because the deal also
calls for AOL to purchase $500 million worth of Sun's computer
systems and services at list price.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the deal a good one for Sun. ``It's a very
finite investment with a very good potential for return,'' said
Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Raduchel insisted that Sun was not to blame for holding up the
AOL-Netscape deal, denying speculation that his company held out
for better terms than AOL wanted to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of us bargained hard, and both sides had to protect our
shareholders,'' he said. ``We finally had an agreement at 2:05
(Tuesday) morning.''
</P>
<P>
   By combining Sun's computers and Netscape's e-commerce software,
Internet service providers and online businesses would be able to
get all of their technology from one company.
</P>
<P>
   This will make Sun a more formidable competitor to Microsoft,
which went head to head with Netscape in e-commerce software but
does not sell hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Sun the tools to be the competitor to Microsoft
they've always wanted to be,'' said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Sun also said they will develop new Internet devices
that will help users access the Web or AOL from anyplace. According
to Raduchel, those devices could be pagers, smart phones, set-top
boxes and portable Internet-only appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The new devices promise to be fertile ground for Java, and
perhaps a Java-based operating system that could rival Windows CE,
Microsoft's OS for handheld computers and other portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge over the next 20 years will not be speed or cost
or performance,'' said Raduchel. ``It will be a question of
complexity, and what  &LR; we're going to try to eliminate an awful lot
of that complexity.''

WASHINGTON: soft money. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As noted above, in order to prove a violation of Section 1001 in
this case, the Government would have to prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that at the time he made the telephone calls that were at
issue in the 1997 investigation, the Vice President actually knew
that the media campaign had a hard-money component, or that the
limit on hard money contributions was $20,000. In this case, there
is no direct evidence of such knowledge. While the Vice President
was present at the meeting, there is no evidence that he heard the
statements or understood their implications, so as to suggest the
falsity of his statement two years later that he believed the media
fund was entirely soft money. Nor does anyone recall the Vice
President asking any questions or making any comments at the
meeting about the media fund, much less questions or comments
indicating an understanding of the issue of the blend of hard and
soft money needed for D.N.C. media expenditures. Witnesses were
also asked whether they recalled any other discussion with the Vice
President about the hard-money component of the media fund; none
recalled any, nor did any recall the Vice President saying or doing
anything at any other time that would indicate that indeed he knew,
whether from the meeting or from some other source, that there was
a hard-money component to the media fund.
</P>
<P>
   There is thus only weak circumstantial evidence of the Vice
President's knowledge _ his presence at a meeting where the subject
was briefly discussed _ which I do not believe provides reasonable
grounds to believe that further investigation of this matter is
warranted. Notably, others attending the meeting also left it with
an inaccurate understanding of the funding of the media campaign.
The range of impressions and vague misunderstandings among all the
meeting attendees is striking, and undercuts any reasonable
inference that mere attendance at the meeting should have served to
communicate to the Vice President an accurate understanding of the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the total lack of direct evidence suggesting that
the Vice President was aware of the hard-money component to the
media fund, and the insubstantial nature of even the indirect
evidence, I also find a lack of evidence to reasonably support a
conclusion that he may have had a motive to falsely deny that he
knew about the hard-money component. The documentary evidence and
the testimony from involved witnesses clearly establish that at the
time, the D.N.C. did not need to find ways of raising hard money in
order to continue to run the advertisements. However, it was
critically short of soft money and had used up its soft-money line
of credit. Thus, when the Vice President was asked to help raise
money by making telephone solicitations, the D.N.C.'s specific need
was for soft money.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Vice President did not need to deny
knowledge of the fact that there was a hard-money component to the
fund in order to provide an innocent explanation for his telephone
calls. His explanation would have been just as innocent if he had
stated that while he knew there was a hard-money component to the
media campaign, soft money was what was needed at the time and
therefore that was what he was raising. In fact, such an account,
unlike the one he gave, would have been corroborated by the
documentary evidence that was brought to the Vice President's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   It is also significant that there is evidence that this issue
was specifically brought to the Vice President's attention before
his interview with us during the 1997 investigation. The Vice
President's attorneys have provided us with their sworn statement
that in the course of preparing him for his interview, the Vice
President also told them that at the time he made the calls he
believed that the media campaign was funded entirely with soft
money. They explained to him that this belief was not accurate, and
pointed out to him that there were documents, addressed to him, in
conflict with his statement. Nevertheless, they averred, he stated
that he would have to tell us that he believed the media fund was
all soft money because it was the truth.
</P>
<P>
   To summarize, it appears that at the time of his interview
during the 1997 investigation, the Vice President was expressly
aware that he had little to gain and much to lose in admitting his
misconception of the true facts. In fact, his explanation not only
led to additional inquiries during the 1997 investigation, because
it was at odds with known documents, but led directly to this
investigation as well. I can see no reasonable basis for concluding
that he had a motive to tell this story if it were not true.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned above, the Vice President also told us in the
course of the 1997 investigation that he believed that the limit on
hard-money contributions was $2,000, and some of the handwritten
notes suggest that topic too may have been discussed at the
November 1995 meeting. However, while some of the 15 meeting
attendees had a vague recollection of some of the topics of
discussion, no one interviewed could remember the use of the note's
terms ``hard limit $20K'' and ``corporate or anything over $20K
from an individual'' in this meeting. We thus have no evidence of
what, if anything, was said, or in what context. Thus, with the
exception of the notes themselves, the meaning of which is unclear,
we are left with no evidence that the Vice President's statement
that he believed the legal limit for hard money gifts to the D.N.C.
was the same as the limit for individual candidates _ $2,000 per
election cycle _ is false. We found no independent evidence to
suggest that the Vice President did not in fact believe that
hard-money contributions were so limited, and his belief is
plausible in light of his previous experience with Congressional
campaigns. While it appears from the handwritten notes that some
reference to the higher limit on hard-money contributions to the
D.N.C. may have been made during the meeting, the fact that no one
who attended the meeting recalled the statement _ and a number of
other attendees reported the same or similar mistaken belief about
the limitation on the size of hard-money contributions _ leads me
to the conclusion that I have insufficient evidence to warrant
further investigation as to whether the Vice President made a false
statement on this point.
</P>
<P>
   As mentioned above, in the course of the 1997 investigation we
obtained several memoranda addressed to the Vice President as one
of several recipients, which contain brief internal references to
the hard-money component to the media fund. However, as we noted at
the conclusion of the 1997 investigation, the Vice President has
stated, and several members of his staff have confirmed, that he
did not read these types of memoranda that dealt with D.N.C.
budgetary issues. We discovered no new evidence during this
investigation which contradicts this evidence or would lead me to
revisit my previous conclusion that the mere existence of these
memoranda, without any evidence that the Vice President actually
read them, was not sufficient grounds to conclude that the Vice
President might have been making a false statement about his
knowledge of the hard-money component to the media fund.

WASHINGTON: media fund. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Finally, there were regular meetings held at the White House
known as ``residence meetings,'' because they were held in the
White House. During the relevant period, the residence meetings
were focused on political strategy and polling issues. Two
residence-meeting ``agendas''_ one dated Sept. 7, 1995, and the
other dated Sept. 13, 1995 _ have one line each that indicates that
the D.N.C. issue ads under consideration were going to be paid for,
in part, with hard money.
</P>
<P>
   We were unable to establish whether the Vice President attended
these particular meetings; indeed, we have been unable to establish
that those two meetings were even held. They do not appear on
either the President's or the Vice President's daily calendars,
while other residence meetings do appear. Regular attendees of the
residence meetings who were interviewed do not recall whether these
particular meetings were held or, if they were held, whether the
Vice President attended or whether these particular agenda items
were actually discussed. Many of the attendees specifically stated
that they do not recall the hard-money component to the media fund
ever being discussed at the residence meetings. Given this state of
the evidence, T conclude that there is insufficient evidence to
reasonably conclude that the Vice President was put on notice as to
the hard-money component to the media fund during or because of any
discussion that may have been held on the topic in the course of
the residence meetings.
</P>
<P>
   I considered with care the reasonable implications that might be
drawn from all of this evidence _ the Vice President's attendance
at the November 1995 meeting, the memoranda addressed to him and
the residence meetings _ along with all other evidence and
information available to us concerning the Vice President's
understanding of the media fund and how it was financed, including
the affidavit of the Vice President's counsel. Taken altogether, I
find the evidence fails to provide any reasonable support for a
conclusion that the Vice President may have lied. As explained
above, there are no reasonable grounds to conclude that the
November 1995 meeting would have put the Vice President on notice
of the hard-money component of the media fund, there is no evidence
that the Vice President actually read the memoranda in which the
topic is mentioned (and considerable evidence that he did not), and
there is insufficient evidence that the topic was addressed at the
residence meetings or that the Vice President attended the meetings
where the topic might have been raised. As a result, I conclude
that there is no reasonable prospect that these facts could support
a successful prosecution. Furthermore, I am unable to identify any
additional investigation that might reasonably be expected to
provide sufficient evidence to support a successful prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   CONCLUSION
</P>
<P>
   I conclude that the evidence supporting a conclusion that the
Vice President may have provided false statements to investigators
and attorneys during an interview in the 1997 investigation is so
insubstantial that there are no reasonable grounds for further
investigation. Therefore, based on the results of the
above-described investigation, I hereby notify this court that no
independent counsel should be appointed.

FOR NBA TALKS, NOT SO WONDERFUL A LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First, the National Basketball Association told NBC
to run ``It's a Wonderful Life'' instead of a Christmas Day
doubleheader, featuring the Bulls vs. the Knicks. Thus, the season
will not start until 1999. Bad news got worse for the league
Tuesday when the players withdrew their agreement of an escrow plan
_ a major issue in the five-month-old lockout.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy commissioner Russ Granik sent a letter to Billy Hunter,
the union executive director, suggesting that Saturday's full
bargaining session in Manhattan be canceled. Earlier in the day,
Jeffrey Kessler, the union's chief outside counsel, told Granik
that there was a misunderstanding among the players of the escrow
tax proposal agreed upon during a 10-hour bargaining session
Friday. That apparent agreement was considered the most significant
progress in the 146-day lockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are nowhere,'' Granik said Tuesday night. ``Whatever
progress we made on Friday is all but gone. If this is their
position, then I don't expect there to be a meeting on Saturday. I
accept it was a misunderstanding rather than any bad-faith
bargaining. But that doesn't help a lot. Based upon their not
accepting the tax, we're back to square one.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter disputed Granik's contention that it would be futile to
hold a meeting Saturday. ``If the NBA is serious about making a
deal,'' Hunter said, ``they should stop posturing and come to the
bargaining table this Saturday with the goal of ending the lockout
and saving the season.''
</P>
<P>
   In NBC's first televised date of the season, the Knicks were
scheduled to play at Chicago and the Phoenix Suns were scheduled to
meet the Los Angeles Lakers in the second game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, NBC spokesman Ed Markey said, the network's
entertainment division has planned to show ``It's a Wonderful
Life.'' The network's next NBA telecast is regional coverage on
Saturday, Jan. 16. In the New York area, the Nets at Knicks would
be the featured game.
</P>
<P>
   Granik admitted that any thought of playing in December has been
lost. ``In light of these developments, there's no chance we start
before 1999,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The league has resisted issuing a deadline for canceling the
season, despite the suggestion made by the union on Friday. But no
agreement in principle by mid-December would severely jeopardize
the chance for playing an even 50-game season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them on Friday, `Let's set a date to cancel the season
on Wednesday,''' Kessler said. ``And we'll negotiate around the
clock for six days and see where were are. Our feeling is, whatever
deal we can make a month from now, we can make now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler added, referring to David Stern, ``But the commissioner
didn't want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   What is now putting the season in jeopardy is an economic plan
discussed and tinkered with for the better part of a month, a plan
that may be days away from termination. Soon after reports of
progress emerged from Friday's meeting, the players said they would
not accept a proposal from the owners that dealt with the unlimited
signing of free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule would force teams who sign another team's free
agent to give up the right to re-sign their own players under the
Larry Bird exception, which allows teams to pay the players
whatever they want. The proposed change to the ``timing rules'' was
shot down by many of the more than 100 players who took part in a
union conference call over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of several disagreements between the two sides, along
with the escrow tax. The players had agreed to put aside 10 percent
of their salaries at the beginning of the season in the fourth,
fifth and sixth years of a proposed-seven year deal. The escrow
fund would go toward paying back the owners if an agreed-upon
salary percentage had been exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can continue to be hopeful,'' Kessler added. ``We
believe the players have put more than enough on the table already.
The owners have to be irrational to cancel the season. But we can't
stop them from committing irrational acts.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked when the league would make the announcement, Granik
replied, ``We're going to do everything we can to resist that. But
someday in the not-too-distant future, we're going to turn around
and realize the season is lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said in a prepared statement: ``We strongly disagree with
Russ' statement that the parties made no progress at last Friday's
negotiating meeting. At that meeting, the players proposed an
additional method _ on top of what we already proposed _ to address
the owners' desire to obtain cost certainty. That new proposal and
the entire escrow framework remain on the table.''

DEMOCRATS DISPUTE VACCO'S CLAIMS ABOUT DECEASED VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Democratic officials Tuesday bitterly assailed an
accusation that as many as 1,000 ballots might have been cast in
the race for state attorney general in the names of voters who had
died before the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   The allegation, from the campaign of Attorney General Dennis
Vacco, was also rejected by officials at the city Board of
Elections. They said Vacco's claims could not possibly be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Thomas Spargo, a lawyer for Vacco, told a state
Supreme Court justice that a series of computer searches conducted
by the Vacco campaign showed that ballots might have been cast in
Manhattan by 1,000 people listed as dead by the Social Security
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of their charges so far have been unfounded, I believe
this will be the same,'' said Jon Del Giorno, administrative
manager of the New York City office of the Board of Elections.
``All of their previous attempts to show that there have been
mistakes have not played out, I don't think this one will either.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state Board of Elections said Tuesday that Eliot
Spitzer, the Democratic challenger, was maintaining a lead of more
than 21,000 votes over Vacco, with less than 500 ballots left
uncounted, all from Erie County, and almost 22,000 paper ballots
set aside because of objections.
</P>
<P>
   Spargo said Tuesday that the Vacco campaign had compared the
Social Security Administration's list with ``a computerized active
list of voters'' in New York City. But the Board of Elections said
that its computerized records of voters who went to the polls Nov.
3 had not been compiled and would not be completed until next week.
</P>
<P>
   The only other method to determine whether fraudulent ballots
were cast using the names of dead people would be to compare names
from the Social Security Administration list with the signatures
written on the Board of Election books that voters must sign at
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
   Spargo said that the Vacco campaign had not begun to examine
those books until late Tuesday afternoon, a day after he made his
assertions before Justice Thomas Keegan. The judge, while
expressing dismay about the delays in determining the election's
outcome, allowed the Vacco campaign a few more days to look through
voting records to clarify the claims of voting irregularities.
Vacco's lawyers were instructed to return to court Monday to
present their findings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Spargo said he was uncertain of precisely what computer list the
Vacco campaign had secured from the Board of Elections or of the
period in which that information was compiled. ``My understanding
is that it is an overall list of voters in New York City, an active
voter list,'' he said. He said the Social Security Administration
data were supplied by a vendor hired by the Vacco campaign and
included a list of names and birth dates of people for whom death
benefits had been paid.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Herman Farrell, the Democratic Party chairman in
Manhattan, said that it would not be unusual for the names of more
than 1,000 dead people to appear on voter rolls. ``But that doesn't
mean that anyone voted in the names of those people,'' Farrell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Spitzer campaign reacted strongly to Vacco's charges
Tuesday. ``This is becoming like a horror movie starring Dennis
Vacco,'' said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Spitzer's campaign.
``The title would be: `The Attorney General Who Lost and Would Not
Leave.'''

NEW LEASE DOESN'T BLOCK NETS' MOVE TO NEWARK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets, whose owners would like to move to a
proposed arena in downtown Newark, now have a better lease at their
current home through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The lease, made public Tuesday, significantly alters the Nets'
revenue stream, but imposes stiff penalties on the team if it moves
from New Jersey. The lease lets the team move anywhere it wants
after the 1999-2000 season, with six months' notice. If it moves to
Newark, there is no financial penalty, because the state is
expected to play some financial role at that facility.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Nets leave the state, it would pay the New Jersey
Sports and Exposition Authority $15 million after next season, $10
million after the 2000-1 season, $7.5 million after the 2001-2
season and $5 million after the 2002-3 season. For the final four
years of the lease, no fines would be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   The lease was written so that the sports authority has time to
study whether to overhaul Continental Arena, or build another arena
in its place at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a satisfying lease,'' said Michael Rowe, the Nets'
president, ``because it recognizes our desire to relocate to
Newark, but gives the sports authority time to show us whether the
Meadowlands is the best place for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lease that binds us, but gives us time to reach a
long-term solution on an arena,'' said John Samerjan, the sports
authority's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The lease will require the Nets to pay the sports authority rent
based on 2 percent to 5 percent of gross ticket receipts, depending
on attendance, down from a range of 10.5 percent to 25 percent in
the previous lease.
</P>
<P>
   The team will also receive 40 percent of gross luxury box
revenues (up from 25 percent), 100 percent of net parking receipts
(up from 50 percent) and 100 percent of the sports authority's
share of concessions (up from 50 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The team will also keep 60 to 70 percent of the revenues from
advertisements posted in new locations in the arena, and be
reimbursed $2.5 million by the sports authority for nearly all the
costs of a new practice facility.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe would not estimate how much greater the Nets' revenues will
be. ``The authority's acting as a partner, not a landlord,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By not blocking a Newark move, Rowe said, ``The authority is
acting as a New Jersey sports authority, not an East Rutherford
sports authority.'' &QL;

CIA DENIES WITHHOLDING REPORTS ON RUSSIAN CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CIA said Tuesday that it had provided many
reports on the corruption of senior Russian officials to the
Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The agency strongly denied that its analysts had censored
themselves after concluding that senior administration officials
did not want evidence of corruption to obstruct doing business with
the Russian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have published numerous pieces on corruption in the Russian
government over the past several years and up to the present,'' a
spokesman for the agency, Bill Harlow, said. ``We do not withhold
reports because they are inconvenient.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was a response to an article on Monday in The New
York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Some CIA officials, the article reported, said important
administration officials had been dismissive of intelligence
reports about the corruption of Russian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, the analysts said, included former Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin and Anatoly Chubais, who was until recently
considered by administration officials to be an important leader in
the field of economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA said Tuesday that its analysts had continued to provide
reports on high-level Russian corruption, no matter how they were
received by administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged frequent tensions between the agency and
policy makers over the reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to remain independent in the face of political
pressure is a sensitive issue for agency officials. Political
pressure on the intelligence community is a recurring theme in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The debate may have reached a high point in the battle in 1991
over the nomination of Robert Gates to be director of central
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who had been deputy director of the CIA in the Reagan
administration, came under fire during Senate hearings because of
allegations that he had sought to tailor intelligence reports on
the Soviet Union to fit the Reagan administration's conservative
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Gates was confirmed as director.

   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a large difference
between Denver (no. 1) and Minnesota (2), and almost no difference
between Atlanta (3) and Dallas (4).

MASS. LAWMAKERS WILLING TO TALK TO PATRIOTS OWNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH   AND TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ Signaling an apparent new flexibility on behalf of
House members, Majority Leader William P. Nagle Jr. said Tuesday
that Democratic legislators stand ready to negotiate with New
England Patriots owner Robert Kraft if his plan to move the team to
Connecticut falls through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sense of the Democratic members is that there
would be some willingness to at least talk,'' Nagle said. ``I think
the fact that there would be discussions would be different, and I
think he should hear that the membership is interested in doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagle, the second most powerful man in the House after Speaker
Thomas M. Finneran, wouldn't say whether he was offering an olive
branch on behalf of his boss. Pressed repeatedly on whether
Finneran had authorized him to float the possibility of further
negotiations, Nagle said: ``I think the fact that I am saying it is
significant in itself. I am the number two guy in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran's philosophical opposition to using tax dollars to
support professional sports teams, as well as his power to
single-handedly block legislation, has been the team's biggest
obstacle to winning approval for a new stadium in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, who spoke with Nagle earlier Tuesday, insisted he has
been flexible all along on the stadium. However, he admitted that
Nagle's outreach _ particularly his insistence that ``almost
anything can be compromised'' _ struck a different tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is somewhat different than what you heard from me,''
Finneran conceded. ``There's no question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Nagle emphasized that ``my position is the
speaker's position. We are on the same page, singing the same song
in the same church.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with some State House sources saying Finneran was
surprised Kraft signed a deal with Connecticut, and some House
members worrying about the long-term image of the House as a
chamber where representatives don't dare cross the speaker, Nagle
clearly wanted to signal a new stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think almost anything can be compromised,'' said Nagle, a
Northampton Democrat. ``I think there is a general interest in
trying to do something so that everybody's needs are met in
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Finneran has struck an antagonistic stance toward
Kraft, essentially saying the team owner would have to take a deal
on the speaker's terms. Asked Monday whether he would reconsider
his position on the stadium _ which at last offer was $57 million
in publicly-financed infrastructure along Route 1 in Foxborough _
Finneran first shrugged off questions. But later, turning to
several House members, he suggested that the House had little
interest in revisiting its stance.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the message from Nagle Tuesday, who said several
times that Democratic representatives want to find a way to keep
the team in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House would be interested in entering into some sort of
discussion,'' Nagle said. ``It would probably redefine the
parameters of what we have been discussing with Bob Kraft. There is
an opportunity for movement that I think is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagle stressed that he didn't think the House would move on the
fundamental issue where Finneran has balked: Buying land that Kraft
owns around the current stadium and having Kraft lease it back from
the state.
</P>
<P>
   However, Nagle said he thought there were other ways to solve
Kraft's needs. ``There are a whole host of things that could be
looked at,'' he said. ``We could look at who owns the land and who
would acquire it.'' Nagle offered no further elaboration on that
point, saying he didn't want to negotiate in the pages of the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Patriots declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the memorandum of understanding that Kraft and
Governor John Rowland signed last Thursday, the team owner has
placed $2 million in an escrow account to show good faith that he
will not negotiate with another state until Dec. 31 or after the
Connecticut Legislature votes on the issue, whichever comes first.
Kraft would forfeit the money if he breaks the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said Tuesday that legislators
could be called back to vote on the stadium proposal as early as
Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Finneran is taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the ball is in the court of the Connecticut
Legislature,'' he said. ``But we never said never. That's not an
appropriate style of negotiations.''

 CDs FROM PLAYER-PIANO ROLLS: PERFORMERS DUPLICATED, LIKE SHEEP?  (bl) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geneticists have their Dolly. They also have the goods on Thomas
Jefferson: the old miscegenator long suspected, now betrayed by his
own DNA. Where the progress of science is concerned, art is rarely
far behind, and now comes Sergei Rachmaninoff, dead since 1943,
walking among us again.
</P>
<P>
   Telarc has released ``A Window in Time,'' a CD made from piano
rolls, and promises another in March. On the first, the great man
plays his own music and arrangements ranging from Bizet to ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.'' On the second, Rachmaninoff addresses the
significant (Chopin, Schubert, Mendelssohn) and the less
significant (Henselt, Rubinstein and bowdlerdized Bach, Beethoven
and Gluck). The music comes from a process developed by Wayne
Stahnke, who got his ideas working on the Voyager space mission for
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   My colleague Harold C. Schonberg, who experienced Rachmaninoff
in the flesh, says that Telarc's reproductions come eerily close to
the Rachmaninoff he remembers; he also says that the 78-rpm record
and the player piano don't. I don't know who or what played these
performances, but they constitute masterly pianism.
</P>
<P>
   Is this Rachmaninoff positively identified, in the manner of our
third president, or Rachmaninoff duplicated, after our famous
Scottish sheep? Let ontology and science battle this one out. The
results are extraordinary. Played on a mechanized and electrified
Boesendorfer piano, the performances have a nuance and
sophistication that no original disk or previous piano-roll
technology comes close to. How does it work? Let not the blind lead
the potentially sighted. Suffice it to say that a transformation
takes place that moves discourse from mechanics-speak to
electricity-speak.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional player piano (high-end purveyors prefer the term
``reproducing piano'') can't avoid spillage. For no matter how
sophisticated the old Ampico process in registering touch, pedal
and expression, pumping air through perforations on mass-produced
sheets of paper invites small miscalculations of hand and machine,
and the debilitating frictions of moving mechanical parts. Stahnke
first devised his own updated player piano, powered by electric
current, not air pressure. Assuming that the local power company
kept things steady, commands to the keyboard could be received
through circuitry without hindrance. Bypassed are the dangers of
misaligned machinery or the vagaries of flagging feet pumping
pedals furiously at home.
</P>
<P>
   The next obstacle was the purity of source; and when Stahnke
could not find the master rolls used as manufacturing templates, he
managed, through computer hocus-pocus, to recreate them from their
imperfect offspring on the retail market. Much refined, the
perforations pass before a computer scanning process and the
results are stored on hard disks.
</P>
<P>
   One can argue that Stahnke's process is just one further
refinement on the original process, and that too much excitement
over it reinforces the myth of attainable reality: that the gap
between the event and our mechanical memory of it will eventually
narrow into nothingness. Live and recorded performance are separate
experiences and need to be received as such. I also believe that
too much machinery takes our minds off music. Yet what one hears
from these CD's seems less a new stage than a whole new event.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Dolly. Previous technologies _ early recordings, old
piano rolls and the modern Disklavier _ are a little like building
an elaborate mechanical sheep that at its best moments walks on all
fours, simulates eating grass with reasonable verisimilitude but
could never cause the perspicacious mutton-lover to salivate. What
Stahnke and Telarc do to Rachmaninoff comes close to cloning. At
least, the relationship of original to copy is close enough to make
us worry.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Chopin's B flat minor Scherzo on the disk not
yet released is one that few humans or humanoids would disavow. The
familiar Gluck air from ``Orfeo,'' also in the second volume, has
an intimate personal vocabulary that one can't keep from calling
human. Inhumanity pops up elsewhere and in ways that make it hard
to decide whom to blame. That Mendelssohn's ``Spinning Song,'' a
modest character piece, becomes a virtuoso race course, and the
last of Schubert's Opus 90 Impromptus a kind of abstract mechanical
drawing, may have to do with pianistic ability out of control. On
the other hand, perhaps the source is less to blame than the
process that cleansed it.
</P>
<P>
   Other items are so scientifically perfect that they make the
flesh crawl. The absolute symmetry of touch in Rimsky-Korsakov's
``Flight of the Bumblebee,'' for one, is deeply suspicious.
Schonberg may tell me that this is the way Rachmaninoff played, but
I feel the presence of a synthetic process dedicated to righting
the weaknesses of fallible man, a perfect sheep updating the
accidents of nature.
</P>
<P>
   These are not releases intended for musical discovery. Very few
of the items here are of vital artistic consequence; it is how they
are done that is significant. The confusing mix of virtuosities
gives one little idea where pianist leaves off and machine begins.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts that hidden somewhere in the collective
unconscious is a unified field theory binding science to the arts
should read the newspapers and then listen to these disks. For they
elicit exactly the delight and dread we feel toward scientists
fiddling with creation. I'm not sure whether I am listening to
Rachmaninoff, Stahnke or a shadowy doppelganger: some artificial
conglomerate made in the laboratory but claiming a life of its own.

INSURANCE COMMISSIONER WANTS OUT, SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts Insurance Commissioner Linda Ruthardt,
who has presided over declining auto and workers' compensation
rates and a series of hot-button controversies in her 5 1/2 years
in the job, wants to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Two people close to Governor Paul Cellucci said Ruthardt
informed the governor's office in the last few days of her desire
to leave. Both sources, who did not indicate when the commissioner
planned to depart, said she had not been asked to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A Ruthardt spokesman denied she was leaving. ``There is no truth
to the rumor, and I cannot substantiate your sources of
information,'' said Christopher Goetcheus, a spokesman for the
Division of Insurance. Ruthardt declined to comment. A Cellucci
spokesman said the governor's office would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt is hardly the only change in the offing as the Cellucci
administration starts to focus in earnest on its new term. The top
jobs at the departments of environmental affairs and public safety
are open. Administration insiders say there could be an unusual
amount of shifting of key personnel in the term.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci sources said there was no obvious choice to replace
Ruthardt, whose salary is $86,580 a year. One name mentioned was
Julie Bowler, Ruthardt's first deputy. But Bowler, seen as close to
new Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift, lacks heavy insurance
experience, having arrived at the division only this summer from
the department of Medicaid assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt has been a good-news, bad-news insurance commissioner
for the Weld and Cellucci administrations.
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure, the state has seen unprecedented drops in
auto and workers' compensation insurance rates. Auto rates have
fallen four years in a row, with the average Massachusetts driver
today paying $798 for insurance, or $120 less a year than in 1994,
Ruthardt's first full year in office. Workers' comp rates have been
nearly cut in half in five years.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruthardt has also been involved in an unusual number of
high-profile dustups and been the subject of barrage of complaints,
mainly that she conducted too much business behind closed doors and
tried to thwart access to public documents.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the state attorney general, citing ``ethical issues''
raised by the division's conduct, took the rare step of refusing to
defend her in a dispute with a consumer group over the
demutualization of a Worcester insurer. In another case, she
quickly approved a Massachusetts insurer's move to Bermuda, only to
have the company file for liquidation a few months later; that move
touched off an embarrassing series of reversals that dragged on in
the courts for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently Ruthardt has been criticized by the attorney
general and consumer groups for a private meeting she held with an
insurance industry executive just before the current round of auto
rate hearings was to begin. Her longtime head of the State Rating
Bureau, the division unit that helps sets rates, criticized
Ruthardt as being too cozy with the industry and too ready to serve
the political interests of Weld and Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance job is always tough because it deals with
pocketbook issues that effect consumers. And administrations are
loathe to second guess insurance commissioners because the issues
are arcane and technical. But her style has dogged her in a way
that hasn't other commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Said one Cellucci insider Tuesday: ``She was regarded as
well-intentioned and honest, but she lacks certain personal and
public relations skills. And that hurt her.''
</P>
<P>
   The next commissioner will have no bigger job than overseeing
the complex demutualization of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance
Co. The process of cashing out current policyholders and selling
shares of the company to the public could take up to two years, and
is sure provoke questions over whether the insurer's surplus is
being divided equitably.

WILLIAMS OFFER MAY REACH 8 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox, demonstrating anew Mo Vaughn's maxim that
when they really want a player, they pull out all the stops to sign
him, were hopeful Tuesday night that their seven-year offer to
Bernie Williams would be enough to land the free agent center
fielder.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette, after two days of meetings in
Atlanta with Williams and his agent, Scott Boras, returned home
Tuesday to Boston, where he was expected to update CEO John
Harrington. On Monday, Duquette made a seven-year offer in the
neighborhood of $80 million for the American League's reigning
batting champion, and there were indications that the Sox would
consider adding an eighth year as an option, which could make
Williams's deal the biggest to date in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   It also could seal the deal quickly, maybe even by Thursday,
though Boras said Tuesday there are still five teams interested in
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question Dan Duquette came down here with the right
arsenal to demonstrate that Boston is sincere about Bernie
Williams,'' said Boras, who refused to discuss specifics of the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Jimy Williams joined Duquette in Atlanta and met
with the outfielder for four hours, and Duquette apparently made a
compelling argument to Bernie Williams to leave his incumbent team,
the New York Yankees, and join the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, of course, was more persuasive than Duquette's
willingness to offer a deal that obliterated the five-year, $63
million offer the Sox made to Vaughn, who turned that down and
subsequently was told that the Sox would negotiate no further.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Yankees have not budged from their refusal to offer
a seven-year contract to Williams, who in Tuesday's editions of the
Bergen (N.J.) Record questioned how much the Yankees want to retain
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't perceive them having a lot of interest,'' he said.
``They keep saying I'm their top priority, but when it really comes
down to it, they don't show it. I guess that's just part of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees apparently have decided to pursue free agent left
fielder Albert Belle instead, and likely will make a trade for a
center fielder, having already talked to the Montreal Expos about
Rondell White. The Anaheim Angels, once they sign Vaughn, also
appear willing to deal Jim Edmonds for a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were indications Tuesday night that the Yankees were
attempting another meeting with Williams and Boras. Last week, the
agent had two days of talks with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks, whose manager, Buck Showalter, is
close with Williams from their days together with the pre-Joe Torre
Yankees, also are a major player. How far the Diamondbacks are
willing to go on Williams, however, may hinge on whether they can
sign free agent pitcher Randy Johnson. If they sign Johnson, it's
unlikely they would push for Williams, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles expressed interest in Williams, too, but they are
expected to retain free agent first baseman Rafael Palmeiro and
have indicated that Williams's price tag is beyond what they're
willing to spend. If there is indeed a fifth bidder, that team has
yet to surface publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, speaking from his Easton home Tuesday, reiterated that
he expected to sign ``very soon'' with the Angels, who made a
six-year proposal for $72 million that could be worth closer to $80
million if incentives and performance bonuses were met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something will happen,'' Vaughn said. ``I can't say
today, but very soon, though. I think something is going to go down
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said he knows of no other team that has made an offer for
him, and that given the way the Angels have treated him, he could
not envision signing with a last-second bidder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it would be kind of unfair if something was put
forth by somebody else, to take that, unless this thing falls off
the face of the earth,'' Vaughn said. ``They've been very
straightforward with me, showed faith in me, and straight up the
whole time. That's definitely something I'm not used to, and it's
definitely been real nice. I feel myself pretty much excited, with
a chance to do a lot of good things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never interested in pitting one team against the other.
I think Anaheim can be a great situation. For anybody to come in
the back door doesn't mean much right now. Anaheim, from 9 o'clock
in the morning on the first day of free agency, showed themselves,
and that's important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he has had conversations with Johnson, urging him
to sign with the Angels, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me,'' Vaughn said. ``We've been talking. We have a lot
of respect for each other, and we've been talking. We've both
expressed interest in being together. Will it happen? I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that the Sox have offered at least seven years to Williams,
Vaughn said, ``It's like I've always said. The Red Sox sign the
players they want to sign. But I hold no grudges. I had some great
years here, but it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams would play center field and bat third in front of Nomar
Garciaparra in a revised Red Sox lineup that also would feature a
new leadoff hitter, Jose Offerman, with John Val-entin expected to
bat second. The Red Sox already have a center fielder, Darren
Lewis, who signed a three-year, $7 million deal earlier this month
expecting to return to center. Lewis played some right field last
season, too, but Williams's signing would seem to make him
expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette had said last week that the Sox would be adding a
couple of pitchers by now. Instead of offering a contract to free
agent Armando Reynoso, Duquette requested more medical information
on the righthander, who passed a physical with the Diamondbacks and
was offered a two-year deal for $5.5 million, with an option for a
third year.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also have talked to Boras about another client,
righthander Tim Belcher.

<P>
   The United States has been in revolutionary mode this week.
Though his spokesmen deny that Vice-President Al Gore intended in
his remarks in Malaysia on Nov. 16 to incite anyone to rebel
against the government, he minced no words in describing as
``brave'' the Malaysians who have been calling for political
reform.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, the United States now makes no secret of its earnest
wish to see Saddam Hussein overthrown, or of its support for the
opposition groups that it hopes will be the instrument of its
desires.
</P>
<P>
   Attempting thus to get rid of Hussein, a despot with a long
criminal record who is plainly dangerous both at home and abroad,
may be considered highly desirable. But Malaysia is not Iraq. It is
no danger to others, and is ruled by a relatively benign government
whose head, Mahathir Mohamad, though autocratic, is
constitutionally elected.
</P>
<P>
   Is the United States wading into dangerous waters?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, but it is right to do so nonetheless, so long
as it is aware of the risks.
</P>
<P>
   One risk, in Malaysia certainly, is that criticism may
strengthen the hand of the government, not of the opposition it is
intended to help.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitivities are acute in many countries, and criticism from
foreigners, especially from ``arrogant'' or ``inconsistent''
Americans, can often turn even opponents into nationalists. It may
also upset other allies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Philippines has been quick to applaud Gore's
remarks, other countries in the region have been more reticent.
They worry, no doubt, for the cohesion of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum, whose meeting it was that brought the
American vice-president to Malaysia in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   APEC is a fragile organization, they may reckon, and needs to be
strengthened, not weakened, if it is to last.
</P>
<P>
   Similar worries also apply in Iraq. Hussein makes capital from
his readiness to defy the might of America, and this goes down well
in parts of the Arab world, where the United States needs all the
friends it can find.
</P>
<P>
   But other concerns loom larger in Iraq. In Malaysia, dangerous
critics may get beaten up; in Iraq, if they are caught, they are
certain to be tortured and killed.
</P>
<P>
   There are practical difficulties in helping them, too. The Iraqi
opposition is ineffective, divided and largely in exile. Much of it
is also unsavory: many of those who might conceivably carry out a
coup are themselves implicated in Hussein's crimes. And many of the
others, having lost faith in getting decisive help from outsiders,
have come to unspoken arrangements with his regime.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable that America could nonetheless fortify the
opposition enough to worry Hussein. After all, though the Bay of
Pigs operation to remove Fidel Castro in 1961 ended in fiasco, the
decision to arm opponents of Soviet rule in Afghanistan in the
1980s proved much more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this example should be cautionary. Driving the Russians
out of Afghanistan involved a hideous civil war that even by 1987
had claimed the lives of perhaps 1.24 million people, mostly
civilians. And out of it emerged a battle-hardened breed of Muslim
fanatic, the Afghanis, who are now blamed for most of the acts of
international terrorism carried out against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unintended consequences of a civil war in Iraq could
be the breakup of the country. In an ideal world that might be
desirable, especially if it led to the establishment of a state for
one of the world's stateless nations, the Kurds. But it would
horrify Turkey, an American ally, never mind Iran and Syria, each
of which has its own Kurdish minority. Civil war in Iraq could turn
into regional chaos.
</P>
<P>
   So why is America right to wade in? Essentially, in Malaysia,
because America's long-term national interest is to stand up for
the values upon which George Washington's country is founded and by
which it still lives.
</P>
<P>
   These values sometimes produce awkward outcomes: it is possible,
for instance, that a Malaysian government led by Anwar Ibrahim, the
former finance minister now being prosecuted for sodomy and
corruption, would be no easier to deal with than Dr. Mahathir's. It
might even be no friendlier to the West.
</P>
<P>
   But if democratic values are not openly defended by the United
States _ and by their other proponents, whether in Asia or anywhere
else _ they will not in the long run triumph, and people everywhere
will be the poorer.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the short run, there will be costs. APEC, for instance,
for all its fragility, is not well served by the studious lack of
mutual criticism most of its members observe: it will not gain
strength through silence.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq, more immediate considerations apply. As long as Iraq is
run by a man who is plainly intent on gaining weapons of mass
destruction, whatever his latest promises, the outside world must
do whatever it can to frustrate him.
</P>
<P>
   The means at its disposal are limited: weapons inspections,
sanctions, diplomacy backed by the credible threat of force _ and
support for the opposition, both Arab and Kurdish, albeit without
encouraging foolish ideas about independence for Kurdistan.
</P>
<P>
   All of these have their risks and drawbacks. None is guaranteed
to work indefinitely. Indeed, imagination may be needed to make
them work better, or at all. A way must be found, for example, to
enable Iraq to pump the oil it is entitled to export, so that it
can buy the food and medicine needed to alleviate the suffering of
its people.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, in Iraq as in Malaysia, peace and
prosperity will come only with stable democracy. America is right
to say so. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, people have had Malthusian nightmares about global
population growth. Although, in some countries, too many babies
have put pressure on food distribution, the environment and the
supply of school places and health care, Malthus has mostly turned
out to be bunk.
</P>
<P>
   But his gloomy predictions frightened successive Chinese
Communist leaders into the most outrageous population policy the
world has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to quadruple Chinese living standards per head by
2000, Mao and his successors took the simple expedient of banning
the growth in the number of heads.
</P>
<P>
   But the result will be to exacerbate an entirely new sort of
demographic crisis in the next century, when China will become the
oldest poor country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some of what has happened in China has happened all over eastern
parts of Asia: a phenomenon that Nicholas Eberstadt, an American
demographer, has dubbed ``a world population implosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Far faster than in the industrial world, life expectancy has
risen and fertility has declined. Yet China is aging much faster
than any comparably poor country has ever done before, thanks at
least partly to its one-child policy.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility seems already to have fallen below the level needed to
replace the population. If that doesn't change, more than one in
five Chinese will be 60 or older by 2030, and the absolute size of
its work force will have begun to decline.
</P>
<P>
   If this comes about, unlike most countries China will have grown
old before, rather than after, it has grown rich.
</P>
<P>
   The main consequence will be a big burden on those of working
age. Too many grandparents will need family and financial support;
not enough youngsters will be around to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the family still takes primary responsibility for caring
for the old, middle-aged women will find themselves looking after
several old folk, and unable to work just when they most need to be
building up savings for their own old age.
</P>
<P>
   As for people at work, they will foot the bill for, among other
things, health care and pension schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these demographic trends were to change, China would
still need to reform financial support for the old. A pension is a
luxury enjoyed mainly by China's minority of urban workers in state
jobs; most old folks receive nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the obligation on state firms to support former employees
is one of the biggest barriers to the industrial restructuring that
China desperately needs to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   To disentangle this mess, the government plans to create a
single unified scheme. So far, though, it has merely created a new
sort of mess, with pension obligations fragmented among
municipalities, rather than among firms.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious is the need to make sure that the money people
are saving for their old age is well invested. The World Bank is
urging the creation of a properly funded scheme.
</P>
<P>
   China's savings rate is more than 40 percent of GDP; as in much
of East Asia, baby-boomers are busily squirrelling away cash to
help them through their twilight years. But in China, where banks
are fragile and the stock market primitive, the pensions pile is a
standing temptation to fraud and waste.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic issue for China, however, is whether the
government should continue to tell women how many children to have.
</P>
<P>
   The one-child policy has already softened at the edges: rural
families are frequently allowed two children, especially if their
firstborn is a girl; and when two only-children marry each other,
they are allowed two babies. But the government continues to
intervene, on a scale unknown anywhere else in the world, in
people's reproductive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese individuals have long had their fertility decisions
interfered with by their extended families, but never before, even
in China, has the state itself decided how many babies millions of
women should have. Undoubtedly, most families would like to decide
for themselves how many children to have.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way fertility has declined throughout East Asia, it
seems unlikely that births would rise dramatically if families were
given plenty of advice, access to contraception and then left to
themselves. But a few more babies would make all the difference to
the lives of China's old folk in a couple of decades from now. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Chinese individuals have long had their fertility decisions
interfered with by their extended families, but never before, even
in China, has the state itself decided how many babies millions of
women should have. Undoubtedly, most families would like to decide
for themselves how many children to have.
</P>
<P>
   Given the way fertility has declined throughout East Asia, it
seems unlikely that births would rise dramatically if families were
given plenty of advice, access to contraception and then left to
themselves. But a few more babies would make all the difference to
the lives of China's old folk in a couple of decades from now. &QL;

<P>
   For years, people have had Malthusian nightmares about global
population growth. Although, in some countries, too many babies
have put pressure on food distribution, the environment and the
supply of school places and health care, Malthus has mostly turned
out to be bunk.
</P>
<P>
   But his gloomy predictions frightened successive Chinese
Communist leaders into the most outrageous population policy the
world has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to quadruple Chinese living standards per head by
2000, Mao and his successors took the simple expedient of banning
the growth in the number of heads.
</P>
<P>
   But the result will be to exacerbate an entirely new sort of
demographic crisis in the next century, when China will become the
oldest poor country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Some of what has happened in China has happened all over eastern
parts of Asia: a phenomenon that Nicholas Eberstadt, an American
demographer, has dubbed ``a world population implosion.''
</P>
<P>
   Far faster than in the industrial world, life expectancy has
risen and fertility has declined. Yet China is aging much faster
than any comparably poor country has ever done before, thanks at
least partly to its one-child policy.
</P>
<P>
   Fertility seems already to have fallen below the level needed to
replace the population. If that doesn't change, more than one in
five Chinese will be 60 or older by 2030, and the absolute size of
its work force will have begun to decline.
</P>
<P>
   If this comes about, unlike most countries China will have grown
old before, rather than after, it has grown rich.
</P>
<P>
   The main consequence will be a big burden on those of working
age. Too many grandparents will need family and financial support;
not enough youngsters will be around to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the family still takes primary responsibility for caring
for the old, middle-aged women will find themselves looking after
several old folk, and unable to work just when they most need to be
building up savings for their own old age.
</P>
<P>
   As for people at work, they will foot the bill for, among other
things, health care and pension schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these demographic trends were to change, China would
still need to reform financial support for the old. A pension is a
luxury enjoyed mainly by China's minority of urban workers in state
jobs; most old folks receive nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the obligation on state firms to support former employees
is one of the biggest barriers to the industrial restructuring that
China desperately needs to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   To disentangle this mess, the government plans to create a
single unified scheme. So far, though, it has merely created a new
sort of mess, with pension obligations fragmented among
municipalities, rather than among firms.
</P>
<P>
   Even more serious is the need to make sure that the money people
are saving for their old age is well invested. The World Bank is
urging the creation of a properly funded scheme.
</P>
<P>
   China's savings rate is more than 40 percent of GDP; as in much
of East Asia, baby-boomers are busily squirrelling away cash to
help them through their twilight years. But in China, where banks
are fragile and the stock market primitive, the pensions pile is a
standing temptation to fraud and waste.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic issue for China, however, is whether the
government should continue to tell women how many children to have.
</P>
<P>
   The one-child policy has already softened at the edges: rural
families are frequently allowed two children, especially if their
firstborn is a girl; and when two only-children marry each other,
they are allowed two babies. But the government continues to
intervene, on a scale unknown anywhere else in the world, in
people's reproductive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese individuals have long had their fertility decisions
interfered with by their extended families, but never before, even
in China, has the state itself decided how many babies millions of
women should have. Undoubtedly, most families would like to decide
for themselves how many children to have.
</P>

seems unlikely that births would rise dramatically if families were
given plenty of advice, access to contraception and then left to
themselves. But a few more babies would make all the difference to
the lives of China's old folk in a couple of decades from now. &QL;

   LA PALOMA RANCH, CHARLOTTE, TEXAS _ What makes Texas different?
Not just that Texans think of themselves as bigger and better than
other Americans, though of course they do; not that they live in
boots, wear bolo ties and show other weird sartorial flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   What really counts is that they, and not the federal government,
own the land they walk on.
</P>
<P>
   Given the size of Texas, it is extraordinary that it contains
virtually no public land. Even the most desolate sweeps of desert
are private fiefs protected by the toughest trespassing laws in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Other western states are a checkerboard of federal lands (Nevada
is 86 percent federally owned, Utah 64 percent). Less than 2
percent of Texas _ 2.7 million acres out of 171 million, or 1.1
million out of 69 million hectares _ belongs to the government.
</P>
<P>
   How did Texas come to be so independent? Largely because it was
independent. When the Republic of Texas joined the Union in 1845 as
a sovereign nation, it kept title to its unappropriated land. The
federal government received nothing. This was important to Texans.
Mexican rule had given them a mistrust of distant power.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the carnage of the Alamo, Texans forged a simple mantra:
Texas should always be in the hands of Texans. So it has remained.
</P>
<P>
   Even today the only large tracts of federal land in Texas have
either been bought (military bases) or donated (Big Bend National
Park). The rest is in private hands, from the small to the
extremely large.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, big ranches still gripped the imagination of
Texans. Just to mention the JA, the Four Sixes, the Wagoneer or the
Matador was enough to get them misty-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Big ranching families had a lustre that was part John Wayne,
part royalty. This is less true today. Suburbanization, the North
American Free-Trade Agreement, the trauma of the 1980s' oil bust, a
growing Latino population and a newly diversified economy have all
loosened ties to the land.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Texans knew more about the King Ranch than they
did about Michael Dell, the owner of Dell Computer, the richest man
in Texas. Today it is the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Texans are all too aware that even the biggest and most
profitable ranches earn less than any medium-sized Austin software
company.
</P>
<P>
   It is bad manners to ask a Texas rancher the size of his spread.
And, unsurprisingly, reliable statistics on land ownership are hard
to come by. Proposals to lay out who owns what, and how much, are
thrown out of the state legislature as soon as they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dismissed for what they are,'' says one official at
the Texas Land Office: ``federal, socialist, environmentalist
plots.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the broad brush strokes of landownership are clear.
Cattle-raisers still dominate the land. About 55 percent of Texas _
94 million acres _ is under ranch management, though the huge
ranches that remain are a shadow of their former selves.
</P>
<P>
   The Matador used to have 100 cowboys and 70,000 head of cattle;
now it has only eight cowboys and 7,500 cattle. Fencing and even
branding are contracted out to a new breed of freelance
day-laboring cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Dolph Briscoe, a colorful former governor of Texas and the
largest single landowner in the state (640,000 acres of south
Texas), points out that it used to take 15 cowboys two weeks to
round up his cattle. Now it takes half a day in a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, Briscoe is luckier than most. His children want to
follow in his footsteps. Texan ranchers are getting older: on
average, now, over 55. This does not bode well. Children who have
grown distant from the land are likelier to sell it than to work
hard to pay off inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Old giants such as the XIT, a 3 million-acre spread in the Texas
Panhandle, have long since been broken up. The other big ranches
are getting smaller, and smaller ranches more numerous.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most telling statistic on ranching in Texas is that
70 percent of the state's ranches now run fewer than 50 head of
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how high Texas may climb,'' ran a recent editorial
in the Dallas Morning News, ``its roots are in the range.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of a new breed of Texas rancher proves the point. Small
plots of 100 acres or less _ ranchettes _ have become popular with
city slickers. Developers shamelessly entice buyers by tugging at
their heartstrings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Own a piece of Texan history,'' says a brochure for land
parcels on the famous YO Ranch just west of San Antonio. ``Be a
Texan, buy land,'' exclaims another, pointedly playing on the
notion that owning a ranch is a patriotic duty.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, old-timers scoff at ranchettes. They may be big
enough to give a city boy some peace and quiet, they say, but they
are too small to be economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ranchette-owners,'' goes one crack, ``are 40-40 types. They
work 40 hours a week in the city and run 40 cattle out on their
land.'' The typical owner, it turns out, is a middle-aged, affluent
professional who was raised in rural Texas and wishes he was still
there.
</P>
<P>
   Ranchettes have pushed up land prices and, with them,
inheritance taxes. This has tempted some old-timers to sell out,
and this year's drought has driven more out of the business.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas ranchers are a tough breed. Most are reluctant to sell
the ranches their forebears worked hard to build. ``Hold on to the
land,'' they say, ``God's not making any more.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 950. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Yet, since land scarcely pays, giving profit margins of less
than 5 percent on big ranches even in a good year, ranchers are
being pushed into a painful shift in land-management.
</P>
<P>
   It is rather like the steps British aristocrats had to take to
hang on to their stately homes. Ranches, once jealously guarded
private preserves, are now almost obliged to be open to the public
and to market themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters who strayed on to ranch land used to be prosecuted. Now
they are welcomed with open arms _ assuming, that is, that they pay
handsomely. Tourist pursuits such as bird-watching are increasingly
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary King Ranch, once the biggest beef-producing spread
in the world, is now run by businessmen in Houston with a mandate
to earn money for the extended King clan.
</P>
<P>
   They have increased hunting on the 800,000-acre ranch and have
brought out a line of King products (this season, there is talk of
a King Ranch cologne). Cattle are now an afterthought; but profits
on the ranch have risen from $100 million in 1988 to $183 million
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a kind of Faustian pact,'' frets one rancher; ``the more
we open up our land, the less control we'll end up having.''
</P>
<P>
   Big ranches will survive, all right; but most of them, like the
King Ranch, will increasingly become corporate concerns. Ranch
managers will exact further efficiencies and supplement their
income with hunters and bird-watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Ranches which do not measure up, or are closer to the city, will
be broken up into ranchettes. And this tells a greater truth about
the Lone Star state. No matter how intoxicating the myth, the
bottom line is even more important. &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Cook County Hospital in Chicago is the inspiration for
the television drama ``ER.'' The real hospital, though lighter on
romance, is every bit as bloodsoaked: Cook County had to treat
nearly 900 gunshot wounds last year.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Daley, Chicago's mayor, would like the gun industry to
begin paying for that care and for the other costs associated with
violence caused by guns.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Chicago and Cook County have therefore filed suit
against 12 gun shops in the Chicago suburbs, 22 gun manufacturers
and four gun distributors.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks $433 million in compensation for gun-related
costs incurred since 1994 by the police, the emergency medical
services, the criminal justice system and the Cook County Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a product-liability case; rather, the suit alleges
that the defendants have created a public nuisance because they
knowingly design, market and distribute guns that will make their
way to Chicago and be used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The city has gathered some compelling evidence. In a three-month
investigation, undercover police officers bought 171 guns from
suburban gun shops while posing as gang members, motorcycle toughs
and soldiers of fortune complete with camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   They were sold the guns even though they said that they lived in
Chicago (where handguns are banned unless they were registered
before 1982), that they planned to use the guns to retaliate
against others, or that they were buying guns for people who did
not have a state firearm-owners identification card, which is
required for gun-ownership in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, when the officers made it clear that they planned
to use the gun for a street killing, a sales assistant recommended
a particular bullet because ``it doesn't go through the target and
hit a little girl on the next block.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the gun sellers are no different from a
tavern owner who plies a patron with drinks and then helps him to
his car.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-distributors and manufacturers stand accused of
providing the Chicago suburbs with more guns than can be absorbed
by the legal market.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Polsby, a law professor at Northwestern University who is
opposed to gun control, calls the lawsuit ``a novel take on the
theory of public nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   Public-nuisance statutes are designed to provide a legal tool in
cases where an offender does a small amount of harm to many people;
because it costs too much for a large number of plaintiffs to sue
on their own, the government can consolidate the claims and thus
deal with the matter more efficiently. Such laws have long been
used to close polluting factories or take down offensive
billboards.
</P>
<P>
   To win this case, according to Richard Epstein, a professor of
law at the University of Chicago, the city must prove ``a rather
elaborate chain of causation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to argue that the gun dealers are not fastidious
shopkeepers; it is another to prove them responsible for Chicago's
gun carnage. And gun-proponents argue that some guns actually deter
crime, saving taxpayers money.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the action is likely to be a winner, if not
necessarily in court. The suit will hit the gun industry in its
wallet, which is not nearly as fat as that of the tobacco industry:
it is expensive to mount a defense in any legal case, even one that
makes law professors scoff.
</P>
<P>
   It is also good politics for Mayor Daley, who is up for
reelection next year.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's voters have less tolerance for guns than most
Americans. George Ryan, a Republican, was elected governor of
Illinois this month in large part because he claimed to be tougher
on guns than his Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's anti-gun credentials are already rock-solid. In
addition to a ban on handguns, Chicago leads the country in the
number of guns confiscated and destroyed every year.
</P>
<P>
   The new lawsuit is neither a cheap nor a democratic way to deal
with the problem of guns; but Daley hopes, first, that he will win
it, and then that it will ratchet up pressure on the industry and
help him lobby for more stringent gun-control measures at state and
federal level. Soon after announcing the lawsuit, he flew off to
Washington to do just that. &QL;

<P>
   SHANGHAI _ In their small apartment in a back street of
Shanghai, Zhang Ziqiang and his wife gloomily reflect on their
predicament. He is 47, she 42, and in this richest and most
exhilarating of China's cities, their lives typify those of a
growing number of baby-boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang lost his job last November. He had worked all his life in
a hat factory, pressing caps. The firm was taken over by a bigger
one, the 150 workers laid off and the factory building sold. ``Only
the important people kept their jobs,'' he says sourly.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is in the same boat. The food shop where she served
merged with another in 1992. For a while, she sold bedding on
commission for one of China's new fly-by-night private companies.
Four months ago that, too, came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 60 percent of the people in this street are in the
same position,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhangs are luckier than many. Each receives a small monthly
payment from their former firm: Zhang, instead of earning 600 yuan
($72) a month, now gets 260 yuan, and his wife receives another 140
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   But the payments will not last much longer. So Zhang peddles
rice bowls and chopsticks in the street, while his wife gets up at
3 a.m. to cook rice balls and sell them to the queue at the local
bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   In much of China, skilled workers like the Zhangs are tasting
poverty and insecurity for the first time in a generation. The
baby-boomers are bearing the brunt of economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's economic reform will be at the cost of a whole
generation,'' according to Peng Xizhe, the director of the
Institute of Population Research at Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-boomers, and especially those born in the first half of
the 1950s (like Jung Chang of ``Wild Swans'' fame), have already
had more than their fair share of misfortune. They are an unusually
large age-group, the second-biggest in China's history.
</P>
<P>
   Their childhood saw the three-year famine that began in 1958, in
which 30 million Chinese died. As a result, their health is worse
than both younger and older Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   So is their education. Their high-school years coincided with
the cultural revolution, when many urban youngsters were packed off
to the country for a decade. Zhang, for instance, did not finish
high school because he was sent to Yunnan for nine years to plant
crops and cut trees.
</P>
<P>
   Not many baby-boomers managed to resume their education. So this
``most miserable cohort,'' as Peng calls them, is peculiarly
ill-prepared for the economic shock that has now hit the Zhangs and
so many of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I apply for jobs, I'm either too unqualified or too
old,'' says Zhang's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, at least 5.5 million workers are unemployed
(and therefore drawing no financial support), and more than 10
million are ``laid off,'' a euphemism for unemployment supported by
modest benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some people reckon that 30 million to 50 million Chinese workers
are unneeded. Meanwhile, about 8 million new people enter the work
force each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhangs' constant nightmare is that the pace of layoffs in
Shanghai will rise, depressing the market for chopsticks and rice
balls and increasing the competition on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Worse lies ahead. Many of the urban baby-boomers, Peng points
out, did not marry until they returned from their enforced rural
exile. The result was a marriage boom in the early 1980s _ just as
the one-child policy was entering its first and most dogmatic
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, younger people can often find loopholes that allow them
to have two children. But many baby-boomer couples, whose mediocre
education and interrupted working lives have so reduced their
ability to save, will find themselves in old age with only one
child to support them.
</P>
<P>
   They pose the most intractable aging problem anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is likely to be at its most acute in Shanghai.
There, fertility plummeted in the late 1960s _ almost a decade
before the rest of China _ and one-child families have been
standard since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy has risen by an astonishing 33 years in a mere
five decades. Since 1993, deaths among the city's official
residents have exceeded births.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for illegal immigrants, who pour into the city and
now account for over one-fifth of Shanghai's people, the population
of Asia's most ebullient city would have been contracting.
</P>
<P>
   But even the flood of immigrants will not prevent Shanghai from
becoming a city of the old within just over a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Peng, who has made a special study of the city's demography,
calculates that in 2025 one-third of the population will be 60 or
over, even if migrants continue to arrive at the present pace. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 825. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Where Shanghai leads, the rest of China will follow. The first
serious consequence of China's aging is the rapid rise in the
number of pensioners supported by the dwindling number of workers
in present and former state enterprises. As layoffs rise, some
companies find themselves with more pensioners than workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a report last year, the World Bank argued that the obligation
to pay pensions was slowing down the desperately needed
restructuring of China's industrial giants.
</P>
<P>
   By 2020, 16 percent of China's population will be 60 or older _
not far short of Japan's 17.3 percent in 1990. In urban areas, the
``dependency ratio'' (a figure that includes children as well as
old folk) may be above 47 percent in 2030, over three times the
1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will have a high-income economy's old-age burden with a
middle-income economy's resources for shouldering it,'' comments
the Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Shanghai, the Zhang household's misery is eased a little
by a loan from Mrs. Zhang's niece, a youngster who speaks good
English and works as a tour guide. Little does she know it, but she
may be supporting many more baby-boomers in the course of the next
four decades. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ In their small apartment in a back street of
Shanghai, Zhang Ziqiang and his wife gloomily reflect on their
predicament. He is 47, she 42, and in this richest and most
exhilarating of China's cities, their lives typify those of a
growing number of baby-boomers.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang lost his job last November. He had worked all his life in
a hat factory, pressing caps. The firm was taken over by a bigger
one, the 150 workers laid off and the factory building sold. ``Only
the important people kept their jobs,'' he says sourly.
</P>
<P>
   His wife is in the same boat. The food shop where she served
merged with another in 1992. For a while, she sold bedding on
commission for one of China's new fly-by-night private companies.
Four months ago that, too, came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 60 percent of the people in this street are in the
same position,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhangs are luckier than many. Each receives a small monthly
payment from their former firm: Zhang, instead of earning 600 yuan
($72) a month, now gets 260 yuan, and his wife receives another 140
yuan.
</P>
<P>
   But the payments will not last much longer. So Zhang peddles
rice bowls and chopsticks in the street, while his wife gets up at
3 a.m. to cook rice balls and sell them to the queue at the local
bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   In much of China, skilled workers like the Zhangs are tasting
poverty and insecurity for the first time in a generation. The
baby-boomers are bearing the brunt of economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's economic reform will be at the cost of a whole
generation,'' according to Peng Xizhe, the director of the
Institute of Population Research at Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
   The baby-boomers, and especially those born in the first half of
the 1950s (like Jung Chang of ``Wild Swans'' fame), have already
had more than their fair share of misfortune. They are an unusually
large age-group, the second-biggest in China's history.
</P>
<P>
   Their childhood saw the three-year famine that began in 1958, in
which 30 million Chinese died. As a result, their health is worse
than both younger and older Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   So is their education. Their high-school years coincided with
the cultural revolution, when many urban youngsters were packed off
to the country for a decade. Zhang, for instance, did not finish
high school because he was sent to Yunnan for nine years to plant
crops and cut trees.
</P>
<P>
   Not many baby-boomers managed to resume their education. So this
``most miserable cohort,'' as Peng calls them, is peculiarly
ill-prepared for the economic shock that has now hit the Zhangs and
so many of their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I apply for jobs, I'm either too unqualified or too
old,'' says Zhang's wife.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, at least 5.5 million workers are unemployed
(and therefore drawing no financial support), and more than 10
million are ``laid off,'' a euphemism for unemployment supported by
modest benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Some people reckon that 30 million to 50 million Chinese workers
are unneeded. Meanwhile, about 8 million new people enter the work
force each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Zhangs' constant nightmare is that the pace of layoffs in
Shanghai will rise, depressing the market for chopsticks and rice
balls and increasing the competition on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Worse lies ahead. Many of the urban baby-boomers, Peng points
out, did not marry until they returned from their enforced rural
exile. The result was a marriage boom in the early 1980s _ just as
the one-child policy was entering its first and most dogmatic
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Today, younger people can often find loopholes that allow them
to have two children. But many baby-boomer couples, whose mediocre
education and interrupted working lives have so reduced their
ability to save, will find themselves in old age with only one
child to support them.
</P>
<P>
   They pose the most intractable aging problem anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is likely to be at its most acute in Shanghai.
There, fertility plummeted in the late 1960s _ almost a decade
before the rest of China _ and one-child families have been
standard since the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy has risen by an astonishing 33 years in a mere
five decades. Since 1993, deaths among the city's official
residents have exceeded births.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for illegal immigrants, who pour into the city and
now account for over one-fifth of Shanghai's people, the population
of Asia's most ebullient city would have been contracting.
</P>
<P>
   But even the flood of immigrants will not prevent Shanghai from
becoming a city of the old within just over a generation.
</P>

<P>
   HONG KONG _ As Microsoft and Intel can attest, dominance is a
dirty word in the technology industry. Yet one giant has escaped
notice.
</P>
<P>
   VTech, Hong Kong's largest electronics firm, has more than 70
percent of a worldwide computer and electronics market worth more
than half a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Why has America's Justice Department not denounced this
shameless monopolist? Perhaps it is because VTech makes kiddie
computers and electronic learning toys. Its products go to pre-teen
children, not yet schooled in the art of antitrust complaints.
</P>
<P>
   VTech sells more computers of one sort or another (14 million
last year) than Dell and IBM combined. The market is growing
healthily, VTech's net profit margins are a very PC-like 10 percent
or so, and the firm will achieve $1 billion in sales next year.
</P>
<P>
   True, a lot of these ``computers'' have keyboard buttons shaped
like animals, go by such names as Little Smart Count 'n' Go Bug,
and sell for less than $30. But others are sophisticated notebooks,
with e-mail and spreadsheets, selling for several hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This makes VTech's dominance all the more surprising. The toy
industry is ruled by American giants such as Hasbro, Mattel and
Fisher-Price, huge marketing machines that control most of the
shelf space at Toys ``R'' Us and other retailers. All of them can
make, and have made, similar electronic learning aids.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Allan Wong, VTech's founder, runs out of fingers as he
counts the big toy firms that have entered his market in the past
15 years. But most soon leave: VTech's chief competitors today are
Team Concepts, another Hong Kong company, and Tiger, a Japanese
firm bought earlier this year by Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   From his offices in a dusty industrial complex near Hong Kong's
border with China, Wong seems genuinely bemused by VTech's
dominance, if not its success.
</P>
<P>
   It did not invent the market _ indeed, Wong got into electronic
educational toys in the early 1980s when Sears asked the former NCR
engineer to come up with something that could compete with Texas
Instruments' ``Speak and Spell,'' the first toy to have a
synthetic-speech chip.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it common in the fickle toy industry for one company to
rule a market segment for long. Only Lego comes close: for all
Barbie's durability, she has always had lots of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   VTech's advertising and marketing is modest by toy-industry
standards _ just 10 percent of sales, about half that of the big
American brands _ and it eschews daytime television, preferring to
advertise in Good Housekeeping magazine and other publications
aimed at parents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result children rarely know its name. It is adults, a far
more demanding audience, who decide whether or not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason VTech can dominate the business is the troubled
state of toy shops. Video games are taking more of children's time,
attention and money. Because they are bought by adults as well as
children, they are sold in computer and music stores rather than
toy shops.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us has closed 90 stores this year alone, and other
toy retailers are cutting both their shelf space and the number of
different toys and brands they put on those shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas leading products _ mostly produced by the bigger firms _
gain market share, lesser brands tend to be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies are thus vulnerable to VTech; but is it at
risk from the bigger firms? Probably not. They cannot, by and
large, be bothered to try to grab VTech's market.
</P>
<P>
   The market for ``educational learning aids,'' as such gadgets
are grandly called, is still just 2 percent of the overall toy
industry; and, thanks to VTech and its Asian competitors, margins
are less than half those elsewhere in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the research and development costs are dauntingly
high: making a computer is one thing, but making one with a large
LCD screen, keyboard and a mouse for less than $70 is quite
another. Each must be programmed in as many as a dozen different
languages, with voices and scripts produced by linguists around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Facing such costs, it is easy to see why companies making a
fortune on Toy Story figurines might be only too happy to leave
kiddie computers to VTech.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, too, why VTech, which will never have the marketing
clout of the rich-world giants, is happier using its market as a
launch pad into electronics than into other sorts of toys.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrolled by its toy sales, it has moved into cordless
telephones, and now has half the market in America for
high-frequency models, under its own label and for Lucent and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Now I've got a Little Smart ABC Playground, daddy, please can I
have a cordless phone? &QL;

computers and electronic learning toys. Its products go to pre-teen
children, not yet schooled in the art of antitrust complaints.
</P>
<P>
   VTech sells more computers of one sort or another (14 million
last year) than Dell and IBM combined. The market is growing
healthily, VTech's net profit margins are a very PC-like 10 percent
or so, and the firm will achieve $1 billion in sales next year.
</P>
<P>
   True, a lot of these ``computers'' have keyboard buttons shaped
like animals, go by such names as Little Smart Count 'n' Go Bug,
and sell for less than $30. But others are sophisticated notebooks,
with e-mail and spreadsheets, selling for several hundred dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This makes VTech's dominance all the more surprising. The toy
industry is ruled by American giants such as Hasbro, Mattel and
Fisher-Price, huge marketing machines that control most of the
shelf space at Toys ``R'' Us and other retailers. All of them can
make, and have made, similar electronic learning aids.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Allan Wong, VTech's founder, runs out of fingers as he
counts the big toy firms that have entered his market in the past
15 years. But most soon leave: VTech's chief competitors today are
Team Concepts, another Hong Kong company, and Tiger, a Japanese
firm bought earlier this year by Hasbro.
</P>
<P>
   From his offices in a dusty industrial complex near Hong Kong's
border with China, Wong seems genuinely bemused by VTech's
dominance, if not its success.
</P>
<P>
   It did not invent the market _ indeed, Wong got into electronic
educational toys in the early 1980s when Sears asked the former NCR
engineer to come up with something that could compete with Texas
Instruments' ``Speak and Spell,'' the first toy to have a
synthetic-speech chip.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it common in the fickle toy industry for one company to
rule a market segment for long. Only Lego comes close: for all
Barbie's durability, she has always had lots of rivals.
</P>
<P>
   VTech's advertising and marketing is modest by toy-industry
standards _ just 10 percent of sales, about half that of the big
American brands _ and it eschews daytime television, preferring to
advertise in Good Housekeeping magazine and other publications
aimed at parents.
</P>
<P>
   As a result children rarely know its name. It is adults, a far
more demanding audience, who decide whether or not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason VTech can dominate the business is the troubled
state of toy shops. Video games are taking more of children's time,
attention and money. Because they are bought by adults as well as
children, they are sold in computer and music stores rather than
toy shops.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us has closed 90 stores this year alone, and other
toy retailers are cutting both their shelf space and the number of
different toys and brands they put on those shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas leading products _ mostly produced by the bigger firms _
gain market share, lesser brands tend to be discarded.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller companies are thus vulnerable to VTech; but is it at
risk from the bigger firms? Probably not. They cannot, by and
large, be bothered to try to grab VTech's market.
</P>
<P>
   The market for ``educational learning aids,'' as such gadgets
are grandly called, is still just 2 percent of the overall toy
industry; and, thanks to VTech and its Asian competitors, margins
are less than half those elsewhere in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the research and development costs are dauntingly
high: making a computer is one thing, but making one with a large
LCD screen, keyboard and a mouse for less than $70 is quite
another. Each must be programmed in as many as a dozen different
languages, with voices and scripts produced by linguists around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Facing such costs, it is easy to see why companies making a
fortune on Toy Story figurines might be only too happy to leave
kiddie computers to VTech.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear, too, why VTech, which will never have the marketing
clout of the rich-world giants, is happier using its market as a
launch pad into electronics than into other sorts of toys.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrolled by its toy sales, it has moved into cordless
telephones, and now has half the market in America for
high-frequency models, under its own label and for Lucent and Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Now I've got a Little Smart ABC Playground, daddy, please can I
have a cordless phone? &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Buying computers at toy shops is old hat. The
novelty this Christmas will be buying your toys at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Amazon.com has confronted Barnes &AMP; Noble in the book
trade, so an Internet arrival, eToys, is vying with Toys ``R'' Us
to become the toyshop of the web.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in March 1997 with backing from idealab!, a Californian
venture capitalist, eToys launched its web service towards the end
of last year. So this is really the firm's first big Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 7,000 toys from 235 suppliers, eToys has more
items in stock than most bricks-and-mortar toy shops.
Unfortunately, it does not (yet) ship toys abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Toys are not obviously suited to being sold online. After all,
children love to try out the Lego and touch the Barbie dolls. That
is precisely why many parents are delighted to avoid a visit to a
real shop.
</P>
<P>
   At eToys, a search engine finds what you need, such as a toy for
a two-year-old girl who likes the Teletubbies, but is lumbered with
parents unwilling to pay more than $10.
</P>
<P>
   As well as finding birthday presents within a budget, the store
will wrap them and mail them. The web site is more than just a
glorified catalogue, featuring, for example, e-mail birthday
reminders.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester Research, a high-tech consultancy, estimates that in
2003 about 5 percent of all toys in America will be sold over the
Internet, generating revenue of $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   More books will be sold online, but the toy business will be
more profitable, since margins are higher, averaging 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since June, Toys ``R'' Us has had its own retail web site.
Although it is like eToys', the site stocks only 5,000 toys.
Whereas eToys pays a fee of 25 percent of any sales garnered from
referrals coming from partner web sites, such as AOL and Yahoo!,
Toys ``R'' Us has no partnership program, which is considered a
must in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us appears to find it hard to reconcile its new site
with its offline presence (even that is not healthy: it announced a
third-quarter loss of $475 million on third-quarter sales of $2.17
billion on Nov. 16). It must also learn how to run a mail-order
business, which, unlike Barnes &AMP; Noble, it has never done.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us may soon perfect its web site. It has a strong
brand, and can use its advertising to promote its Internet address.
It is also integrating its offline and online operations. Consumers
can, for example, return an item bought online at their local Toys
``R'' Us store.
</P>
<P>
   There is much to play for _ including foreign distribution, not
due to start until 1999 _ before eToys becomes the Amazon.com of
the toy world. &QL;

GROUPS SAY CITY PLAYING POLITICS WITH PARADE PERMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Giuliani administration is wielding its power to
grant or deny permits for parades, marches and protests as a
political weapon, contend several groups that say they have
struggled to get permits.
</P>
<P>
   The administration vehemently denies the charge, asserting that
hundreds of permits are awarded each year by police and parks
officials without regard to the applicants' identities or messages.
</P>
<P>
   But the groups say that to secure permits for demonstrations
that are at odds with the administration's political views, they
have had to agree to curtail their criticism, stage the events at
remote locations or sue the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's selective and it's politically selective,'' said Sara
Flounders, a coordinator with the International Action Center,
which has fought to get permits to protest against American
military interventions. ``Everything is done to discourage us.''
Her organization, she said, had to threaten to go to federal court
before it was granted a city permit to demonstrate in Times Square
against American bombing in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Three groups _ cabdrivers, organizers of the Million Youth March
and an organization that fights police brutality _ successfully
sued in federal court earlier this year to remove city
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   And in the latest ruling, a federal judge ordered the city on
Tuesday to allow Housing Works, an AIDS service group, to march
down Broadway and to hold an event at City Hall to commemorate
World AIDS Day.
</P>
<P>
   The city, voicing concerns over security and the cost of the
police, denied permits for the demonstrations. But the judge ruled
that the city had undercut its own arguments by staging much larger
events recently, with far greater security risks and police costs _
like the ticker tape parades and City Hall ceremonies for the
Yankees and for Sen. John Glenn. Housing Work said its parade would
draw 1,000 people; police estimated 3.5 million people attended the
Yankee parade.
</P>
<P>
   In the three earlier cases heard in federal court, judges
criticized the way the city handled parade and rally permits. One
judge suggested that the city's efforts this fall to prevent the
October 22d Coalition from marching down Broadway to protest police
brutality had more to do with the group's message than with the
police department's stated traffic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to say conclusively whether political interference
plays a role in the permit process. The administration says that
all it has tried to suppress is public disorder by insuring that
demonstrations are safe and do not clog city arteries.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Bronx borough president's office said the city
raised bogus concerns about police manpower and traffic in 1996 to
discontinue a tradition of converting a section of the Grand
Concourse into a pedestrian mall on Sundays. Borough President
Fernando Ferrer said the permit denial was based on his own
political antagonism with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, members of the Million Marijuana March, a group
that seeks the legalization of that drug, have accused parks
officials of conspiring to block their rally from Washington Square
Park this year.
</P>
<P>
   The group has staged a rally, calling it a smoke-in, for more
than two decades, usually in Washington Square. But officials,
supported by many community residents, contend that the event,
which is usually accompanied by widespread marijuana smoking and
dozens of arrests, has grown too large and rowdy for that site and
should be moved to Battery Park.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Parks Commissioner Henry Stern wrote the group a
letter saying applications for 1998 park permits would not be
accepted before January. But when the group showed up in January
with its application, officials said their traditional date, May 2,
had been claimed weeks earlier by a neighborhood family
association.

 (Update2 - changes 3rd graph)   AOL Deal A Boon for Sun Micro 
 &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Netscape Communications' operations will remain in Mountain View if
yesterday's $4.2 billion buyout by America Online goes through. But
whether Netscape has any future at all is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; As part of a sidecar deal, AOL and Sun Microsystems said they
will develop future versions of Netscape's software, including its
popular Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Netscape would be involved in the products, Sun's
chief strategy officer Bill Raduchel said simply, ``There is no
Netscape anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If the merger spells trouble for Netscape, it promises to be a
boon to Sun of Mountain View, which would be in position to mount a
major challenge to Microsoft in the fast-growing area of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, a leading maker of business computers, already is one of
the star players on the Internet. Its computers run the majority of
the world's Internet service providers, and the Java programming
language it developed has become a staple in creating interactive
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under a three-year agreement with AOL, Sun now also will have
Netscape's corporate software _ the stuff that lets corporations do
business online.
</P>
<P>
   In return for marketing rights to the Netscape software, Sun has
agreed to pay AOL more than $350 million up front, plus what the
companies termed ``significant minimum revenue commitments'' over
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Sun will recoup some of that investment because the deal also
calls for AOL to purchase $500 million worth of Sun's computer
systems and services at list price.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the deal a good one for Sun. ``It's a very
finite investment with a very good potential for return,'' said
Daniel Kunstler of J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Raduchel insisted that Sun was not to blame for holding up the
AOL-Netscape deal, denying speculation that his company held out
for better terms than AOL wanted to give.

   ``Both of us bargained hard, and both sides had to protect our
shareholders,'' he said. ``We finally had an agreement at 2:05
(Tuesday) morning.''
</P>
<P>
   By combining Sun's computers and Netscape's e-commerce software,
Internet service providers and online businesses would be able to
get all of their technology from one company.
</P>
<P>
   This will make Sun a more formidable competitor to Microsoft,
which went head to head with Netscape in e-commerce software but
does not sell hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives Sun the tools to be the competitor to Microsoft
they've always wanted to be,'' said analyst Rob Enderle of Giga
Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Sun also said they will develop new Internet devices
that will help users access the Web or AOL from anyplace. According
to Raduchel, those devices could be pagers, smart phones, set-top
boxes and portable Internet-only appliances.
</P>
<P>
   The new devices promise to be fertile ground for Java, and
perhaps a Java-based operating system that could rival Windows CE,
Microsoft's OS for handheld computers and other portable devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge over the next 20 years will not be speed or cost
or performance,'' said Raduchel. ``It will be a question of
complexity, and we're going to try to eliminate an awful lot of
that complexity.''

ACTIVISTS CALL FOR FBI PROBE AFTER SHOOTING OF 5TH ENDANGERED
WOLF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone has shot dead yet another endangered Mexican gray wolf
in eastern Arizona, the fifth one killed since the wolves were
brought back to the wild this year, federal officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wolf death has environmentalists calling for FBI
intervention, while some ranchers say now is a good time to abandon
the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt called the
latest killing ``incomprehensible,'' and she repeated Babbitt's vow
last week that the wolf reintroduction program _ and the goal of
returning at least 100 Mexican wolves to the wild in the next
decade _ will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are allegations that a $35,000 bounty has been
posted for the wolves' slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, that is the same amount the federal government
and environmentalists are offering for information leading to the
arrest of the wolf killer or killers.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there are only four wolves remaining in the wild, and
none is running free.
</P>
<P>
   The two surviving males from the original group of 11 brought to
the wilds of Arizona in January _ the first wild wolves in the
Southwest in 28 years _ were recaptured this week. There were
placed in pens with two new females Babbitt delivered last week
from the New Mexico ranch of cable-TV mogul Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Those four wolves will be released in about two months, and four
more wolf packs will arrive this winter.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wolf killing occurred near Hawley Lake, on the Fort
Apache Indian Reservation, between Show Low and Springerville.
</P>
<P>
   Like four others, the wolf appeared to have been shot, said Tom
Bauer, spokesman for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in
Albuquerque. Government biologists found the dead wolf Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Marks, a rancher and spokeswoman for the Arizona
Cattlemen's Association, said now is a good time to end the
program, since all the wolves have been rounded up and none is
running wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much money do they have to spend before they admit that
it's a failure, for the wolves and for the community? It's been a
cruel experiment,'' said Marks, who lives in the isolated Blue
Primitive Area, which has been the primary wolf release area.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Kieran Suckling, executive director of the
Southwest Center for Biological Diversity, said the federal
government should increase the reward leading to the arrest of the
wolf killers to $50,000 and begin releasing wolves in the Gila and
Aldo Leopold wilderness areas in New Mexico as well as the Blue.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle ranching, Suckling said, should be phased out in all
three areas; the government should close unneeded roads in the
Apache and Gila national forests, and provide full wilderness
status, which would ban mechanized vehicles, to the Blue range; and
ranchers should drop their federal lawsuit challenging the wolf
releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (ranchers) may not have pulled the actual trigger. But by
creating this anti-wolf climate up there, they have encouraged
whoever did it,'' Suckling said.
</P>
<P>
   Two leaders of Santa Fe environmental groups _ Pat Wolff of New
West Research, and Sam Hitt of Forest Guardians _ said the federal
government has failed to fully investigate information they have
collected that they say points to wolf bounties of up to $35,000
being offered by an as yet unidentified man from Catron County,
N.M.
</P>
<P>
   They said a tape recording they obtained of a federal prison
inmate in Tucson indicates a wolf bounty was being offered by
someone affiliated with the New Mexico ranching groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's laughable,'' said Caren Cowen, executive secretary of
the New Mexico Cattle Growers Association. ``Patricia Wolff has
really gone off the deep end this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pursuing our case through the courts. There is no
reason to go out and senselessly and needlessly kill an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Marks and Cowen said it is doubtful ranchers are the
killers because they not only would risk fines under the Endangered
Species Act of $100,000 and a year in prison, but they also would
risk losing their right to graze livestock on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Hitt, of Forest Guardians, also has called on Babbitt to bring
in the FBI, saying the law enforcement officers of the Fish and
Wildlife Service are prone to intimidation by ranchers and not
backed up by their superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said more federal officers are already assigned to the
case and there is no need to involve the FBI, but if the help of
other federal agencies is needed, he will call for it.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 wolves brought to the wild this year, five were shot,
three were recaptured for their own protection, one is missing and
presumed dead, and four remain. In addition, the pup of one of the
wolves killed _ the first wolf pup born in the wilds of Arizona in
half a century _ also is missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbie Holaday of Phoenix, the 76-year-old retired computer
systems analyst that led the decadelong charge to return the
wolves, called the wolf killings ``beyond comprehension.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so . . . difficult to think that there are people with so
much hate in their lives . . . to do such atrocious acts,'' Holaday
said. &QL;

FAMOUS, NOT-SO-FAMOUS MADE COWBOYS LOOK LIKE TURKEYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As you scowl at Minnesota Vikings defensive
lineman John Randle tomorrow, or curse Cris Carter and Randy Moss,
don't forget about ESPN television announcer Sterling Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, when he was a wide receiver for the Green Bay Packers,
Sharpe came to Texas Stadium and caught four touchdown passes from
quarterback Brett Favre. Only two other players in history have
scored four touchdowns in a game against the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   And though Jason Garrett rallied the Cowboys for a 42-31
victory, Sharpe's game remains the top performance by a Cowboys
opponent on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   That also means Sharpe tops Craig James' 112 yards rushing for
the Patriots in 1984 as best performance by a future television
announcer at Texas Stadium on Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of the unofficial all-time best Thanksgiving
Day performances by Cowboys opponents. They are a collection of
players, famous and not-so-famous, who made Cowboys fans sick to
their stomachs for more reasons than the undercooked stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Best performance by ...
</P>
<P>
   ...a former Cowboy: Duane Thomas was traded to the San Diego
Chargers after the 1971 season after run-ins with Tex Schramm and
Tom Landry. He found himself in Washington a year later, and in
1974, he got revenge against his former employers , rushing for one
touchdown and catching another. It took Clint Longley's miracle
pass to Drew Pearson in the final seconds to save the Cowboys,
24-23.
</P>
<P>
   ...a guy with a funny name: San Francisco linebacker William
Gerard ``Skip'' Vanderbundt had three touchdowns in his career. Two
came against the Cowboys on Thanksgiving in 1972, when he returned
a fumble 73 yards for one score, and returned an interception 21
yards for another. Also notable that day: Current Florida Gators
coach Steve Spurrier was the 49ers quarterback, and completed 16 of
24 passes for 177 yards with one touchdown in a 31-10 San Francisco
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ... future Hall of Famers: Paul Warfield played in two
Thanksgiving Day games here (1966, 1973), but he was held to just
two receptions for 67 yards and one touchdown. Bart Starr (9-of-21
passing for 83 yards in 1970) and John Riggins (12 rushes for 40
yards in 1978) were also future Hall of Famers who proved to be
Turkey Day flops.
</P>
<P>
   But there were games in 1979 and 1981 that could have served as
a highlight tape for two future Canton-bound players. In '79,
Houston Oilers rookie running back Earl Campbell had touchdown runs
of 61 and 27 yards and finished a 30-24 Oilers victory with 33
rushes for 195 yards, most ever by a Cowboys opponent on
Thanksgiving. Two years later, Chicago Bears running Walter Payton
sprinted to 179 yards on 38 carries, but the Cowboys survived a
nail-biter, 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, for those of you who wondered, the last time
Minnesota played in Irving, on Thanksgiving Day in 1987, the
Cowboys' tormentor was Anthony Carter, who had eight receptions for
184 yards and two touchdowns in a 44-38 Vikings win in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The game remains the highest-scoring Thanksgiving Day contest in
Cowboys history. Inside the locker room With injuries to Ernie
Mills and Deion Sanders, wide receiver Patrick Jeffers is getting a
lot of attention _ on and off the field. Jeffers said it has been
strange to see so many reporters at his locker lately. One reporter
asked Jeffers to describe his playing style. ``Ed McCaffrey!''
Jeffers said of the Broncos' 6-foot-5, 215-pound receiver. ``It
seems like all tall white guys get lumped into the Ed McCaffrey
boat. As long as they think I'm a slow white guy, then I'll keep
surprising them.'' ... Out in public at malls or at dinner, if
people are thinking it, they don't say it when they walk by Greg
Ellis. ``Nobody has ever come to my face and said, `Yeah, they
should have picked Randy \RMoss\S over you.' Randy's a good player.
Mr. \RJerry\S Jones knew he was a good player when he didn't take
him. He realized the best thing to do for this football team was to
take me. Randy, as everyone can see, is an excellent football
player. But they needed a defensive lineman here.'' ... Nate Newton
is always talking about how handsome he is. Well, last week,
somebody put a fake cover of ``People'' magazine in Newton's
locker. The cover superimposed svelte Newton under a headline that
billed him as ``America's Sexiest Man Alive, 1998.'' Joked Newton:
``A lot of the \RHollywood\S guys called me. The little guy from
Titanic \RLeonardo DiCaprio\S, it sunk his ship. He went under
after he saw that picture, man.''
YARDSTICKS: How far do the Cowboys have to go?
1st-and-10
</P>
<P>
   Everyone talks about how dangerous the Vikings are in their
three-wide receiver set. Well, Troy Aikman is no slouch himself
with three wide receivers on the field. Aikman's quarterback rating
when he has three wide receivers to throw to is 113.0.
</P>
<P>
   Running to daylight
</P>
<P>
   Here is yet another fact to show that running back Emmitt Smith
has nearly regained whatever it is he didn't have in 1996 and 1997.
He has 32 rushes for 10 yards or longer. That is third-best in the
league, just behind Barry Sanders (35) and Terrell Davis (33).
Throw him the ball
</P>
<P>
   Leading rookie-of-the-year candidate Randy Moss is getting a lot
of ink for his big-play ability. But the Vikings should not forget
about Michael Irvin. He ranks among the league leaders with eight
catches this season of at least 25 yards or longer.

IT'S TIME TO START THINKING FANTASY BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fox Sports Online is launching a Winter Fantasy Baseball league
using statistics from the past Major League Baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's the easy part.
</P>
<P>
   The tough part: Fox Sports Online will use complete statistics
from ``random'' games that were played the past season. That means
fantasy managers won't be able to load their rosters with Mark
McGwire, Sammy Sosa or Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   And that means more chance than strategy in this 54-game league.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our winter league, you don't have to be as hard-core _
you're not following 162 games,'' said Laura Sigman of Fox Sports
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Online is banking on NBA and NHL fans, as well as
baseball fans, to pluck down $19.95 and play Winter Fantasy
Baseball (www.baseballmanager.com).
</P>
<P>
   Fox Sports Online is teaming with GameLine, operators of the
Baseball Manager, for the game, which concludes its open enrollment
Monday. Baseball Manager was selected Best Fantasy Site on the Web
by ``Yahoo! Internet Life'' magazine.
</P>
<P>
   With Winter Fantasy Baseball, fantasy managers will be allowed
to draft players, set lineups and pitching rotations and
participate in trading and free-agent signings.
</P>
<P>
   Membership fees will also give managers access to exclusive
content including daily personalized winter-theme news headlines,
as well as box scores, league standings, league leaders and
statistics, and membership a bulletin board forum where fantasy
baseball managers can meet and discuss the season with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Even if chance is more a part of the game, Sigman said the
league performed well in beta-testing by GameLine.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the (NBA) lockout and the kind of year that baseball had,
it's a great time to launch it,'' Sigman said. &QL; 
Bytes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   News in hand: Do you own a handheld computer? Well, here's a
good reason to own one: The Sporting News Online
(www.sportingnews.com) has announced an agreement with San Mateo,
Calif.-based AvantGo Inc. to deliver sports news free to handheld
computer users. The Sporting News Online will provide content
updated hourly; AvantGo makes the software that accesses the data
from a handheld computer.
</P>
<P>
   Polls of the week: The NBA lockout will last longer than the
marriage between Chicago Bulls forward Dennis Rodman and
``Baywatch'' star Carmen Electra, according to 60 percent of 22,001
respondents in an ESPN.com poll. The two were married Nov. 14.
According to a CNN/SI.com poll, 31 percent (7,773 of 24,820)
predict the marriage will last only one month. Twelve percent said
the marriage will last forever.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Night update: Ten years after H.G. ``Buzz'' Bissinger's
book, ``Friday Night Lights,'' cast a critical eye on football
fanaticism at Odessa Permian High School, ESPN revisited Odessa
earlier this month to see how the book affected the community.

TCU, OKLAHOMA WON'T PLAY IN '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU athletic director Eric Hyman said
yesterday that TCU has released Oklahoma from a football contract
for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said he received the written request via fax yesterday,
although, discussions have been going on since July.
</P>
<P>
   The game is likely to be rescheduled for either the 2004 or 2005
season, said Horned Frogs director of football operations Charley
North.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma's departure leaves TCU with nine games under contract
for next season. TCU has seven Western Athletic Conference games
and two nonconference games against Arizona on Sept. 4 and
Northwestern on Sept. 11. The Arizona game is being tentatively
discussed as the Thursday night ESPN game.
</P>
<P>
   Because they travel to Hawaii, NCAA rules allow TCU to play a
12th game.
</P>
<P>
   TCU has three open dates, two of which look to be occupied by
Arkansas State and North Texas. A contract has been received on the
Arkansas State game (Sept. 25).
</P>
<P>
   North Texas is likely to occupy the open date on either Nov. 13
or Nov. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got a pretty good mix of games. Arizona is going
to be a Top 10 team and maybe go to the Rose Bowl,'' Horned Frogs
coach Dennis Franchione said. ``I'm pretty excited so far.''
Nothing from OU
</P>
<P>
   Franchione said he hasn't been contacted about interviewing for
the Oklahoma job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered to be mentioned,'' Franchione said, ``but I
haven't been contacted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Oklahoman has reported that Franchione was a
candidate. It quoted Hyman in Monday's editions as saying he could
``neither confirm nor deny'' whether he had been contacted for
permission to interview Franchione.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said yesterday not to read too much into that statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my policy to defer those questions to the coach or the
school,'' Hyman said.
Two Frogs make all-WAC
</P>
<P>
   TCU linebacker Joseph Phipps and place-kicker Chris Kaylakie
were selected to the Mountain Division first team as the Western
Athletic Conference released its all-conference selections.
</P>
<P>
   Phipps finished the season with 153 tackles, including a
school-record 95 solo tackles. Kaylakie connected on 15 of 20
field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The second team included six Horned Frogs: offensive linemen
Michael Keathley and Russ Sanders, running backs Basil Mitchell and
LaDainian Tomlinson, defensive end Aaron Schobel and defensive back
Reggie Hunt (DB).
</P>
<P>
   TCU's honorable-mention picks were J.W. Wilson and Curtis
Fuller.

TEXAS A&AMP;M'S WARRICK HOLDMAN THRIVES IN THE SHADOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ The reason Texas A&AMP;M outside linebacker
Warrick Holdman is not recognized as the star player on the team's
``Wrecking Crew'' perhaps can be summarized best one way _ Dat
Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dat has done a great job this year,'' said linebacker
Cornelius Anthony, who plays alongside the Butkus Award finalist.
``But if we didn't have a guy like Dat on the team, then Warrick
probably would be the center of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Living in the shadows as the Aggies head into the regular-season
finale Friday against Texas doesn't bother Holdman, who has twice
as many third-down tackles as his more famous teammate. Holdman
smiles in anticipation of the query.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at Dat first and then say, `Oh yeah, they've got
some other linebackers,''' Holdman said. ``But Dat and I have been
friends for five years now, and I'm happy for any recognition he
gets. And when Dat makes a big play, I try to get in there, too _
so they'll say Holdman was also in on that play. So I use him some
whenever I can. And I feel like if I just keep playing hard,
someone is going to notice.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone is disturbed by Holdman's relative lack of
recognition, it's Nguyen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel terrible about it,'' Nguyen said earlier in the year.
``Every time Warrick does something, they compare him to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a huge part of our success. He makes plays left and
right, but people still want to talk to me. I don't know why. Maybe
it's my nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubtful. But a fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dat isn't the name that he is,'' coach R.C. Slocum said,
``then all of a sudden you say this Warrick Holdman is making some
pretty big plays for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics back up Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   Holdman's 22 third-down tackles are two more than Nguyen's 1997
team-leading total. Holdman also leads the team in sacks (7),
passes broken up (8) and pressures (4). His 15 tackles for losses
are only three less than Nguyen's.
</P>
<P>
   Holdman's 79 total tackles trail only those racked up by the two
inside linebackers _ Nguyen (118) and Anthony (87). Considering
that Holdman plays only on one (the left) side of the defense, that
may be the most amazing statistic of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the plays that go away from him, you still find him
in the tackle somewhere because he's such a good athlete,'' safety
Rich Coady said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also a determined athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a statement this year,'' Holdman said. ``I
came into the year determined to cut loose, have fun and whatever
happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior's biggest statements are hard to pick out. He has
three double-digit tackle games. But his play in the victory over
Nebraska is perhaps most memorable. Holdman recovered a fumble in
the end zone, sacked quarterback Bobby Newcombe, made two other
tackles for losses and batted down a pass attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the most exciting games I've played in,''
Holdman said. ``A beautiful day, the crowd was hyped, a big game
with a high-ranked team in our stadium. It was big, but Texas is
bigger than Nebraska. Here, we know we can't lose to Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   That Ricky Williams is only 63 yards away from becoming college
football's all-time leading rusher adds to the game's aura, Holdman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes our defense stand out even more. Everyone is really
going to be watching the Wrecking Crew to see how we control Ricky,
how we control their offense, really.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going into the game with two things on my mind _ making
sure tackles on Ricky and putting pressure on the quarterback. If
Ricky gets the record, I'll be happy for him. But if we worry too
much about him, they'll beat us with the passing game.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect Holdman to be heavily involved in both areas.
</P>

COWBOYS' DEION PLAYS IT COY ON PLAYING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders wore a walking
cast to Valley Ranch yesterday to protect his sprained left big
toe. He took the cast off and was walking barefoot around the
locker room with a slight limp.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he will play against the Minnesota Vikings, he
smiled and said, ``Am I going to play? That's an interesting
question.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not sitting around wasting time. Before he left the locker
room, he asked team video director Robert Blackwell for tape of the
Vikings' only loss this season, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and running back Chris Warren did not practice. Running
back Emmitt Smith and offensive tackle Erik Williams went through
light drills. Each is listed as questionable on the injury report.
What's the play?
</P>
<P>
   The season-ending injury to Ernie Mills hurt the Cowboys in more
ways than one. Mills tutored the other wide receivers because he is
more familiar with Chan Gailey's offense.
</P>
<P>
   This fact is not lost on Michael Irvin, who wondered,
half-jokingly, about how he will know the plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ernie and Deion \RSanders\S are out there, every time
we'd call a play Deion would say, `OK, Ernie, what've I got?' ''
Irvin said. ``It's a good thing Deion is not playing offense
because there is no telling where he'd be running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if \RDeion\S turns to me, I'm going to say, `Hey,
partner, I got my own problems. You better figure it out yourself.
I don't even know where I'm going.' ''
Turkey Day advantage
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings coach Dennis Green says he doesn't mind that
the Cowboys always play on Thanksgiving Day. But he would like the
schedule-makers to have the Cowboys play on the road the week
before.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who hosted Seattle on Sunday, have not had to
travel since Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people have felt that they \RCowboys\S should be
on the road the week before,'' Green said. ``Playing at home on
Sunday and on Thursday, that's pretty good. That's a pretty sweet
deal.''
Itching to play
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mathis bemoaned his bad timing. He was the backup
cornerback when he fractured a forearm against the New York Giants
on Nov. 8. Had he been healthy, he would have seen his first
extended action when Sanders and Kevin Smith got nicked in the past
two games.
</P>
<P>
   But he is out until the Cowboys play Dec. 6 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get them to let me play this week, but the doctors
wouldn't let me,'' Mathis said. ``When I got hurt, I told Deion
that he couldn't get hurt. But I guess that didn't work.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are asking fans who attend the game tomorrow to wear
all white. In addition, white rags will be handed out for fans to
wave at the game. ... The Thanksgiving Day game next season will be
against Jimmy Johnson's Miami Dolphins or Bill Parcells' New York
Jets. ... Guard Everett McIver is scheduled to have surgery today
to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament.

AIKMAN SEEMS EVEN BETTER AFTER LAYOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ He can't throw the deep ball.
</P>
<P>
   He's too mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like the shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Such were some of the preseason comments regarding Cowboys
quarterback Troy Aikman's ability to adapt to coach Chan Gailey's
new wide-open offense.
</P>
<P>
   That all seems like folly now.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys (8-3) head into tomorrow's Thanksgiving Day
showdown with the Minnesota Vikings (10-1), Aikman has become more
formidable than ever in Gailey's spread-the-wealth offense.
</P>
<P>
   Few quarterbacks have been hotter in the past four weeks since
Aikman returned from a broken collarbone. He has completed 72 of
109 passes (66 percent) for 836 yards with six touchdowns and one
interception in leading the Cowboys on a four-game winning streak
and back into the realm of being a bona fide Super Bowl contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing a great job, an unbelievable job,'' Gailey said.
``But I always thought he was great for this offense. It's not
about people adapting to it. It's about putting people in position
to do what they do best.''
</P>
<P>
   What Aikman, 32, does best is read defenses and pick out
receivers. Gailey's offense simply maximizes those strengths _
which was evident the past two games in which Aikman completed
passes to eight receivers in a 35-28 victory against the Arizona
Cardinals and hit 10 receivers in Sunday's 30-22 victory against
the Seattle Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel comfortable with what we are doing and I feel like I'm
throwing the ball well,'' Aikman said. ``I feel like I've made
improvements with what we are doing over the past four weeks. I
feel good about the way things are going. Hopefully, that will
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Vikings coach Dennis Green said Aikman has been the difference
for the Cowboys. And he said the offense is turning the six-time
Pro Bowler into a bigger weapon than he was during the Cowboys'
Super Bowl title seasons of 1992, 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the new offense has done is give him more people to throw
the ball to,'' Green said. ``During the championship years, they
relied on the run, getting the ball to Michael \RIrvin\S and
occasionally throwing it over the top to Alvin Harper. He's
absolutely more dangerous now because you have to defend the whole
field. Any time a guy is open he'll be able to get them the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said that was the point all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm coaching defense, he's more dangerous because defense
is about monitoring threats,'' Gailey said. ``If you have to
monitor every threat, then it makes you less able to defense them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said nobody takes advantage of defensive mistakes better
than Aikman, because of his arm and his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys have the accuracy and can throw,'' Gailey said.
``But Troy sees the mistakes, anticipates and can put it there. The
physical part is just part of it. Troy is so sharp that it's
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikman has played well in the Cowboys' offense all season,
considering that the Cowboys averaged 30.6 points per game in the
six games that he has finished. However, there is no doubt that the
five-game injury layoff set back his development in Gailey's
system.
</P>
<P>
   But he has improved in each outing since he returned and is now
playing as well as anyone in the league. His combined quarterback
rating over the past four games of 107.5 tops that of Vikings
quarterback Randall Cunningham, who is the league's top-ranked
passer but has managed a rating of only 94.48 in his past four
outings.
</P>
<P>
   And Aikman's success has come despite not completing a single
pass to longtime favorite target Michael Irvin two weeks ago and
losing new-found favorite target Ernie Mills to injury Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt he's getting better with every game,'' Irvin
said. ``He's not just making the reads, but anticipating the reads.
That gives you a chance to look at one thing and throw back to
another because you know it's there. And the more he plays, the
better he's going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the scary part,'' Gailey added, ``is that he will continue
to get better.''

LAST YEAR'S HERO HOPES TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's a glass case in Mark Cusano's house that
contains the football he intercepted in the final minutes of USC's
victory over Notre Dame last season. Right next to it is a framed
letter he received from Notre Dame, when he was a high school
senior.
</P>
<P>
   These are the possessions he cherishes, and why no other player
at USC would enjoy the moniker ``Mr. Notre Dame killer'' quite as
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the hex. He's our Notre Dame hero,'' linebacker Chris
Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the senior linebacker ended USC's winless streak
against Notre Dame at 13 years when he batted down Ron Powlus'
fourth-down pass to preserve the Trojans' 27-20 victory in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cusano intercepted a Powlus pass with 2:34 left and
returned the ball 27 yards to set up the game-winning field goal in
USC's 20-17 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest moment of my life,'' Cusano said. ``As a
player, as anything, I don't think there's anything that's felt
better.''
</P>
<P>
   His reputation for beating the Irish is so revered, that some
USC fans have taken snapshots with Cusano pointing to the spot on
his arm where he deflected Powlus' pass in '96.
</P>
<P>
   No other USC player seems to relish playing Notre Dame like
Cusano, who always dreamed of playing for the Irish but never
received more than that single recruiting letter.
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of a payback each season for Cusano, who has grown to
dislike nearly every aspect of the Trojans' rival. Those feelings
began to peak when Cusano made his first visit to South Bend with
the Trojans when he was a freshman in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a dream of mine to finally be standing there. It took
my breath away,'' Cusano said. ``Then the little leprechaun started
yelling at us. I heard the fans and I instantly hated them. Tempers
flared on the field. I wanted to beat them more than anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about how I wanted to come to Notre Dame and now I want
to prove to them that I'm a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished. But as Cusano enters his final encounter
with Notre Dame, there's doubts about whether he'll even be on the
field enough to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano has been plagued by injuries since the Trojans opened
camp at UC Irvine. First, there was a hamstring injury. That was
followed by a sprained ankle and a pulled thigh muscle. He's played
in just eight games and started only one. He has 13 tackles this
season, the worst output of his four-year career. Before this
season, his lowest total was 50 tackles as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the most difficult year of my life, dealing with
football,'' Cusano said. ``I've never had injuries before and it's
been a learning experience. It's definitely frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to the injuries, Cusano has been healthy the past
four weeks but has played sparingly since he lost his starting job
to sophomore Zeke Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a huge disappointment to him and to me,''
USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``If your body will not allow you to
go, you can't let yourself fall apart. Mark has dealt with these
issues. It's the toughest part of the profession to see a young
person taken out of what they love to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It got even tougher against UCLA last week. After starting
outside linebacker David Gibson injured his thigh and left the
game, Cusano merely shared time with freshman Darryl Knight. He'll
be in a similar spot this week if Gibson is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been performing at the level of the three guys that
are ahead of me. I can't really ask for anything,'' Cusano said.
``I feel I'm doing my assignments, but I haven't done the extra
thing. Great players make great plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his role has been reduced, his teammates expect
something might happen, given his history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be hyped,'' Claiborne said. ``He's fought through a lot
of things this year. It would great if he had a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cusano can describe his Notre Dame moments as if they just
happened. He remembers immediately after the '96 game, looking up
at the big video screen at the Coliseum. He could see former Notre
Dame coach Lou Holtz, his one-time idol, dejected after his final
college game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see him squatted down on the sideline, and he put
his headphones down. You could see defeat in his posture,'' Cusano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano said he's not thinking much about his success against
Notre Dame because he just wants to get decent playing time after
spending most of the previous four games on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you've done in the past is the past. You're only
remembered for what you've done lately,'' Cusano said.

UA LAW SCHOOL GIFT NOW AT $100 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN VAN DER WERF  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon enough, officials at the University of Arizona are going to
just get it over with and rename the school Rogers University.
</P>
<P>
   Alumnus James E. Rogers on Tuesday became one of the largest
benefac tors in the history of higher education, donating $100
million to the UA law school. The gift will likely grow to $130
million, with $15 million of that total going to the general use of
the university.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable gift not only for its size, one of the five
largest ever in American academia, but also for the lack of strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some very sophisticated written documents from Mr.
Rogers that basically say the dean has the `total discretion' to
spend the gift however he sees fit,'' UA law school dean Joel
Seligman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Board of Regents voted last week to rename the UA
law school after Rogers. Some students grumbled that the honor
should have been reserved for a more noted graduate rather than a
wealthy benefactor, but even outspoken faculty members have been
impressed by the sincere generosity of Rogers' gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``His money will clearly have an influence, but he personally
has not sought to have any,'' said Professor Andy Silverman. ``I,
too, would be leery of someone who gave that much money wanting to,
in a sense, buy a law school, and dictate what goes on there. If he
is pulling strings in the background, I don't sense it, and I don't
know anyone on the faculty who does.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said his aims are simple: He wants to give 80 percent of
his fortune to higher education, and he particularly wants to
support the law school that launched him to such a lucrative
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunes come to people for a lot of strange reasons,'' Rogers
said. ``Just a lot of fortuitous occurences have to come together
for you to say, `wow, look at all the zeroes after that one on my
balance sheet.' I know I have it, but I don't feel particularly
like I earned it. Now I want to put it to good use.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers is the former law partner of Louis Weiner, who was lawyer
to Las Vegas casino pioneer Bugsy Siegel. He is also president of
Sunbelt Communications Co., which owns eight television stations
across the West, including one in Yuma. He received a bachelor's
degree in accounting from UA in 1960 and graduated from the law
school in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers made history in April when he announced that he was
giving $20 million to the UA law school. It was the largest gift
ever made to a law school, beating the previous record of $15
million. Then, in September, Rogers announced that he was
increasing the gift to $50 million. On Tuesday, he increased it
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Rogers said. ``This has always been
contemplated, that we would maybe do two things. That we would
provide a gift during my lifetime, then pay money into an endowment
where it would keep earning income in perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier $50 million in gifts will be paid out over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement calls for the creation of an endowment
after Rogers, 60, has died, and his Las Vegas television station,
KVBC, is sold. In addition, he pledged $15 million to match each
dollar that might be raised from alumni, students or friends of the
law school. Rogers also pledged $15 million from his endowment to
be used by any programs at the university other than the law
school.
</P>
<P>
   Seligman said he and a faculty committee are still trying to
figure out how to spend the money, but the first priority will be
to keep tuition from rising. Law school tuition has almost tripled
at the UA law school in the last five years, to about $5,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   He said the law school will use Rogers' gift to create separate
endowments to underwrite individual professorships, a key factor in
attracting and retaining top faculty, upgrade the holdings of the
law library, offer more financial aid to incoming students, and
improve the legal research and writing program.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he hopes that with his financial support, lawyers
just getting started will not be saddled with debt from student
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give students the ability to serve people any way
they want to,'' he said. &QL;

COWBOYS AND VIKINGS TO PLAY FOR PIECE OF AN UNUSUAL TURKEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON DICKSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ The six-legged turkey is a rare bird indeed. It arrives
once a year, as seen on TV. 'Tis a symbol of Thanksgiving, Texas
and food. To get a drumstick, you must play football good.
</P>
<P>
   The bird's appearance has become a tradition. After a full day
in a smoker, it is an award of nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   For football fans, John Madden's Turkey Leg Awards are right up
there with Grandma and pumpkin pie. Every Thanksgiving, whether
covering a National Football League game in Irving or in Detroit,
Madden awards the legs to the game's grittiest players.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Madden will join fellow Fox Sports broadcaster Pat
Summerall at Texas Stadium, where the Cowboys and the Minnesota
Vikings won't be playing just for victory _ they're also hungry for
turkey legs.
</P>
<P>
   The famous six-legged turkey, created by Irving barbecue wizard
Joe Pat Fieseler, will be surrounded by a security force until it's
carved up. The 22-pound bird will be shown to television viewers
throughout the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to find turkeys that had a lot of legs on them,''
Madden said yesterday. ``There's only one place you can get a
turkey with more than two legs, and that's in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Fieseler is owner of Harvey's Barbecue Pit in south Irving. If
Madden and Summerall are in town for Thanksgiving, he provides the
bird. On occasion, he has shipped the bird to Detroit, where the
Fox broadcasters go every other year for the NFL's other
Thanksgiving game.
</P>
<P>
   Fieseler came up with the idea for the six-legged turkey after a
1990 Thanksgiving game, during which Madden awarded a turkey leg to
Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith but lamented on the air that he
wished he had enough drumsticks to give to the Cowboys' five-man
offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Madden and Summerall worked for CBS. They moved to
Fox in 1994 and took the Turkey Leg Awards with them.
</P>
<P>
   Fieseler, who said he prefers to be called Joe Pat, likes to
embellish the tale of the turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story I like to tell is that these turkeys grow on a farm
near the nuclear plant in Glen Rose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A dissection of a six-legged turkey shows that two legs are
attached by bones and skin. The four other legs are fastened with _
gasp! _ 3-inch wood skewers.
</P>
<P>
   The smoked turkey is more of an artistic overstatement than an
abomination of nature.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped critics of the six-legged turkey from
calling Fox Sports to complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing the amount of mail we've gotten,'' said
Summerall, who lives in Northeast Tarrant County. ``They think
we're being cruel to animals by growing six-legged turkeys.''

STORR STILL HURTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Even though he recorded a 21-save shutout in
his return to the lineup Saturday night against the Chicago
Blackhawks, Los Angeles Kings goalie Jamie Storr continues to be
bothered by the groin strain he suffered six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Storr was scheduled to play Tuesday night for the Long Beach Ice
Dogs, but he felt a twinge during the morning skate and was held
out of the game for precautionary reasons. Instead, Manny Legace
was assigned to the Ice Dogs and served as their backup. Legace is
expected to be recalled by the Kings today on an emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jozef Stumpel (sprained ankle) and defenseman Doug Bodger
(broken hand) skated Tuesday, and it appears Bodger is the more
likely of the two to play when the Kings' season resumes against
Phoenix on Saturday night at the Forum. The status of goalie
Stephane Fiset (groin strain) for Saturday's game remains
uncertain.

<P>
   A snowbird bearing free turkeys has landed in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson says he's here for good.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said that the Valley was his new home Tuesday after he
handed out 200 Thanksgiving turkeys to poor kids and families at
Madison Square Garden, a central Phoenix gym where the former
heavyweight champion plans to train for his first fight since he
bit off Evander Holyfield's ear in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming to Arizona gives me a a start, a brand new start in
life,'' said Tyson, who was flanked by former Suns forward Charles
Barkley, former Diamondbacks outfielder Devon White and other
prominent athletes who live in the Valley. ``I plan to start my new
life, from day one, right here in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the exact zip code is unknown. Tyson said he has been
residing in Scottsdale for about the last month while commuting to
and from the gritty gym on West Van Buren Street.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his turbulent career, Tyson has been introduced
before the opening bell as a heavyweight from the Catskills, the
mountains in upstate New York where he once trained for the late
Cus D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   But the Catskills are an old address, said Tyson, who has since
maintained homes in Las Vegas, Cleveland and Connecticut. Then he
did his best imitation of ring announcer Michael Buffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Representing Scottsdale, Arizona, in the red corner: Mike
Tyson,'' he yelled.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tyson later said that Scottsdale might be too upscale
for his tastes, which were forged on the mean streets of Brooklyn's
Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A better reflection of his roots are the gritty barrios that
surround Phoenix's Madison Square Garden, on West Van Buren Street
near 17th Avenue, said the fighter, who has earned more than $100
million in a career that was interrupted by prison term.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan and a friend,'' Barkley said. ``I think this is his
best mental shape in 10 years. He was young when bad things
happened to him. He had bad people around him. I think now he has
good people with him. Now, he's going to appreciate things more
than he ever has.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley said he was not attempting to be an adviser, unlike
former Los Angeles Lakers' star Magic Johnson, who spoke at Tyson's
relicensing hearing last month before the Nevada Atletic Commission
as if he were a manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anything from him,'' Barkley said. ``Everybody
always wants something from him. I just want the best for him. The
No. 1 thing I want is that, when he retires, he's at peace with
himself and is financially set.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson has yet to start serious sparring. However, he has been
hitting bags and shadowboxing in drills that have been directed by
a Holyfield cornerman, Tommy Brooks, who is expected to be
introduced as Tyson's new trainer.
</P>
<P>
   His comeback is projected for Jan. 16 against South African
Frans Botha at Las Vegas' MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement of the bout is expected at a news
conference next week in New York, according to Tyson advisor Shelly
Finkel, who blamed contract details for a postponement of the first
news conference a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, Tyson left no doubt that he was preparing for Botha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a possibility I'll take a bath in his blood
when we fight on January 16,'' he said. &QL;

MIGHTY DUCKS NOTEBOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Teemu Selanne's availability for tonight's
game in Detroit will remain in question up until the pregame skate
at Joe Louis Arena. Selanne, who has missed six games with a thigh
injury, says he hopes to be back. Anaheim Mighty Ducks coach Craig
Hartsburg is also optimistic, but the Ducks and Selanne obviously
don't want to take any chances on the injury becoming a chronic
one.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne had seven goals and 15 points in 13 games before being
injured on Nov. 11 against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (8-7-4) are 4-2 in Selanne's absence, and Hartsburg
said his star winger may not return to the No. 1 line right away,
especially considering the play of Marty McInnis, who has three
goals and seven points in the six games Selanne has missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see much reason to break them up,'' said Hartsburg
after Sunday's win over Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis has 14 points in 13 games since being acquired by the
Ducks from Chicago, Hartsburg's former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter where we got him,'' Hartsburg said. ``I'm
just glad we got him. It's been a huge pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart player, has good speed, good skill and fits in
well with Paul.''
</P>
<P>
   McInnis' linemates are just as hot as he is. Kariya has a
league-leading nine-game point streak (four goals, 13 points),
while Steve Rucchin has a career-high seven-game streak (four
goals, 11 points).
</P>
<P>
   With the injuries to Selanne, Tomas Sandstrom (broken wrist) and
Travis Green, who strained his knee last Friday against Edmonton,
the Ducks called up forwards Josef Marha and Frank Banham last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Green missed the Chicago game and has been ruled out of the
Detroit game, but he is on the trip which continues to Nashville
(Friday), Carolina (Sunday), Pittsburgh (Dec. 1), Chicago (Dec. 3)
and San Jose (Dec. 6).
</P>
<P>
   Marha, a regular who suffered a sprained ankle on opening night,
returned to the lineup for the first time on Friday when he
replaced Green.
</P>
<P>
   Banham, who has spent the season at Cincinnati of the American
Hockey League, will likely be sent back when Green and Selanne are
healthy.

OFFICIALS, AUTHOR BACK TEACHER ON BOOK THAT PARENTS CALL RACIALLY
INSENSITIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ School officials Tuesday backed a white third-grade
teacher's use of what black parents asserted was a racially
insensitive book, but the teacher said she feared returning to her
classroom because of threats from parents.
</P>
<P>
   School officials reassigned the teacher, Ruth Sherman, 27, after
a raucous public meeting Monday at Public School 75 in the Bushwick
section of Brooklyn in which parents denounced her for assigning a
critically acclaimed book titled ``Nappy Hair'' by Carolivia
Herron, a black writer and scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and community organizers said they had received
photocopies of pages from ``Nappy Hair,'' about an African-American
girl coming to terms with her hair, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Told in a gospel-like, call-and-response style, the book is
about a little girl with the ``nappiest, fuzziest, the most screwed
up, squeezed up, knotted up'' hair. It received positive reviews,
including one from The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Davis, a spokesman for the United Federation of Teachers,
said he believed parents who were angry had not read the entire
book. ``Some parents saw only a few pages, taken out of context,''
or heard the title.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Community School Board 32, Dennis Herring, said
the photocopies gave a false impression of what the book's
illustrations were trying to convey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pages were copied from the book and there was no
background information explaining how it was meant, it looks like
pictures to degrade African-Americans. The way it looks in black
and white is different from the way it looks in the book,'' Herring
said.
</P>
<P>
   District Superintendent Felix Vazquez determined Tuesday that
the book, recommended by instructors at Teachers College at
Columbia University, was not inappropriate, but that Ms. Sherman
should have cleared its use with Principal Felicita Santiago, said
J.D. LaRock, a spokesman for the city's Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the uproar had diminished, because more parents had
reviewed the book in full, said Herring, who is black.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Herron, an assistant professor of English at California
State University at Chico, said on Tuesday that she was shocked to
learn that Ms. Sherman had been assigned to a desk job because
parents had protested her assigning ``Nappy Hair'' as
extracurricular reading.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me deeply in the heart,'' said Ms. Herron.
</P>
<P>
   As a scholar at Harvard in the mid-1980s, Ms. Herron specialized
in the epic poetry of Homer, Dante and Milton. Fascinated by its
parallels with her family's oral tradition, she taped her Uncle
Richard's story about her own hair, told to her as a child in the
back yard at family feasts, and turned it into the book ``Nappy
Hair.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Sherman called her Monday night, Ms. Herron said, ``She
wanted to know what was going on _ did she make a mistake?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here she was a teacher doing what many don't have the nerve to
do, to bring to her students books of their own culture,'' Ms.
Herron said. ``I admire what she desired to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Isoke T. Nia, director of research and development at the
Teachers College Reading and Writing Project at Columbia
University, said she was dismayed by the parents' reaction to the
book.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nia, who is black, said she has recommended the book to
hundreds of teachers for two years at summer training institutes
and will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to talk to the parents and ask them, `What is it
about your hair that you are offended by?''' she said. ``There are
things that blacks say in their homes about their hair and this is
bringing it to the public. I'm surprised, astonished and appalled.
A line from the book says a lock of the child's hair is the only
perfect circle. What's so bad about that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sherman said that she was uncertain whether she would return
to the classroom on Monday, after the Thanksgiving break, because
parents and leaders of community groups had threatened her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not angry,'' Ms. Sherman said in an interview Tuesday. ``I
just wish that the children were more of concern. My children lost
two days of instruction at a very important time of the year.''

FORMER PAROLE OFFICIAL CHARGED IN INFLUENCE INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal prosecutors have charged that a former
official of the State Parole Board tried to hamper their
investigation into whether the campaign of Gov. George Pataki
promised favors to inmates in return for political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In a criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn late Tuesday, the official, Ronald Hotaling, was accused
of lying to a grand jury and an investigator about a case before
the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   The case involves a teen-age gang member, John Kim, who was
freed by the board at the earliest possible date after serving time
for violent felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's father is a Korean-American minister in Queens who secured
the help of a Pataki aide to win his release and contributed $1,000
to the Pataki campaign. Others connected to the minister donated
several thousand dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   Senior aides to the governor, who controls the parole board,
have repeatedly said the board did not give special treatment to
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling, 51, served as special assistant to the parole board
until late 1996, when he was dismissed along with several other
staff members, a move that was unrelated to the current
investigation, officials said. In his job, he scheduled cases for
board members, who work in three-person teams traveling to prisons
around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling, who began working for the parole board in 1970, is the
second official to be charged in the federal inquiry. Last month,
prosecutors announced an eight-count indictment against a member of
the parole board, Sean McSherry, who was also accused of lying to a
grand jury about the Kim case.
</P>
<P>
   Hotaling pleaded innocent Tuesday to one count of obstruction of
justice, which has a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was
released on a $10,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint says Hotaling at first repeatedly told an
investigator that he had never spoken to McSherry and another
commissioner about the Kim case. It says he ``denied receiving
communications about special interests in the case.''
</P>
<P>
   But in September, he confessed that he had lied, ``among other
reasons, to protect the integrity of the parole board,'' the
complaint says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Albert Conde Bickford, a retired Manhattan antitrust lawyer who
represented Paramount Pictures during the filmmaker's divestiture
of its chain of movie houses, died last Wednesday at his home in
Ardsley-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Staten Island, he graduated from Harvard College and, in
1927, from Harvard Law School. He then joined the international law
firm of Simpson Thatcher &AMP; Bartlett, where he retired from active
practice as a senior partner in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Settlement of the Paramount case 50 years ago brought about
significant changes in the ways Hollywood studios made and
distributed their motion pictures. Besides Paramount, he
represented such major companies as General Electric and MCA, the
Music Corporation of America, in antitrust cases brought by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s he was counsel for Amtorg Trading Co., the Soviet
agency that bought food and other supplies in the United States. He
ended that legal representation when the Soviet-German
nonaggression pact was signed in Moscow in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Bickford is survived by two sons, Robert C., of Cold Spring,
N.Y., and Nathaniel L., of Manhattan, six grandchildren and three
great-grandchildren.

ONE BROTHER GUILTY IN BENNETT FUNDING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two weeks before the chief financial officer of the
Bennett Funding Group is to stand trial on charges that he bilked
investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars, his brother
admitted in court Tuesday that they conspired to thwart a federal
investigation into their company.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bennett, 41, pleaded guilty to perjury, obstruction of
justice and conspiracy before U.S. District Judge Thomas Griesa.
Bennett faces up to 15 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has not agreed to testify against his brother, Patrick
Bennett, and was not motivated by a hope that prosecutors would
seek a lenient sentence, said his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bennett has been charged with 100 counts of fraud, money
laundering, perjury, conspiracy and obstruction of justice in what
prosecutors have called the biggest Ponzi scheme in American
history. He has pleaded innocent and is scheduled to go on trial
Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 investors, most of them retirees looking for a safe
place to put their money, lost more than $600 million by investing
in Bennett Funding Group, according to prosecutors. Ponzi schemes
work by funneling the investments of later investors to earlier
participants to fool the early investors into believing their
investments have been successful, while other money may be diverted
to those running the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Both brothers were officers of Bennett Funding, a company based
in Syracuse that claimed to be in the business of financing leases
of office equipment like copiers.
</P>
<P>
   Both were important figures in Syracuse's business,
philanthropic and political circles. Patrick Bennett bought the
local racetrack; Michael Bennett, the deputy chief executive, was
praised for his work in partly restoring the landmark Hotel
Syracuse. He was a major fund-raiser for Gov. George Pataki's 1994
campaign. He has recently been living in Virginia, ``trying to work
_ not in the leasing or financing business,'' his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In court Tuesday, Michael Bennett was cheerful and talkative,
chatting with lawyers and reporters about the television show
``Ally McBeal,'' some of which takes place in a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   His voice broke when he told the judge that, in 1996, at his
brother's behest, he had lied to the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission. Investigators there were looking into what
they contend was a fake deal designed to trick Bennett Funding's
accountants _ and some investors _ into thinking the company was in
good health.
</P>
<P>
   Securities regulators sued Bennett Funding in March 1996,
prompting the company to file for bankruptcy protection. Former SEC
Chairman Richard Breeden, who is now the court-appointed trustee
trying to recover money for the investors, mailed $50 million in
checks to defrauded investors in August.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are to get more than $100 million as part of a
settlement with an insurance company involved in the case. That
money can be distributed only after the bankruptcy court in Utica,
N.Y., approves a plan of reorganization, Breeden said, adding that
he hoped to file the plan the same week that Patrick Bennett's
trial is to begin.

LINEBACKERS BATTLE WITH WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Normally reluctant to criticize an opponent, USC
linebacker Chris Claiborne changed character Tuesday and responded
angrily to UCLA linebacker Brandon Ayanbadejo's remarks that
quarterback Carson Palmer was ``terrible'' and not even as good as
the Bruins' redshirt freshmen quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of upset me. I'm about sick of him running his
mouth. For him to talk about Carson is ridiculous . . . (it) is not
classy,'' Claiborne said. ``You don't count your season on one
game. You've got to be consistent. If he got four sacks every game,
OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could thrash him. I don't see him up for any awards. But to
talk about him is not classy. I don't think he has a right to talk
about Carson. I don't think he's good enough to talk about Carson
like that. For him to talk about Carson, I take it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer also expressed surprised for a second day in a row about
Ayanbadejo's comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he wasn't a senior, I wish I had a chance to play
against him next year,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cancel the team meeting: Thanks to an unexpectedly sharp
practice Tuesday, USC's players held off on holding a team meeting
to make sure the Trojans are thinking about Notre Dame and not
still smarting over the loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If practice had went bad, either me or another senior was
going to step up (and call a meeting),'' wide receiver Billy Miller
said. ``I just want to make sure we keep our focus and realize
we've got to beat that team coming in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our last hurrah. It's in front of our parents and on
national TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Even USC coach Paul Hackett was surprised with the way the
Trojans bounced back Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we might not come out with as much zip,'' Hackett
said. ``I liked the way the guys responded.''
</P>
<P>
   __ One vote for Florida State: Palmer was asked who was better,
No. 3 UCLA or No. 4 Florida State?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Florida State was better,'' Palmer said. ``We got
killed by Florida State and we couldn't move the ball or do
anything. I think we had a chance to win against UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bowl update: USC is trying to make a pitch for the Holiday
Bowl in San Diego, provided the Trojans can defeat Notre Dame. The
Holiday Bowl could be a possibility if UCLA goes to the Fiesta Bowl
or if Arizona gets an at-large BCS spot, which is considered a long
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' competition is Oregon, which is also strongly
pushing for the Holiday Bowl. Otherwise, the Trojans can probably
expect to receive an invitation to the Sun Bowl in El Paso. There
is a slight chance USC could go to the Aloha Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   __ Day of rest: Claiborne did not practice Tuesday to rest his
sore knee. Defensive tackle Aaron Williams also missed practice to
rest his sore Achilles' tendon. Linebacker David Gibson (bruised
thigh) is expected to return to practice today, although it is
uncertain if he will play. The same applies to defensive tackle
Ennis Davis (sprained foot).
</P>
<P>
   __ Free advice: What two suggestions has Hackett heard most from
alumni and fans since the UCLA loss? Use a shotgun offense and
throw more to the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a lot of pressure for the shotgun,'' Hackett
said.

with the likes of IBM, Andersen Consulting, and a host of smaller
new companies that have started up offering various e-commerce
services. But it also raises questions about whether this new
business, no matter how vast the opportunity, will be too much of a
distraction for AOL, a company that has long suffered from the

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ Since 1975, no senior football class at Texas A&AMP;M
has finished below .500 against archrival Texas. However, the Class
of 1998's fourth-year seniors enter Friday morning's battle in
Austin with only a 1-2 record against the Longhorns.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in a season of outstanding accomplishments that has three
matters of business still on the table, beating Texas to arrive at
.500 would add to a variety of good memories Dat Nguyen and his
fellow seniors will eventually carry away from Aggieland.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, you do sit around and think about it. It's hitting
me every day,'' Nguyen said when asked about the impending end to
his college career. ``Every day it's getting closer and closer,
knowing that I'm down to 10 days of practice left. Really, 10 days
of football left until we go to a bowl game. It's like we've got
this week and next week; that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In actuality, there's a little more time remaining. For after
the Aggies face Kansas State in the Big 12 Championship Game on
Dec. 5 in St. Louis, they will advance to a bowl to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   That's a signal, said Nguyen, that the seniors will have left
the program at an elite level, which is exactly what he envisioned
the first year he set foot on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we came in, A&AMP;M was up on a pedestal. They were one of
the elite teams,'' the All-America linebacker said. ``They were in
the top 10 every year; the Wrecking Crew was well known. And for a
couple of years, we went through like a slump. There were a few
mistakes here and there, and it hurt us. The record shows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat around and talked about it last year. We won the Big 12
South and had a chance to play Nebraska in the conference
championship. We didn't play as well as we would have liked. Over
the spring and over the summer, we talked about how we wanted to
leave this place the same way it was when we came in.''
</P>
<P>
   They very well might. After losing to Florida State 23-14 in the
Kickoff Classic to open the season, the sixth-ranked Aggies have
reeled off 10 straight victories and even have an outside shot at
participating in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship
should they beat Kansas State in the Big 12 title game. (Losses by
Tennessee in the Southeastern Conference title game and by UCLA to
Miami, which would also be necessary, could set up a Fiesta rematch
with Florida State.)
</P>
<P>
   Heady stuff indeed. Especially for the Aggies' 18 seniors, who
could lead A&AMP;M to its first top-five finish since 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But while there are important games to look toward, it never
hurts to take a brief stroll down memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, they were winning the Southwest Conference,''
said linebacker Warrick Holdman of Alief, who has logged 79 tackles
this season and leads the Aggies with seven sacks. ``When we came
here, we saw what the upperclassmen were doing. We were thinking we
wanted to be that type of class. We wanted to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we're doing a lot of great things _ up there in the
top five in defense, (winning) the South Zone championship again.
That's the way it should be. And then the younger guys under me can
look and say, `Yeah, when I'm a senior, that's the way I want to
finish.' It really works.''
</P>
<P>
   For quarterback Branndon Stewart, the celebrated transfer from
Tennessee, the trip down memory lane isn't thoroughly strewn with
rose petals and the smell of jasmine. Though he was the man under
center most of the year when A&AMP;M claimed the South crown in 1997,
Stewart has hardly lived up to the lofty expectations that followed
him from Knoxville to College Station.
</P>
<P>
   Five games into the current season, subpar performances earned
Stewart a seat on the bench. From there, he has watched junior
Randy McCown work his magic, but that hasn't discolored the
memories Stewart will take with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the biggest thing, the memory for me, is of those
football games walking out on Kyle Field,'' Stewart said. ``It was
victory, for the most part, every time we walked out on the field.
We didn't lose too many games, haven't lost one in about two years,
I think. That's special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy with which Stewart had to deal for the better
part of three years is indelible, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, maybe it made it difficult to enjoy football as much
as you should in college,'' he said. ``But I think it helps me
understand and put into perspective how to deal with people, how to
take the good and the bad. I'm glad I got to experience the things
I did, because going into the next step, past college, it will
help.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot for the seniors to be proud of, said reserve
cornerback Shun Horn of Jasper, particularly because of what has
happened in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well enough all year to get us to the Big 12
Championship Game,'' he said. ``We've played well enough to allow
us to get to a bowl game. But each week, we take one game at a
time. And right now, we're focusing on the University of Texas.''

 By JEROME SOLOMON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Who knows what promises then-head coach John Mackovic made
to get them to sign a letter of intent? There is no way he, or
anyone for that matter, could have foreseen what the 18 players who
this week will play their last home game at Darrell K Royal-Texas
Memorial Stadium would go through in their Texas football careers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But to a man, the Longhorns' seniors say they would not hesitate
to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Their four or five seasons at Texas (depending on a redshirt
year) encompass a set of highs and lows that probably spans as wide
a spectrum as any UT graduating class has encountered.
</P>
<P>
   No, there was no national championship to revel in, as was the
case for players who wore the burnt orange in 1963, '69 and '70.
But it seems this group has seen just about everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, hard, fun ride,'' said linebacker Dusty
Renfro, a three-year starter from Alvarado. ``I've enjoyed every
second of it. I don't think there is anywhere else in the world
that I would rather have spent the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been to the top, and we've seen the bottom also. I've
learned that you've got to get up every time you get knocked down
and keep going. You never can tell what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at some of the happenings over the past five years for
Texas' 1998 seniors:
</P>
<P>
   They were a part of three consecutive conference championships
(Southwest Conference in 1994 and '95; Big 12 in '96) and were one
loss away from a last-place finish (1997).
</P>
<P>
   They played at the Superdome and Trans World Dome, before
Touchdown Jesus at Notre Dame, and in front of a half-naked crowd
at Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   They were on a team that saw the end of a 28-game series winning
streak against Rice but posted a couple of the largest victory
margins in school history against rivals Texas A&AMP;M (51-15 in 1996)
and Oklahoma (34-3 this season).
</P>
<P>
   They shocked the nation with an upset of two-time defending
national champion Nebraska in the 1996 Big 12 Championship Game but
were humiliated by the school's worst-ever home loss the following
season against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   They were part of a 4-7 campaign in 1997, the worst at the
school in 10 years, but were also part of one of only two 10-win
seasons at Texas in the past 15 years (10-2-1 in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   They saw the rise of a coach hailed as a genius (Mackovic) and
the fall of a coach who could not get the job done (ditto).
</P>
<P>
   But all things considered, the Longhorns' seniors say they leave
as they thought they would _ as winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great time, and I wouldn't trade it for anything,''
said offensive tackle Jay Humphrey of Richardson. ``There's nothing
that I would even change. I'm gonna leave with (five) rings (two
conference championships and three bowls), and anybody who could
complain about that, something's wrong with 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, like many of his classmates, has trouble singling out
a particular moment that stands out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to pick just one incident that was the high point of
my career,'' the three-year starter said. ``Blocking for (running
back) Ricky (Williams) for the past three years has been special.
There are several games _ Texas A&AMP;M in '96 and Nebraska both times
(1996 and '98) there are not gonna be many people who, 20, 30 years
down the road, can say that they were 2-0 against Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   The seniors agree that following the disaster of 1997, all the
good times could almost have been erased had the team not responded
with a solid year this season under new head coach Mack Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who could further distinguish this group by joining
Earl Campbell as the second Longhorn to win the Heisman Trophy,
breaks down the highlights of his career by year.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman (1995): ``Going to Hawaii, and beating A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore: ``Beating Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   As a junior: ``There weren't any last year.''
</P>
<P>
   As a senior: ``The way the team has come together and played so
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-year senior Tony Holmes thinks this season has provided an
almost perfect close to his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a new challenge, especially for the seniors,'' the
cornerback from Irving said. ``For us to keep the team together
when we didn't have a coach helped bring us together, and we
rallied around each other. When the new coaches came in, it was a
turning point and another leaf in our career. We took it in stride,
and it turned out good.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being part of a much-maligned defense that had the
school's second- (1997) and fourth-worst (1996) seasons in terms of
yards allowed, Holmes believes his tenure at Texas was a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord brought me here for a purpose, and it's been
wonderful,'' he said. ``The friendships, the winning seasons, the
three straight championships it was great.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior vote for the most unforgettable play is easily the
now-famous fourth-down pass play against Nebraska that helped the
Longhorns claim the Big 12 title in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Lewis, the recipient of that pass, said that with just two
more games to go _ one against A&AMP;M and a second in a bowl to be
determined _ focus is even more important for the seniors, since
they can create some final pleasant memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take the positive things and sit back after you're through
and say wow,'' said the New Orleans native. ``But being a player,
if you strive to be really good, you can't take those things to
heart as they happen, because you're only as good as your last game
in this business.''

GIANTS' HAMILTON CHARGED WITH MARIJUANA POSSESSION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Giants defensive tackle Keith Hamilton was
stopped by Port Authority police for speeding on the George
Washington Bridge early Monday morning and later charged with
possession of marijuana, driving under the influence of a
controlled dangerous substance and possession of drug
paraphernalia, according to Port Authority police.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was stopped at 1:30 a.m. for driving 71 mph in 45 mph
zone. Hamilton was not carrying a driver's license or an insurance
card and the police said they found a bag that appeared to contain
less than an ounce of marijuana and a pipe on Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Later, it was discovered that Hamilton's car insurance had
expired. He also was charged with driving an uninsured car, said
Bill Cahill, a police spokesman for the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Giants Coach Jim Fassel helped in the release early
Monday of Hamilton, who posted $750 bail.
</P>
<P>
   All charges against Hamilton are either traffic violations or
misdemeanors. Hamilton is scheduled to appear in court on Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Giants officials said Tuesday that they did not expect Hamilton,
a fourth-round draft pick of the team who emerged last year as one
of the Giants better players, to be suspended by the National
Football League because it was Hamilton's first offense of this
kind. Hamilton could be fined and the league could order a
mandatory evaluation along with treatment or drug testing.

THREE YUPPIES, ALL DOWNWARDLY MOBILE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why are these people not smiling? Michael, Jonathan
and Jenifer, the anxious trio at the heart of ``Snakebit,'' David
Marshall Grant's solid and savvy new yuppie melodrama at the Grove
Street Playhouse, should have found a measure of contentment by
now. Bright, good looking, capable, they present themselves as a
group that is as likely as any in the culture to attain full and
rewarding lives.
</P>
<P>
   But look again. Psychologically speaking, they're nothing if not
downwardly mobile. Michael (Geoffrey Nauffts), a gay social worker,
is a good person who has been abandoned by a lover who objected to
his plan to adopt a foster child. Jonathan (David Alan Basche), his
boyhood friend, is an actor with a rampaging ego, a deteriorating
marriage and a psychiatric seminar's worth of unresolved feelings
for Michael. And Jenifer (Jodie Markell), Jonathan's wife and soul
mate (and erstwhile bedmate) of Michael, is a fetching bundle of
nerves, regretful of the choices she has made but powerless to
unmake them.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, nominated for a Tony for his portrayal of the Mormon
husband in ``Angels in America,'' turns playwright for this
presentation by the Naked Angels theater company, and the
transition could not have been much smoother. Tinkering with what
might have been a formula for an episode of ``thirtysomething'' _ a
show on which he also had a small recurring role _ Grant comes up
instead with a rather smart and absorbing evening of water-cooler
theater, the intimate sort of off-Broadway experience that has you
picking apart the recognizable characters long after the curtain
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The play has been handled with expert attention by an adroit
director, Jace Alexander, and a first-class ensemble; all the
actors dig in and emerge with finely textured portraits of
terminally unhappy people who can't quite put their fingers on the
sources of their misery. Perhaps, for these once promising souls,
not having all the answers is misery enough.
</P>
<P>
   As with Kenneth Lonergan's ``This Is Our Youth,'' the hit comedy
at Second Stage, Grant's play triangulates the attractions,
disaffections and jealousies in a pair of men and the woman who
drives a wedge between them. Grant's characters are a good 10 to 15
years older than Lonergan's drug-dealing, scam-generating Manhattan
ne'er-do-wells, and so ``Snakebit'' deals with a more established
class of privileged citizens, whose personal histories are both
richer and less extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Michael's Los Angeles apartment, authentically rendered
by the set designer Dean Taucher with a sharp eye for the sunbaked
Southwest, ``Snakebit'' takes place during a visit from New York by
Jenifer and Jonathan, who stay with Michael while Jonathan awaits
word on a major role in a big-budget thriller.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the break the fuming, hyperactive Jonathan has
always dreamed of, but the significance of the occasion is lost on
Michael and Jenifer, who have hit emotional dead ends that
Jonathan, who prides himself on, among many other things, his
sensitivity, can barely acknowledge. Their depression seems a kind
of repressed anxiety, focused at the moment on Jenifer's worries
about her young daughter back in New York, who throws up
continually and, more ominously, is losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   Her thoughts revert to the affair she carried on 11 years
earlier with Michael _ the last woman he slept with _ just prior to
her marriage to Jonathan, and the suspicion that Michael may be the
carrier of a dread disease that he transmitted to her and is only
now making its impact felt. Michael, strangely detached from the
doom that might await him if the blood tests he and Jenifer have
taken come back positive, is fixated instead on his abandonment by
Gary, a radio shock jock who carries on a public charade of
heterosexuality. It's in the contemplation of his loss, and
Jenifer's potential disaster, that Michael makes a fateful choice.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to lay out the basics of ``Snakebit'' because
there's a lot going on here: These are carefully plotted
relationships, for which the actors and the playwright find all
sorts of pleasing insights. For instance, near the conclusion, Ms.
Markell, an off-Broadway actress who is always a joy to watch, has
a wonderful moment that sums up marriage in a minute and meaningful
way. In the midst of one her husband's endless, disruptive tirades,
she interrupts with a really important tip on how he might more
practically repack a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who provides the actors with all manner of clever things
to say, at times overpacks a bit himself, concocting two or three
telling moments or ripostes where one would suffice. Nevertheless,
he's interesting even when he overdoes it.
</P>
<P>
   Nauffts, in a gently understated performance, is grand as the
conflicted conscience of the piece. Basche is equally strong,
putting his leading-man looks to maximum advantage as a clueless
cock of the walk, and Michael Weston, as the play's fourth wheel,
finds the right mix of calculation and guilelessness in the
mysterious visitor who arrives one morning at Michael's house.
</P>
<P>
   What a generous actor Grant must be, to give all the good parts
away.

STRINGER COPES WITH A FAMILY CRISIS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could not be happening again. Not to C. Vivian Stringer. Not
during this week of Thanksgiving. But it was her choked voice on
the phone from an airplane heading to Raleigh, N.C., on Sunday
night. And it was her longtime confidant on the other end of the
call, Temple Coach John Chaney, trying to gently comfort her while
letting her know that, once again, she would have to be strong for
her family. Once again, during Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer was devastated when her husband, Bill, died of a heart
attack on Thanksgiving Day in 1992. Two decades earlier, her
father, Charles, had died during the Thanksgiving holiday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, Stringer was in Austin, Texas, preparing
her 11th-ranked Rutgers women's basketball team for its game
against the University of Texas. That game went on without Stringer
on Monday night; assistant coach Larry Lawler filled in. Rutgers
won, 66-59.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday evening, Stringer has been by the side of her son,
David, who faces felony charges after being with two other North
Carolina State football players, two wrestlers and another student
who were arrested early Sunday morning after a bizarre altercation
left a fellow student dead from a gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vivian was crying, and I was just trying to tell her to hang
on, that we were all counting on her to fight through this, and
that I was with her,'' Chaney said Tuesday. ``It is just
unbelievable from the standpoint that families, at this time of the
year, come together. And yet, too often in Vivian's life, there has
been someone missing or someone in pain at this time of the year.
It's hard to imagine this happening to her now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine that David Stringer, portrayed as heady and
responsible, was involved in a confluence of events resulting in a
shooting death that has shaken the college town of Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart goes out to all of the families of the young people
involved,'' Stringer said in a statement issued by Rutgers. ``This
is one of the things parents dread in the deep of the night. I have
visited with my son and am doing all that a mother can do. It is
inappropriate for me to answer any questions at this time. I will
be returning to my team as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raleigh police said that early Sunday, Neil Davis, 21, stood
on the front doorstep of his residence and fired several shots from
his 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, with one shot whistling
through a party in a house across the street. The shot ricocheted
and grazed a wrestler at the party. According to the police,
Stringer was among six students who went across the street to
confront Davis.
</P>
<P>
   `` Davis went back into his house and secured himself in his
bedroom, and these gentlemen chose to unlawfully enter his house,''
Capt. Mike Longmire said. ``At some point, they forced their way
into his room and there was a confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   During a struggle with Clyde Blunt, a wrestler, the weapon was
taken from Davis' hand and fired around 2:30 a.m., police reported.
Davis, who was shot in the stomach, died six hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Doug Faucette said that after the fatal shooting, the
group left the scene and one of the football players took the gun
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt was charged with involuntary manslaughter, a felony.
Stringer, 19, a reserve receiver, and two teammates Harold Jackson,
20, and Willie Wright, 19, were charged with misdemeanor assault.
In addition, Wright was charged with larceny of a firearm, a
felony. Jackson and Stringer were also charged with being
accessories to the felony of larceny. All three football players
were released on bond and suspended from the team. Stringer's next
court date is Dec. 14.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when I heard,'' said Chaney, who has known
Stringer since she began her coaching career in 1971 at Cheyney
State, a small, predominantly black college near Philadelphia.
``This kind of thing takes a toll on a mother.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems so much toll has already been paid. After her husband
died, Stringer was left as the single mother of three, including a
daughter, Janine, now 17, who has needed constant care since she
was left handicapped by spinal meningitis at age 2.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has ever been simple. But the wear on her life was
supposed to ease when Stringer left a highly successful career at
the University of Iowa for Rutgers three summers ago. Some
wondered, why Rutgers? More important than the allure of a $150,000
salary _ the richest for a women's coach at the time _ Rutgers was
closer to her Pennsylvania roots, closer to friends and family,
closer to potential happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers was far removed from Iowa, where her father and husband
had died. Although she found Iowa warm and friendly, she sought a
change for herself and her children.
</P>
<P>
   She found out a fresh start was not so easy. When she arrived at
Rutgers, there was jealously from those focused on her salary and
criticism from those who wondered why she could not sprinkle pixie
dust on her team and create a winner out of Rutgers overnight.
</P>
<P>
   David Stringer was also faced with a rude welcome. In December
1996, his mother left 12 minutes into a game against Princeton when
she was told that David, then a student at North Brunswick High
School, had been slashed with a box cutter by another student.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, problems have come to David,'' said Chaney, who
has coached David in his summer basketball camps since he was a
young boy. ``Someone accosted him over a girl one time when he was
getting out of his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was lucky. He had on a big winter coat when this
happened. So he did not get cut too badly. Other than that
incident, which wasn't his fault, he has been someone who has been
free of any kind of acrimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Stringer is best friends with her son. As the oldest, David has
been someone his mother could depend on since his father died,
someone who was able to prop up his mother when she was not sure if
she could coach again.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally spent after the death of her husband, who seemed to
get more out of her coaching victories than she did, Stringer has
said she nearly walked away from the sport in 1992. With a firm
voice and pensive posture on the sideline, she was on her way to
becoming the third-winningest coach in women's basketball history
while at Iowa. But she didn't care. She didn't want a life in
basketball without her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``David and Justin came to me and said, `When are you going to
coach again?''' Stringer said of her sons in an interview a year
ago. ``They said: `This is your life. Dad would not have wanted you
to give up, and neither do we.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Stringer pushed on. And now, she is asked to push through yet
another painful Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of strength inside of her,'' Chaney said. ``And
sometimes you wonder how much is there and how it keeps her going
all the time.''

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MINNEAPOLIS _ The Minnesota Vikings' success this season is no
secret: They have more talent than any team in the NFL.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask any scout why the Vikings are 10-1 and the first NFC team to
clinch a playoff spot, and he will tell you coach Dennis Green's
cup runneth over with productive, multitalented players.
</P>
<P>
   Denver, the defending Super Bowl champion, might be a better
team, but individually no team rates across the board with the
Vikings, according to the NFL's pro personnel people.
</P>
<P>
   Green, in his seventh season with the Vikings, believes the
team's three-game lead in the NFC Central is the result of talent,
hard work, proven systems and sound organization from the top to
the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective hasn't changed one bit since the season began,''
Green says. ``We're trying to get as much as we can with the people
we have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very happy to have 10 wins, but the only thing we think
about is how we're going to get No. 11. We don't think about the
division race or getting home-field advantage. The only thing we're
thinking about is the Dallas Cowboys.''
</P>
<P>
   Green is no stranger to the playoffs, but he has won only one
playoff game. Red McCombs, who bought the team in the offseason,
showed a lot of confidence in Green when he signed his coach to a
three-year contract extension at the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs made decisions that brought stability to the team, and
he has been rewarded with the Vikings' best season since 1975 and
record-breaking crowds in the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the season, I don't think anyone could have foreseen
this type of season, especially when you consider the instability
of our ownership situation and the players (Vikings free agents) we
had to sign,'' says Jeff Diamond, the vice president of
administration and team operations. ``We knew we had the makings of
a good team, and once Red took over and brought so much enthusiasm
to the organization, everything fell into place.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Vikings tangle with the Cowboys in the traditional
Thanksgiving game, they will be trying to win their first NFC
Central title since 1994. A Minnesota win and a Green Bay loss
would clinch the division for the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just blessed to have a great group of players and
coaches,'' says quarterback Randall Cunningham, who is compiling
Most Valuable Player numbers after beginning the season as the
backup. ``Dennis likes for us to be a little edgy. If we don't win,
he doesn't want us to exhale.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings have been forced to hold their breath only once this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have as many great players on offense like we do, it
makes such a difference,'' Cunningham says. ``We're all role
players. We've got veteran players who stay consistent. We believe
in each other and what we can accomplish. Let me tell you, when you
have guys like this on your team, you come to work every day with a
smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Minnesota's offense is so explosive, it gets more
attention than the defense, which allows 16.7 points and 307.8
yards per game. Tackle John Randle, who has seven sacks, is the
best player and spiritual leader of the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's offense, second in the NFL with an average of 31.6
points per game, has no weakness, even without receiver Jake Reed,
who is out for the season with a lumbar-disk injury.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who had 34 catches for 474 yards and four touchdowns, had
been overshadowed by Randy Moss, the magnificent rookie who has
eight touchdowns. Moss starts against the Cowboys opposite Cris
Carter, the Vikings' leading receiver with 50 catches for 686
yards. Like Moss, Carter has eight touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   With Carter, Reed and Moss, the Vikings had the best threesome
in the league. With Carter and Moss, they have one of the best
duos.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Walsh, Robert Tate and Matthews Hatchette will try to
replace Reed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it (Reed's injury) changes the profile (of the
offense) a little bit,'' offensive coordinator Brian Billick says.
``This is a situation where everybody has to step up and take up
the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to alter our game plan dramatically. Obviously,
you have to pare some things down. You really have to count on your
veterans' experience and their ability to be able to carry it from
the classroom to game situations.''
</P>
<P>
   With the short work week to prepare for the Cowboys, the Vikings
plan to remain pretty basic. There is nothing fancy about their
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Carter works the middle of the field and the sideline like a
magician. The 6-4 Moss goes deep and outjumps shorter cornerbacks.
Moss showed in Sunday's 28-14 win over Green Bay that he's more
than a deep threat. Of his eight catches, five were near the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Moss gets most of the recognition because he makes so many big
plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy tells me he'll catch anything I throw as long as I don't
overthrow it,'' Cunningham says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Robert Smith, who has 967 yards rushing and six
touchdowns, has exceptional speed. He excels on artificial turf
with quick cuts and outstanding acceleration. Smith is better in a
one-back formation that allows him to line up deep and read his
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who replaced the injured Brad Johnson, has completed
150 of 239 passes for 2,206 yards and 19 touchdowns. He has thrown
six interceptions. His passer rating is a league-leading 108.9.
</P>
<P>
   On third down, Cunningham has been the most productive
quarterback in the NFL. His passer rating on third down is a
league-high 125.3, with seven touchdown passes and one
interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great passer for our system,'' Green says. ``Randall
brings confidence and calmness to this team. He's just so poised.
He never gets overexcited.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who posted an 8-4 record against the Cowboys when he
played in Philadelphia, is fortunate to have one of the best
offensive lines in the league. Guard Randall McDaniel is a
perennial Pro Bowl selection. Tackles Kory Stringer and Todd
Steussie are former No. 1 picks who are having their best seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a lot of time in the pocket,'' Cunningham says. ``I
don't take off and run like I used to. If I feel comfortable in the
pocket, I'll hold the ball a little longer looking for my receiver.
If I feel the pressure, I'll get rid of the ball to avoid the
sack.''
</P>
<P>
   Green can't say enough good things about what Cunningham has
meant to the team. Cunningham can become a free agent after the
season, but he says he wants to stay in Minnesota, even if he has
to accept a lot less money than other teams would offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randall was a gift to us,'' Green says. ``He had vowed to
never play again. He came to the right team because we know how to
utilize him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham left Philadelphia after the 1996 season and retired
to his offseason home in Las Vegas. He made a decision to return in
1997 and signed with the Vikings as a backup to Johnson rather than
go to New Orleans as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham helps the Vikings average 378.2 yards per game. He
makes smart decisions and does not force the ball or throw into
coverage. He's much more patient in the pocket than he was with the
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an awesome feeling these days,'' Cunningham says.
``When I'm in the huddle and I look in guys' eyes and see a feeling
of confidence, I know we can get through any situation. If I throw
an interception, it doesn't get us down. If we lose a fumble, we
get over it. There's a feeling here that we can accomplish just
about anything.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The model is doing her best. The lighting in the
Cotillion Ballroom of Manhattan's Pierre Hotel is not helping and
the 200 guests attending the gala fund-raising night for the
American-Italian Cancer Foundation seem somewhat underwhelmed by
the flowing brown shawl she is showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty, but not that pretty,'' grumbles a woman sitting
behind me. ``Yes, but a Fendi is a Fendi,'' protests her husband.
</P>
<P>
   When the auctioneer, Simon Teakle, a senior vice-president at
Christies, closes the bidding, the shawl _ a handmade tulle affair
with tufts of weasel fur _ goes to a gentleman on the left of the
aisle for $12,000. He has a bargain. The donor value, according to
the catalogue, is $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   All told, however, the evening turns out very well for the
Foundation. The Mercedes convertible that was parked outside as we
came in _ value $51,000 _ is snapped up for $75,000.
</P>
<P>
   And someone pays $2,800 to take five friends out to dinner at
the Four Seasons in the company of Norman Mailer.
</P>
<P>
   Before retiring for dinner with the rest of us, Teakle manages
to squeeze $160,000 out of us for just 15 lots.
</P>
<P>
   And it is not just the live auction that brings in the dollars.
It is preceded by an hour of cocktails and delectable hors d'oeuvre
in the adjoining reception rooms where guests are encouraged to
participate in a silent auction for no fewer than 260 items that
have been donated for nothing by a myriad of companies and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The sign-up list is empty for a free checkup at the Westside
Family Dental Group, included in the Hobbies and Entertainment
section. For a free day of game shooting on the Millbrook Preserve
in upstate New York, there are entries from $200 and up. Buying a
table at the dinner runs in the thousands. As a guest of Benetton,
however, I tactfully refrain from asking just how many thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The evening, a glittering, black-tie event that attracts the
rich and powerful of American-Italian society on the East Coast,
provides a glimpse into the world of philanthropic giving that is
peculiar to the United States, and especially to the Upper East
Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when the charity circuit goes into high
gear. If he had the energy, Teakle could be wielding his gavel free
of charge at similar events all across town every night of the week
between now and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what is coming up in the New York charity calendar.
Last night, for example, you could have paid $25,000 for a table at
the New York City Ballet opening night benefit with performances of
works by George Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the glitziest of all evenings, however, one where
guests have the best chance of getting their picture in the gossip
pages of the city tabloids comes on Dec. 7. That is the night of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art's always-fabulous Costume Institute
Benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Events such as these represent just the celebrity tip of a
fund-raising iceberg in this country. Any institution that needs
money it cannot get from government is forced to invade the pockets
of private citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   Libraries, hospitals and radio stations all find ways to raise
cash, and auctions are a favorite strategy. Even these events are
not always humble. At a recent auction for a girls' school in
Greenwich, Conn., home to this reporter, the star lot was a
labrador puppy. It fetched $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   What possesses Americans to attend these events and shell out so
much? There are, of course, a variety of answers.
</P>
<P>
   The most cynical is that giving like this is many people's
passport to enhanced social status. The more you give, the higher
you are on the rungs of America's faux aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Others go, apparently, because they are lonely. On this evening,
one woman admits her mission is to find a husband. She enters the
bidding twice in the live auction in the hope of impressing the
handsome man next to her.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of tax. Later at my dinner table, a
broker from Morgan Stanley explains I should not be too impressed
by the $75,000 paid for the car. Once you factor in the
tax-deduction the buyer will earn for having given to charity,
really he is paying only $45,000 _ below sticker price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I refuse to be cynical. This, finally, is about giving
and about generosity. It is about an understanding that many
Americans share, whether at a gala evening at the Pierre or when
they reach into their wallets for the Salvation Army at Christmas _
that this is far from a welfare state and that where the government
does not provide the private citizen has to.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCallion, a voice-training consultant for Christies who
is also at this dinner, said: ``Americans have their social dues to
pay and they pay those dues.'' Judging by the money that is flowing
tonight, he is not wrong. &QL;

in the adjoining reception rooms where guests are encouraged to
participate in a silent auction for no fewer than 260 items that
have been donated for nothing by a myriad of companies and
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The sign-up list is empty for a free checkup at the Westside
Family Dental Group, included in the Hobbies and Entertainment
section. For a free day of game shooting on the Millbrook Preserve
in upstate New York, there are entries from $200 and up. Buying a
table at the dinner runs in the thousands. As a guest of Benetton,
however, I tactfully refrain from asking just how many thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The evening, a glittering, black-tie event that attracts the
rich and powerful of American-Italian society on the East Coast,
provides a glimpse into the world of philanthropic giving that is
peculiar to the United States, and especially to the Upper East
Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time of year when the charity circuit goes into high
gear. If he had the energy, Teakle could be wielding his gavel free
of charge at similar events all across town every night of the week
between now and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at what is coming up in the New York charity calendar.
Last night, for example, you could have paid $25,000 for a table at
the New York City Ballet opening night benefit with performances of
works by George Balanchine.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the glitziest of all evenings, however, one where
guests have the best chance of getting their picture in the gossip
pages of the city tabloids comes on Dec. 7. That is the night of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art's always-fabulous Costume Institute
Benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Events such as these represent just the celebrity tip of a
fund-raising iceberg in this country. Any institution that needs
money it cannot get from government is forced to invade the pockets
of private citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   Libraries, hospitals and radio stations all find ways to raise
cash, and auctions are a favorite strategy. Even these events are
not always humble. At a recent auction for a girls' school in
Greenwich, Conn., home to this reporter, the star lot was a
labrador puppy. It fetched $38,000.
</P>
<P>
   What possesses Americans to attend these events and shell out so
much? There are, of course, a variety of answers.
</P>
<P>
   The most cynical is that giving like this is many people's
passport to enhanced social status. The more you give, the higher
you are on the rungs of America's faux aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Others go, apparently, because they are lonely. On this evening,
one woman admits her mission is to find a husband. She enters the
bidding twice in the live auction in the hope of impressing the
handsome man next to her.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the matter of tax. Later at my dinner table, a
broker from Morgan Stanley explains I should not be too impressed
by the $75,000 paid for the car. Once you factor in the
tax-deduction the buyer will earn for having given to charity,
really he is paying only $45,000 _ below sticker price.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I refuse to be cynical. This, finally, is about giving
and about generosity. It is about an understanding that many
Americans share, whether at a gala evening at the Pierre or when
they reach into their wallets for the Salvation Army at Christmas _
that this is far from a welfare state and that where the government
does not provide the private citizen has to.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCallion, a voice-training consultant for Christies who
is also at this dinner, said: ``Americans have their social dues to
pay and they pay those dues.'' Judging by the money that is flowing
tonight, he is not wrong. &QL;

`HEARTBREAKING' OIL SPILL KILLS 20,000 SEABIRDS

   LONDON _ At least 20,000 seabirds have been killed and 130,000
more are directly threatened by an oil spill in an ``ecological
catastrophe'' off Germany's North Sea coast, the Royal Society for
the Protection of Birds said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The spill has occurred in the islands of the Schleswig-Holstein
National Park on the German-Danish border, which forms part of the
Waddensee, the enormous area of coastal shallows stretching as far
as the Netherlands. It is the most important wintering ground for
seabirds in all of northern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of waders such as oystercatchers, dunlin and
sanderlings, and of sea ducks such as eiders and common scoters
have already been wiped out by heavy fuel oil leaking from a
crippled Italian freighter, the Pallas.
</P>
<P>
   The ship was carrying a cargo of timber from the Baltic to
Casablanca when it caught fire off the Danish North Sea port of
Esbjerg on the night of Oct. 25/26. But its owners refused
assistance and towed it out beyond the Danish 12-mile limit in an
attempt to salvage it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They failed, and for nearly three weeks the stricken vessel
drifted southwards into the small islands off the German coast,
leaking fuel oil as it went.
</P>
<P>
   Although the amount was not enormous by the standards of past
oil spills such as the Sea Empress off Wales in 1996 _ about 50
tons _ the spill happened in exactly the wrong place and the wrong
time, according to Robert Oates, the RSPB's marine policy officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very heavy oil which does not disperse and it has split
into several slicks and there are enormous concentrations of birds
there,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 20,000 are dead already and about another 130,000 are
threatened. It is an ecological catastrophe and it far exceeds the
damage to the Coto Donana in Spain by the pollution incident there
last spring. We are extremely concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Scarth of the International Fund for Animal Welfare said:
``This is the worst crisis with oiled sea birds I have ever
witnessed. It is heartbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the greatest problems, Oates said, was that, although the
German authorities were attempting to clear the oil from the
beaches, it was proving very hard to get it off the extensive
mudflats of the Waddensee which are the birds' feeding grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Waddensee extends for 10,000 square kilometers and is the
winter home to an estimated four million birds from all across
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Pallas has now been anchored to a Dutch oil spill control
rig off the German island of Amrum and the oil leak is believed to
be under control. But the seabird deaths are continuing from the
oil already spilled, Oates said. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They may be richer than they have ever been, living
in bigger houses, enjoying cleaner air and better health, but some
of that sunny optimism has gone out of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   As they trim and stuff their turkeys for the Thanksgiving
holiday 1998, white, middle-class Americans are looking inwards,
and back.
</P>
<P>
   A recent crop of films examines what might be called the
American condition on the threshold of the millennium, and it is
shot through with angst for a way of life that may not be all it
seems and may never have been.
</P>
<P>
   From ``The Truman Show,'' a morality play for the television age
that was released in the U.S. this summer, through
``Pleasantville,'' a critical look back at the America of the
Fifties, to ``Happiness,'' a search behind the respectable facade
of a ``perfect'' American family to find some very dirty linen, the
ideal of wholesome, family-orientated, small-town America held so
dear by generations is cracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Truman Show,'' if you have not seen it, is unusual for an
American film in embodying an idea: the exchange of appearance and
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Truman _ the name is no accident _ is the real-life and
unwitting star of a television soap opera that has revolved around
him since his birth.
</P>
<P>
   He lives in the television dimension. Everything else _ wife,
house, neighbors, job, town _ is fabricated according to the
television ideal; every man is manly in a televisual way, every
woman is beautiful in that unsubtle American way and, every child,
as Garrison Keillor said in his gently satirized tales of Lake
Woebegone, ``is above average.''
</P>
<P>
   For the viewer, the earliest clues of the deception are a
prophetic falling ``star'' that shatters like the light bulb it is,
and the digressions by Truman's ``wife'' to advertise commercial
products, directly to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   They culminate in the first storm in living memory to hit the
manufactured white clapboard town that splits the artificial
``sky'' and gives Truman an inkling of a world outside. The
``moral'' is the obvious one: ``True man's'' overriding need for
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The physical and metaphorical limits of small-town America are a
theme also of ``Pleasantville,'' a recent box-office success for
``all the family'' that hammers home just one message.
</P>
<P>
   Those glorious, secure, innocent Fifties you may be tempted to
feel nostalgia for were not so wonderful: they were circumscribed,
cold and bigoted.
</P>
<P>
   The tale is of two Nineties teenagers transported by clumsy
artifice back to the world of a Fifties soap-opera, with
two-parent, two-child families, forced by social and civic
pressures to conform, whatever the personal cost.
</P>
<P>
   In a crude device which transforms the characters from their
black and white originals to glorious technicolor, each is
``awakened'' to personal enjoyment and fulfillment through the
Nineties knowledge and experience of the newly arrived teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the issue of race is introduced as the ``coloreds'' are
subjected to discrimination by the as yet unenlightened monotone
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, ``Happiness'' _ a niche film rejected by the big
distributors worried that one of the characters emerges a pedophile
_ lifts the veil on an outwardly ``model'' American family.
</P>
<P>
   Three generations are shown in progressive disintegration, with
the most perfect of them all _ the comfortable, complacent suburban
housewife who ``has it all'' _ big house, money, children and loyal
husband _ having her contentment stripped away as her psychoanalyst
husband's vice is exposed and her own Nineties tolerance breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious combined message from all three films that
the idealized world of family-values America _ whether in the
Fifties or the Nineties, the small town or the sanitized suburbs _
does not exist, something else emerges.
</P>
<P>
   There is at the heart of each an ambivalence; it is as though
none of the directors could bring himself either to embrace or
dismiss the fabricated ideal completely.
</P>
<P>
   Was Truman better off when he believed in his world, or when the
sky fell in? How many Americans now tailor their lives to what they
see on television?
</P>
<P>
   Of the teenagers transported into the Fifties, the boy
(David/Bud) returns to the Nineties still enamored of the stable
family and fixed values that made him such a fan of the aged soap
opera in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The girl (Jennifer/Mary Sue), while railing against the limits
on a girl's freedom pre-Pill, pre-feminism, nonetheless abandons
the permissiveness she has brought to the Fifties world, retreating
chastely to her frilled bedroom and her books.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Happiness'' _ whose title, like that of ``Pleasantville,''
is ironic _ shocked some American critics with its refusal to
condemn the ``perfect'' husband for his pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   The cumulative effect is of a troubled caste _ an entirely white
caste, it should be stressed _ that is unsure whether the comforts
and principles it lived for ever had any substance.
</P>
<P>
   After all, those pretty clapboard towns are now reproduced as
flimsy housing developments across America; the props of that showy
television world can be bought at every shopping mall, and those
families that will gather around the laden dinner table on
Thanksgiving are, more often than not, fractured.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder these people are reluctant to shame Bill Clinton. The
brash New World is at last starting to feel the self-doubt of the
Old. &QL;

FED'S CUTS, COMPETITION DRIVING DOWN CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATES

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shoppers should get some relief from credit card
payments this year, as interest rates are starting to go down again
after rising since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to recent rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors and intense competition in the credit card industry,
consumers are seeing rates going down. They are expected to
decrease even more in January, as the Fed's last cut this month
finally kicks in.
</P>
<P>
   The weighted average annual percentage rate is 18.08 percent
this year for standard, gold and platinum cards, compared with
18.11 percent in 1997, according to CardWeb Inc., a
Pennsylvania-based payment card research firm. Rates can be as low
as 7.99 percent, which is the case at Pulaski Bank &AMP; Trust.
</P>
<P>
   CardWeb President Robert McKinley said he has noticed record-low
introductory APR rates as well, including some at 2.9 percent or
3.9 percent and others with no interest charges during the
introductory period.
</P>
<P>
   But before shoppers cheer, McKinley and consumer advocates say
that credit card issuers are making up the lost profits -- down to
1 percent today from 4 percent in the early 1990s -- by increasing
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks are adding other fees,'' McKinley said.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks are charging fees to close an account or for not
using an account. More banks are charging penalty interest rates of
up to 25 percent for such violations as making one late payment or
exceeding the credit limit once, according to the 1998 Credit Card
Survey by Consumer Action and Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   They're also adding late-payment fees at an average of $21.82,
up 75 percent from three years ago, the survey said. Grace periods
have been shortened from 25 days to 20 days at many banks. To top
it off, the minimum payment required has been lowered to 2 percent
of the balance from 4 percent, meaning it would take consumers more
time to pay off the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Banking institutions are the most common issuers of credit
cards. Visa and MasterCard are nonprofit associations owned by
their member banks.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have ancillary fees because intense competition makes it
hard for them to charge an annual fee while introductory or
``teaser'' rates are the lowest they've ever been, said John
Stafford, a spokesman for the California Bankers Association in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But only 3 percent of customers incur these fees, since most
people pay their accounts on time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers who manage their accounts responsibly don't pay any
fees. Most people do avoid these fees,'' Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   And now they're avoiding higher rates. Since most cards carry an
adjustable rate, consumers should see their interest rates go down
as the last Fed cut takes effect next year. As the Fed changes the
federal funds rate, or the discount rate, banks tend to follow suit
by adjusting their prime rate accordingly. The prime rate is the
rate banks charge their most valuable customers.
</P>
<P>
   Many credit cards are pegged to the prime rate. Since early this
year, the prime rate has dropped from 8.5 percent to 7.75 percent
today, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.
