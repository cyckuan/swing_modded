<HEADLINE> Contact Group Prepares Kosovo Peace Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) - The Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia on Friday summoned the warring Serbs and ethnic
Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo to attend peace talks
in France by February 6.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the six-nation Contact Group "agreed to
summon representatives from the Federal Yugoslav and Serbian
governments and representatives of the Kosovo Albanians to
Rambouillet (southwest of Paris) by February 6...to begin
negotiations," a statement issued by the Contact Group in London
said.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after a three-hour-long meeting of
foreign ministers from the United States, Britain, France, Italy,
Germany and Russia.
</P>
<P>
It said the ministers agreed that the parties "should work to
conclude negotiations within seven days."
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the group would hold both sides
accountable if they failed to seize the opportunity for a
peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
But it did not mention a threat of force by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, which Russia opposes.
</P>
<P>
The arranged peace talks in France would be co-chaired by
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
Cook said earlier in an interview that Britain, France and
their NATO partners were prepared to underpin an agreement on
Kosovo self-rule by deploying ground troops, but only if the
warring parties signed up to a political process.
</P>
<P>
Cook was expected to fly to Belgrade on Saturday to present
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic with the Contact Group's
political ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
NATO said on Thursday it was increasing military preparedness
in response to the worsening crisis in Kosovo and warned that the
two sides should agree to the group's proposals.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet clear whether leaders of the Federal Yugoslavia
and the Albanian groups in Kosovo, who are seeking independence
from the union, would attend the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Publicizes Causes of GITIC's Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The bankruptcy of the
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp. (GITIC)
resulted from the chaotic internal management, heavy debts and
the impact of the Asian financial crisis, said an official with
the Information Office of the Guangdong Provincial government
here today.
</P>
<P>
The remark came at the second session of the Ninth Guangdong
Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Investigation showed that the GITIC had set up some 240
enterprises overseas, and their losses from the bad loans totaled
9.26 billion yuan (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result, the GITIC cannot repay the debt, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The official said the bankruptcy which was declared earlier
this month will bring about some negative effect in the short
term, but it will help improve China's financial system and
prevent the expansion of the financial risk in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The GITIC used to be the largest non-banking local financial
institution in Guangdong and served as a major channel of fund
raising for the province. It was shut down by the People's Bank
of China on October 6, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Mortgage Lending Falls in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- New mortgage activity lost
momentum in December 1998, according to the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA)'s monthly survey on residential mortgage lending.
</P>
<P>
The amount of gross new loans made in December increased by
28.6 percent to 13.2 billion HK dollars (1.7 billion U.S.
dollars) from the previous month. The average size of new loans
increased to 1.51 million HK dollars (193,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
New loans approved in December fell by 24.1 percent to 11.2
billion HK dollars (1.4 billion U.S. dollars) on a month-to-month
basis. Loans approved during the month but not yet drawn also
decreased by 29.3 percent to 7.3 billion HK dollars (935 million
U.S. dollars). More than 99 percent of these loans were related
to owner-occupied properties.
</P>
<P>
On the pricing front, mortgage rates eased further with
one-third of the new loans granted at the best lending rate plus
0.25 percent or below.
</P>
<P>
"In view of revived competition for residential mortgage
loans, as evidenced by the decline in lending margin, banks are
reminded to maintain their credit standards, by adopting prudent
lending practices and paying close attention to borrowers'
ability to service their debt," said Deputy Chief Executive of
the HKMA David Carse.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Sees Total Deposits Rise, Loans Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total deposits
increased in December 1998 while total loans and advances
declined, according to the latest monetary statistics released by
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits rose by 1 percent in December. HK dollar
deposits accounted for 57.1 percent of the total deposits at the
end of December.
</P>
<P>
Savings deposits in HK dollars grew for the fourth consecutive
month by 3.6 percent. The continued strong depositors' appetite
for savings deposits in part reflected the narrowing of the
interest rate spread between the short-term time deposit rate and
the savings deposit rate, according to the HKMA.
</P>
<P>
Of foreign currency deposits, U.S. dollar deposits decreased
by 2.6 percent while other foreign currency deposits rose by 7.1
percent in December.
</P>
<P>
During the month, total loans and advances decreased by 0.7
percent. Both domestic loans and offshore loans shrank, by 1
percent and 0.2 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Strengthen Economic Ties With Mainland for Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will
further strengthen special economic ties with the mainland of
China for mutual growth, said Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The economy of the mainland of China is moving well. By the
end of 1998, it was already the sixth largest economy in the
world. I have no doubt that, in 25 years, China will be one of
the largest economies in the world," Tung said on answering X
inhua at a press conference held at the ongoing annual meeting of
the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong, we have a unique opportunity under the 'one
country, two systems' regime as part of China to take full
advantage of this very exciting growth," said Tung who took
office as the head of the HKSAR on July 1, 1997 when China
resumed the exercise of sovereignty of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong and the mainland share a common culture, use
the same language and enjoy good relations, he said, Hong Kong
will be able to, more than anyone else, fully participate in the
economic development in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a very active international financial center,"
he went on, "As China's need for international capital increases,
Hong Kong is in a unique position to participate in that area and
therefore derive benefits for ourselves at the same time."
</P>
<P>
"So we will be able to participate very fully in China's
economic development. We are very much looking forward to taking
full advantage of the development." the 51-year-old Tung said.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Group to Wage Violent Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A pro-British Protestant
guerrilla group in Northern Ireland claimed responsibility Friday
for a bomb attack on a Roman Catholic home this week and vowed to
wage a violent campaign in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
A caller to Downtown Radio in the British-ruled province said
the attack at the town of Dungannon, in which a woman and four
children escaped injury, was the work of the Red Hand Defenders.
</P>
<P>
"Further attacks will continue. The war is still on. We will
start attacking the south soon with guns or bombs," the caller
said.
</P>
<P>
Police said the "pipe-bomb" device used Thursday failed to
explode when it was thrown through a kitchen window while the
woman was asleep in a downstairs room and the children, aged from
five to 11, were in bed upstairs.
</P>
<P>
The Protestant guerrilla group killed a 35-year-old Catholic in
a street shooting on a day in October when rival Northern Irish
parties were supposed to have established a body that would take
over day-to-day running of the province from British ministers
next February.
</P>
<P>
The Red Hand Defenders is one of several small groups which
oppose the British-ruled province's peace agreement from among
pro-British Protestant gunmen and their Catholic republican
opponents.

<HEADLINE> New Head Appointed for Wildlife Trade Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Willem Wouter Wijnstekers of
the Netherlands has been appointed Secretary-General of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild
Fauna and Flora (CITES), Xinhua learned here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was announced by Klaus Toepfer, Executive
Director of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) based in Nairobi,
which administers the Convention.
</P>
<P>
After14 years working in the private sector and the Dutch
administration, Wijnstekers became responsible for wildlife trade
legislation in the European Commission's Directorate General for
the Environment, Nuclear Safety and Civil Protection in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Born in Rottoerdam in 1948, Wijnstekers has over 20 years built
up a great deal of expertise in drafting European Community
wildlife conversation legislation, particularly on the
implementation of CITES.
</P>
<P>
CITES was signed in 1973 and entered into force on July1, 1975.
The Convention, drawn up to protect wildlife against
over-exploitation and to prevent international trade from
threatening species with extinction, now has a membership of 144
countries.
</P>
<P>
These countries act by banning commercial international trade
in an agreed list of endangered species and by regulating and
monitoring trade of others that might become endangered. At
present , there are over 30,000 species of plants and animals
included in the Convention's three appendices.

<HEADLINE> U.S. GDP Increases by 3.9 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The nation's gross domestic
product (GDP) in 1998 increased by 3.9 percent, the U.S. Commerce
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
That followed an identical increase in 1997 and a healthy 3.4
percent rise in 1996, making the three-year period the economy's
most robust run of growth since 1984-86.
</P>
<P>
All this was accomplished with negligible inflation. A price
index tied to the GDP rose 1 percent last year. There hasn't been
a rate that low since 1959, also 1 percent, and it hasn't been
lower since 1950, 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that vigorous consumer spending and booming
business investment helped fuel the strongest surge in U.S.
economic growth in more than two years during the fourth quarter
of 1998. In the quarter, GDP shot ahead at a 5.6 percent annual
rate, a sharp acceleration from the third quarter's 3.7 percent
rate of growth and the strongest pickup in activity for any
quarter since a 6.1 percent jump in the second quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter rate surprised economists, and they have
been surprised all year. They've been predicting that U.S.
economic growth will slow markedly as a result of the spillover of
the slump in Asia, Russia and Latin America onto manufacturing,
agriculture and energy.
</P>
<P>
Now, with economic momentum so strong at the end of the year,
they say the slowdown won't show up before the April-June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. trade deficit did deteriorate in 1998, with imports
shooting 10.8 percent higher and exports growing only 1.5 percent,
the weakest performance in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
But spending by American consumers on houses, cars and
furniture and by businesses on computers saved the year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending rose 4.8 percent, the most in 14 years.
Housing construction surged 10.4 percent, also the most in 14
years.
</P>
<P>
However, to maintain the frenzied pace, consumers reduced their
savings rate -- savings as a percentage of after-tax income --
from 2.1 percent in 1997 to 0.5 percent in 1998, the lowest since
1933.
</P>
<P>
Business investment in new equipment jumped 16.7 percent, the
most in six years, offsetting a 0.7 percent decline in
construction of commercial buildings. Equipment purchases were
driven by computer sales, which rose 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that if not for the trade deterioration, overall
growth for the year would have topped 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, the surge in growth was heavily
influenced by an 80.7 percent jump in automobile output,
reflecting the return to production at General Motors after
strikes over the summer. Excluding the impact of autos, the
economy grew at a seasonally adjusted 3.5 percent rate in the
fourth quarter and at a 4.2 percent rate in the third.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe the combination of strong growth, low
inflation and looming threats to the U.S. economy from overseas
means the Federal Reserve probably won't touch short-term interest
rates for some months.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Countries Urged to Act on Preventing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Major industrial nations
and the international community should take immediate actions to
prevent the current financial crisis from deepening, a United
Nations task force said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The world economy is experiencing a major slowdown, which may
deepen if inadequately managed, warned the task force of the
Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Japan is in its worst recession since the war, much of East and
Southeast Asia is in depression, Russia is experiencing a major
downturn, growth has stalled in Latin America, and commodities
prices are falling, said the report entitled Toward a New
International Financial Architecture.
</P>
<P>
"Current policies may prove insufficient to prevent the world
economy from slipping into recession," it alerted.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that the rules of an open international
trading system operate smoothly, allowing the economies facing
adjustment to reduce their deficits or generate trade surpluses
with the more vigorous industrial economies.
</P>
<P>
The new type of contingency financing by institutions such as
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) "should become a stable
feature of the new international financial order, and that the
availability of funds should be guaranteed without delay," it
added.

<HEADLINE> Angola President to Reshuffle Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos announced Friday to reshuffle his government soon to
"make it capable of facing the challenges for the country".
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos made the decision known in his letter to the
national parliament.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government and the armed forces will, from
Friday, be under the directly leadership of the president, while
the routine military, political, social and economic affairs will
be handled by the standing committee of the Ministerial Council.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos said that as the rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) is launching another civil war in
Angola, the country is facing "serious situations" in military,
economic, financial and social sectors, so is necessary for the
government to be reshuffled for a higher efficiency.
</P>
<P>
It is not necessary to impose the state of emergency at
present, as that will restrict the cardinal rights and freedom of
the citizens and affect Angola' s hard-won democracy, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting erupted between the government and UNITA forces
in November 1998, which then spread to other parts of the country,
and as a result, the U.N. peace observers withdrew from the
country after declaring that peace process went collapsed in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Though situation in the central part of the country is making a
turn for the better with the government forces advancing to Andulo
City where the UNITAI headquarters is located, situation in the
northern part of the country is getting intensified as UNITA men
seized Mbanza-Congo of Zaire Province.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Accuses Liberia of Involving in Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone Friday
accused neighboring Liberia of involving in the conflict in the
West African nation, saying that the fighting in the country "is a
regional conflict."
</P>
<P>
James Jonah, Sierra Leone's minister of finance, development
and economic planning, told a press conference here that the
fighting in the country "is not an internal conflict, it is a
regional conflict."
</P>
<P>
"It is an attempt being made by a group of countries and
individuals to deny the people of Sierra Leone the right to choose
their own government," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"You know the recent invasion of our capital Freetown was
organized from outside, sustained from outside and financed from
outside," he said. "It is indeed surprising that all the resources
that was put into this operation, but end in failure."
</P>
<P>
"It is the third time that the enemy of Sierra Leone, whether
internal or external, failed" in its attempt to topple the
democratically-elected government, led by President Ahmed Kabbah,
he said, referring to the recent drive by the West African
peacekeepers, known as the ECOMOG, to push the rebels back from
Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that his government has reported to the U.N.
Security Council on the Liberian involvement in the conflict in
his country, which was denied by the Liberian government headed by
President Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is clear that Liberia has been involved in the
conflict from the very beginning," he said, adding that his
government has informed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan there
are five camps in Liberia to train Sierra Leonean fighters.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah staged a political comeback in Sierra Leone in March
1998 with the help of the ECOMOG after he was toppled before going
on exile in Guinea in the wake of a military coup.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for fresh talks between the government and
rebels, whether internal or external, because there exists a peace
agreement, called the Abidjan accord," which was mediated by West
African countries about two years ago in the capital of Cote
d'Ivoire to end the crisis in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on the U.N. Security Council to be more
even-handed in dealing with African crises, including that of
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"Peace is indivisible," and "we need more robust from the
council," said the minister, who met Thursday with the president
of the Security Council, Celso Amorim of Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Speaker in Iran to Boost Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Speaker of the Grand
National Assembly (parliament) Hikmet Cetin said Friday evening
that he hopes his visit to Iran will bear fruits in broadening
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cetin made the remarks upon his arrival in Tehran on a four-day
visit to boost cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Cetin said that he will exchange views with Iranian officials
on different issues such as bilateral relations and cooperation
at the regional and international levels, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Turkey, as neighbors, have historically lived in an
atmosphere of friendship and shared cultural and social
commonalities, Cetin said.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming Cetin at the Tehran airport, Iranian Majlis
(parliament) Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri maintained that the
Iranian-Turkish cooperation will play an effective role in
restoration of peace, security and tranquillity in the region.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Cetin's visit to Iran will be fruitful
for the two countries and the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Terming Iran and Turkey as two great neighboring nations with
many commonalities, Nateq-Nouri said that his talks with Cetin
will focus on issues of bilateral interests, especially the Iraqi
crisis and the situation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military forces have frequently entered northern Iraq
to wipe out the Turkish Kurdish militia who have been fighting for
years for autonomy in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iran has stated its opposition to Turkish military incursion
into northern Iraq and called for respect for Iraq's sovereignty
and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Tehran also blamed Ankara for its military cooperation with
Israel, which is seen by Iran as the most dangerous threat to the
Muslim world.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Calls for Reform of World Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The current
international financial system is unable to safeguard the world
economy from financial crises, a U.N. task force said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of financial flows, floating exchange rates,
financial innovations and new communications techniques have
increased not only financial transactions, but also volatility, it
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The concentration of participants in international financial
markets that apply criteria indiscriminately to all countries is a
major basis for contagion," said the task force of the Executive
Committee on Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The panel's views are reflected in a report entitled Toward a
New International Financial Architecture.
</P>
<P>
The report said, "Developing and transition economies have been
highly vulnerable to financial volatility and contagion.
</P>
<P>
"They have been particularly prone to periods of rapid
expansion and diversification of financial flows, often followed
by abrupt reversals.
</P>
<P>
"This pattern has been aggravated by premature and hasty
liberalization of the capital account, fragile domestic financial
structures, and weak financial regulation and supervision.
</P>
<P>
"Extended financial booms build up strong pressures on
aggregate domestic demand, which make macroeconomic balances
unsustainable during the ensuring financial contraction."
</P>
<P>
The panel said existing institutions are inadequate to deal
with financial globalization.
</P>
<P>
International financial institutions "have manifested
significant shortcomings in the consistency of macroeconomic
policies, and in the management of international liquidity,
financial supervision and regulation," it said.
</P>
<P>
The task force called for immediate actions by industrial
countries to cope with the current crisis and the reform of the
international financial architecture in the longer run.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Targets Four Percent Economic Growth in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government announced a
900 million U.S. Dollars budget for 1999, targeting the gross
domestic product (GDP) growth at four percent and reducing
inflation to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The budget was released by Zambian Minister of Finance and
Economic Development Hon Nawakwi on Friday and will be delivered
to parliament for approval..
</P>
<P>
The budget has been designed to reverse the economic decline
Zambia experienced in 1998, and to restore the economy firmly onto
the path of growth, said the minster.
</P>
<P>
It is targeted " at consolidating our efforts to reduce
poverty by providing real opportunities for advancement for our
people through economic growth, and stabilizing the exchange
rate," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the budget, Nawakwi provided an overview of the performance
of the economy in 1998, saying it was an exceptionally difficult
year for Zambia's economy. The year was characterized by a number
of adverse developments, both in the international economy and
domestically, that impacted very negatively on the performance of
the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the adverse developments in the international
economy, Zambia's economy was put under considerable strain. The
steep fall in world copper and cobalt prices reduced the metal
export earnings by 310 million Dollars, and led to an overall
decline of 11 percent in the mining sector's contribution to the
GDP.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the low metal prices and uncertain global
investment climate resulted in delays in the privatization of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), which depressed
investment activity in the entire economy.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the country experienced unfavorable weather
condition largely attributable to the EL Nino weather pattern,
which resulted in a six percent decline in agricultural production
in1998, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The inadequate availability of foreign exchange in the economy
also introduced severe inflationary pressures that drove the
annual rate of inflation up to 30.6 percent by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the government's macro-economic objectives over the
next three years, the minister said that during this period, the
government intends to achieve an average of 4.5 percent economic
growth per year, to reduce inflation to single digit levels by the
end of this period, and to strengthen Zambia' s external financial
position.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Addis Ababa University, the
oldest manpower development institution in Ethiopia, said it is
faced with an acute shortage of textbooks, The Ethiopian News
Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Taye Tadesse, Libraries Director of the university, was quoted
as saying that the majority of the university books are outdated
and old.
</P>
<P>
Taye said that most of the new books which are highly demanded
by the university are very expensive and could only be bought with
hard currency.
</P>
<P>
Because of lack of these books, he said, the university
community is unable to keep track of recent discoveries and
research findings.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of books has significantly impacted on the
teaching- learning process of the university which currently
caters for nearly 19,000 students, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has recently allocated two million Birr
(266,000 U.S. dollars) for the university to purchase books. But
he said that the money is not enough in view of the exorbitant
price of books in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Malawi's Population Drops: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary results of the
1998 population census indicated that Malawi's population
registered 9.8 million,

down from the previous12 million, the Malawian News Agency (MANA)
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
MANA quoted Commissioner for Census and Statistics Lloyd Golosi
as saying at a press conference in Blantyre Friday that the result
was due to three main reasons.
</P>
<P>
"The 12 million figure was due to the one million Mozambican
refugees who were in the country at the time of the previous head
count," said Golosi.
</P>
<P>
He said other factors that contributed to the present figure
include high mortality rate and family planning methods.
</P>
<P>
"We can also speculate that the population is at this level
because of the HIV/AIDS problem," said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
However, Golosi said that his office had not yet arrived at the
final figures.
</P>
<P>
"The 9.8 million is only a preliminary result," he said, adding
that the final results may take "two or more years to arrive at."
</P>
<P>
But the national statistics showed the final figure would not
be much different from the present one because the final figure
will be arrived at basing on the very questionnaires where the
preliminary results were made.
</P>
<P>
According to the preliminary results, the northern region has a
 population of 1,229,360, the central has 4,041,636 while the
southern has 4, 567,490 people.
</P>
<P>
The results also indicated that the male and the female are in
the ratio of 96 to 100.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Dar es Salaam-based
Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court ruled Friday that the two
suspects in the U.S. embassy bombing case cannot be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Delivering the ruling, Principal Resident Magistrate, Projestus
Lugazia, said that according to the section 225 (5) of Tanzania's
Criminal Procedure Act of 1985, the Kisutu court, as a lower
court, is not allowed to dismiss murder charges.
</P>
<P>
On August 7 last year, terrorists carried out a bomb attack on
the United States embassy in Dar es Salaam, killing 11 people and
injuring more than 70 others. A number of suspects were held after
the incident and released later, but two remain in police custody.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects are Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, an Egyptian
national, and Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian, who are charged
with murdering 11 persons.
</P>
<P>
The suspects have been held for more than five months.
Tanzanian police force, the prosecution side, in collaboration
with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), have yet
completed investigations into the case.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Abdul Mwengera, one of the defence
advocates for the suspects, requested the court to release his
clients in accordance with section 225 (4) of the act, which
stipulates that the prosecution side is supposed to complete the
investigations of a case within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Turning down Mwengera's request, Lugazia Friday said that the
section of the act cannot be applied in murder cases.

<P>
CARIO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Boeing is seeking to merge El Al, Israel's
national airline, a long-range program of aircraft acquisition
which can cost up to 1.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A senior Boeing official met Thursday with top El Al officials
at Ben-Gurion Airport, shortly after a visit by a senior official
of Airbus, the European conglomerate, Boeing's strongest
competitor.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israel Lands Administration plans to end land
profiteering by kibbutzim and moshavim, two kinds of collective
farms in Israel.
</P>
<P>
They were deprived of discounts they now receive when they
purchase land for expansion.
</P>
<P>
The decision aimed to stop the current widespread practice of
kibbutzim and moshavim selling building rights on the discounted
land they have bought from the land administration.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt is taking measures to increase the production of
oil crops, Deputy Prime Minister Youssef Wali said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said that an increasing number of modern olive farms have
been set up, especially in the newly-reclaimed land and in
southern valley, where the country is carrying out a mega-project.
</P>
<P>
Wali made the remarks during meeting with representatives of
manufacturers and distributors of food items from Egypt, Spain and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel was the only country in the Middle East
that suffered a drop in tourism for the second consecutive year in
1998, according to the preliminary data from the World tourism
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that tourism in the Middle East as a whole rose
5.3 percent last year, more than double the worldwide increase of
2.4 percent. But tourism in Israel fell 3 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Retain Control Over Tajik-Afghan Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Director of the Russian Federal
Border Service Col. Gen. Konstantin Totsky said Friday that Moscow
will not give up its control over the Tajik-Afghan border in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
"We don't see any possibility of surrendering to Tajikistan
control over the state border with Afghanistan" in the near
future, Totsky told.
</P>
<P>
"Such a step would not meet the interests of Russia or other
CIS countries," he said, referring to the 12-member Commonwealth
of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Totsky said the future of the border largely depends on the
developments in both Tajikistan and Afghanistan where the
situation is aggravated by the confrontation between the Taliban
and government troops.
</P>
<P>
"If the Taliban approaches the border with the CIS, a serious
threat will arise for the entire region," Totsky said.
</P>
<P>
He also said new forms of cooperation between border services
are sought on more peaceful sections of the CIS border, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Totsky said parts of the Kyrgyz state border will soon be
handed over to local guards.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement will be drafted in February-March on the
stage-by-stage handover of the sections and on border cooperation
between Kyrgyzstan and Russia," Totsky said.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebel Leader Dismisses 2 Generals from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Two generals who commanded the
UNITA troops attacking central cities of Huambo and Kuito last
December have been removed from office by their leader Jonas
Savimbi, the official Angolan news agency ANGOP said Friday.
</P>
<P>
ANGOP quoted Tiago Delfim, a turn-coat UNITA second lieutenant,
as saying Friday that the two generals, Altino Sapalalo and Antero
Viera Menezes, had been strong supporters for Savimbi's "tough
line" and they had served in the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Delfim said that Savimbi has deprived both Sapalalo and Menezes
of their military ranks because the troops under their command did
not take the two cities but suffered a lot of losses of personnel
and materiel.
</P>
<P>
According to ANGOP, Delfim surrendered himself to the Angolan
government troops recently in Chipeta, a town some 25 kilometers
east of Kuito because he "believed that the conflicts in Angola
could be resolved peacefully."

<HEADLINE> Gulf War Syndrome May Not Exist: UK Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- There may be no specific Gulf
War Syndrome, despite the fact that many veterans of the 1991 war
have developed illnesses, according to a report from UK's Ministry
of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from the Ministry of Defense's Medical Assessment
Program assessed 1000 Gulf War veterans who sought medical
treatment between October 1993 and February 1997.
</P>
<P>
Reporting Friday in the British Medical Journal, the doctors
said that their findings confirm other recent work that suggests
no single physical or psychological cause is responsible for the
illnesses seen in some Gulf War veterans.
</P>
<P>
The authors speculated that this pattern of illness has been
described after previous conflicts and may be another example of
what have been described as "postwar syndromes".
</P>
<P>
War service in the past has "often been associated with illness
occurring in the post-war period", the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
Their study found that 59 percent of veterans had more than one
diagnosed condition, 39 percent had at least one condition for
which no physical or psychological diagnosis could be given and in
nearly one in 10 cases no diagnosis could be made.
</P>
<P>
Gulf War Syndrome has sparked much controversy in recent years
with veterans' groups in Britain and the U.S. accusing the
military in both countries of ignoring the plight of sufferers.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms suffered by veterans of the Gulf conflict have
ranged from chronic fatigue syndrome to chest pains and arthritis.
</P>
<P>
British Gulf War veterans Friday slammed the new Ministry of
Defense report, calling it "an outrageous attempt to cover up Gulf
War Illness" and demanded an independent study.

<HEADLINE> PC Sales Rise Sharply in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- World-wide personal
computer sales got a double-digit increase in 1998 because
of the strong demand from both the corporate and home
markets, according to reports by two U.S. market-research
firms.
</P>
<P>
Analists at both Dataquest and international Data Corp.
believe there is more world-wide demand this year and PC
shipment will continue rising at a double-digit pace.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest, based in San Jose, Calif., said in its latest
report that PC shipment worldwide increased 17.7 percent to
a record high of 92.92 million units last year. It was 80.60
million units on the market in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The IDC report, however, estimated the growth at 15.4
percent in 1998. The two firms varied in their estimates
because they used different methodologies.
</P>
<P>
The strong demand were mainly from Europe and the
United states, according to IDC. Europe's demand was fueled
by the continent's recovery from an economic slump while
the sales increase in the U.S. was driven in part by
sub-1000-U.S.-dollar PCs bought by consumers seeking to use
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Among the top suppliers were Compaq, IBM, Dell and
Hewlett-packard. Compaq remained the biggest shipper who put
12.78 million units on the market in 1998 from 10.59 millions
in the previous year, achieving a 20.7 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
IBM ranked second on the list but it was facing a challenge
from fast-growing Dell. IBM rose 9.5 percent in shipment to
7.61 million units in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Dell, the third-biggest PC maker, increased its sales 64.9
percent to 7.36 million PCs, just 256,000 units less than
IBM's.
</P>
<P>
Hewlett-Packard shipped 5.39 million units in 1998,
ranking fourth biggest PC makers. The company scored a 25.5
percent increase.

<HEADLINE> US Data Keeps European Stocks Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON January 29 (Xinhua) - A surprising spurt in US economic
growth encouraged European stock markets to hold onto morning
gains Friday.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 Index just fell short of the psychological 5900
barrier, climbing 23.5 points to 5896.0 by the close of the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Telecom stocks were a major focus for London's stock market on
the day. News that the government could lift the ceiling on BT's
stake in Cellnet joint venture helped send the sector soaring.
</P>
<P>
While BT's 3.5p gain to 930.5p was modest, it led to the 7
percent jump in Securicor, BT's partner in Cellnet.
</P>
<P>
Securicor put on 42.5p to 631.25p in the hope that BT would now
snap up its 40 percent share at a significant premium.
</P>
<P>
German share prices eased off earlier highs but remain well
supported. The Dax index finished 63.55 points higher at 5159.96.
</P>
<P>
The auto sector was still in the spotlight in the wake of
Ford's announcement that it planned to buy Sweden's Volvo car
unit.
</P>
<P>
French stocks also lose their grip on session highs, but
bullish corporate results supported the market. The Cac 40 index
finished the day 52.13 points higher at 4251.80.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU Make Compromise on Free Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- South African and European
Union (EU) negotiators announced Friday that they had made a
compromise which would enable them to finalize a free trade
agreement, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The compromise was made at a meeting between South African
Trade and Industry Minister, Alec Erwin, and EU Commissioner Joao
de Deus Pinheiro in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Both sides refused to disclose the details of the compromise as
the agreement has to be referred back to their principals -- the
South African cabinet and the EU Council of Ministers respectively
-- for ratification.
</P>
<P>
But both men were confident that the compromise reached was
within the mandate they had been given, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that today we reached a compromise, which as all
compromises have not left any one of us happy, but we can live
with it. That is the spirit of compromise," Pinheiro told
reporters at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said the compromise was acceptable to the South African
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
"I think it would be fair to say that as negotiators we have
come to the end of these very important negotiations and hopefully
these will be sanctioned by the principals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had attempted to meet each other half-way, Erwin
said.
</P>
<P>
He would not disclose whether South Africa had backed down to
EU demands that South African wine producers stop using the names
"port" and "sherry", saying that the final agreement reached on
the issue was a complicated one and had to be considered in its
entirety.
</P>
<P>
Pinheiro said that many of the issues discussed during the
South African- EU trade negotiations would be covered in broader
trade negotiations to be conducted by the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
He felt it was unfortunate that the negotiations had become
stuck on the "port" and "sherry" issue because there were other
parts of the agreement which had far greater economic
consequences.
</P>
<P>
He expected the EU Council of Ministers to deal with the
agreement at its next meeting on February 22.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Plants Safer Than Coal: Scientist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Nuclear power plants are a much
safer option in terms of the effect on peoples' health than
traditional coal burning power stations, according to a U.S.
scientist.
</P>
<P>
Comparing the nuclear and coal wastes on the basis of disposal
techniques, "the coal wastes are 40 times more harmful to human
health than nuclear wastes", Professor Bernard Cohen wrote in the
British journal Interdisciplinary Science Reviews.
</P>
<P>
Professor Cohen, from University of Pittsburgh, pointed out
that fifteen tons of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide are
produced every minute in a large, coal power station together with
large quantities of other waste chemicals.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, a nuclear power station, which can generate the
same amount of electricity as a large coal burning power station,
will produce an amount of waste that is five million times smaller
in size.
</P>
<P>
This waste "can be handled with a care and sophistication that
is completely out of the question for the millions of tons of
waste spewed out annually from an analogous coal burning plant",
he said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen calculated that from the current disposal techniques, air
pollution from a coal burning power station results in the
fatalities of 25 people while nuclear wastes from generating the
same amount of electricity would kill 0.018 people.

<HEADLINE> S. African Voter Registration Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The second round of voter
registration in South Africa got under way Friday with fewer
hiccups reported than the first round last year.
</P>
<P>
"All areas of the country report very few logistical problems
with the failure of a few voting stations to open being caused by
the non-arrival of public servant staff," the Independent
Electoral Commission (IEC) said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
All stations in Eastern Cape Province opened on time as did
those in Northern Cape, with the exception of a few in Kimberley,
according to South African Press Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
In KwaZulu-Natal and North West, around 90 percent of the
stations were open by 11 a.m. in Mpumalanga, five were not open by
10 a.m., SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven stations opened late in Western Cape while several
stations in Gauteng were still closed at mid-day.
</P>
<P>
In the only politically related incident of the day, a group of
United Democratic Movement (UDM) supporters held a rally next to a
registration station in Ngeleni in Eastern Cape.
</P>
<P>
Despite concerns by IEC officials in the area, the situation
was defused after UDM leaders intervened and persuaded their
rally-goers to move to another venue, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
According to SABC television, in contrast to the first round of
 registration, more youths were registered Friday.

According to the diplomat, the Council members were attempting
to reach an agreement on Canada's proposals to convene three expert
panels aimed at reviewing all aspects of Iraq's relations with the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Such an agreement was unlikely to be reached for the time being
with Russia's objecting to any role for the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction in the panel for disarmament, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Canada submitted a revised plan to the Council on Wednesday,
calling for setting up of three panels to assess disarmament,
the condition of the Iraqi people living under sanctions, and an
accounting of missing Kuwaitis and others during the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Canada proposed the panel for disarmament be comprised of
experts from UNSCOM, the International Atomic Energy Agency and
the U.N. Department of Disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Canada said the plan is to get the Council's discussions
moving on Iraq rather than devise a new policy on the future of
arms inspections or sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Government Backs Up Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Government will
support the farmers to buy tractors, combines and other farming
machines as well as irrigation rigs, the Rompres news agency
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a recently passed Ordinance, the agency said that the
banks may grant credits out of their own sources at the current
interest to the farmers requesting such credits for buying farm
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The Ordinance stipulates that those who benefit from such
credits are natural and juristic persons whose permanent and main
occupation is farming and cattle breeding, and who own and work at
least 5 hectares of arable land, farmed in grains, technical
plants and fodder or 2 hectares for growing vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Romania's farming mechanical equipment developed at a slow pace
in recent years. Most of the tractors and harvester-threshers have
now become considerably run down.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in the Ministry of Agriculture, Romania at
present avails of 163,000 tractors, only 44 percent of its
necessary set of mechanics, of which over 50 percent are 8 to 14
years old. The sources also indicated that 87 percent of the
harvester-threshers are older than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, the average tilled area would be
around 60 hectares per tractor, whereas in the European Union
countries it goes from 4.6 to 21 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Seek Investment from Morocco, France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is to start on Sunday an
investment promotion campaign in Morocco and France, an official
in charge of foreign investments said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Head of Egypt's General Authority for Investment and Free Zones
Ibrahim Fawzi told reporters that he will fly to Rabat to open a
seminar on opportunities of investment and trade between Egypt and
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will be attended by key communications companies,
leather industries and software companies of the two countries,
and will deal with investment and trade opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Despite the excellent political relations between Egypt and
Morocco, the two countries have set up only six joint investment
companies, Fawzi said.
</P>
<P>
The joint ventures have a total capital of 430 million Egyptian
pounds (126.47 million U.S. dollars), to which Morocco has
contributed 31 million pounds (9.12 million dollars), or 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi said that after the activities in Morocco, he will travel
to Paris to take part in another seminar organized by the Egyptian
embassy in France in cooperation with the French Foreign Trade and
Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would review with the French companies
attending the seminar Egypt's investment opportunities and the
incentives, exemptions and facilities offered to investors.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-three joint investment companies have been established
between Egypt and France with an issued capital of about 2.6
billion pounds (765 million dollars), to which France has
contributed 514 million pounds (151.12 million dollars), the
Egyptian official said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt sees a steady increase in foreign investments in recent
years, which stood at 1 billion dollars in 1997 and 1.5 billion
dollars in 1998, Fawzi said.

<HEADLINE> Three Criminal Suspects Repatriated from  Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Three criminal suspects
accused of misappropriating public funds for personal use were
repatriated from the State of Mongolia three days ago, according
to the Ministry of Public Security today.
</P>
<P>
 The three, Deng Baoju, Mai Weiping, and Chen Xiqiu, are
former officials of the Shajing Rural Credit Cooperative in
Shenzhen, China's first Special Economic Region.
</P>
<P>
 Since January 1997, the three suspects began
misappropriating public funds for private investment and
spending, leading to more than 200 million yuan in losses for the
credit cooperative. The three fled to the State of Mongolia last
November with over three million yuan of public funds.
</P>
<P>
 The China National Bureau of Interpol contacted their
counterparts in Mongolia soon after the bureau received a report
on the case.
</P>
<P>
 The three suspects were detained in the State of Mongolia on
January 11, and were repatriated on January 27.

</P>
<P>
They flew 680 kilometers in seven hours and 40 minutes after
taking off from Rongcheng, China's nearest city to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
They landed at sunset at the mountainous area with the

</P>
<P>
"Now we are too exhausted to move," the 29-year-old Liu said
through telephone. "Fortunately, the police found us and they
offered some help."
</P>
<P>
Ballooning, which needs more courage than skills, is a nascent
sport in China.
</P>
<P>
"This marked a milestone in hot air ballooning in China," said
Liu Liancheng, president of the Ballooning Committee of China
Aeroaviation Association.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time for Chinese balloonist to fly over
such a long distance across the sea, and with the success we'll

WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States last year achieved the best combination
of strong economic growth, low inflation and low unemployment in
more than three decades, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- A Serbian police raid on a suspected rebel stronghold in
southern Kosovo early Friday ended in what international
inspectors called a "mass killing" of 24 ethnic Albanian men that
added urgency to a new Western plan aimed at bringing peace to
the province.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Clinton's top national security advisers
decided that the U.S. should commit several thousand ground
troops to an international force in Kosovo to monitor an eventual
cease-fire there, according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton administration officials say they are planning to
seek tougher sanctions against Libya because there has been no
sign of cooperation a month before an American deadline for Libya
to hand over two suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in
1998.

<HEADLINE> Sky Over Yan'an Becomes Clearer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The mountain city of Yan'an on
the Loess Plateau in northwest China's Shaanxi Province now
enjoys improved air quality thanks to a government campaign to
control air pollution launched early this winter.
</P>
<P>
One elder resident, Wang Xuezhong, said, "As the air has
become purer and fresher in recent months, I feel refreshed and
comfortable. In the past, whenever I came back home from morning
excise, my nostril was filled with black dust."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wei, a young woman working in the city's tourism bureau,
complained, "Coal dust used to stain my collars and cover the
white chickens with a thick coat of dust. Air pollution control
now makes it possible for us to see a clear sky."
</P>
<P>
With the air quality improved, several large hospitals in
Yan'an have an unusual number of vacant beds this winter, as the
number of people suffering from respiratory diseases decreases,
according to one hospital official.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an was the headquarters of the Communist Party of China
for 13 years before the founding of the People's Republic in
1949. In the past, the mountain city was enveloped by thick smoke
as local residents used coal-fueled stoves for cooking and
heating. The situation became worse in winter when a multitude of
chimneys gushed out heavy black smoke, sometimes bringing
visibility down to only several meters.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the urban district of Yan'an had 50
000 stoves consuming 40,000 tons of coal in each of the past few
years. The majority of the coal was bituminous, discharging 3,000
tons of sulfur dioxide and 6,900 tons of smog a year.
</P>
<P>
The central and local governments have attached great
importance to air pollution in Yan'an. As early as 1985, the
Shaanxi provincial government established an air pollution resea
rch center and built a thermal power plant, a liquefied petroleum
gas center, and several dust treatment projects in Yan'an.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng,former premier of the State Council, earmarked 30
million yuan in 1993 for environmental improvement in the
province, but there was no fundamental change in the atmospheric
quality. Air quality experts said coal use was mainly
responsible for the worsening air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Based on a three-month investigation, the local government
issued a circular last September urging people to replace
bituminous coal with low-sulfur and low-ash coal because the
latter releases only one-quarter of the smog released by
bituminous coal. As the price of low-sulfur coal is twice that of
bituminous, many families were provided with state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The province's plan focused on controlling sulfur dioxide
emissions, the main pollutant of the atmosphere and the cause of
acid rain.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the average concentration of suspended particles
and dust have reduced by 30 percent, and the density of sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen oxide in the air has reached required state
standards, said an official with the city's air-monitoring
center.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Population Growth Rate Declines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's population growth
rate in 1998 stood at 2.3 percent, registering a decline of 0.3
percentage points in comparison with that in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The latest report by Pakistan's National Institute of
Population Studies (NIPS) holds that if the current trend of
declining continues, Pakistan will be able to bring down its
population growth rate to 2 percent by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's demography indicates that the decline in the
population growth rate began in the early 1990s and the downward
trend continued in the decade.
</P>
<P>
The population growth rate stood at 3 percent in 1991 and after
that gradually fell to 2.6 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Population Welfare and Science and Technology
Syeda Abida Hussain said recently that despite the positive
downward trend, it has to be noted that gross rate would remain
more or less the same as more and more people would be entering
the fertile age.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, about 4 million people were being added annually and
in 2001, a modestly lower growth rate will still mean an addition
of 4 million to the population, she said.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend would be established only when the number of
children being born per household is reduced from 5.5 to three,
the minister added.
</P>
<P>
The NIPS report shows that Pakistan's population was more than
1,300 million in 1998. The country now is the world's seventh most
populous country.

<HEADLINE> Angola's New Cabinet Sworn In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Angola's new cabinet ministers
were sworn in Saturday morning in the State House.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle of the cabinet took place at a time of escalating
armed conflicts in the southern African country between the
government army and the opposition National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The major move in the reshuffle is that President Eduardo dos
Santos has removed Prime Minister Fernando Van-Dunem and decided
to lead the government and the armed forces himself. Meanwhile,
over half of ministers were replaced.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle, said the president, is to "downsize the
government and improve efficiency" so as to meet the challenge of
current situation.
</P>
<P>
He added that the re-starting of civil war by the former rebel
UNITA movement has posed a grim situation to the political,
military, social and economic aspects of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, Dos Santos said: "It is not necessary to declare a
state of emergency to affect the democratic results already
achieved by the Angolan people."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the country would rather mobilize all
resources under the condition of strictly abiding by law, to
overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the reshuffle, Joao Miranda has replaced Venancio da
silva moura as foreign minister; Kundy Payama becomes the new
defense minister while Fernando da Piedade dias dos Santos takes
the position of interior minister.
</P>
<P>
Despite the president's promise to reserve fours ministers for
the splinter UNITA Renovation Committee, only Jorge Valentim and
Victorino Hossi have kept their posts of minister of hotels and
tourism and minister of trade respectively.

<HEADLINE> Iran, Turkey Underline Respect to Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Parliament speakers of Iran and
Turkey on Saturday underlined the need to respect Iraq's
territorial integrity and independence.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Majlis Speaker Nateq Nouri and his Turkish counterpart
Hikmet Cetin made the statement in their first round of talks,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Nouri condemned any experimental attitude on Iraq, saying that
Iran supports territorial integrity and independence of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's partition will be detrimental to all countries of the
region, he said. "We condemn any form of U.S. intervention in
northern and southern Iraq, seeing it irrational and in
contravention of the international regulations," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nouri noted that cooperation among Iran, Turkey and Syria to
settle the Iraqi crisis would be "helpful." He said regional
crises require the countries sharing common interests to have
multi-faceted cooperation and coordination.
</P>
<P>
Cetin said that Turkey's foreign policy is based on respect
for Iraq's territorial integrity and national sovereignty, full
implementation of all U.N. resolutions concerning Iraq and
the lifting of U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said that eruption of other crises in Iraq would surely
leave negative impacts on regional countries and Turkish
officials believe regional issues should be settled by regional
states themselves.
</P>
<P>
It is only the Iraqi people that can decide on the type of
their government, said Cetin who arrived here Friday evening for
a four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Wedding Ceremony: Costly Romance for the Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Wanna get married? Prepare to
spend about 50,000 yuan for the wedding ceremony, a recent poll
has suggested to newly engaged couples in China.
</P>
<P>
The wedding expenditure nowadays is almost 50 times more than
in 1978, and has forced many young people to borrow money from
parents, friends or banks, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
A couple spent about 1,016 yuan (122 U.S. dollars) to tie the
knot in 1978, while now it can cost as much as 51,000 yuan (
about 6,000 dollars). The least costly ceremony needed only 40
yuan 20 years ago, compared with the most expensive one now that
can cost a couple 360,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among 200 couples from two groups;
one group got married in 1978, and one this month in Tianjin,
China's third largest city.
</P>
<P>
Purchasing furniture, clothing and home appliances such as
TVs, refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners emptied
the pockets of the modern newlyweds currently, while their
counterparts of 20 years ago struggled to afford the luxuries of
wristwatches, bicycles, radios and sewing machines.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the soaring wedding expenditures to
greater income and changing attitudes.
</P>
<P>
An engaged couple may now earn 1,696 yuan a month, compared
with 80 yuan in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The idea that "the less the wedding costs, the better it is"
was held by 30 percent of the 1978 group, but by only one percent
of this year's couples.
</P>
<P>
Rocketing wedding costs have forced 21 percent of today's
young couples to borrow money, while only eight percent needed
loans 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey was sponsored by the Tianjin Evening News, an
influential Tianjin newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Top Legislature Proposes Draft Amendments to Constitution for Full NPC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
formulated draft amendments to the Constitution today and decided
to table them for consideration at the full annual session of the
NPC on March 5.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendments were drawn up on the basis of a proposal
by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on
amending parts of the Constitution and discussions of lawmakers
at the two-day 7th session of the NPC Standing Committee which
closed here today.
</P>
<P>
The amendments incorporate "Deng Xiaoping Thought" into the
Constitution, and stipulate that the state shall administer state
affairs according to law and build a socialist country with the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
The draft also bolster the status of private economic entities
as "important components of the socialist market economy." While
the existing Constitution says these enterprises are only
"supplements of the public ownership economy," and are allowed to
"exist and develop" within the limits of law.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, commented on
the draft amendments saying the additions which were already
affirmed in the report of the 15th National Congress of the CPC
in late 1997 have proved to be "completely correct" in practice,
and should be part of the nation's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
He said that "timely and meticulous amendments to the
Constitution will make it better meet the needs of reality and
help maintain the authority of the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Such revisions, after adoption, shall have "far-reaching
influences upon the development of the socialist market economy,
the construction of a socialist democratic political system, and
will generally advance cause of socialism with Chinese
characteristics," the top legislator said.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers approved the decision to submit the draft to the
full NPC session with 124 approvals, no objection and one
abstension.
</P>
<P>
The majority of legislators agreed that the proposed
amendments to the Constitution are necessary and in line with the
desires of all the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, who explained the CPC Central Committee proposal
to the NPC Standing Committee Friday in his capacity as a member
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, will again
explain the draft amendments to the full NPC session as vice
chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.

LAGOS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States government has

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) rebels attacked government force installations in Mindanao,
the Southern Philippines, Saturday despite a ceasefire agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency quoted Julieto Ando, spokesman of
the government forces in Mindanao, as saying that rebels attacked
with mortars and grenades four detachments of the 27th Infantry
Batallion (IB) along the Secretary Narciso Ramos highway in
Matanog, Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
Ando said the government forces retaliated later with a number
of mortar shells and artillery fires.
</P>
<P>
The fresh clashes started around 09:45 Saturday (01:45 GMT
Friday), he said.
</P>
<P>
Casualties from both sides cannot yet be determined as the
intense battle is still ongoing, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government forces temporarily closed the highway
for commuters.
</P>
<P>
But MILF spokesman Mohaquer Iqbal blamed the government forces
for encroachment into the perimeter defense line of Camp Abubakar
that straddles along the tri-boundaries of Matanog, Buldon and
Barira towns.
</P>
<P>
Iqbal claimed the government soldiers advanced to their
position instead of withdrawing to a safe distance in compliance
with the provisions of the January 27 truce agreed upon by the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks, fighting between the rebel group and
the government forces in Southern Mindanao claimed at least 31
lives from both sides.
</P>
<P>
The 12,000-strong MILF is fighting for an independent Islamic
state in the Southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Ombudsman's Report on New HK Airport Accepted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- An Ombudsman's report on the
commissioning and operation of the new Hong Kong Airport has been
accepted by the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and the Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
On the publication of the Ombudsman's report on the
Commissioning and Operation of the New Airport at Chek Lap Kok
Saturday, Acting Chief Executive and Administrative Secretary
Anson Chan said: "we have now had an opportunity to study it
carefully."
</P>
<P>
"Having done so, we accept the Ombudsman's recommendations for
improving the administration of public projects in future," Chan
said.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the government "specifically agree" that there
should be "clear definition of roles, powers, functions and
relationship among all key parties involved in major public
projects including clear lines of responsibilities and
communication."
</P>
<P>
Also, there should be "channels to facilitate the candid
exchange of views" and "full prior consultation with relevant
parties in decision-making, and a mechanism to critically review
and assess operational readiness of key elements before
commissioning," she said.
</P>
<P>
On the relationship between the government and the Airport
Authority (AA), Chan said government directors would enhance
their working relationship with other non-government members, who
came from different professional or commercial backgrounds, to
ensure that the AA would effectively carry out its statutory
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday, the AA issued a statement to welcome the Ombu
dsman's report, which was handed over to Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Working Group which has been set up by the AA Board will
study the report thoroughly and will follow up recommendations
where appropriate to improve services," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Following the problems associated with the airport opening
period, the AA has cooperated with the different inquiries, and
has provided them with extensive information and assistance, the
statement said, adding that the AA is "pleased that the
Ombudsman's report has recognized these efforts."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that the AA staff "feel encouraged" by the
conclusion of the report which said "Hong Kong is now proud of
her new airport."

<HEADLINE> Two Chinese-Presented Rare Birds Arrive in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NIIGATA, Japan, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A pair of rare crested
ibises given to Japan by the Chinese government arrived Saturday
at an ibis conservation center on Sado Island, off the coast of
Niigata Prefecture in the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Of an endangered species, the two birds -- one male and one
female -- are gifts from Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Japanese Emperor Akihito, promised during Jiang's visit to Tokyo
last November.
</P>
<P>
Japanese scientists said they hope to breed the birds, which
were handed over earlier in the day at Xi'an airport in China's
Shaanxi Province to a delegation led by Hirohisa Kurihara,
Japan's parliamentary vice minister of environment.
</P>
<P>
The male, You You, was born in May 1996 and is 80 centimeters
in body length. The female, Yang Yang, with a length of 78 cm,
was born in April 1996. Both birds were artificially bred in
China.
</P>
<P>
In China, the number of crested ibises -- which were once
believed to have died out -- stands at 130 after the discovery of
seven of the birds in mountainous areas of Shaanxi Province in
1981.
</P>
<P>
The ibis has become extinct in the wild in Japan due to
environmental degradation and hunting.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Ban People's Democracy Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Chief Prosecutor Vural
Savas has asked the Constitution Court, Turkey's highest court, to
ban the People's Democracy party (HADEP) for its alleged
connection with the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Savas on Friday charged that the HADEP was operating as a
branch of the PKK and accused the party of inciting separatism
based on ethnic lines and enlisting volunteers for the PKK, the
Local Daily News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The HADEP branches are being used to form the grassroots of the
PKK and to organize activities to send militants to the PKK's
mountain bands, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Savas cited a nationwide hunger strike staged by HADEP members
in November in support of PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was detained in Rome in November and many HADEP
members began hunger strikes to protest attempts to have him
extradited to Turkey to stand trial on terrorist charges.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, Turkey's Constitution Court has banned 14
political parties.
</P>
<P>
The court's most recent decision to ban a party was made last
year when it closed the pro-Islamic Welfare Party on the grounds
that the party had become the center of anti-secular activities.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Economic Cooperation Hindered by Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The regional economic cooperation
is out of the question in the Middle East with the peace process
frozen, a senior Egyptian official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a general agreement that one can not talk of economic
cooperation in the Middle East" when the peace process is stalled,
Osama el-Baz, political advisor of President Hosni Mubarak, told
Egypt's Voice of Arab radio in a telephone interview from Davos,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz is with Mubarak in the Swiss city to take part in the
on-going annual World Economic Forum.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of backtracking on its commitments enshrined
in the Wye peace agreement signed with the Palestinians last
October in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Israel should pull back troops from another
13 percent of the West Bank in three phases.
</P>
<P>
But the accord was shelved after Israel carried out the first
phase of pullback in December. Israel demanded the Palestinians
collect illegal weapons, reduce the police forces and renounce the
intention to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the Israeli demands as new
conditions which are not included in the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
El-Baz said that Mubarak will meet with leaders of a number of
countries on the sidelines of the economic forum to discuss issues
including the Middle East peace process and the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is in a standoff with the United Nations Special
Commission, charged with overseeing the elimination of its weapons
of mass destruction, after it suspended cooperation with the
commission following a four-day U.S.-British attack in
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will address the forum on Sunday on Egypt's vision on the
global economy and what the country sees appropriate in serving
the economy in a world of globalization, el-Baz said.
</P>
<P>
He will also expound the legitimate demands of the developing
countries in taking part in the formulation of a new international
economic order, he added.

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Mice Can Produce Milk Low in Lactose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have
genetically engineered mice that produce milk low in lactose, the
sugar molecule that upsets the stomach in an estimated 70 percent
of adult milk drinkers.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bernard Jost and colleagues at Strasbourg, France,
reported in the February issue of the journal Nature
Biotechnology that they introduced a gene stimulating the
production of lactase into mice's mammary glands.
</P>
<P>
As lactase is an enzyme that digests lactose, they said, the
technique means that lactose is removed from the mice's milk,
leading to "a significant decrease" in lactose without obvious
changes in fat and protein concentration.
</P>
<P>
The findings suggest that it may be possible to produce
low-lactose milk for lactose intolerant adults, if the same gene
is successfully introduced into cows.
</P>
<P>
In order to produce low-lactose milk for human consumption,
producers would have to "scale-up" from the transgenic mice to
cows, said an editorial in the same journal by Dr. Bruce Whitelaw
from the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The six-nation Contact Group on the Kosovo issue in the
former Yugoslavia Friday summoned the two conflicting sides to
start negotiations and reach a political solution within three
weeks. France, Britain and Germany are ready to send
peace-keeping troops to Kosovo without U.S. participation, which
would mark the birth of an identity of European security.
</P>
<P>
-- The number of the unemployed in France dropped by five
percent, or 151,000, in 1998, the most substantial drop of
unemployment rate in the country ever since the 1973 world oil
crisis, said the government.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. economy grew by 5.6 percent in the last quarter of
1998 over the same period in 1997, which is the best since the
second quarter of 1996. The frenzy of consumption by U.S.
households, especially in cars, has compensated the U.S. economy
for the negative impact from Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- The primary schools in the suburbs of major French cities
have become the most insecure area for teachers, said a study by
a teachers' association.

</P>
<P>
One of the most important amendments is to put "Deng Xiaoping
Theory" and "develop a socialist market economy" into the Preface
of the Constitution, according to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the phrase "is currently" in the sentence of
"China is currently in the primary stage of socialism" in the
Preface will be revised into "will be over a long period of
time".
</P>
<P>
The proposal was discussed at the 7th meeting of the Ninth NPC
Standing Committee and became a bill of the NPC Standing
committee, and the bill will be submitted to the upcoming Second
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
This marks the third time China revises its Constitution since
it was adopted in 1982. China made amendments to part of the
Constitution in 1988 and in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Other important amendments will be made under the guidelines
of "ruling the country by law" and "developing a socialist market
economy".
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the following will be added to the
original articles:
</P>
<P>
In Article 5, "the People's Republic of China should implement
the principle of ruling the country by law, governing the country
according to law and making it a socialist country ruled by law"
will be added.
</P>
<P>
Contents to be added in Article 6 is, "in the primary stage of
socialism, the country should uphold the basic economic system in
which the public ownership is dominant and diverse forms of
ownership develop side by side, and it should also uphold the
distribution system with distribution according to work remaining
dominant and a variety of modes of distribution coexisting."
</P>
<P>
At the meantime, "rural collective economic organizations
should carry out the two-tier operation system that combines
unified management with independent management on the basis of
the household responsibility contract system with remuneration
linked to output" will be added to Article 8.
</P>
<P>
Amendments in Article 11 will be: "Non-public sector
comprising self-employed and private businesses within the domain
stipulated by law is an important component of the country's
socialist market economy", and "The country should protect the
legitimate rights and interests of self-employed and private
enterprises, and the country should also exercise the guidance, s
upervision and management over them according to law."
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the wording of
"counter-revolutionary activities" in Article 28 will be changed
into "crimes endangering the state security".
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that the amendments to be made to the
Constitution is the quintessence of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the
most successful experience China has gained in its reforms and
opening-up drive over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Tian Jiyun, member of the CPC Central Committee's Political
Bureau and member of the CPC Central committee's group on
revision of the Constitution told the NPC Standing committee
meeting that the principle in revising the Constitution is that
"we will only make amendments that are deemed necessary and
relevant conditions are ripe."
</P>
<P>
The revision group is led by Li Peng, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee
and Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> France Stresses Importance of Mubarak's Upcoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- French Ambassador in Cairo Jean
March Rocherean De La Sabliere has stressed the importance of
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's upcoming visit to France next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit comes as part of the continued consultations
between the Egyptian leader and French President Jacques Chirac on
thorny issues in the Middle East, Egypt's Al Ahram daily on
Saturday quoted De La Sabliere as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's visit also falls within the context of the
"well-founded" bilateral ties and increasing economic cooperation,
he said in an interview with the Arabic-language newspaper on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents have been closely following up the
developments of the situation in the Middle East, the French
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
France, which wants to play a key role in Mideast affairs,
maintains coordination with Egypt, the first Arab country to sign
a peace treaty with Israel and an active mediator in the Mideast
peace process and other regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The Mubarak-Chirac talks will cover the Iraqi crisis, De La
Sabliere said, adding that France and Egypt are seeking ways of
maintaining the security in the region and ending the Iraqi
people's sufferings.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is in a standoff with the United Nations Special
Commission, charged with overseeing the elimination of its weapons
of mass destruction, after Baghdad suspended cooperation with the
commission following a recent U.S.-British military attack.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain launched four-day air strikes
against Iraq in mid-December for what the U.S. denounced as
Baghdad's failure to comply with the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
France is keen on seeking ways of containing the Iraqi crisis,
De La Sabliere said, adding that it welcomed the communique issued
by the Arab foreign ministers' meeting on January 24.
</P>
<P>
The Arab communique called for halt to military attack on Iraq
and respect for the country's sovereignty and territorial
integrity. It also called on Iraq to comply with the U.N. Security
Council resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blamed as Major Source of Terrorism in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Israel was labeled as one of the
major sources of terrorism in the Middle East in a report
presented Saturday to Arab interior ministers, who are meeting
here to coordinate Arab efforts in combating drugs and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The five-page report, prepared by the Secretariat of the
Council of Arab Interior Ministers (CAIM), also blamed Israel for
trying to use its platform of fighting terrorism to "ensure its
targets of expansion into the Arab world."
</P>
<P>
"Israel is seeking to damage the reputation of Arab citizens by
misguiding world public opinion that Arabs are behind acts of
terrorism, sabotage and violence," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report was submitted for discussion at the ongoing
three-day meeting by Arab interior ministers, who are expected to
map out a pan-Arab strategy to combat drugs and terrorism in the
Mideast.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech at the opening ceremony Friday, Jordan's
new Crown Prince and the Regent Abdullah Bin Hussein stressed the
need for Arab countries to coordinate their efforts in fighting
terrorism and drug trafficking in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jordan stands firm against terrorism and illegal
drug trade and would strengthen its cooperation with other Arab
countries to combat drug abuses and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also conveyed a message to the participants from
Jordanian King Hussein Bin Talal, who wished the meeting a
success and stressed the need to fight terrorism for the
reputation of Islam and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Hussein left Amman for further cancer treatments in the United
States on Tuesday, after naming Abdullah as the new crown prince
and regent of the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are interior ministers and
representatives from Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia,
Morocco, Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and some other Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Northern Thailand to Be Hit by Water Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A serious water crisis will hit
Northern Thailand by the year 2010 as water resources are
dwindling, a seminar warned on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the seminar on "Sustainable Agriculture and
Survival of the Watershed Forest" said communities around northern
river basins like the Ping and Nan Rivers will face a chronic
water shortage. Other important basins like the Tha Chin and Sakae
Krang are likely to be affected.
</P>
<P>
Supply in the Chao Phraya River which runs through Bangkok will
be severely affected if river water from northern basins is
reduced because the Chao Phraya gets its water from northern
rivers, said Mingsun Khaosa-ard, a researcher on water resource
management at the Thailand Development Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Dwindling water resources in these river basins stem from
increasing population and extended agriculture in the north that
forces farmers to use more water, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of water shortages will be conflicts and
disputes over water resources at various levels involving the
state, farmers, hilltribe people and people in low-lying areas.
The lack of water will affect the environment and the economy, the
seminar warned.
</P>
<P>
In Chiang Mai province, the shortage becomes a sensitive racial
issue when hilltribes like the Karen and Hmong, who cultivate rice
and cauliflower in the hills, require large amount of water.
</P>
<P>
People who live in the city and low-lying areas, usually ethnic
Thais, blame the water shortage on hilltribe farmers using too
much water or storing water that should flow down to low-lying
land, said Thumrong Maseekaew, program coordinator of Care
Thailand, an NGO working group on community development in
Northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In General, northern river basins contain more water than the
Chao Phraya and each person usually has about 2,000 cubic meters
of available water per year.
</P>
<P>
But by the year 2010, each person would have only 1,500 cubic
meters per year, and that was considered "problematic" and "out of
control" in terms of water resource management, according to a
study delivered at the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Each person living in Thailand has about 1,845 cubic meters of
water supply to use in one year (1,845 cu.m/head/year), according
to the water stress index showing the amount of available water
supply in each country.
</P>
<P>
This figure indicates that Thailand does not have much of a
water scarcity problem and that if water shortages do occur, the
problem will be manageable, some experts said.
</P>
<P>
But if the water stress index reaches 1,700-1,000
cu.m/head/year level, it means the beginning of a chronic water
scarcity problem and water management will be unable to cope with.
</P>
<P>
Among countries in Southeast Asia, Thailand does not have an
abundant water supply as people believe, said Mingsun.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the water stress index of Laos shows significant
abundant resources of 50,392 cu.m/head/year, Myanmar at 22,000
cu.m/head/year and India at 1,896 cu.m/head/year.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, the water shortage in Thailand is a seasonal problem
and the state doesn't take it seriously. But the study warns that
water shortages will become a chronic problem," Mingsun said.

<HEADLINE> Fourth Asian Winter Games Open in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Fourth
Asian Winter Games, the largest ever in the history of the Winter
Asiad, kicked off Saturday afternoon with a grand opening
ceremony at an indoor ice rink in the mountain resort of
Yongpyong, Kangwon Province.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-Jung, President of South Korea, declared the opening
of the week-long Games, the last Asiad of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
Hironoshin Furuhashi, Executive Vice President of the Olympic
Council of Asia (OCA), represented OCA President Sheikh Ahmad
Al-Fahad Al-Sabah, who didn't attend the Games due to health
reasons, to make a speech at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Over 800 athletes and delegates from 23 countries and regions
are participating in the Games, which are staging in the three
sites of Yongpyong, Chunchon and Kangnung under the slogan "Asia,
Shining Brightly through Everlasting Friendship".
</P>
<P>
Athletes on the snow and ice will compete in 43 events in
seven sports of the Alpine skiing, cross country skiing,
Biathlon, speed skating, short-track speedskating, figure skating
and ice hockey.
</P>
<P>
In terms of participating delegations and athletes, the
Kangwon Asiad is the largest ever in the history of the Asian
Winter gala, which was launched in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Before the Kangwon Winter Asiad, the Harbin Games in 1996 were
the largest featuring over 700 participants from 17 countries and
regions as well as 43 golds on offer.
</P>
<P>
Japan sent the biggest delegation of 162 to the Kangwon Games
including 101 athletes followed by China of 147, host South Korea
of 136 and Kazakhstan of 126. But 102 athletes from the host are
the largest competitors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese won 15 golds at home in the 1996 Winter Asiad,
with Kazakhstan 14, Japan and South Korea eight each. But for
those Games this time China kept modest tone because Japan and
Kazakhstan sent stronger athletes to the Games.
</P>
<P>
"Japan and Kazakhstan will contest for the top at the gold
medal table, while China aims to outperform South Korea for third
with more golds," said Xiao Tian, chef de mission of the Chinese
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Eight delegations from Macau, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka,
Vietnam, Bangladesh, Philippines and Bhutan made their debut in
the Asian Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
Bhutan has one athlete for the competition while the other
seven only sent officials to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony was followed by a 10-minute Korean folk
performance and 20-minute modern singing and dancing performance
titled "Heaven, earth and Human beings," which symbolizes Asia's
everlasting peace and advancement into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,300 million won (about 1,300,000 U.S. dollars)
has been spent on staging the opening ceremony. Yoo Kyung-hwan,
59, the chief planner and producer of the opening program, is
renowned for choreographing the opening ceremonies of the Summer
Olympic Games in Seoul in 1988.
</P>
<P>
Yongpyong, also a venue for the February 6 closing ceremony,
will stage the Games' Alpine and cross-country skiing,
short-track speedskating and figure skating.
</P>
<P>
Speed skating and ice hockey competitions are held at an
outdoor ice rink in Chunchon and an indoor ice rink in Kangnung
respectively.
</P>

The ice hockey competition started Saturday afternoon with
South Korea playing Kazakhstan in the women's competition while
Japan facing Kuwait in the men's competition.

<HEADLINE> Congo (k) Rebels End Rift in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing rift between top
leaders of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) has ended in
Uganda owing to the persuasion work allegedly done by President
Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
RCD leader Wamba dia Wamba made this announcement at a press
conference here Friday, the Monitor daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the RCD's second vice-president Arthur Z'Ahidi Ngoma,
who had quit, has agreed to rejoin the movement and they were
reunited as before.
</P>
<P>
Ngoma can solve nothing by quitting and so later he agreed to
rejoin the movement because there was no fundamental cause for him
to do that, the professor-turned leader was quoted as saying in
Nile Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The report said the persuasion work was done by Museveni who
they often come to consult when rift or difficulties arise within
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Ngoma said Tuesday that he would not continue serving in the
RCD, the rebels' political wing, claiming it did not represent the
broad range of forces opposed to Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) President Laurent Kabila and had become "isolated".
</P>
<P>
Ngoma said he would not rejoin the rebel organization as its
vice president, but as a man who tries to mobilize people and
liberate his country.
</P>
<P>
There are mainly two rebel groups in DRC fighting to oust
Kabila. One is RCD and the other is Congolese Liberation Movement
led by business tycoon Jean Pierre Bemba, the son of Saolone Bemba
and former close associate of the late Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
The six-month war in DRC has left the economy of the third
largest African country in shambles. There is still no sign of
end to the conflict because no key players in the war will back
down.

KAMPALA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said he will not be intimidated by abuses launched by

Some MPs said the president is not trying to remove the corrupt

protecting them.
</P>
<P>
The privatization and valley dams scandals, which have shocked
the whole country, are reportedly involving senior government
officials who allegedly embezzled huge sums of public funds. There
is a loud outcry for the president to do something against
increasing rampant corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision paper reported Saturday that Museveni was
requested by some MPs who support him to do something and to
silence those who accused him.
</P>
<P>
However, Museveni said although some MPs have abused him in the
past, this has not dented his popularity or derailed his
principles.
</P>
<P>
He said he has the tongue and would fight back when the
opportunity comes, adding that he could wait to the last minute of
his patience.

<HEADLINE> G-15 Summit to Focus on World Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Syed Hamid Albar said Saturday that short-term capital flow and
the havoc that it can create for the world economy will be the
focus of the G-15 summit in Jamaica early next month.
</P>
<P>
The summit from February 4 to 12 might come out with a common
stand on the need to review the world financial system and
regulate hedge funds and short-term capital flow, he said in a
briefing for the media on the summit.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad will attend the
summit as head of the delegation that includes International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz and himself, Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Malaysian delegation would explain the economic and
fiscal measures taken to overcome the economic crisis, in
particular the selective exchange controls, the loosening of the
credit squeeze and the lowering of interest.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit would also focus on the multilateral trading
system, and trade and economic cooperation among the member
states.
</P>
<P>
The group will take the occasion to consult and coordinate,
wherever possible, on positions that they would adopt at the
forthcoming Third Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade
Organization scheduled to take place from November 30 to December
3, 1999 in Seattle, the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's stand on the WTO is that the multilateral trading
system needs to be fine-tuned, taking into consideration the
inputs of the developing countries, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The summit would also review the 17 ongoing G-15 projects as
well as consider any project proposals, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is coordinating three of the projects -- bilateral
payment arrangement, centers of educational excellence and South
Investment, Trade and Technology Data Exchange Center.
</P>
<P>
The minister said G-15 had made headway in realizing one of its
main aims of spearheading trade and economic cooperation among
countries of the South.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment among the G-15 members increased by
24 percent to 61.7 billion ringgit (about 16.236 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
The G-15, found in 1990 in Malaysia, has now 16 members --
Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, India,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Mexico,
Peru and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is to be admitted as the 17th member in the Jamaica
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Willing to Meet Rebel Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that he is willing to meet leaders of the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) any time and anywhere within
the Philippine territory in order to forge a peace pact with the
rebel group.
</P>
<P>
"I am willing to meet with the MILF leaders any time and
anywhere for the sake of peace. But the meeting should be inside
the Philippines; I will not meet them abroad," Estrada said in an
interview here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada said he may meet MILF leaders to discuss peace
in the Mindanao region when he visits Mindanao late next month.
</P>
<P>
In the past three weeks, government troops and MILF forces
clashed in Southern Mindanao and over 30 people were killed from
both sides.
</P>
<P>
Despite a ceasefire agreement reached by the two sides
Wednesday night, clashes continued in the region.
</P>
<P>
But Estrada assured the public that the government remains in
control of the situation in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the police and the military in the area have
orders from him to relentlessly pursue anyone who violates the
law.
</P>
<P>
"We will exhaust all peaceful means of dealing with them
(MILF), but if they want war, we'll give them war," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government is scheduled to start peace talks early next
month with the MILF, which is fighting for an independent Islamic
state in the Southern Philippines.

The government has previously removed import duty on
agricultural inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides and reduced
duty on seeds from 25 percent to five percent.

<HEADLINE> Humanitarian Situation Remains Serious in DPRK: UN Coordinator </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua)-- David Morton, United Nations
Humanitarian Coordinator in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK), said here today that the humanitarian situation in
DPRK "still remains very serious".
</P>
<P>
Morton said this at a press briefing here today while updating
on the World Food Program (WFP) operations in the country.
</P>
<P>
WFP has been present in DPRK since November 1995 after the
DPRK government requested assistance following severe flooding
earlier that year.
</P>
<P>
An emergency operation plan which covers the period April
1998-- March 1999 requires more than 600,000 Mts of food for 6.75
million people.
</P>
<P>
According to Morton, WFP forms part of the Consolidated Appeal
for DPRK. Within the appeal, WFP makes provision for emergency
assistance for vulnerable groups. This includes children in
nurseries, kindergartens and primary schools, orphans, the
handicapped, hospitalized patients and pregnant and nursing
mothers. It also supports agricultural rehabilitation and
reconstruction through Food for Work projects.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has appealed 730,000 Mts of food for the year 1999,
and that includes cereal, pulses, vegetable oil, biscuits, sugar,
and etc. The WFP now has access to 75 percent of the country's
land area and 80 percent of its population.
</P>
<P>
In a Consensus Statement issued recently by all UN agencies
including WFP, NGOs and donor agencies operating in DPRK, they
voiced the agreement that "effective, accountable humanitarian
assistance is still required in the country", since "severe
difficulties still exist in the food, nutrition, health, water
and agricultural sectors".

<HEADLINE> Scientists: Artificial Bladder Works Well in Dogs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Fully functional
artificial bladders have worked well in dogs for nearly a year,
raising hopes for a similar treatment for humans with serious
bladder disease, said U.S. scientists.
</P>
<P>
In the February issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology, Dr.
Anthony Atala and his colleagues at Children's Hospital and
Harvard Medical School in Boston said more research is needed
before the technique could be tried in people.
</P>
<P>
To grow the bladders, the scientists took small bits of
bladder tissue from six dogs and grew the cells into artificial
bladders in the laboratory. Then they put the artificial organs
back into the animals, whose own bladders had been removed.
</P>
<P>
Within a month, the artificial bladders were performing as we
ll as natural bladders and continued to do so for at least 10
months, they said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 400 million people worldwide who suffer from
bladder disease, but suitable donors for patients who need a
transplant are always in shortage.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Threatens to Sack Striking Workers </HEADLINE>

<P>
HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The board of directors of the
Post and Telecommunications Corporation of Zimbabwe (PTC) warned
striking workers that they may be fired if they continued with
their action, the daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
PTC board chairman, Moses Mashumba, said Friday the strike was
illegal and all workers who continued with their action would be
dealt with in terms of the contract of employment and the PTC
sector's code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
PTC engineers and technicians went on strike on January 18 to
press management to increase about 200 percent salary.
</P>
<P>
The business sector has urged the PTC management and the
striking workers to resolve their 10-month salary dispute which
has disrupted telecommunication services in the country.
</P>
<P>
President of the Employers' Confederation of Zimbabwe, Lazarus
Dhlakama, Friday said the continued disruption of services was not
in the interest of either the PTC or the workers.
</P>
<P>
"The business community has actually suffered as a result of
the strike. This is unfair, especially at a time when the economy
is not performing well. The PTC management and its workers must
quickly resolve the dispute so that communication services are
back to normal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many companies also complained about the disruption of
telephone services as a result of the strike, the paper reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Swiss star Martina Hingis won
her third consecutive Australian Open on Saturday when she
brushed aside the power game of unseeded French teenager Amelie
Mauresmo to win in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the No.2 seed, clinched the match 6-2 6-3 in 67
minutes, but had to wait until her seventh match point before
sealing victory against the dogged Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion breathed a huge sigh of relief and then
tossed three racquets into the crowd in delight.
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo went into the tournament ranked 29 and her ranking is
now expected to rise to 18.
</P>
<P>
Hingis collected 679,000 Australian dollars (420,000 U.S.
dollars) for her win to add to the 141,500 Australian dollars
(87,730 U.S. dollars she won for winning the doubles title.
Mauresmo banked 339,500 Australian dollars (210,490 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 18, scored the first service break in the opening game
of the match after fighting back from 15-40 down.
</P>
<P>
Games then went with serve until the seventh when the Swiss
ran up three break points. Mauresmo saved two but succumbed on
the third when she mishit a return out over the baseline.
</P>
<P>
Hingis then quickly wrapped up the set 6-2 with an ace in 28
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Hingis again opened with a break of serve at the start of the
second set but Mauresmo responded by breaking the defending
champion to level at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
The pair then traded breaks in the fifth and sixth games, with
Hingis breaking again in the seventh and ninth games to clinch
the win.
</P>
<P>
Towards the end of the first set Hingis switched tactics and
began attacking the net, a move which paid off and for which
Mauresmo had no answers.
</P>
<P>
But, while the Frenchwoman continued to run up unforced
errors, she also hit clear winners with sharp angles and heavy
topspin to stay in the match.
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo unleashed 31 winners to Hingis' 19 but also had
double the number of unforced errors - 41 to 20.
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo seemed baffled on her rare forays into the net but
Hingis was at home, winning 83 percent of net points.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, with her eye on recapturing the No.1 spot from Lindsay
Davenport, said she wanted to continue playing this well for the
remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
Mauresmo said Hingis had played great tennis on Saturday and
she thanked the crowd for the support she had received.

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage Causes Panic in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe
(CCZ) has urged consumers not to engage in panic buying of
mealie-meal, the country's staple food, as that will only serve to
worsen the artificial shortage.
</P>
<P>
Mealie-meal has been in short supply over the past weeks
because of problems being experienced in the milling industry.
This has resulted in consumers failing to get maize-meal in most
supermarkets and other retail outlets, the daily Herald reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in Harare Friday by CCZ Executive Director
Elizabeth Nerwande said such shortages in the past had resulted in
panic buying, hoarding and exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
"The CCZ is worried about about the wrong responses that
consumers engage in when facing adverse situation and would like
to call on consumers not to panic," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
She said the situation was worsened by some local companies who
were engaged in informal trade of mealie-meal at exorbitant and
lucrative prices in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Consumers have suffered artificially created shortages in the
past, as the government and millers negotiated price increases.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the business sector to engage in responsible trade.
 The tradition of exploiting the consumer by creating artificial
shortages and imposing exorbitant prices in the informal markets
that they create, should come to an end," she said.
</P>
<P>
The CCZ believed that the issue of food security was for all
stakeholders and called on the concerned parties to put their
heads together for long-term solutions, she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
United National Party (UNP) leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has
threatened to boycott the other five provincial council elections
if they are not held on the same day, a newspaper The Island
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference on Friday, Wickremesinghe
explained that if the polls are held at different dates, the
government could use state machinery in addition to thugs from
outside to win the elections through manipulation.
</P>
<P>
The UNP together with some other political parties and
organizations have been accusing the ruling People's Alliance (PA)
of rigging and intimidation in the recent North Western Provincial
Council election, which ended with PA winning 30 seats out of a
total of 52 seats in the council.
</P>
<P>
The government postponed elections to the Western,
Sabaragamuwa, Uva, Central and North Central Provincial Councils
due in last August under emergency regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court on Wednesday held that the postponement of
those elections was a violation of the constitution and directed
the Elections Commissioner to fix the dates for these elections
within two weeks from the judgment and hold elections within three
months.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details of statement Security Council Backs Negotiated Settlement on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Friday night adopted a presidential statement, voicing
its welcome and support for a Contact Group decision to seek
negotiated political settlement of the problem in the Serbian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council hailed the decisions of the foreign
ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Russia, the United Kingdom
and the United States, which make up the Contact Group in charge
of the Balkans diplomacy, "which aim at reaching a political
settlement between the parties and establish a framework and
timetable for the that purpose".
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council demands that the parties should accept
their responsibilities and comply fully with these decisions and
requirements, as with its relevant resolutions," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, following its Friday meeting in London,
summoned warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians to attend peace talks
in France by February 6 and set a tight deadline for concluding a
deal on the future of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90
percent of the province's population of two million.
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of an unusual late night session
at weekend by the 15-member Security Council. However, neither
the Contact Group's statement or the Security Council's
presidential statement calls for any use of force against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council reiterates its full support for the
international efforts, including those of the Contact Group and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Kosovo
Verification Mission, to reduce tensions in Kosovo and facilitate
a political settlements in Kosovo and the recognition of the
legitimate rights of the Kosovo Albanians and other communities
in Kosovo," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the
escalating violence in Kosovo, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,"
the statement said. "It underlines the risk of a further
deterioration in the humanitarian situation if steps are not
taken by the parties to reduce tensions."
</P>
<P>
The Council "reiterates its concern about attacks on civilians
and underlines the need for a full and unhindered investigation
of such actions," the statement said, adding that the Council
called once again upon the parties to respect fully their
obligations under the relevant U.N. resolutions and "to cease
immediately all acts of violence and provocation".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution "reaffirms its commitment to the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia", the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The conflict broke out in Kosovo in February last year after
ethnic Albanians resorted to military force in their struggle for
independence.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Training Enterprise Managers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China is stepping up the
training of corporate managers in a bid to fuel the reform and
development of the large and medium-sized state-owned enterprise
(SOES).
</P>
<P>
"A Management Training Project initiated early last year has
progressed steadily and scored sound achievements," China Daily
quoted Zheng Silin, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
The project aims to cultivate a great number of competent,
technocratic managers who are familiar with the economic theories
and management expertise.
</P>
<P>
It also intends to experiment ways of establishing a
management training scheme that conforms to the modern enterprise
system, said sources with the commission's Training Department.
</P>
<P>
"By the end of last year, 180,000 executives from medium- and
large-sized SOEs had participated in the business administration
program, and many of them have managed to achieve better
efficiency and productivity in the enterprises with the know-how
they acquired.
</P>
<P>
About 49 percent of the country's large- and medium-sized SOEs
are losing money, according to sources in the commission.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, which ends next year, all the managers
should get training for at least three months on theories on
socialist economy, marketing, human resources and international
trade.
</P>
<P>
Enterprise officials in some SOEs will have to get a permit to
be employed, said the commission officials.
</P>
<P>
This year the commission will set up another 30 key training
centers for large SOEs, and tighten supervision and management on
the training of enterprise officials.
</P>
<P>
The commission has so far authorized 241 training centers for
the project, most of them universities and business management
institutes.

<HEADLINE> More Attention to be Paid to Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official
reiterated here that more attention should be paid to the
protection of the natural environment in China instead of
constructing man-made ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
"People's idea of building up ecosystems needs to be changed,"
Yang Chaofei, from the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA), was cited by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Yang, director of SEPA's Nature Conservation
Department, ecosystems in China are deteriorating at an alarming
rate. Two million hectares of forests are being destroyed
annually while 10 million hectares of cultivated land suffer from
varying degrees of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Some local governments still occupy farmland or leave them
idle amid the boom to open up development projects. In 1997,
abandoned land reached 116,500 hectares, 53.9 percent of which
were farmland.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the country's protection efforts are still
lagging far behind the pace of destruction.
</P>
<P>
Some people think the state should implement man-made
ecological projects to turn the situation around, Yang said, but
man-made forests can never compete with natural ones.
</P>
<P>
Once the rivers or lakes are polluted, it is very hard for
people to restore the previously pristine environment, Yang
warned.

<HEADLINE> China's Large Retailers Report Growth Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Large department stores in
China suffered heavily from a weak consumer demand last year,
with more than half of them witnessing negative sales growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from China National Commercial Information Center
(CNCIC) show that 61.7 percent of the country's 238 large
shopping malls saw a decline in sales growth while 71 stores were
in deficit totaling 457 million yuan, an increase of 17.4 percent
from 1997.
</P>
<P>
The 238 retailers' profits hit a total of 2.61 billion yuan
last year, down 15.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The consumer market confronted great challenges last year,
when the financial turmoil abroad and domestic radical reforms
directly changed consumer behaviors," Wang Yao, general engineer
with CNCIC, was quoted by today's China Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
"People became cautious about buying something when they must
save money in preparation for the radical reforms of the housing
system, medical service and social welfare programs," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China's retail sector witnessed a 9.6 percent growth in sales
volume last year, a growth that for many years have been well
into the double-digits.
</P>
<P>
The national retail price index plunged 2.6 percent from 1997
while the consumer price index was down 0.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Tea Crop Hits Record High in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's tea production
reached a record high of 280 million kilos last year, up by 3.2
million kilos or 1.15 percent over that of 1997, according to Sri
Lankan Tea Board (SLTB).
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth consecutive year of all-time high tea
production since 1994, an SLTB official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A significant feature of tea production last year was the
continued growth of the Low Grown Tea which had risen from 136
million kilos in 1997 to 150.3 million kilos in 1998 and accounts
for 53.6 percent of the total tea production in the country, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the High Grown Tea production declined from 83.7
million kilos in 1997 to 77.4 million kilos last year, the
official said, adding that the Medium Grown Tea also dropped from
57.1 million kilos to 52.3 million kilos.
</P>
<P>
Tea is one of Sri Lanka's main export items and the source of
25 percent of its export earnings. It is estimated that the tea
crop in 1999 will reach 296 million kilos, up by 16 million kilos
or 5.7 percent over last year, the official added.

<HEADLINE> NBA No. 1 Pick Olowokandi Signs with Clippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Just days after being let
out of his contract in the Italian League, 1998 No. 1 draft
choice Michael Olowokandi has signed with the Los Angeles
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
As the first pick in the draft, Olowokandi today signed a
three-year, $8.44 million contract, the richest among 1999
rookies under the NBA's new collective bargaining agreement. The
deal also includes a club option for a fourth season.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi did not impress his first employer, Kinder Bologna,
and was released from his contract Monday, more than two weeks
prematurely. He arrived in Los Angeles today, passed his physical
and signed with the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi will participate in Saturday's shootaround before
meeting the media in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Just two days before NBA players and owners agreed to a labor
settlement January 7, Olowokandi signed a deal with Kinder that
reportedly would have paid him at least $1 million and as much as
$3 million if he spent the entire season in Italy.
</P>
<P>
According to European scouts, the poorly conditioned
Olowokandi was not met with rave reviews, playing ineffectively
from the start. In an 84-67 victory over Verona, the Pacific
University product was scoreless with two rebounds and four fouls
in five minutes off the bench.
</P>
<P>
The second straight center selected first overall, Olowokandi
has only been playing basketball since 1993. He was born in
Nigeria and raised in England, where he participated in
volleyball, soccer and track and field.
</P>
<P>
Olowokandi averaged 22.2 points and 11.2 rebounds during his
senior season at Pacific, placing 10th in the nation in scoring
and fifth in rebounds. He also blocked 92 shots and finished as
the school's all-time leader with 157.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Retired NBA star Michael
Jordan launched "Jordan Fundamentals" program for educators in
public secondary schools that serve disadvantaged students at a
news conference today at a school in southeast Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
After two weeks of retirement, Jordan announced he would
donate a $5 million grant program to aid teachers.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to focus on giving kids an opportunity to excel and
to achieve their dreams," Jordan said. "My own desire and ability
to succeed are the result of many blessings, none greater than
those of the excellent role models I had.
</P>
<P>
"My father, Dean Smith, Phil Jackson and many of my teachers
were just a few of the many role models who taught me that my
achievements could never exceed my expectations of myself. I hope
that these grants empower more teachers to do what they do best."
</P>
<P>
The "Jordan Fundamentals" grants will recognize and support
lesson plans written by teachers that demonstrate instructional
creativity and exemplify high learning expectations for
underserved students.
</P>
<P>
In its first year, the program will make 400 awards of $2,500
each available to teachers. The first round of grants will be
awarded in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, $1 million a year of the next five years from
the Nike sporting goods Jordan Brand will be sent to teachers in
poor communities.
</P>
<P>
Jordan said he is going to strive to be the best possible role
model to young people. "It's a heavy responsibility, but it was
bestowed upon me."

<P>
LA PAZ, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A Bolivian village which
suffered a serious earthquake last year was shaken again Friday
by a quake measuring four on the Richter Scale.
</P>
<P>
Aiquile, in the province of Cochabamba, was severely damaged
and at least 85 people died in an earthquake measuring 6.5
degrees on the Richter Scale last May.
</P>
<P>
The latest quake, which hit the village at 1.56 p.m. (17.76
GMT) Friday, is reported to have caused no material damage.
</P>
<P>
But first reports from the area said the quake caused panic
among the population, who fled their houses and returned to the
tents where they had lived for months following the last
quake.
</P>
<P>
Seismologist Angel Vega, of the San Calixto Observatory, said
the tremor occurred after two months of seismic inactivity in
Aiquile, 400 miles southeast of the Bolivian capital, La Paz.
</P>
<P>
Vega dismissed any connection between the tremor and Monday's
quake in Colombia that caused at least 940 deaths, because the
two countries are more than 4,000 kilometers apart.

<HEADLINE> Yayuk Basuki to Skip Federation Cup due to Pregnancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's tennis queen
Yayuk Basuki has decided not to play in next month's Federation
Cup Zone Asia Oceania competition due to pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I'm three weeks pregnant", Yayuk, who married coach
Suharyadi in 1994, told reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the 28-year-old player, who realized her dream of winning
the singles gold medal at the Asian Games in Bangkok last
December, will turn up for the Federation Cup tournament, also in
Bangkok, as a nonplaying captain.
</P>
<P>
Last month the Indonesian Tennis Association named her team
captain and she was expected to play in the doubles match.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk admitted that only after returning from the Australian
Open now still underway in Melbourne did she notice that she was
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
Playing her last tournament as a professional, Yayuk was
knocked out in the opening round in the singles, but advanced to
the quarterfinals in the doubles with her French partner Amelie
Mauresmo.
</P>
<P>
The new tandem lost to eventual runner-ups Lindsay Davenport
and Natasha Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia will meet China, Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, India,
South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand and Uzbekstan in the
tournament scheduled to run from February 22 to February 27. Only
the winner advances to the Federation Cup World Group qualifying
round.
</P>
<P>
Yayuk expressed her hope that her juniors would perform their
best to avoid relegation.
</P>
<P>
"Although we finished sixth last year, we can't say that this
year we'll finish fifth or fourth. It depends on the draw," she
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Government Warned of Ice Flows In Yellow River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Local governments along the
lower reaches of the Yellow River, China's second longest, have
been urged to prepare for the fight against possible ice flow
damages.
</P>
<P>
The river has frozen this winter along a stretch of 750
kilometers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Shanxi,
Shaanxi and Shandong provinces, according to a report released
Friday by the Beijing-based State Flood-Control and Drought
Prevention Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
China Daily also reported that although the river's
freezing-up is not unusual, it has come three weeks later than
normal this winter since temperatures in some areas along the
Yellow River have been higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted that the fight to prevent the ice from
blocking the river is more difficult than previous years.
</P>
<P>
Friday, a 20-kilometer-long section of ice in the river, in
Shandong Province, started to thaw, one official from the
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
The number of damage caused by ice flows is expected to grow,
following the earlier thawing of the Yellow River since the
spring may begin earlier this year than in normal years, the
official warned.
</P>
<P>
When the Yellow River is frozen, which usually lasts until
early spring, water will start to accumulate upstream as ice fl
ows block its course downwards, leading to higher water levels in
parts of the river and thereby make the fight against the ice
flows more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Ice run is a seasonal problem for provinces and regions along
the lower reaches of the Yellow River as winter turns to spring,
and ice-jamming used to threaten the safety of embankments along
some narrow and winding sections of the river in early spring,
according to Liu Yuzhong, an official from the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China has
mobilized 52,000 people to form emergency squads, and supplies of
materials and equipment are also available for possible rescue
operations.

<HEADLINE> Denmark's Only Rembrandt Painting Stolen in Broad Daylight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The only Rembrandt painting
in Denmark was stolen on Friday afternoon during a raid on a
private gallery north of Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
Two men who entered the Nivaagaard Kunstsamling gallery as
visitors overpowered a guard and made off with Rembrandt's
"Portrait of a Lady", painted in 1632, and another work, painted
during the Italian Renaissance by an unidentified member of the
Bellini family, called "Portrait of a Young Man".
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the Rembrandt, bearing the painter's
autograph, is the only one in the country and worth at least 15
million U.S. dollars. The other painting, dating from 1500, could
fetch a six-figure price on the market.
</P>
<P>
However, they said as the paintings would be too well-known to
sell, the thieves might intend to seek a huge ransom.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Basket Price Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan oil basket
price increased 20 cents per barrel in the past week, moving from
8.67 U.S. dollars to 8.87 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The average of the Venezuelan crude basket went up to 8.97
dollars per barrel in January, a 96 cent increase over last
December, according to the Energy and Mines Ministry's
preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan basket of crude and byproducts closed at 10.63
dollars per barrel at the end of 1998, 31.4 percent down from the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The most realistic calculation for the average price of the
Venezuelan crude exports is nine dollars per barrel in the
calculations of the 1999 national budget.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have dived since 1997 because of the Asian economic
crisis erupted and the oversupply of crude oil in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
The oil price drop last year meant a 36 percent loss for the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) producers.
And some OPEC countries do not want this situation to be repeated
this year and want to advance the date for the organization's
conference to March.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to propose that independent and OPEC producers
are to cut crude output by 3.1 million barrels a day in 1999.

In a statement issued Friday, Foreign Minister Anna Lindh
urged the combatants in the Yugoslav province to respect the
existing ceasefire and follow the Contact Group's latest demand
to start talks on a political solution to the conflict, which she
described as "unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
In London, the Contact Group set a February 6 deadline for the

imposed a time frame of one week from that date to reach an ac
cord, although it could be extended for up to seven more days if
the talks made progress.

Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Ratko Markovic emphasized to the
European Union Thursday that any negotiations on Kosovo should
take place within Serbia or Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to EU special envoy to Kosovo Wolfgang
Pietritsch, who reiterated the EU's proposal that peace
negotiations be held outside Yugoslavia to seek a political
solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The dialogue began in Pristina and that is where it should
continue," Markovic was quoted as saying.
</P>

 The Swedish foreign minister said that her country could
send peacekeeping troops to Kosovo if both sides in Kosovo agree
or at the call of the United Nations or the Organization for

<HEADLINE> Rodman May Reunite with Daly in Orlando </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Orlando Magic expressed
some interest with Dennis Rodman and believes he is one of the
very talented free agents.
</P>
<P>
Today's editions of the Orlando Sentinel are reporting that
the Magic coach Chuck Daly has had discussions with Rodman, who
has led the NBA in rebounding and bizarre behavior for the last
seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
A move to Orlando would reunite Rodman with Daly, his former
coach with the Detroit Pistons "Bad Boys," who won NBA titles in
1989 and 1990. Daly also has strong input on personnel decision.
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Dennis about a week ago, but in general terms,"
Daly told the newspaper. "We have talked about it. I'm definitely
interested."
</P>
<P>
Daly met Tuesday with Magic president Bob Vander Weide and
general manager John Gabriel and discussed whether to pursue
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
Rodman retired and unretired in a span of 24 hours last week.
On Friday's "Tonight Show," he said he would like to continue his
career in a warm-weather city, preferably Miami or Orlando.
</P>
<P>
Neither team was considered a good fit for Rodman, who has
been everything from a cross-dresser to a wrestler to host of his
own TV show in conjunction with his basketball career.
</P>
<P>
Both the Heat and Magic are leveraged against the salary cap,
likely limiting how much the 37-year-old Rodman could be paid to
an exception of no more than $1.75 million. He made $9 million as
a member of the Chicago Bulls last season, helping them to their
third straight NBA title and sixth in eight years.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know where we are with money and such," Daly said.
"That's John's department. But we'll see where it goes. We've
extensive talks about it. He indicated his interest to us. How
much, I don't know."
</P>
<P>
The Magic already have a surplus of power forwards, including
Bo Outlaw, Derek Strong and Horace Grant, a former Bull who
battled Rodman during the Chicago-Detroit playoff showdowns of
the late 1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Under Daly in Detroit, Rodman became one of the best sixth men
in the NBA, changing games with his defense, rebounding and
ability to run the floor. He was named Defensive Player of the
Year in 1991 and 1992 and won the first of his consecutive
rebounding titles in 1992.
</P>
<P>
After Daly resigned in 1992, Rodman began missing practices
and was found one night shooting baskets in a gym by himself at 3
a.m.-- with a loaded shotgun in his car in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
The Pistons traded Rodman to the San Antonio Spurs in 1993 and
he was given latitude by coach John Lucas. Although he won two
more rebounding titles, Rodman derailed playoff pushes with a
suspension in 1994 and refusing to join a team huddle during a
time-out in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Rodman joined the Bulls in 1995-96 season, drawing suspensions
of six games for head-butting a referee and 11 games for kicking
a cameraman while winning three more rebounding crowns.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997 Finals, he referred to people of Utah as
"Mormons" and was fined $50,000, the largest independent fine in
league history. In the 1998 Finals, he missed a practice and was
fined by the league and the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Rodman was a 1986 second-round pick of the Pistons out of
Southeastern Oklahoma. He has played for a team that has won less
than 50 games just once in 12 years and has career averages of
7.5 points and 13.2 rebounds in 876 games.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Oil Company to Increase Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The debt aims at covering the expenditures of the firm whose
finances have been eroded by the government's growing need to
increase its tax revenues, according to Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
The state oil company shareholders assembly, held in December
1998, approved a new debt of one billion dollars for this year,
of which 800 million dollars will be used to pay the existing
debt.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that the necessity of debt was the result of a
drop in the income for the oil industry due to the oil price s
lump in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez was appointed Mines and Energy Minister last
Thursday by President-elect Hugo Chavez to replace Erwin Arrieta.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela lost some seven billion dollars in oil revenues in
1998 when international crude prices dropped.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan crude basket closed 1998 with an average
quotation of 10.83 dollars per barrel, 5.69 dollars lower than
the 1997 average.

<HEADLINE> Pillage Continues in Colombian Quake City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Andres Pastrana warned Friday that looter would be arrested and
prosecuted as more stores were ransacked in the earthquake-hit
city of Armenia.
</P>
<P>
Orlando Mejia Duque, commander of the army reserve in the
town, said a Red Cross depot, a warehouse and a market place were
plundered and two people were injured when police clashed with
the mob.
</P>
<P>
The lack of food after Monday's quake unleashed a crimewave in
Armenia's self-service stores as people searched for food.
</P>
<P>
Armenia and Calarca, the two cities most affected by the
quake, were placed under strict military control after a curfew
was decreed Thursday by President Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana condemned the looting, saying that those responsible
were not disaster victims and would be arrested and prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking for the solidarity of the community to end this
violence. We are going to arrest these people," Pastrana said.

<HEADLINE> McManaman Set for Real Madrid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool and England
midfielder Steve McManaman agreed to join European Cup holders
Real Madrid on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the player's agents,
McManaman would sign a five-year contract with Real to start on
July 1, the day after his current contract with the English
premier league club expires.
</P>
<P>
McManaman, 26, will be a free agent under the Bosman ruling so
Liverpool will receive no transfer fee or compensation. He still
faces a medical with the Spanish club.
</P>
<P>
"I am extremely sad to be leaving Liverpool," he said.
"However the opportunity to be playing football for Real Madrid,
the current European and world champions, is too good to turn
down and it helps me further my ambition to test myself in
another top European League."
</P>
<P>
The deal was sealed at a meeting on Friday between McManaman's
representatives and Real Madrid officials in the Spanish capital.
</P>
<P>
McManaman made his debut for Liverpool in 1990 and soon became
a favorite with the Kop for his dribbling ability and weaving
runs in the penalty box.
</P>
<P>
Part of England's 1998 World Cup squad, he played just 18
minutes against Colombia before suffering an Achilles tendon
injury which has troubled him since. He has managed just 40
minutes of first team football since November 7.
</P>
<P>
The injury has meant he has played only 12 games all season
and scored just one goal.
</P>
<P>
He played in a reserve team match in midweek but was again
troubled by his ankle. His first team return was again put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
McManaman has played more than 350 times for Liverpool and has
won more than 20 England caps.
</P>
<P>
The signing will be a major coup for Real. Spanish rivals
Barcelona and Italian club Juventus have both been linked with
the player.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid chairman Lorenzo Sanz is known to be frustrated by
his team's inconsistent performances this season.
</P>
<P>
They are sixth in the Spanish championship, three points
behind leaders Barcelona, and lost 4-0 at Deportivo Coruna on
Sunday, their worst result of the season.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Almost 400 tons of
aid have been flown from Bogota to the western zone of Colombia,
devastated Monday by a powerful earthquake, to help the 250,000
victims, official sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seism caused almost 1,000 deaths and injured 4,000, and
has been followed by disturbances and pillage caused by the
victims who complain of hunger and thirst and the lack of the
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The 400 tons of aid, including 150 tons of food, 100 tons of
clothes, 35 tons of medicines, 50 tons of blankets and 16 tons of
mattresses, have been flown from the Colombian capital to the
most affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Other articles sent were coffins, pillows, plastic bags,
tents, stoves, lamps, lanterns, hammers, pots, diapers, batteries
, power plants and bed sheets, among other things.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government said that the victims need 150 tons
of food a day.
</P>
<P>
The 6-magnitude quake devastated many communities in the
Quindio, Rirasalda, Valle, and Tolima departments, in the main cof
fee producing zone of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
will distribute during 15 days 5,000 rations of food a day.

<HEADLINE> Japan Aims at Most Golds for Alpine Skiing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan pins high
hope for grabbing most of the medals in the Alpine skiing
competition, the Japanese chief of delegation Eisuke Sho said
before the opening ceremony of the Kangwon Asian Winter Games on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Japan has high expectations for medals in all seven sports
during the week-long Games starting this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"But we have especially high hopes for Alpine skiing and speed
skating, with a good chance for golds in the Alpine events," Sho
said in an interview with '99 Kangwon Winter Asiad.
</P>
<P>
How the Japanese do also depends greatly on their competitors,
Sho added. "As the last three Asian games were basically a
three-way race between Japan, China and South Korea, I expect the
latter two countries will be our biggest rivals," Sho said.
</P>
<P>
But he has not forgotten that Kazakhstan, who collected a
total
of 31 medals including 14 golds at the last Games in Harbin. "The
country has come in strong on the preliminary rounds, also may
give Japan a tough contest," Sho added.
</P>
<P>
China, winner at the Third Winter Asiad at home in Harbin with
37 medals including 15 golds, has regarded Japan and Kazakhstan
their biggest rivals during the Games held in the three venues of
Yongpyong, Kangnung and Chunchon.
</P>
<P>
"We will try our best for third place at the medal tally,"
said Xiao Tian, chef de mission of the Chinese delegation. "At
last Games in Harbin both Japan and Kazakhstan didn't send their
best athletes, so we placed first on the medal table. But this
time it's impossible for us to repeat that."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation is made up of 101 athletes and 61
officials has only one goal to win more medals than the last
Games, Sho said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 Harbin Games Japan won eight golds, 14 silvers and 10
bronzes, compared to South Korea's eight golds, 10 silvers and
eight bronzes.
</P>
<P>
"But the number of participating delegations has grown and
we'll have to see how these games go," Sho said.
</P>
<P>
Japan also miss their all five Olympic stars who won five gold
medals including the events of the speed skating, short track
speedskating, jumping skiiing.
</P>
<P>
"One of the toughest events we expected is the speed skating.
There are many excellent skaters competing," Sho predicted.

<HEADLINE> Ford Increases China Exposure Through Volvo Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- United States automotive giant
Ford will accelerate the process of building a major presence in
China after taking over the sedan car division of Sweden's AB
Volvo.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Ford representative office in Beijing said
that Volvo's high prestige and networks of distribution and
service in China will perfectly complement Ford's local operation.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement on the 6.45-billion-U.S.-dollar takeover on
Thursday, Ford said that it will take ownership of all of Volvo
Cars facilities around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong-based Swire Group, the sole agent
for Volvo sedan cars in China, Volvo sold near 700 cars in the
country last year, and held a grand ceremony to launch the luxury
S80 sedan car in Beijing last December. Volvo Cars has 19 service
centers around China.
</P>
<P>
"The merger is a good thing for both Ford and our company,"
said Gao Mengxiong of Swire Group's Beijing office.
</P>
<P>
"We may sell Ford autos as well in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Swire Group has offices in six Chinese cities and a
distribution network consisting of scores of designated agents
all over China.
</P>
<P>
Ford and Volvo were among the first group of Western
automotive companies to enter China in the 1980s. However, Volvo
seemed to be quicker than Ford in expanding its presence in the
country, and has set up several wholly owned and joint venture
companies in China, manufacturing buses, trucks and engines.
</P>
<P>
However, Ford lagged behind its arch rival General Motors and
other international competitors such as Volkswagen in
establishing automobile assembly lines in China. It launched the
transit commercial van at the end of 1997 by buying 30 percent of
the shares of the Jiangling Company in east China's Jiangxi
Province. Ford established only five auto-part joint ventures in
China during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
"We are catching up very quickly," said Xu Guozhen of the Ford
Beijing office.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that Ford is seeking to buy its way into the
Aeolux Automotive Company in central China's Hubei Province, the
second largest automotive company in the country.
</P>
<P>
Though luxury cars such as Jaguar and Volvo S80 have a very
limited market in China, the lower-end auto market is huge. In
1998, China sold ten million motor bikes and 2.6 million farm
vehicles, diesel fueled tricycles or mini-trucks which are
restricted from city use. China also produced and sold 1.5
million automobiles last year.
</P>
<P>
Dong Yang, a State Administration of Machinery Industry
official in charge of the automotive industry, said that China is
already a market for 14 million autos a year, as large as the
United States and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Real Plunges Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's currency, the real,
plummeted further in value Friday, hitting 2.20 to the dollar,
below the psychologically important level of two to one U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
This rate represents a devaluation of almost 40 percent
compared to one dollar for 1.59 reals on January 18, when the
free fluctuation exchange policy was officially applied.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso blamed
"excessive speculation", but added that devaluation was natural
in the initial stages of the real's flotation.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso expressed the confidence that the exchange rate would
return to a normal level.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan said that the strong
rise of the dollar against the real Friday in the market "had no
basis in the foundations of the economy".
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign reserves have fallen to less than 27
billion dollars from 75 billion dollars in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed head of the Central Bank Francisco Lopes
said Friday the government would announce the level of its
reserves daily beginning Monday.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian President Rejects Moratorium Rumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso on Friday was twice forced to quell widespread
panic by denying reports that his government might declare a
moratorium on foreign debt payments or would freeze bank savings.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to declare a moratorium. We will not touch
the Brazilian people's savings. We will not do anything that will
leave Brazilians without money in their bank accounts, and
neither will announce next Monday a new economic program,"
Cardoso said during a visit to Sao Paulo.
</P>
<P>
Although the president and Finance Minister Pedro Malan denied
the rumors which began in the early hours of Friday, banks,
exchange houses, and news agency telephones were jammed in the
widespread panic.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso had to refute for the second time in one day, in this
case during a visit to the capital of the Sao Paulo state,
alarming word-of-mouth rumors that the government was going to
freeze savings, as happened in 1990 under the Fernando Collor de
Melo administration.
</P>
<P>
The insistence and intensity of the rumors during the day were
such that they generated an enormous pressure on the U.S. dollar
quotation, which closed Friday's session at 2.09 reals buy and
2.11 sell, breaking thus the psychological two-real barrier.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso claimed the rumors were propagated by speculators who
want to cause confusion in the country's economy, but his
government was facing the crisis "with firmness and decision".
</P>
<P>
"There is a crisis, but we are facing it adequately and we
cannot allow fear to overwhelm us," said Cardoso.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Coach Has "Winning Secret" in Short Track </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YONGPYONG, South Korea, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Short track
speed skaters from South Korea have a "secret" that could help
them outperform their opponents at the Kangwon Asian Winter
Games, which is opening Saturday afternoon, coach Chun Myung-kyu
said.
</P>
<P>
"I am worried about the injuries and illness our athletes have
sustained," Chun, who has long been noted for "manufacturing"
gold medals for South Korea short track skaters.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, there wasn't enough time to train for the
competition. We had only 50 days of training. In addition, rules
have become strict on 'kicking out' at the finish line," Chun
said. "I can say we have a secret that will help our skaters grab
gold medals at the competition."
</P>
<P>
Chun refused to elaborate on the "winning secret" he had in
mind, only adding that Korean athletes will reveal the secret on
the ice.
</P>
<P>
South Korean star Kim Dong-Sung, who won the gold medal in the
men's 1,000 meter race at the Nagano Olympics last February, has

<P>
However, rising star Lee Seung-Jae and Choi-Min-Kyung, winner
of the women's 3,000 meters at the 1998 and 1999 World Cup, as
well as Lee Jun-Hwan were affected by food poisoning three day's
ago.

<P>
Short track skaters of South Korea won three gold medals,
including Kim Dong-Sung's 1,000 meter victory through the use of
the "kicking-out technique at the finish line", which surprised
China's Li Jiajun.
</P>
<P>
Under new international rule, deliberately kicking out a skate
or throwing one's body across the finish line, thereby causing
danger to others, could be punished for disqualification.
</P>
<P>
Experts speculate that the South Korean team might have
bolstered their physical strength and mental tenacity rather than
their techniques, in hopes of dominating short track speed
skating events.
</P>
<P>
Many of skaters of South Korea lost 3-4 kgs by undertaking
intensive weight training for the Winter Asiad, according to
reports.
</P>
<P>
China, who aims at taking more golds than the host, will be
South Korea's main rivals during the two day's short track
speedskating competition, which is scheduled on Sunday and Monday
with ten gold medals on offer.

LONDON -- There may be no specific Gulf War Syndrome, despite
the fact that many veterans of the 1991 war have developed
illnesses, according to a report from UK's Ministry of Defense.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from the Ministry's Medical Assessment Program
assessed 1,000 Gulf War veterans who sought medical treatment
between October 1993 and February 1997.
</P>
<P>
Reporting Friday in the British Medical Journal, the doctors
said that their findings confirm other recent work that suggests
no single physical or psychological cause is responsible for the
illnesses seen in some Gulf War veterans. (UK-Gulf war syndrome)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton called Indian Prime

disappointment over strained relations between the two countries
because of the nuclear issue, the White House said.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Senate delivered subpoenas Friday for
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and two of President
Bill Clinton's advisers, summoning them for private, videotaped
testimony beginning February 1 in the impeachment trial against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The deposition testimony commanded by the subpoenas could go a
long way to determine whether any of the three will be called
before the Senate, whether additional witnesses may be necessary
and -- ultimately -- whether the trial can be finished by the
February 12 date cited by both political parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The saga over Juninho's
proposed transfer to Aston Villa has taken yet another twist.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian maestro, who made a huge impact in the
Premiership with Middlesbrough, was expected to be returning to
the Premiership with a 10 million pounds move to Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
But the deal, which has been subject to intense speculation
over the past fortnight, again looks in jeopardy following the
latest developments at Juninho's Spanish club Atletico Madrid.
</P>
<P>
Atletico coach Arrigo Sacchi, who seemed ready to off-load a
player who has been out of favour this season, insisted:
"Juninho's going nowhere. He is too important to Atletico Madrid."
</P>
<P>
Juninho met Villa chairman Doug Ellis and manager John Gregory
earlier in the week, before returning to Spain to discuss his
future with Atletico.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting, in which Gregory is understood to have
offered Juninho a five-year contract worth 1.5 million a year,
the move appeared certain to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
But Sacchi's comments are bound to disappoint Villa - along
with Middlesbrough, who were also in the running for the
pint-sized midfielder.

MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- Weighed down by the contraction in the agriculture and
industry sectors, the Philippine economy, as measured by the gross
national product grew by a measly 0.1 percent, far below the 1.5
to 3.5 percent range official target.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> FIFA Issues Guidelines for 2006 World Cup Bidders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- FIFA on Friday issued
guidelines to the eight countries bidding for the 2006 World Cup
-- with a limit of 100 U.S. dollars on gifts, but no restriction
on foreign travel.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, world soccer's governing body, has urged all eight
bidders to show restraint in their campaigns in the 14 months
leading up to the vote being taken by the executive committee in
March 2000.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations were drafted last May well before the
IOC's problems snowballed and were always due to be sent out at
the end of January.
</P>
<P>
FIFA is making a plea to the bidding nations, which, if
heeded, would stop any repeat of the Olympic debacle.
</P>
<P>
"These recommendations are to save unnecessary work, effort
and expense -- and to protect the good image of the FIFA World
Cup," it says.
</P>
<P>
A five-page document states that gifts should be limited in
value to 100 U.S. dollars, adding: "Interested national
associations as well as third parties or agents acting for them
... are strongly discouraged from giving FIFA members -- as well
as their blood relations, relatives by marriage, guests or
companions -- any gifts, favors or direct or indirect benefits
other than souvenirs or small presents to a total value which
should not exceed 100 U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
FIFA has not banned overseas visits to boost a country's
campaign, but has urged that such trips should be tied in with
general footballing matters, for example, to attend a match or
tournament.
</P>
<P>
If a team is visiting a country specifically to lobby for a
FIFA member's vote, then FIFA wants to know about the trip in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Another recommendation urges that if a bidding country does
attend a recognized FIFA tournament like the World Under-17 or
Under-20 championship, its party stays in a separate hotel from
the official FIFA hotel and does not put up any display stand.
</P>
<P>
FIFA also spells out its requirements on security,
telecommunications stadiums and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The eight countries competing for the right to stage the
finals are Brazil, Egypt, England, Germany, Ghana, Morocco,
Nigeria and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Korda Escapes Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Czech tennis players Petr Korda
escaped suspension over his positive drugs test after he won a
court ruling against the International Tennis Federation at
London's High Court on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled that the ITF was not entitled to appeal
against its own decision not to ban Korda after he tested
positive for steroids at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
The ITF said it may appeal against the decision, which means
the federation cannot take Korda to the Court of Sports
Arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Debbie Jeavons from the International Tennis Federation: "We
feel our decision has been misapplied."
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Australian Open champion tested positive for the
steroid nandrolene at last year's Wimbledon championships.
</P>
<P>
Last month, an independent appeal committee appointed by the
ITF said the world No 21 was guilty of a doping offence, but
decided he should not be banned.
</P>
<P>
The panel cited "exceptional circumstances" because the
31-year-old did not know how the banned drug got into his system.
</P>
<P>
Leading players and sports organizations were dismayed by the
ruling which the ITF wanted to reverse by appealing to the Court
of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The federation's own rules suggest a one-year ban for using
steroids.
</P>
<P>
Korda's lawyer, Charles Flint, said the ITF, under its own
anti-doping program, had no right in law to appeal against the
decision, which was "final and binding" on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Flint said the ITF's own anti-doping program "is designed to
provide for speedy and final determination of disputes as to
allegations of doping before an independent expert committee."
</P>
<P>
The code had worked exactly as it was supposed to do, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ITF claimed that the decision was only final if there was
no appeal.
</P>
<P>
The federation said it had an "unfettered right" to reopen and
re-argue any decision at a full re-hearing in Lausanne, as did
any player.

<HEADLINE> Solar Expert: Tibetan Sun Fairy Sweeps Away Superstitions (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Solar heating has become a big
hit amongst Tibetans with many residents even using the method to
cook or boil water and today tourists visiting this exotic
autonomous region of China are amazed at the range of such
products available.
</P>
<P>
They are often, though, spun a yard by the locals who tell
them they are precious gifts from the Sun Fairy.
</P>
<P>
But in fact there is an element of truth in this for they are
referring to Zhang Jie, a 46-year-old solar energy expert who has
helped rid the local people of their superstitions about using
the sun for heat.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, the director of the region's solar energy research
institute, explained that it was very difficult to sell
solar-energy products in Tibet even in the 1980s because t
raditionally Tibetans worshipped the sun and believed
passionately that it could never be harnessed and subservient to
humans.
</P>
<P>
Now, how times have changed. For example, Alhii, a young lama
of the Zhebung Temple in the western suburbs of Lhasa, regularly
uses solar heating in his kitchen. "It is safe and clean," he
exhorts, praising its convenience. Even his older neighbors have
been converted to the wonders of solar heating.

SANTIAGO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- 11 passengers were killed and
16 injured in a road accident occurred Friday in Kilometer 11 of
Highway 22 near the San Carlos section of the city of Chillan,

</P>
<P>
The suburban bus of the Caro firm that ran the San Fabian-San
Carlos route collided with a tree, and the bus body split.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred in a section of the road that has many

<P>
Zhang and her fellow researchers made considerable efforts to
demonstrate the advantages of solar products and gradually won
over the local people.
</P>
<P>
To her surprise, though the first group of people to switch to
solar cookers were actually the lamas in Tibetan temples, who
were traditionally very conservative in their outlook. But once
they found that their suspicions about the dangers of fire were
unfounded they were quick converts too.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, in order to make life easier for the
Tibetan people, Zhang's institute has developed a lot of useful
and practical products based on harnessing the sun's heat,
including energy systems, solar power stations, photoelectricity
water pumps, solar water heaters, cookers and greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is estimated that there are more than 80,000 solar
cookers in use in Tibet and some 80,000 square-meters used for
water heating based on solar energy, a 1,000-kilowatt
photoelectricity instrument unit and more than one million-square
meters of greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
"Tibet has vast renewable energy sources but the development
of equipment and modern techniques is still rather backward,"
Zhang added, explaining that farmers and herdsmen in the region
still use wood, dry grass, peat and manure as fuel.
</P>
<P>
As a result, according to Zhang, this has had a severe impact
on biological resources and the ecological environment. Now she
is urging more people to take full advantage of the hugely
efficient and vast energy resources provided by the sun, wind and
water.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Delivers Subpoenas for Witnesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate delivered
subpoenas Friday for former White House intern Monica Lewinsky and
two of President Bill Clinton's advisers, summoning them for
private, videotaped testimony beginning February 1 in the
impeachment trial against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The deposition testimony commanded by the subpoenas could go a
long way to determine whether any of the three will be called
before the Senate, whether additional witnesses may be necessary
and -- ultimately -- whether the trial can be finished by the
February 12 date cited by both political parties.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky, whose relationship with the president led to the
perjury and obstruction of justice charges, will be questioned
next Monday at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, according to her
spokeswoman. The former intern was interviewed there last Sunday
by three of the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Senators will have a chance to review videotapes of the
testimony before reconvening the trial next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If any significant, new information is developed, or if the
demeanor of the witnesses becomes an issue, the chance of live
testimony would increase. It would take only a majority vote to
bring any of the three to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
The barrier is higher, however, for additional witnesses.
Democratic leader Tom Daschle would have to agree with Majority
Leader Trent Lott that new witnesses were necessary, giving the
minority Democrats veto power in this area.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Senate's Republican and Democratic leaders
each chose three senators to referee the questioning by House
prosecutors and White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, spokesman Joe Lockhart complained anew
about the arrangements for the final stages of the trial --
especially the uncertainty. He accused the Republican-run Senate
of "making up the rules literally on the back of an envelope....
That raises some issues about whether that's fair to all sides."
</P>
<P>
"There is an attempt here by the Republican majority to play
out this process in a way that can inflict maximum political
damage on the president," he said, suggesting there could be "an
endless proceeding of new witnesses, new evidence."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, many senators headed back to their states where they
could expect a firsthand taste of sentiment about a trial that
most Americans -- if polls can be believed -- want to see ended.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
He is the first president in U.S. to be subjected to a trial
since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one vote in
1868. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to convict
Clinton and remove him from office, which most still consider to
be unlikely.

<P>
NEW YORK, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The better-than-expected U.S.
economic report pushed stocks higher on Wall Street Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was

2,505.89, surpassing the record closing high of 2,477.34 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nasdaq fell on profit taking during the early trading but
investors refocused on the positive economic report and looked for
technology stocks. The index is up more than 13 percent this year,
luring investors in the profit taking after the open of trading
this morning.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Methods Feasible for Blood Screening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Genetic screening methods can
improve the ability of doctors to ensure that donated blood is
free from disease, German scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Conventional antibody-based blood-donor screening can
sensitively pick up diseases that the body has started to fight
off.
</P>
<P>
If the body has not starting attacking the virus, there is
still a risk of transfusion-transmitted viral infections.
</P>
<P>
However, using a DNA test in blood banks could detect people
who may be infected with hepatitis C, hepatitis B virus, or HIV,
but who do not have any symptoms or detectable antibodies in their
blood, researchers from Frankfurt am Main, Germany, reported in
The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
Dr Willi Kurt Roth and colleagues tested the use of a technique
called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests in blood samples
taken from blood donated by 373,423 people.
</P>
<P>
PCRs are used to study genetic material. A short piece of DNA
or RNA, the body's genetic blueprints, can be amplified more than
a billion times.
</P>
<P>
Using the technique they were able to test 3,000 samples a day,
and testing was completed within eight hours.
</P>
<P>
They found two samples that carried the hepatitis C virus that
would have been missed using standard screening methods.
</P>
<P>
"PCR is a suitable and fast blood-donor screening procedure and
contributes to a reduction in viral transmission by transfusion of
blood components." the researchers concluded.

<HEADLINE> Global Consistency of Macroeconomic Policies Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations task
force on Friday called for the global consistency of macroeconomic
policies in preventing and managing financial crises.
</P>
<P>
Granting greater policy powers to the IMF Interim Committee and
broadening the Group of Seven to include representatives of the
developing and transition countries are among the proposals for
this purpose, the panel said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Economic and Social Council needs to be strengthened
to have political leadership in promoting broad consensus on
international economic issues, the task force of the U.N.
Executive Committee on Economic and Social Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
Its lengthy report entitled Toward a New International
Financial Architecture also called for the provision of adequate
liquidity in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
The current International Monetary Fund (IMF) has inadequate
funds and "acts more as an organizer of rescues than a provider of
funds", it said.
</P>
<P>
The conditions attached to the use of IMF funds "are not always
appropriate to the problems faced by countries in distress" and it
has very limited capacity to stop contagion, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The task force said IMF conditionality to provide funds "should
not include issues related to economic and social development
strategies" as these strategies "should be decided by legitimate
national authorities, based on broad social consensus".
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the imposition, under crisis conditions, of structural
and institutional changes that do not fit the national situation
or the national consensus potentially generates instability --
economic and political, national and international", it added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. panel urged significant membership expansion of the
current international institutions when the idea of creating a
world authority for global financial regulation is considered.
</P>
<P>
It said developing and transition economies should retain the
right to impose controls on capital inflows particularly in times
of capital surges, and on outflows during severe crises.

LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The IRA denied on Friday
responsibility for a series of "punishment" attacks in Northern
Ireland in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army was responding to accusations from
Conservative and Unionist politicians that it had been behind a
coordinated campaign of assaults.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in Sinn Fein's official paper Republican News,
an IRA spokesman rejected claims by the human rights group
Families Against Intimidation and Terror (FAIT) that it was to
blame for the ongoing attacks.
</P>
<P>
The often horrendous and sometimes fatal beatings and shootings
have long been a feature of paramilitary "justice" against

<P>
The IRA statement said: "FAIT's claim of IRA involvement in a
series of so-called punishment attacks is completely bogus."
</P>
<P>
But the Royal Ulster Constabulary said it was in little doubt
that IRA members were behind some of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
FAIT spokesman Vincent McKenna said "everybody knows" the IRA
was responsible.
</P>
<P>
"The RUC Chief Constable said as recently as last Friday that
he was quite satisfied that the majority of these attacks have
been carried out by the IRA, UDA and UVF," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Disappointed over Strained Relations with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton called Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee on
Friday to express his disappointment over strained relations
between the two countries because of nuclear issue, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
"He expressed some disappointment that the relation has not
blossomed as he had hoped," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
told reporters. "His goal remains to work through differences
and move the relationship forward."
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Clinton's call was to push for the
success of Deputy Secretary of States Strobe Talbott's talks now
underway in New Delhi with Indian officials.
</P>
<P>
Talbott is undertaking another round of nuclear policy talks
in New Delhi to urge the Indian government to sign the nuclear
test ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said India and the United States should have a strong
and productive relationship.
</P>
<P>
Clinton shelved a planned trip to India and Pakistan last year
after both countries conducted nuclear tests. The president in his
telephone conversation with the prime minister, expressed
appreciation for India's commitment to adhering to the test ban
pact by next September, Lockhart said. "He believes it's a very
important step on which to build," Lockhart added.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee has never clearly promised to sign the test ban
treaty, but has said he hopes it would come into force by
September. The treaty as it is now written cannot come into
force without India's signature.
</P>
<P>
Instead, India has offered a no-first-use treaty, which
Pakistan rejected. Both nations have promised to refrain from
more nuclear tests, but the United States says verbal promises
aren't reliable or durable enough.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Ties with African Bank: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABIDJAN, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China will continue to explore
new ways and areas of cooperation with the group of the African
Development Bank to promote bilateral friendly ties,
Vice-President Hu Jintao said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is here on a three-day official visit, said this Friday
afternoon in a meeting with President Omar Kabbaj of the African
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The group, as an important regional financial institution, has
made important contributions to the African economic development
and social development for many years, he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Hu continued, the group has undertaken
restructuring, improved the business services and personnel
training, and strengthened supervision on projects, financial
management and structural readjustment.
</P>
<P>
It has achieved great progress in helping Africa with economic
progress and poverty-relief, the Chinese vice-president said.
</P>
<P>
Since China joined the African Development Bank and the African
Development Fund in 1985, bilateral friendly cooperation in
various field have cherished a continuous advancement, Hu added.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the smooth implementation of a appraisal
technology cooperation agreement between the Chinese government
and the African Development Fund has helped Chinese professionals
actively take part in the group's financing consultations, which
has in return enhanced China's relations with African nations and
the group.
</P>
<P>
Kabbaj said the group has a very good relationship with China
and it very much appreciates China's efforts not to devalue its
currency and to maintain forceful cooperation with his bank.
</P>
<P>
This has served to ensure the smooth implementation of the
cooperation projects between his bank and China, he added.
</P>
<P>
After his Cote d'Ivoire tour ends on January 31, Hu will
proceed to South Africa, the last leg of his ongoing 13-day
four-nation African tour.

<HEADLINE> Combined Therapies Most Effective to Quit Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Combined methods of nicotine
replacement therapies are more effective than using just one,
scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Patients combining the use of nicotine patches with nicotine
nasal sprays were twice as likely to still be abstaining from
smoking after five years than those who had only used patches,
researchers from Iceland and Sweden have found.
</P>
<P>
Their study, published in the British Medical Journal,
monitored 237 smokers aged 22 to 66 over a six-year period.
</P>
<P>
Volunteers were split into groups and given either a patch and
a nasal spray, or a patch and a dummy placebo spray to help them
stop smoking.
</P>
<P>
They found the most effective way to stop smoking was to use a
nicotine patch for five months in conjunction with a nicotine
nasal spray and then continue to use the spray only for a further
seven months.
</P>
<P>
The researchers believed the combined method works because the
patches release nicotine slowly, with the nasal spray delivering
nicotine more rapidly, as and when the smoker needs to respond to
any smoking urges.

<HEADLINE> Vaccine Prevents Relapse of Colon Cancer, Study Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Colon cancer patients who
received an experimental anti-cancer vaccine after surgery were
less likely to see the cancer return, said a study published
Friday in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
The "customized" vaccine was made from a mixture of the
patients' cancer cells and a strain of bacteria called bacille
Calmette-Guerin (BCG).
</P>
<P>
By injecting BCG with the tumor cells, the vaccine could
generate an immune response that would destroy cancer cells
remaining in the patient after surgery.
</P>
<P>
Professors Jan Vermorken and colleagues from Vrije University
Hospital in Amsterdam, Netherlands, have tested the vaccine on 254
patients.
</P>
<P>
Of these, 170 patients had early, or stage II colon cancer,
where the tumor has eroded through the bowel wall but has spread
no further. The other 84 had stage III cancer, where the cancer
has travelled to the lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
Half of each group was randomly chosen to have the
vaccinations, while the other half got placebo injections.
</P>
<P>
After a five-year follow-up, tumors recurred in 40 of the 126
patients who had surgery, but in only 25 of 128 patients who had
surgery and the vaccination.
</P>
<P>
Further analysis indicated that this reduction was due to the
vaccine's effect in patients with stage II cancer, and that the
vaccine seemed to have little effect when the cancer had advanced
to stage III
</P>
<P>
The anti-cancer vaccine "gave significant clinical benefit"
with few side-effects, and should therefore be considered in the
treatment of such patients, the researchers concluded in The
Lancet.

<HEADLINE> Research Priorities on Aging to Be Identified at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A consultative meeting
of 30 experts will convene in Vienna from 1 to 3 February 1999, to
identify priorities that will guide and direct research on aging
into the next century and develop the Research Agenda for the
twenty-first century, U.N. Department of Public Information said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind, the meeting will consist of a series of
plenary and group activities based on the four facets of the
United Nations conceptual framework for considering a society for
all ages, which is the theme of the International Year of Older
Persons 1999.
</P>
<P>
The experts come from a wide range of research backgrounds and
disciplines, including health sciences, planning, economic and the
social and behavioral sciences.
</P>
<P>
The world now faces the prospect of an unprecedented rate of
population aging. In 1950, there were about 200 million persons
aged 60 or older. Today, persons on that age group now number
almost 550 million and rising. One of five persons will be 60
years or older by the year 2050 and one of three persons by 2150.
