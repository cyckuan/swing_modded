	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of Malaysia's most
famous dissident, Anwar Ibrahim, began Monday with the defense
asking the judge to hold Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in
contempt of court for prejudging the case.
	   ``You should hold this man for contempt'' said Raja Aziz
Addruse, who lead a team of nine defense lawyers, in reference to
reports quoting Mahathir as having said a conviction would help
preserve the ethnically-diverse Southeast Asian country's racial
harmony.
	   Demonstrations in support of Anwar have been held regularly
since the former deputy premier and heir apparent to Mahathir was
arrested on Sept. 20.
	   Outside the packed courtroom, policemen armed with assault
rifles patrolled the area to prevent possible protests by pro-Anwar
groups. About 200 supporters gathered nearby, but police blocked
them from approaching the courthouse, eyewitnesses said.
	   Anwar, who has denied the charges against him, made his
appearance in court after being escorted to the building through an
underground tunnel.
	   ``I am in good health. Expecting a good trial too,'' he told
reporters from the dock, where four policemen guarded him. He
hugged his wife and children and was later seen sharing a candy bar
with his wife.
	   The 51-year-old politician, who has called on Mahathir to step
down after 17 years in power, did not wear the neck brace he had
sported during previous court appearances. He has alleged having
being assaulted by police on his first night in custody, 18 days
after Mahathir fired him.
	   Anwar's dismissal and his arrest has led to unprecedented public
demonstrations against Mahathir and focused attention on the issues
of political dissent, freedom of expression and human rights in
Malaysia.
	   ``This is an excellent opportunity, your honor, for those of us
in Malaysia and especially those in this honorable court to prove
that the legal and judicial system isn't backward and lacking,''
Sulaiman Abdullah, another defense lawyer, told the court.
	   More than 100 reporters and international observers hoping to
watch the legal proceedings milled about outside the court
building, which faces Independence Square where many pro-Anwar
protests have taken place.
	   London-based Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch
were among the groups which sent representatives to observe the
trial.
	   ``We will totally monitor Anwar's trial to examine the nature
and basis of evidence brought against him and to assess the
proceedings in light of international standards on fair trial,''
said Mark Daly of Amnesty International.
	   Although the judge dismissed pleas by the defense to accord
special status to the international observers, representatives of
some rights groups were allowed to sit in the public gallery.
	   The Malaysian Bar council, a body of nearly 8,000 lawyers,
however, was also not allowed to send its representative to monitor
the trial.
	   ``The presence of these people here would interfere with the
exercise of (judicial) powers,'' said Judge Augustine Paul.
	   Judge Paul began hearing arguments about four counts of
corruption and one count of sodomy which have been lodged against
Anwar. A separate trial is expected for another charge of abuse of
power and four more counts of illegal sex.
	   Anwar has denied all the charges, saying they were politically
motivated. Mahathir, 72, says he fired his deputy prime minister on
moral grounds because homosexual acts are illegal in
Muslim-majority Malaysia.
	   He could be jailed for a maximum of 14 years for each of the
corruption charges linked to his alleged abuse of power during his
tenure from 1993 until his dismissal on Sept. 2.
	   Each illegal sex charge is punishable with 20 years in jail and
whipping.
	   The prosecution plans to cite testimony from 52 witnesses in the
first round of the hearing, which was scheduled to last until Nov.
14. At that time, the court will break for more than one week as
Malaysia plays host to a meeting of 20 world leaders for an
Asia-Pacific trade forum.
	   The widespread international attention on the case and its huge
implications for Malaysian politics forced authorities to shift the
hearing from the High Court building to a large room in the
adjacent federal courthouse.
	   ``We're obviously deeply concerned about aspects of Mr. Anwar's
arrest, detention, and trial,'' said Sidney Jones of the New
York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   ``But we are equally concerned about the government's reliance
on the Internal Security Act and what appears to be growing
restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly that affect a
much larger number of people,'' she said.
	   The ISA, a law that allows detention without trial, has been
used to detain a number of Anwar's supporters. Several hundred
others have been arrested for protesting against Mahathir.
	   In Melbourne, Australia, a prominent lawyers' group urged the
government to guarantee a fair trial for Anwar. The Law Council of
Australia also called on the government not to impede the work of
international observers attending the trial.
	   The trial was conducted partly in English and partly in Bhasa,
the language of the majority Malay community. Justice Paul had
initially ruled that the trial would be conducted in English
because of the intense interest abroad. But last week, the chief
justice ordered the trial to be conducted in Bhasa, the language of
majority Malays.

Philippines seizes dlrs 15 million in drugs from 39 foreigners in
</HEADLINE>
10 months

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine authorities have seized
613 million pesos (dlrs 15.3 million) worth of illegal drugs from
39 foreigners in the past 10 months, indicating the country has
become a key market for foreign drug traffickers, a senator said
Monday.
	   The drug seizures and arrests also show the government has been
unable to curb demand for the drugs, especially crystal
methamphetamine, known locally as ``shabu,'' Sen. Loren Legarda
said.
	   She urged a stronger government campaign to discourage illegal
drug use.
	   Shabu accounted for most of the seized drugs, totaling 278.5
kilograms (613 pounds) worth an estimated 557 million pesos (dlrs
13.9 million). The rest was cocaine, heroin and marijuana, said
Legarda, citing police statistics.
	   She said 22 of the arrested foreigners came from China, seven
from Taiwan and four from Japan. There were also one American, an
Austrian, a Nigerian and a Saudi Arabian, she said.
	   Since 1994, nine foreigners _ six Taiwanese, two Chinese and a
Japanese _ have been sentenced to death in the Philippines on drug
trafficking charges. Legarda said 29 other foreigners, including
six Chinese women, are being tried on similar charges.
	   Drug use has risen rapidly in the Philippines despite a law that
provides for the death penalty for possession of more than 200
grams (7 ounces) of shabu or 40 grams (1.4 ounces) of cocaine,
heroin, opium or morphine.
	   There are an estimated 1.7 million drug users in the
Philippines, most of them hooked on shabu, regarded as the ``poor
man's cocaine.'' The yearly trade in drugs is estimated at 300
billion pesos (dlrs 7.5 billion), more than half the government's
annual budget, officials said.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers recovered hundreds of
bodies from Nicaraguan communities buried when a crater lake
overflowed and sent mud and rock hurtling down a volcano on to
villages below. The confirmed deaths throughout Central America
blamed on one-time Hurricane Mitch rose to 1,005.
	   However, Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday that in just
two of the four Nicaraguan villages buried, 1,000 to 1,500 people
were presumed dead. The flow of mud down the Casitas volcano late
Friday or early Saturday had covered 80 square kilometers (32
square miles) in mud and rocks, he said. There were reports of
perhaps as many as 10 villages being affected.
	   ``We perhaps will never know how many people died,'' Bolanos
said.
	   Mitch was one of the most violent hurricanes to hit the
Caribbean, causing heavy rain and floods as it cut a fatal path
along the coasts of Honduras, Nicaragua and other Central American
countries.
	   Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman declared three days of
national mourning in what he said was the country's worst natural
disaster since a magnitude-6.2 earthquake killed 5,000 people in
1972.
	   The turmoil caused by the storm took more lives Sunday when the
mayor of the Honduran capital and three others died in a helicopter
crash while out surveying flood damage. Tegucigalpa Mayor Cesar
Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely presidential candidate
in 2001 elections.
	   And a C-47 cargo plane crashed Sunday in western Guatemala,
killing 12 people aboard and injuring six. The accident may have
been caused by bad weather associated with Mitch, airport officials
in Guatemala City said. The plane apparently was operated by a
Protestant missionary group with ties to the United States, but the
victims' nationalities were not known.
	   The first army rescue helicopters to reach the Casitas volcano
on Sunday found widespread destruction, army spokesman Capt. Milton
Sandoval said. Rescue workers recovered 360 bodies in four villages
near Posoltega, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) northwest of
Managua.
	   A river of mud and rubble collapsed on the villages after a
crater lake near the volcano's peak overflowed and caused part of
the mountain to crumble, Sandoval said.
	   Rescuers aboard the first army helicopters to reach the
communities found hundreds of decomposing bodies, he said. One
hundred soldiers working at the scene were burying the rotting
bodies where they lay because of public health concerns, Sandoval
said.
	   It was unclear how many residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa may have
fled in time to avoid the mudslide. Dr. Marcos Espinosa said in a
telephone interview that 126 survivors from the four villages had
been treated at a hospital in Chinandega for ``fractures and
serious wounds'' that had become infected after the victims spent
nearly two days in the mud.
	   A woman who claimed to have survived the disaster told Radio
Nicaragua on Sunday that she had seen ``many unburied bodies'' in
orchards near the volcano. The survivor, Mercedes Rodriguez Zapata,
said she left the area Saturday and traveled on foot and horseback
to the capital, Managua.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, army rescue helicopters flew 52 famished and
ailing men, women and children from the town of San Francisco
Libre, on the northern banks of Managua Lake, about 40 kilometers
(25 miles) north of the capital. In that community alone, 1,600
families were left homeless.
	   One survivor, Candido Mejia, 58, was so weak he could barely
give his name after he and his two children were airlifted to
safety.
	   Townspeople said they had to climb trees and on to roofs last
week when the lake's edge advanced by three kilometers (two miles)
and flooded the farming community. No deaths were reported, but
many residents had not eaten for several days.
	   Rescue workers left behind rice, corn, beans and other
provisions before taking the sick to get medical care.
	   By official count, 225 people have been killed in Nicaragua from
heavy rain and flash flooding _ apparently in addition to the
mudslide victims.
	   Nicaragua has asked the United States to lend it several large
helicopters to help deliver supplies and assess damage in remote
areas, Defense Minister Pedro J. Chamorro Barrios said Saturday.
	   In Honduras, at least 246 deaths have been blamed on Mitch,
including those in the Tegucigalpa mayor's helicopter crash.
	   El Salvador _ where 140 people died in flash floods _ declared a
state of emergency Saturday, as did Guatemala, where 21 people died
when floods swept away their homes. Mexico reported one death from
Mitch last Monday.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 people aboard that hasn't been heard from
since Tuesday.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near 180 mph (288 kph), had
dropped to near 30 mph (48 kph), and the storm _ now classified as
a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on Mexico's southern
Pacific coast near the Guatemalan border.
	   Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13 kph) and was dissipating, but
threatened to strengthen again if it moved back out to sea.

Protest in Indonesian capital targets U.S.-based mining company

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Dancing and playing traditional drums,
about 100 people from a remote Indonesian province protested in the
Southeast Asian nation's capital city Monday against a U.S.-based
mining company.
	   The demonstrators alleged that Freeport Indonesia, a unit of New
Orleans-based Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc., was exploiting
mineral-rich Irian Jaya.
	   Freeport operates the world's single largest copper and gold
deposit mine in the province, which is located on the western half
of an island shared with Papua New Guinea.
	   Students from Irian Jaya rallied outside the attorney general's
office, saying Freeport had failed to adequately help out the poor
province while reaping the benefits of its natural resources.
	   ``There is financial support for the Irianese but it's only a
small amount after years of robbing our coal and gold,'' said
Hendrik Mansnembra, a protest organizer.
	   Mansnembra said Freeport had made little effort to negotiate
with the Irianese after three decades of mining in the eastern
Indonesian province.
	   Freeport pumps some money back into the local economy, and has
built schools and bridges. But critics say more aid is needed.
	   Freeport has long been shrouded in controversy due to its close
ties with the Indonesian government and perceived links with former
President Suharto, who quit in May after riots and protests forced
him to end 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   The attorney general's office is investigating the alleged
involvement of Indonesian senior economic minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita in a 1991 share transaction between Freeport and an
Indonesian conglomerate, the Bakrie group.
	   The deal was suspected of having led to the renewal of
Freeport's operating contract with the Indonesian government that
year.
	   Ginandjar, who was mines and energy minister at the time, has
rejected the allegations and says the deal was completely legal.

Indonesian debtors meet foreign lenders at debt conference
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's top economics minister
called on local debtors and foreign creditors Monday to restructure
a massive private debt mountain, saying a deal was needed to curb
rising poverty and unemployment.
	   More than 1,000 Indonesian business executives, international
lenders and others gathered in the capital city Monday for a World
Bank-sponsored conference aimed primarily at promoting the Jakarta
Initiative, a corporate debt restructuring plan.
	   The sprawling Southeast Asian island country has suffered from
its worst economic crisis in 30 years. Soaring prices, mass
unemployment and millions of additions to the ranks of the poor
have raised the potential for civil unrest.
	   Riots and protests in May forced former President Suharto to
quit after 32 autocratic years in power. His successor President
B.J. Habibie is now the target of regular anti-government
demonstrations.
	   Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for the Economy, Finance and
Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita stressed the key importance of
restructuring when he opened the two-day meeting.
	   ``We will not be able to generate the jobs we need, alleviate
poverty, expand our national output or generate fiscal balance
until the engine of growth in our economy, its private sector, is
working again.''
	   The Jakarta Initiative, which was unveiled in September, is the
government's latest effort to help Indonesian corporations
reschedule the terms of more than dlrs 60 billion in foreign debt.
	   The private sector's inability to reach agreements with
creditors has been viewed as a key impediment to economic recovery
in the world's fourth most populous nation.
	   World Bank country director for Indonesia, Dennis De Tray, said
the government's role in the Jakarta Initiative ``is to facilitate
restructuring, not bail out companies.''
	   Partly financed by the World Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, the Jakarta Initiative is designed as a ``one-stop shop''
through which companies can cut out the red tape that would
normally require them to consult several government ministries to
win regulatory approval for such issues as debt-to-equity swaps.
	   The initiative will provide so-called facilitators, for the most
part international lawyers and consultants, to serve as middlemen
between creditors and debtors.
	   Indonesian Finance Minister Bambang Subianto urged Indonesian
companies to be more transparent.
	   ``Put losses on the balance sheets so we can clearly see the
size of the loss,'' Bambang told the conference.
	   He repeated that the government has begun reviewing various
policies, particularly in the field of capital market regulations,
in order to help ease the restructuring process.
	   Despite the recent strengthening of the Indonesian currency, the
rupiah has depreciated by 70 percent since last July, making it
impossible for many corporations to repay foreign currency loans.
	   Meanwhile, the Indonesian Public Companies Association, which
represents all listed companies, urged borrowers and lenders to
adopt a more realistic approach toward resolving the impasse over
the debt talks.
	   In a public advertisement placed in local newspapers, the
association said there was a ``deepening sense of frustration''
over the lack of progress in debt-restructuring talks even 16
months after the crisis began.

Shanghai to Osaka flight makes emergency landing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A Chinese jetliner on a flight from
Shanghai to Osaka, Japan was forced to make an emergency landing
Monday after taking off due to an unspecified problem with its
front landing gear, state television reported.
	   China Eastern Airlines flight number MU515 was able to return to
Shanghai's Hongqiao airport after the problem was detected,
according to a brief report on Shanghai television that made no
mention of any casualties.
	   The flight took off from Shanghai at 11:55 (0355 GMT) Monday
morning, and Shanghai government officials went to the airport
after the problem was detected, the report said.
	   The news report described the jet as a big passenger plane, but
gave no other details.
	   A Chinese source at another state-run television station in
Shanghai said one of the plane's front wheels fell off after
takeoff.
	   On September 10, nine people were injured after another Eastern
Airlines jetliner made an emergency landing in Shanghai after its
front landing gear jammed, sliding along the runway in a shower of
sparks.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 with 137 passengers aboard was bound
for Beijing when its landing gear failed. Pilots identified a
problem with the gear shortly after takeoff and circled for more
than three hours to burn up fuel before making an emergency belly
landing on a foam-covered runway at the Hongqiao airport, the
official China Daily newspaper reported Monday.
	   The newspaper described the landing gear failure as mechanical
and said Chinese technicians have since identified the cause of the
problem. But the report gave no details. It said the nine people
were injured while exiting the plane after the emergency landing.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of Malaysia's most
famous dissident, Anwar Ibrahim, began Monday with the defense
asking the judge to hold Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in
contempt of court for prejudging the case.
	   ``You should hold this man for contempt'' said Raja Aziz

appearance in court after being escorted to the building through an
underground tunnel.
	   ``I am in good health. Expecting a good trial too,'' he told
reporters from the dock, where four policemen guarded him. He
hugged his wife and children and was later seen sharing a candy bar
with his wife.
	   The 51-year-old politician, who has called on Mahathir to step
down after 17 years in power, did not wear the neck brace he had
sported during previous court appearances. He has alleged having
being assaulted by police on his first night in custody, 18 days
after Mahathir fired him.
	   Anwar's dismissal and his arrest has led to unprecedented public
demonstrations against Mahathir and focused attention on the issues
of political dissent, freedom of expression and human rights in
Malaysia.
	   ``This is an excellent opportunity, your honor, for those of us
in Malaysia and especially those in this honorable court to prove
that the legal and judicial system isn't backward and lacking,''
Sulaiman Abdullah, another defense lawyer, told the court.
	   More than 100 reporters and international observers hoping to
watch the legal proceedings milled about outside the court
building, which faces Independence Square where many pro-Anwar
protests have taken place.
	   London-based Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch
were among the groups which sent representatives to observe the
trial.
	   ``We will totally monitor Anwar's trial to examine the nature
and basis of evidence brought against him and to assess the
proceedings in light of international standards on fair trial,''
said Mark Daly of Amnesty International.
	   Although the judge dismissed pleas by the defense to accord
special status to the international observers, representatives of
some rights groups were allowed to sit in the public gallery.
	   The Malaysian Bar council, a body of nearly 8,000 lawyers,
however, was also not allowed to send its representative to monitor
the trial.
	   ``The presence of these people here would interfere with the
exercise of (judicial) powers,'' said Judge Augustine Paul.
	   Judge Paul began hearing arguments about four counts of
corruption. A separate trial is expected for others charges of
abuse of power and illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar has denied all the charges, saying they were politically
motivated. Mahathir, 72, says he fired his deputy prime minister on
moral grounds because homosexual acts are illegal in
Muslim-majority Malaysia.
	   He could be jailed for a maximum of 14 years for each of the
corruption charges linked to his alleged abuse of power during his
tenure from 1993 until his dismissal on Sept. 2.
	   Each illegal sex charge is punishable with 20 years in jail and
whipping.
	   The prosecution plans to cite testimony from 52 witnesses in the
first round of the hearing, which was scheduled to last until Nov.
14. At that time, the court will break for more than one week as
Malaysia plays host to a meeting of 20 world leaders for an
Asia-Pacific trade forum.
	   The widespread international attention on the case and its huge
implications for Malaysian politics forced authorities to shift the
hearing from the High Court building to a large room in the
adjacent federal courthouse.
	   ``We're obviously deeply concerned about aspects of Mr. Anwar's
arrest, detention, and trial,'' said Sidney Jones of the New
York-based Human Rights Watch.
	   ``But we are equally concerned about the government's reliance
on the Internal Security Act and what appears to be growing
restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly that affect a
much larger number of people,'' she said.
	   The ISA, a law that allows detention without trial, has been
used to detain a number of Anwar's supporters. Several hundred
others have been arrested for protesting against Mahathir.
	   In Melbourne, Australia, a prominent lawyers' group urged the
government to guarantee a fair trial for Anwar. The Law Council of
Australia also called on the government not to impede the work of
international observers attending the trial.
	   The trial was conducted partly in English and partly in Bhasa,
the language of the majority Malay community. Justice Paul had
initially ruled that the trial would be conducted in English
because of the intense interest abroad. But last week, the chief
justice ordered the trial to be conducted in Bhasa, the language of
majority Malays.

Hussain posts first ton
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Nasser Hussain put aside seeing blood on
the pitch to post England's first century of the Ashes tour in the
first-class match against Western Australia on Monday.
	   Hussain came in to bat on Sunday after opener Mark Butcher was
hit above his right eye and was forced to retire hurt with a gash
which required 10 stitches.
	   Hussain admitted he saw Butcher's blood on the ground as he
began his innings. After reaching 93 on Sunday Hussain converted
the innings into a century before falling for 118.
	   Hussain, who scored a double hundred on Australia's last tour of
England, brought up his century with a hooked boundary. He reached
the milestone in 271 minutes, off 229 balls, with 14 fours.
	   At lunch on the third day England was 268 for four in reply to
Western Australia's 334 for eight declared, with Mark Ramprakash 73
and Warren Hegg on nine.
	   England captain Alec Stewart, who was forced to miss the match
because of a back injury, had his first session in the nets for
three days Monday.
	   ``If the match had started today and I had woken up feeling like
this then I would have probably played,'' Stewart said. ``I'm
hoping to have another net this afternoon and hopefully I'll be
back to 100 percent tomorrow.''
	   Butcher was still feeling the effects of being struck on the
head. He came to the WACA Ground on Monday but returned to the
hotel as his eye began to close and he suffered headaches.
	   ``I didn't realize the problem immediately,'' Butcher said of
being struck by the second ball of the innings. ``I didn't feel too
bad and then I saw the blood and realized I was in a little
difficulty.''

Shanghai to Osaka flight makes forced landing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with report of no casualties, other details.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A Chinese jetliner carrying 102 mostly
Japanese passengers developed a landing gear problem after takeoff
Monday from Shanghai, forcing it to make an emergency landing in
which no one was hurt, state media reported.
	   The Airbus A300 jet flown by China Eastern Airlines was bound
for Osaka, Japan but was forced to return to Shanghai's Hongqiao
Airport due to an unspecified mechanical problem with the plane's
front landing gear, the Xinhua News Agency said.
	   None of the 87 passengers, which included 55 Japanese and a
person from Taiwan, or 15 crew members were injured, the report
said.
	   Xinhua gave the flight number as 2322 and said it took off from
Shanghai at 9:45 a.m. (0145 GMT). But state-run Shanghai television
gave the flight number as MU515, and said it took off at 11.55 a.m.
(0355 GMT).
	   There was no immediate explanation for the conflicting reports.
	   Xinhua said the airport was closed at 11:50 a.m. (0350 GMT) and
re-opened after the plane's successful emergency landing shortly
after midday.
	   Shanghai government officials went to the scene after the
problem occurred, the TV report said.
	   A Chinese source at another state-run television station in
Shanghai said one of the plane's front wheels fell off after
takeoff.
	   On September 10, nine people were injured after another Eastern
Airlines jetliner made an emergency landing in Shanghai after its
front landing gear jammed, sliding along the runway in a shower of
sparks.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 with 137 people aboard was bound for
Beijing when its landing gear failed. Pilots identified a problem
with the gear shortly after takeoff and circled for more than three
hours to burn up fuel before making an emergency belly landing on a
foam-covered runway at the Hongqiao airport, the official China
Daily newspaper reported Monday.
	   The newspaper described the landing gear failure as mechanical
and said Chinese technicians have since identified the cause of the
problem. But the report gave no details. It said the nine people
were injured while exiting the plane after the emergency landing.

Australia urges rich nations not to be ``heavy handed'' with Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The world's richest countries should
not impose ``heavy handed'' conditions on any loans they offer to
troubled Asian nations, Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer said
Monday.
	   Fischer lavishly praised the Group of Seven nations _ the United
States, Britain, Japan, Germany France, Italy and Canada _ for
steps to restore stability to the world's financial system and
prevent fresh repercussions from the Asian economic meltdown.
	   But he warned that great care is needed to ensure that
conditions attached to loans made in this way are not too harsh for
developing Asian nations.
	   The G-7 group last week approved an emergency borrowing program
for troubled countries which agree to pursue International Monetary
Fund-approved policies.
	   U.S. officials hope such contingency financing will avert
further episodes of the kind of panic which has plunged several
Asian countries into deep recession and which leveled Russia's
economy in August.
	   Fischer promised Australia would do all it can to advance the
G-7 initiatives in the Asian region, in particular at the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting in Kuala Lumpur in
mid-November.
	   He said the G-7 initiatives had already advanced global efforts
to restore transparency to the world's financial system.
	   ``The efforts towards more transparency have been massively
helped by the agreement by the G-7 leaders and finance ministers
and central bank governors on steps for addressing the financial
crisis,'' Fischer said.
	   ``(But) I've got to say that some of the OECD countries, at the
bigger end of the spectrum, should not be too heavy handed,'' he
warned.

Explosions at gas cylinder warehouse kill at least 8
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Explosions at a gas cylinder warehouse in
northeastern India killed at least eight people and injured 170
others, according to witnesses and hospital sources Monday.
	   Homemaker Riti Vohra said a strong smell of gas at the warehouse
in Gauhati had drawn a crowd late Sunday, the Assam state capital.
Most of the dead were believed to have been among the onlookers.
	   Vohra said the first large explosion came around 11:15 p.m.,
followed quickly by two more huge blasts then a series of small
blasts as cylinders ignited one by one.
	   ``A ball of fire rose into the sky,'' Vohra said. ``The air was
burning.''
	   More than 3,000 people fled their homes after the explosions and
spent the night along roadsides.
	   About 40 houses were set ablaze. Firefighters took several hours
to bring the blaze under control.
	   The death toll was expected to rise because many of the injured
were hospitalized in critical conditions with cuts from flying
metal and serious burns. Monday morning, workers searched the
smoldering debris for more bodies or survivors.
	   Most Indian households use gas cylinders attached to stoves for
cooking.

Bedridden, Se Ri Pak skips government medal-awarding ceremony
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ LPGA rookie sensation Se Ri Pak,
exhausted and bedridden with a cold, had to pass up having a medal
pinned on her by South Korea's president Monday.
	   Pak was one of three South Korean athletes chosen to receive the
Order of Sport Merit (Brave Tiger), the second highest government
medal given to an athlete.
	   President Kim Dae-jung wanted to personally pin the medal on
Pak, but her doctor advised her to stay at Seoul's Samsung
Hospital, where she was admitted Saturday.
	   Doctors said she continued to suffer from a high fever.
	   The other two athletes chosen to receive the medal _ Los Angeles
Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park and LPGA golfer Pearl Shin _ attended
the ceremony at the presidential Blue House.
	   Since arriving in Seoul last Tuesday for a week's visit, Pak has
been besieged by the media and attended numerous promotional events
for her corporate sponsor, Samsung.
	   She became ill late Saturday after playing in rain in the second
round of the Korea LPGA. She skipped the final round on Sunday.
	   Doctors put Pak under medication at least until Tuesday.
	   Pak's family said it's unclear whether she will be able to
attend the Japan Classic, the next to the last LPGA event this
year, which opens in Japan Friday.

Moody's puts Japan's electric power companies under review
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Monday it has placed
under review for possible downgrade the senior long-term debt
ratings of Japan's nine electric power companies.
	   The New York-based ratings agency said deregulation of the
industry in Japan and the opening up of the power market make the
earnings prospects of the companies uncertain.
	   Moody's placed under review its triple-A long-term debt ratings
on Tokyo Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric Power Co. and Chubu
Electric Power Co.
	   The double-A1 ratings on other Japanese electric power companies
have also been placed under review.
	   These companies are Hokkaido Electric Power Co., Tohoku Electric
Power Co., Hokuriku Electric Power Co., Chugoku Electric Power Co.,
Shikoku Electric Power Co. and Kyushu Electric Power Co.
	   The Moody's decision affects a total of about 12 trillion yen
(dlrs 103 billion) in long-term debt.
	   The review was prompted by concern the deregulation measures
currently under discussion by the Japanese government may lead to
changes in the currently favorable operating environment for the
industry, Moody's said.
	   The Electric Utility Council of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry was expected to recommend liberalization
measures to further open up the electric utility market in Japan,
according to Moody's.
	   This may lead to revenue losses and a weakening of the full-cost
rate setting method which has traditionally allowed Japanese power
companies to recover their investments in full, said the rating
agency.

Vehicle sales in Japan drop 17 percent in October
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese sales of new cars, trucks and buses fell
17.1 percent in October compared to the same month last year to
322,556 vehicles as a result of a slump in the overall economy, the
Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said Monday.
	   The latest figures mark the 19th consecutive month of declines,
the association said.
	   Sales of passenger cars fell 14.0 percent on the year to 237,912
units, while truck sales slid 24.8 percent to 83,718 units. Bus
sales dropped 8.0 percent to 926 units.
	   All of Japanese 11 major automakers posted lower sales in
October.
	   By manufacturers, Japan's largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp.,
posted a 16.9 percent decline on the year in October sales to
141,217 vehicles.
	   Second-largest maker Nissan Motor Co. saw a 13.6 percent
decrease in sales to 61,829 units and Honda Motor Co.'s sales
plunged 28.1 percent to 35,004 vehicles.
	   Meanwhile, sales of imported cars fell 21.9 percent on the year
to 19,543 units.

China's economy in ``grim situation,'' economist says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Faltering state enterprise reforms, summer floods
and the Asian financial crisis have thrust China's economy into
``an unprecedented grim situation,'' according to an economist at a
top government think tank.
	   Hou Yongzhi of the Development Research Center, which operates
under China's State Council, or Cabinet, made the frank assessment
in a speech Monday to a conference in Beijing.
	   An unexpected onslaught of problems, including disastrous summer
floods, have boosted unemployment and undermined efforts to
stimulate the economy through increased domestic demand, Hou said.
	   ``Since entering 1998, the operation of China's economy has
encountered an unprecedented grim situation,'' he said.
	   Like other Chinese officials, Hou stopped short of warning that
China's economy faces a slump similar to those in other Asian
countries. Last week, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman and
central bank chief both refuted speculation that China may be on
the verge of an economic meltdown.
	   Hou said 8 percent economic growth this year was still possible
_ a pace outstripping growth elsewhere in the region. The
Development Research Center forecasts growth at 7.9 percent in
1998, increasing to 8.3 percent next year.
	   To help reach the 8 percent growth target thought to be
necessary to absorb workers laid off from downsizing state-run
factories, the government has ordered banks to lend more money and
has poured investment into infrastructure and other construction
projects.
	   Hou said it was unclear how much help the private sector could
provide, since overseas Chinese in crisis-stricken Asia are a main
source of financing.

EU to China: More reform only way to ride out Asian crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By JOE McDONALD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Prodding China to open up its markets to
more imported goods, the head of the European Union said Monday
that economic liberalization is the only way to ride out the Asian
financial crisis.
	   Opening markets and creating a more easily understood legal
system and investment rules would attract foreign money and
technology, EU President Jacques Santer said in a speech to an
audience of European businesspeople.
	   ``Only through the combination of both the reform process and
the opening of the Chinese economy can China ride out the current
crisis,'' Santer said. ``The worst thing to do, also in the Asian
crisis, would be to move toward protectionism.''
	   Santer, who is on a six-day visit to China, said he conveyed
that message in meetings Friday in Beijing with President Jiang
Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji and legislative head Li Peng.
	   European want China, which is eager to join the World Trade
Organization, to ease access to its banking, insurance,
telecommunications and other industries and to loosen restrictive
investment rules.
	   Such liberalization would be ``overwhelmingly in China's own
interests,'' Santer said.
	   Increasing European involvement could make China less vulnerable
to the possible loss of investment from its neighbors, the EU
president said. He said Europe accounts for just 5 percent of
foreign investment in China, while Asian countries make up 70
percent.
	   And allowing in foreign banks could provide money to
reinvigorate China's struggling banking industry, Santer said.
	   ``The establishment of a sound and transparent legal and
institutional framework, as well as better implementation and
enforcement of the rules would do much to make investing in China
more attractive to European companies,'' he said.
	   European imports from China have surged by 25 percent in the
first half of 1998, according to Santer. He said the European trade
deficit with China was dlrs 25 billion last year and was expected
to balloon this year, in part because of Chinese import barriers.
	   Santer rejected suggestions that slowing growth in China, a
trouble banking industry and other economic problems made this the
wrong time to press for further liberalization.
	   ``We have witnessed in all our relations with other countries
that through a more open trade relations system you can provide new
technologies, you can provide new market liquidity, you can provide
new markets,'' he said.
	   ``It's not by measures of protectionism that you can reach these
benefits.''
	   Santer began the day by meeting Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi, then
went to the China-Europe International Business School, a graduate
school financed jointly by the European Union and the Chinese trade
ministry.
	   The 4-year-old school, whose teachers are American, Chinese and
European, has granted 490 degrees to Chinese and foreign students
and trained some 1,250 executives in mid-career programs.
	   Santer said the European Union planned to continue support for
the school through 2000, and grant scholarships for some 2,000
Chinese to study at business schools in Europe.
	   ``This school is arguably the European Union's most cherished
project in China,'' he said.

Dollar lower, Japanese stocks end higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stocks, mid-afternoon dollar, bond prices

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks closed sharply higher Monday after
two major banks announced they may form an alliance. The U.S.
dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 388.24
points, or 2.86 percent, closing at 13,952.75 points. On Friday,
the average closed down 104.21 points, or 0.76 percent.
	   Traders said investors pushed up heavily-weighted banking shares
after two of Japan's largest banks _ Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank Ltd. _ said Saturday that they may form a strategic
alliance in a key business area.
	   ``Investors favored the move by the two banks to restructure
their operations to survive at this very difficult time for
banks,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager of the stock division at
Ryoko Securities Co.
	   A proposed merger of the banks' trust banking operations would
be the first such link between top-ranked Japanese lenders. But it
comes as just the latest word of tie-ups designed to cope with
increased competition, a recessionary economy and massive bad loan
loads.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the stock exchange climbed 30.24 points, or 2.92
percent, to 1,065.84. The TOPIX closed down 1.50 points, or 0.41
percent, on Friday.
	   A gain in New York stocks Friday also gave a boost to
international blue-chip shares, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 115.70
yen, down 0.38 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New
York level of 116.14 yen late Friday.
	   Earlier Monday, the dollar dipped more than 1 yen from its
levels on Friday before making up some of its losses on
short-covering by overseas players, traders said.
	   The dollar's slide came amid expectations for further cuts in
U.S. interest rates. Lower rates make interest-bearing securities
less attractive and tend to reduce demand for a country's currency.
	   The weakness in the U.S. currency also stemmed from a Group of
Seven industrialized nations' endorsement last week of reforms in
Brazil, which was seen as good news for emerging markets, including
those in Asia, traders said.
	   Japanese dealers mostly stayed on the sidelines because of
reluctance to build up positions ahead of a national holiday on
Tuesday, they said.
	   Japanese financial markets will be closed Tuesday for the
Culture Day holiday. Regular trading resumes on Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.825 percent, up from Friday's close of
0.820 percent, driving its price down to 108.68 yen from 108.73
yen.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Foreign observers won't have any
special rights to monitor the trial of dissident Anwar Ibrahim, the
High Court judge ruled Monday.
	   ``The presence of these people would interfere with the exercise
of (judicial) powers,'' Judge Augustine Paul said in response to an
appeal by lawyers for Anwar.
	   ``I regret that the application to be observers is an insult to
the court,'' Paul said. ``There is no reason to let foreigners
check us.''
	   Hundreds of foreign reporters and observers have flocked to the
Malaysian capital to watch the trial of the ousted deputy prime
minister and finance minister.
	   Anwar is charged with five counts of corruption and five counts
of sodomy, a crime in this predominantly Muslim country.
	   His case generated international concern after he appeared with
a black eye and bruises during his arraignment. He said he was
beaten by police the night of his arrest Sept. 20.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept.
2 and has since spearheaded a campaign to oust his former boss. He
says the charges against him were trumped up to quash his growing
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   Raja Aziz Addruse, who is leading a team of nine defense
lawyers, asked that the Malaysian Bar Council and six
representatives of international organizations, including United
Nations rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy, be observers at the trial.
	   ``It is totally wrong. Application by international observers is
an alien concept,'' said Paul.
	   Special status for observers would mean reserving seats for them
in the courtroom and allowing them to formally report on the trial.
	   Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, a British jurists'
forum and representatives of Indonesia and the Philippines were
among those who had flown in for the trial.
	   But only a few of them could get into the courtroom after
jostling with reporters and members of Anwar's family at the
doorway. Several got seats in the public gallery but will not be
allowed to formally monitor the trial.
	   Diplomats from the French, Austrian and U.S. embassies were
among those who failed to get in.
	   The Malaysian Bar Council, which represents nearly 8,000
lawyers, was furious when its representative was barred.
	   ``The irony here is you have foreign observers in there,'' said
Mah Weng Kwai, secretary of the council. ``Here we are local and we
cannot observe the trial as representatives of our people.''

Anti-graft chief urges public to use new constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The head of Thailand's anti-graft
agency has urged the public to join in the fight against corruption
by putting the country's new constitution to use, a newspaper
reported Monday.
	   Unlike past constitutions, the one promulgated last year calls
on government agencies to open up their work to public scrutiny.
	   The newspaper The Nation quoted the chairman of the Counter
Corruption Commission, Opas Arunin, as saying the constitution's
Information Act was a good starting point for individuals and
grassroots organizations to fight corruption.
	   Provisions of the act facilitate public disclosure of documents
pertaining to official budgets, work plans, concessions, contracts
and joint government-private sector investments.
	   Borwornsak Uwanno, who took part in drafting the constitution,
said the strength of the Information Act lay in how it was utilized
by the public.
	   ``The constitution was written to give more power and rights to
the people, and it will be useless if the people do not use those
rights and powers,'' Borwornsak was quoted as saying.
	   He said the constitution made possible the exposure of several
recent corruption scandals, including ones at the ministries of
health and agriculture.

South Korean president hopes for success of Hyundai's business in
</HEADLINE>
North Korea &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-NKorea-Kim Jong Il &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung expressed hope
Monday that deals struck by South Korea's largest conglomerate with
North Korea would spur economic exchanges and help ease tension on
the peninsula.
	   Kim made the remarks after receiving a briefing from Chung
Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai group, on his just concluded trip
to North Korea, during which he discussed joint ventures in the
isolated communist country.
	   ``South-North economic cooperation is beneficial for both sides
and good for improving inter-Korea relations,'' presidential
spokesman Park Ji-won quoted Kim as saying.
	   During a five-day visit that ended Saturday, Chung met North
Korean leader Kim Jong Il and won his support for a series of joint
venture projects Hyundai is pushing in the North.
	   The deals include a dlrs 906 million tourism project, a thermal
power plant, assembly of automobiles and car audio systems, and
building a gymnasium and an industrial park.
	   The tourism project allows Hyundai to send several thousand
tourists a week for a five-day tour of Diamond Mountain, a major
attraction on the North's east coast, beginning Nov. 18.
	   Chung said financial and other details of all except the tourism
project, gymnasium and car audio assembly plant remain to be worked
out. Hyundai plans to build the gymnasium in Pyongyang, the
capital, and donate it to the North Korean government.
	   When the gymnasium is built in a year or two, the North Korean
leader promised to invite South Korean athletes for goodwill games
with North Koreans, Chung said.
	   The South Korean president, the spokesman said, expressed keen
interest in Hyundai's plan to build an industrial park on North
Korea's west coast exclusively for labor-intensive South Korean
plants. Labor costs are about eight times cheaper in the North.
	   ``Taiwan is benefiting from the advance of its businesses into
China. I hope all goes well for the construction of the industrial
park so that many of our small companies can move into it,'' the
spokesman quoted Kim as saying.
	   Hyundai officials said the industrial park would accommodate up
to 800 South Korean plants that have lost their competitiveness in
international markets.
	   Chung and other Hyundai executives said they are advising North
Korean officials that the proposed industrial park be patterned on
China's first special economic zone, set up in Shenzhen near Hong
Kong.
	   Foreigners doing business in Shenzhen are entitled to
extraordinary tax breaks and other financial benefits.

earthquake &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ More than 1,000 tremors have hit a
central Indian village since September, prompting experts to
predict a strong quake will strike the area soon.
	   When news of the impending earthquake first reached Pandhana,
the village about 750 kilometers (450 miles) south of New Delhi was
panic-stricken, said Rajendra Prasad Mandal, administrator of the
district that includes Pandhana. Women and children were sent to
live with relatives in safer areas.
	   ``But now it has become a part of their lives,'' Mandal in a
telephone interview Monday.
	   Local officials and scientists have been trying to create
awareness about safety measures and regular demonstrations are
given to residents about how they should react if an earthquake
occurs.
	   The administration has provided villagers with collapsible
bamboo huts and all are advised to sleep in the open. The fire
brigade, police and local hospitals are on high alert.
	   Scientists from the Geological Survey of India and the Indian
Meteorological Department have been camping in the district to
monitor the tremors.
	   ``The government is fully prepared. We can not prevent the
earthquake, but the casualties are likely to be minimal,'' Mandal
said.
	   The lives of the Pandhana's 12,000 people, and another 22,000
people in 22 villages in a 15-kilometer (nine-kilometer) radius
have been insured by the government of Madhya Pradesh state for
rupees 50,000 (dlrs 1,190) each, Mandal said.
	   Residents have been encouraged to buy their own property
insurance.
	   J.G. Negi of the National Geophysical Research Institute said he
was sure a strong earthquake would hit Pandhana, but could not
predict when, the Hindustan Times said Monday. Similar tremors
preceded major earthquakes that devastated central India in the
mid-1990s.

Vietnam tourism facing tough time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis is hitting
Vietnam's tourism industry hard, with the number of foreign
arrivals forecast to decline this year, local press reported
Monday.
	   Competition from other countries in the region has intensified,
and a hotel construction boom has created a glut in the market. A
number of projects are on hold.
	   Following a boom in the mid-1990s, Vietnam expects 1.5 million
foreign arrivals this year, compared with 1.7 million in 1997, the
newspaper New Hanoi said. Of those, an estimated 41 percent are
tourists.
	   Vietnam had only 250,000 foreign arrivals in 1990. The figure
boomed to 1 million in 1994, but the rapid growth has slowed
dramatically, with only a 6.7 percent increase last year.
	   The government has set a target of 2 million foreign arrivals by
2000. That will be difficult to achieve, given strong competition
from neighboring countries and the very low rate of tourists coming
to Vietnam more than once.

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian impact player Willie
Ofahengaue has been declared fit for the Wallabies' tests against
France and England later this month.
	   Ofahengaue was given a thorough workout on his injured Achilles
tendon before coach Rod Macqueen gave him the clearance.
	   The Wallabies are missing six players because of injury, with
Tim Horan, Ben Tune, Richard Harry, Damian Smith, Matthew Burke and
Stirling Mortlock all forced to stay home.
	   The Wallabies play France A in Lille on Nov. 15 before tests
against France on Nov. 21 and England on Nov. 28.
	   Explosive Back-rower Ofahengaue was used off the bench by
Macqueen this season in tactic which worked well for the Wallabies.

UCLA gets wakeup call
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICHARD ROSENBLATT &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Cade McNown knows a close call when he sees one.
Or two. Or three.
	   ``The last couple weeks we have escaped, not dominated,'' the
UCLA quarterback said after the third-ranked Bruins rallied in the
fourth quarter and then held on for a 28-24 victory over Stanford.
	   ``We got by, but it's certainly a wakeup call.''
	   In the two games before Saturday's scare, the Bruins (7-0, 5-0
Pac-10) edged Oregon 41-38 in overtime and had a tough time beating
California 28-16.
	   ``We have a target on our back and everyone is giving us their
best shot,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``This was the worst we
played all year, but the fact that we still won says something.''
	   The Bruins almost knocked themselves out of the national title
chase, but a fumble recovery in the end zone with 4:19 left
prevented the Cardinal from scoring what could have been the
winning TD.
	   UCLA dropped from No. 2 to No. 3 in this week's AP poll, behind
Ohio State and Tennessee. The Bruins, with a 17-game winning
streak, were first in the Bowl Championship Series standings, but
should only drop to second behind the Buckeyes in today's new
rankings. The BCS determines the teams who will play in the Fiesta
Bowl, with the national title on the line, on Jan. 4.
	   The other top teams had easier times remaining perfect.
	   In Bloomington, Ind., Joe Germaine threw for 351 yards and three
TDs as Ohio State (8-0, 5-0 Big Ten) breezed to a 38-7 win over
Indiana.
	   In Columbia, S.C., Tee Martin set three NCAA records by hitting
23-of-24 passes (95.8 percent) for 315 yards and four TDs to lead
Tennessee (7-0, 5-0 SEC) to a 49-14 rout of South Carolina.
	   In Lawrence, Kan., Michael Bishop accounted for two TDs and 320
yards as fourth-ranked Kansas State (8-0, 5-0 Big 12) clobbered
Kansas 54-6.
	   Even on a day Texas ended Nebraska's 47-game home winning streak
with a 20-16 upset, the focus was on how the Bruins, 28{-point
favorites, got into trouble against Stanford (1-7, 0-5)
	   Before a Rose Bowl crowd of 64,820, UCLA wasn't thinking bowls
or polls. Trailing 24-14 in the fourth quarter, the Bruins got TD
runs of 2 yards by Keith Brown and 8 yards by DeShaun Foster (with
8:05 left) to take the lead.
	   Then the nail-biting began.
	   Todd Husak, who was 25-of-45 for 419 yards and a TD, hit Jeff
Allen in full stride over the middle. As Allen raced to the end
zone for the go-ahead score, cornerback Marques Anderson reached in
from behind, caused a fumble at the 2 and the Bruins recovered in
the end zone for a touchback.
	   Stanford had one more chance when it moved to the UCLA 35 with
13 seconds left, but Travor Turner sacked Husak on the game's final
play.
	   ``We're a team that knows how to win,'' cornerback Ryan Roques
said. ``We have an urgency not to lose.''
	   In other games, it was No. 5 Florida 38, No. 19 Georgia 7; No. 6
Florida State 39, North Carolina 13; No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M 17, Oklahoma
State 6; No. 9 Penn State 27, Illinois 0; No. 10 Arizona 38, No. 21

Minnesota 10; No. 23 Georgia Tech 31, Maryland 14; and No. 24 Miami
35, Boston College 17.
 &UR; No. 2 Tennessee 49, South Carolina 14 &QC; 
	   Martin set an NCAA record by completing 95.8 percent of his
throws against the Gamecocks, beating the mark of 92.6 percent
(25-of-27) set by UCLA's Rick Neuheisel in 1983. Martin also set
NCAA records for consecutive completions in one game (23) and two
games (24).
	   South Carolina (1-8, 0-7) lost its eighth straight.
 &UR; No. 5 Florida 38, No. 19 Georgia 7 &QC; 
	   In Jacksonville, Fla., Doug Johnson threw for two first-quarter
TDs, ran for another and caught a TD pass as the Gators avenged
last year's loss to the Bulldogs.
	   Florida (7-1, 5-1 SEC) stayed one game behind Tennessee in the
chase for the SEC East title. Georgia fell to 6-2, 4-2.
 &UR; No. 6 Florida St. 39, North Carolina 13 &QC; 
	   In Tallahassee, Fla., Chris Weinke passed for 338 yards and two
TDs as the Seminoles (8-1, 5-1 ACC) won their seventh straight.
	   Weinke had TD passes of 56 yards to Peter Warrick and 49 yards
to Laveranues Coles in the fourth quarter, just after the Tar Heels
(3-4, 2-2) scored their first TD against FSU in three years.
 &UR; No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M 17, Oklahoma St. 6 &QC; 
	   In Stillwater, Okla., Chris Taylor caught a TD pass and set up
another score with a long kickoff return for the Aggies (8-1, 5-0
Big 12).
 &UR; No. 9 Penn St. 27, Illinois 0 &QC; 
	   In State College, Pa., Kevin Thompson (19-of-26 for 269 yards)
set up two TDs with long passes to Chafie Fields and threw for a
10-yard score to Corey Jones _ all in the first half _ for the
Nittany Lions (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten).
 &UR; No. 10 Arizona 38, No. 21 Oregon 3 &QC; 
	   In Tucson, Ariz., Trung Canidate ran 71 yards for a TD and
finished with 180 yards on 17 carries as the Wildcats (8-1, 4-1
Pac-10) scored TDs on their first four possessions of the second
half. The Ducks fell to 6-2, 3-2.
 &UR; No. 11 Arkansas 24, Auburn 21 &QC; 
	   In Auburn, Ala., the Razorbacks (7-0, 4-0 SEC) overcame five
turnovers and held on against the Tigers when Eric Branch scored
the go-ahead TD on a 14-yard run in the third quarter.
 &UR; No. 12 Virginia 38, Wake Forest 17 &QC; 
	   In Winston-Salem, N.C., Thomas Jones rushed for 142 yards and a
TD as the Cavaliers (7-1, 5-1 ACC) beat the Demon Deacons for the
15th straight time.
 &UR; No. 13 Notre Dame 27, Baylor 3 &QC; 
	   In South Bend, Ind., Autry Denson rushed for a career-best 189
yards and a TD for the Irish 6-1). Denson had runs of 37, 32 and 24
yards as Notre Dame ran for 329 yards _ its highest total in two
seasons.
 &UR; No. 20 Texas, No. 14 Nebraska 16 &QC; 
	   In Lincoln, Neb., Ricky Williams helped his Heisman Trophy
chances by running for 150 yards, and Major Applewhite threw a
2-yard TD pass with 2:47 left as the revived Longhorns (6-2, 4-1
Big 12) ended the Huskers' home winning streak.
	   Nebraska (7-2, 3-2), last loss at home on Sept. 21, 1991, when
Washington won 36-21. And the last time a visiting player had more
yards rushing against Nebraska was when Barry Sanders had 189 in
his Heisman season of '88.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian soldier standing guard at a spy academy
in the Russian capital deserted with his Kalashnikov assault rifle
and ammunition, police said Monday.
	   Pvt. Konstantin Murzin deserted his post at the Chief
Intelligence Directorate, known under its Russian acronym, GRU,
late on Sunday. The motives behind his action weren't immediately
clear, Moscow police said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   A search for Murzin was under way.
	   Desertions and shootings have become increasingly common in the
cash-strapped and demoralized Russian military. Many have been
linked to widespread, vicious hazing of young conscripts by older
soldiers.

protests &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Officials said Monday they are
concerned about possible protests against President Joseph Estrada
at the forthcoming Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum leaders'
meeting in Malaysia.
	   The officials, however, said they are confident Malaysian
authorities can adequately protect Estrada and the other leaders
and can prevent incidents that could embarrass both Malaysia and
the participants.
	   A Presidential Security Group official said the security
concerns have not prompted them to increase the number of security
personnel that would accompany Estrada to the Nov. 17-18 APEC
summit in Malaysia, as reported by a Manila newspaper.
	   ``We are anticipating some situations but the usual security
arrangements are being made,'' said the PSG official, who asked not
to be named.
	   ``We don't want to be embarrassed and we expect the same
treatment from the Malaysian side, like the way we secured the
leaders during the APEC summit here. There's no problem,'' said the
official.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Estrada's entourage
would be limited to between 50 and 70 people with vital roles,
including security personnel.
	   Estrada has been vocal in supporting jailed Malaysian dissident
Anwar Ibrahim, who was sacked by Malaysian Prime Minister Mohamad
Mahathir as his deputy last September and later jailed on charges
of corruption and sexual misconduct.
	   Anwar has denied the charges and claimed he was beaten while in
police custody. On Monday, a Malaysian court Anwar's trial.
	   Estrada has called for a fair trial and respect for the rights
of Anwar, whom he describes as a personal friend. He also initially
considered boycotting the APEC summit to protest Anwar's arrest.
	   The Philippine leader's comments have been resented by many
Malaysians. Last month, Malaysian protesters picketed the
Philippine Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, lambasting Estrada for
allegedly meddling in Malaysian affairs.

Witness in major drug investigation under army protection
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A low-ranking soldier who alleged that
an army general and three well-known politicians are members of a
notorious narcotics gang has been placed in a top security army
prison to ensure his safety, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Lance Cpl. Vitoon Klinkachorn is a key witness in a major
investigation of alleged links between drug kingpin Surachai ``Bang
Ron'' Ngernthongfoo and the major general and politicians.
	   The Bangkok Post said the corporal had turned himself in to
authorities because he feared the major-general and the politicians
would have him killed.
	   He admitted that he was a member of a ring run by Surachai.
	   The names of the politicians and the army general have not been
disclosed.
	   Army commander Gen. Surayud Chulanont has stated that Vitoon's
confession was a major breakthrough in the investigation and has
ordered all concerned to ensure his safety.
	   Last month, three gang members were arrested when more than
700,000 amphetamine pills were seized at Surachai's suburban home
after a brief shoot-out with about 50 police officers.
	   A number of high-profile cases involving Thai military officers
engaging in drug trafficking, illegal logging, extortion and other
criminal activities have surfaced in the past year.
	   Surayud, who took over the army chief's post last month, has
vowed to clean up the forces and go after officers involved in
illegal activities.

First Hawaiian Bank's parent merges and takes new name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONOLULU (AP) _ First Hawaiian Inc., the parent company of First
Hawaiian Bank, merged Sunday with BancWest Corp. to create a dlrs
14.7 billion financial services company with operations in five
Western states.
	   First Hawaiian is the surviving company, but will change its
name to BancWest and be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It
will remain headquartered in Honolulu.
	   The new BancWest's major subsidiaries _ First Hawaiian Bank and
Bank of the West _ will continue to operate as separately.
	   The old BancWest Corp. was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banque
Nationale de Paris. Former First Hawaiian stockholders own 55
percent of the common equity of the new BancWest, while Banque
Nationale de Paris owns 45 percent.
	   First Hawaiian Bank has 63 branches in Hawaii, Guam and the
Northern Mariana Islands. Bank of the West has 104 branches in
Northern and Central California.
	   Pacific One Bank, which was also a subsidiary of First Hawaiian,
has 40 branches in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. It is being merged
into Bank of the West, and the two will begin operating as one bank
in February.
	   ``This geographical diversification is a defining moment in our
company's 140-year history, but for customers in Hawaii and on the
West Coast, it's business as usual at our branches,'' said Walter
Dods Jr., chairman and chief executive of the new BancWest.

Car of Rabin assassin's family set on fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car belonging to the family of Yitzhak
Rabin's assassin was set on fire as Israel marked the third
anniversary of the prime minister's death, police said Monday.
	   The Volkswagen beetle was parked outside the home of assassin
Yigal Amir's parents in the coastal town of Herzliya on Sunday when
it was torched. No one was injured.
	   Amir is serving a life term in prison for killing Rabin at a
peace rally on Nov. 4, 1995.
	   Israel marked the anniversary of Rabin's death on Sunday, going
by the Hebrew calendar. Rallies and memorial services were held
throughout the country.
	   The anniversary was accompanied by anguished debate on whether
there could be another political killing in Israel. Concern grew
last week after ultranationalists opposed to the
Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security agreement labeled Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a traitor.
	   Rabin was attacked in a similar fashion in the weeks leading up
to his assassination, and Amir said he killed Rabin for handing
land to the Palestinians.

Dollar lower, Japanese stocks climb
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks closed sharply higher Monday,
boosted by word of a possible alliance between Japan's two largest
banks. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen for the fourth
consecutive session.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 388.24
points, or 2.86 percent, closing at 13,952.75. On Friday, the
average had fallen 104.21 points, or 0.76 percent.
	   Traders said investors pushed up heavily weighted banking shares
after Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. said Saturday
that they may form a strategic alliance in trust banking
operations.
	   The news boosted investors' hopes that other banks might follow
suit in a bid to improve their business.
	   The proposed merger is the first between Japan's top lenders,
but only the latest effort to cope with increased competition, a
recessionary economy and bad loans.
	   ``Banks are taking the lead,'' said Yasuo Ueki, a general
manager at Nikko Securities.
	   Banking issues jumped 5.17 percent on the Nikkei.
	   Fuji, the most actively traded issue Monday, gained 53 yen (46
cents), or 12 percent, at 499 yen (dlrs 4.30), while Dai-Ichi
Kangyo gained 59 yen (50 cents), or 8.3 percent, to 774 yen (dlrs
6.70).
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section of the stock exchange climbed 30.24 points, or 2.92
percent, to 1,065.84. It had slipped 1.50 points, or 0.41 percent,
Friday.
	   Volume on the first section was estimated at 373 million shares,
up from 362.36 million Friday. Advances outnumbered retreats 837 to
237, with 193 issues unchanged.
	   Meanwhile, the dollar bought 115.70 yen in late afternoon, down
0.38 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below its New York
level of 116.14 yen late Friday. It now has lost a total of 3.66
yen in the last four trading days in Tokyo.
	   On Monday, it ranged between 114.50 yen and 116.05 yen,
rebounding somewhat in the afternoon from morning losses on
short-covering by overseas players, traders said.
	   The dollar's slide came amid expectations of further cuts in
U.S. interest rates. Lower rates make interest-bearing securities
less attractive and tend to reduce demand for a country's currency.
	   The Group of Seven industrialized nations' endorsement last week
of reforms in Brazil, seen as good news for emerging markets,
including those in Asia, also pressured the dollar, traders said.
	   Japanese dealers mostly stayed on the sidelines ahead of a
national holiday Tuesday, when financial markets will be closed.
Regular trading resumes Wednesday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond stood at 0.825 percent, up from Friday's close of
0.820 percent, driving its price down to 108.68 yen from 108.73
yen.

Jewish group uses race laws to seek withdrawal of Internet
</HEADLINE>
material &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A Jewish group said Monday it is
seeking the removal of ``malicious anti-Jewish propaganda'' from an
Internet website and an apology from its operator.
	   The Executive Council of Australia Jewry has complained to the
New South Wales state Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
about a site posted by the Adelaide Institute and is seeking a
declaration that the institute has breached the Racial
Discrimination Act by publishing allegedly anti-Jewish material.
	   The case is the first time Australia's national race
discrimination laws have been tested in relation to the Internet.
	   The website contains a series of anti-Semitic statements, ``most
of it in the nature of Holocaust denial,'' council vice president
and lawyer Peter Wertheim said.
	   ``But there are other things there as well about the Jewish
religion, Jewish people, Jewish history which really amount to a
stream of derogatory generalizations about the Jewish people,'' he
said.
	   At a commission hearing Monday, proceedings had hardly begun
before institute director Frederick Toben stormed out after an
exchange with commissioner Kathleen McEvoy.
	   Toben took exception to what he claimed was the refusal of the
commission to accept the ``truth as a defense,'' and walked out
after McEvoy questioned the contents of a document Toben wanted to
present to the commission.
	   The document argued there had not been a systematic
extermination of European Jewry in gas chambers during World War
II.
	   ``If the truth cannot be heard, the lie must prevail,'' Toben
said before storming out.
	   It was the second time Toben had walked out of a commission
hearing. The commission will now make its determination without
taking evidence from Toben.
	   Wertheim said Toben's walkout was grandstanding. ``He's done it
once before and it's simply a refusal to face the real issues,'' he
said.
	   The Adelaide Institute was privately funded by Toben and had no
legitimate accreditation, Wertheim said.
	   ``It is a very respectable sounding name behind which, in our
view, lurks a nakedly racist organization,'' he said.
	   The council is seeking a public apology, removal of the website
material, and an order preventing future Internet publication of
similar material by the institute.

Mounties asked to hunt for Swiss murderer suspect in Rockies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JASPER, Alberta (AP) _ Swiss authorities have asked the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police to search in the Rocky Mountain region for
the prime suspect in one of the worst mass murders in Switzerland's
history.
	   Based on an anonymous tip, Swiss authorities believe Carl Arnold
Bernhardt Doser, 51, might be hiding in a Rocky Mountain community.
	   Doser is wanted in the murders of five people _ three adults and
two children _ who were shot to death in Solothurn, Switzerland, in
June 1976.
	   ``The murders are still quite a hot topic in Switzerland,'' said
RCMP Const. Stephen Pavlov, who agreed to help investigate the
possible sighting of Doser.
	   All five victims were shot at close range by a rifle and Doser
was a suspect at the time. He was later released for lack of
evidence.
	   Two years ago, police discovered the murder weapon _ a rifle
registered in Doser's name _ and Swiss television ran reports about
the crime.
	   A Swiss viewer recognized Doser from the program as a man he had
bumped into twice as a tourist in Canada.
	   He wrote an anonymous letter to investigators saying he
remembered the man clearly because he spoke a specific Swiss
dialect of German and said he couldn't return to Switzerland
because he was wanted.
	   The tourist said he first met the man in June 1995 at Hamkin
Falls in B.C.'s Wells Grey Provincial Park and saw him again in
Jasper in 1996.
	   He didn't make the connection to Doser until he saw the TV
program.
	   Even though the last sighting was two years ago, Swiss police
are desperate to warm up the murder trail.
	   ``Swiss authorities are grasping at straws,'' said Pavlov.
``We're grasping at straws too.''

Times are tough, but Water Festival draws thousands

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Money may be short and political
tensions high, but that didn't stop thousands of Cambodians from
paying homage to the mighty Mekong River and ancient glories in the
annual Water Festival Monday.
	   More than 300 long, sleek traditional boats, each with some 30
rowers, competed before crowds gathered along the festive riverbank
in front of the Royal Palace.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath were scheduled to
attend the opening of the three-day festival along with strongman
Hun Sen, the key political rival of the king's son, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
	   Security was tight, with armed police and soldiers present at
every street corner in the area of the celebrations.
	   Assassination attempts, extra-judicial killings and bitter
rivalries have marked the political scene following an inconclusive
election in July. The economy is barely staggering along.
	   But there was brisk business at makeshift riverside stalls
selling food, drinks, toys and even condoms. Stages were readied
for shows and other entertainment.
	   ``This event is held every year to pay our gratitude to the
Mekong River for its contribution of fertility to the country's
agriculture,'' said Vann Seng Ly, a member of the festival's
organizing committee.
	   The festival celebrates one of Southeast Asia's most remarkable
natural phenomena.
	   Swelled by melting snows and monsoon rains, the Mekong backs up
and sends water rushing up the Tonle Sap tributary to Cambodia's
Great Lake. The lake expands enormously, becoming a major source of
fish and water for irrigation.
	   The Great Lake normally reaches its maximum extent in October,
when the water begins to recede and the tributary reverses its flow
toward the Mekong, leaving behind fertile sediment.
	   The boat races associated with the festival recall the powerful
navy of King Jayavarman II, the 9th century founder of the great
Angkorian Empire.
	   The festival was revived in the early 1990s after a lapse of
nearly two decades when Cambodia suffered through war, the Khmer
Rouge reign of terror and other conflicts.
	   It was not clear how much the cash-strapped government was
spending on the event, but Seng Ly said regardless of costs the
event will proceed for the full three days.
	   ``It is hard not to celebrate the event as the people are
strongly attached to it,'' he said.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ There is sand where Edna Elizabeth
Sanchez's house used to be. There are also a few bricks and a rusty
tin roof panel, but mostly just sand.
	   Sanchez's family of 15 left their belongings behind Friday as
the flooded Choluteca River, fueled by rains from Hurricane Mitch,
threatened their home.
	   On Sunday they returned to see what they could salvage.
	   ``Nothing. Nothing. Here exactly was my house. There's nothing
left,'' she said.
	   Sanchez wept as she spoke, but her family just stared blankly at
the river. The brown current was stronger than usual, but still
tame enough for women to wash their clothes in it.
	   Just two days earlier, the river surged over its banks, smashing
through houses and bridges, tossing cars as if they were toys, and
killing what officials say may be hundreds of people. By early
today, the death toll throughout Honduras stood at 246 people.
	   In all of Central America, at least 1,005 were confirmed dead
from the monstrous storm, and that number was expected to climb.
	   Residents of Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, stopped along
the river banks to see the damage for themselves. Taking advantage
of a precious day of sunshine Sunday, they stared at the pickup
trucks almost completely buried in mud, the houses dangling off
cliffs formed by landslides, and the remnants of bridges washed
away in the river.
	   Even if they hadn't lost their homes, just about all of the
capital's 1 million residents had been affected by the storm.
Potable water is scarce, electricity and telephone service spotty,
and schools are closed indefinitely.
	   In another blow, the city's popular mayor, Cesar Castellanos,
was killed in a helicopter accident along with three other people
Sunday afternoon while examining storm damage. Officials believe
mechanical failure was the cause.
	   For Tegucigalpa, the hurricane has brought out the best and
worst of its residents.
	   The worst has been reports of widespread looting. Soldiers
recently joined police in patrolling the city's streets, but there
still wasn't enough security to protect all the evacuated houses
and businesses.
	   David Wernet of Springfield, Massachusetts., who is attending
college in Tegucigalpa, said he watched from his window as thieves
stole at will.
	   ``You could see the same people come back four or five times,''
he said.
	   The best of the city has been the relief efforts.
	   Arnold Aviles and two friends organized a network to distribute
food. About 17,000 meals were delivered on Saturday and more were
being delivered on Sunday.
	   All the food was contributed by local businesses and residents.
But much of the preparation was handled by foreign volunteers who
found themselves stranded in Tegucigalpa.
	   Among them were 21 volunteers from the Tarrytown United
Methodist Church in Austin, Texas. They were building a library in
northern Honduras when the storm forced them to evacuate.
	   Unable to get a flight back to the United States, they offered
their services not only in preparing the food, but also helping out
at their hotel _ doing laundry, for example, said Robert Durkee, a
leader of the group.
	   Hotels, like many businesses, had problems getting employees
into work during the storm.
	   ``If we hadn't been helping, we'd just be sitting around,''
Durkee said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese sales of new cars, trucks and buses fell
17.1 percent in October compared to the same month last year to
322,556 vehicles as a result of a slump in the overall economy, the
Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said Monday.
	   The latest figures mark the 19th consecutive month of declines,
the association said.
	   Sales of passenger cars fell 14.0 percent on the year to 237,912
units, while truck sales slid 24.8 percent to 83,718 units. Bus
sales dropped 8.0 percent to 926 units.
	   All of Japanese 11 major automakers posted lower sales in
October.
	   By manufacturers, Japan's largest automaker, Toyota Motor Corp.,
posted a 16.9 percent decline on the year in October sales to
141,217 vehicles.
	   Second-largest maker Nissan Motor Co. saw a 13.6 percent
decrease in sales to 61,829 units and Honda Motor Co.'s sales
plunged 28.1 percent to 35,004 vehicles.
	   Meanwhile, sales of imported cars fell 21.9 percent on the year
to 19,543 units.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moody's Investors Service said Monday it has placed
under review for possible downgrade the senior long-term debt
ratings of Japan's nine electric power companies.
	   The New York-based ratings agency said deregulation of the
industry in Japan and the opening up of the power market make the
earnings prospects of the companies uncertain.
	   Moody's placed under review its triple-A long-term debt ratings
on Tokyo Electric Power Co., Kansai Electric Power Co. and Chubu
Electric Power Co.
	   The double-A1 ratings on other Japanese electric power companies
have also been placed under review.
	   These companies are Hokkaido Electric Power Co., Tohoku Electric
Power Co., Hokuriku Electric Power Co., Chugoku Electric Power Co.,
Shikoku Electric Power Co. and Kyushu Electric Power Co.
	   The Moody's decision affects a total of about 12 trillion yen
(dlrs 103 billion) in long-term debt.
	   The review was prompted by concern the deregulation measures
currently under discussion by the Japanese government may lead to
changes in the currently favorable operating environment for the
industry, Moody's said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and Chase Manhattan
Bank of the United States will jointly develop a dollar-denominated
investment trust for sale in Japan, a Sumitomo spokesman said
Monday.
	   The agreement comes just one month before Japan lifts a ban on
selling investment trusts _ Japan's version of mutual funds _ at
bank counters on Dec. 1, Sumitomo Trust said.
	   The Sumitomo-Chase deal will be the first case of a Japanese
bank developing a foreign currency-denominated mutual fund, said
Sumitomo Trust spokesman Noriyuki Hashimoto. The trust will be in
U.S. dollars.
	   The new fund, to be sold through Sumitomo Trust's branches
across Japan, will be managed by Chase Manhattan Management, an
asset-management division of the New York-based Chase Manhattan
Bank group, Hashimoto said.
	   The fund will mainly be invested in highly rated debt
instruments such as U.S. Treasury Bills, Hashimoto said. The
minimum purchase amount will be dlrs 3,000, he said.
	   The agreement followed a customer survey in May that showed
Sumitomo Trust's depositors are interested in investing in foreign
mutual funds, while seeking stable and low-risk returns from the
funds, Hashimoto said.
	   As Japan's ``Big Bang'' financial deregulation is now under way,
major banks and financial companies are seen entering the mutual
fund market to take a part of Japanese personal assets worth an
estimated 1,200 trillion yen (dlrs 10.43 trillion).

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Steel, mining and energy giant BHP Co.
Ltd. on Monday ended months of speculation about a new chief
executive by announcing the appointment of American Paul Anderson
to the post.
	   Anderson, 53, currently the president and chief operating
officer of U.S. power company Duke Energy Corp., will take up his
new appointment next month.
	   He said Monday his focus would be on creating wealth for BHP
shareholders and restoring confidence in the diversified mining
group.
	   Anderson will also become BHP's managing director and a member
of the board.
	   He replaces John Prescott, whose resignation following criticism
by investors about BHP's poor profit performance and investment
decisions took effect on April 7.
	   BHP management has been under fire for more than a year,
following Australian dollars 4 billion (U.S. dlrs 2.4 billion) in
asset writedowns in two years and a net loss of Australian dollars
1.47 billion (U.S. dlrs 900 million) for the 12 months to May 31,
1998.
	   Chairman Jerry Ellis bowed to shareholder pressure earlier this
year, announcing he would retire in the first half of 1999. He will
be replaced by National Australia Bank Ltd. managing director Don
Argus.
	   Anderson is president, chief operating officer and a member of
the board of Duke Energy Corp., based in Charlotte, North Carolina.
He also serves on the boards of Kerr-McGee Corp., Baker Hughes
Inc., Temple-Inland Inc. and TEPPCO Partners LP.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Faltering state enterprise reforms, summer floods
and the Asian financial crisis have thrust China's economy into
``an unprecedented grim situation,'' according to an economist at a
top government think tank.
	   Hou Yongzhi of the Development Research Center, which operates
under China's State Council, or cabinet, made the frank assessment
in a speech Monday to a conference in Beijing.
	   Like other Chinese officials, Hou stopped short of warning that
China's economy faces a slump similar to those in other Asian
countries. Last week, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman and
central bank chief both refuted speculation that China may be on
the verge of an economic meltdown.
	   Hou said 8 percent economic growth this year was still possible
_ a pace outstripping growth elsewhere in the region. The
Development Research Center forecasts growth at 7.9 percent in
1998, increasing to 8.3 percent next year.
	   To help reach the 8 percent growth target thought to be
necessary to absorb workers laid off from downsizing state-run
factories, the government has ordered banks to lend more money and
has poured investment into infrastructure and other construction
projects.
	   Hou said it was unclear how much help the private sector could
provide, since overseas Chinese in crisis-stricken Asia are a main
source of financing.
	    &UR; _____
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Asian economic crisis is hitting
Vietnam's tourism industry hard, with the number of foreign
arrivals forecast to decline this year, local press reported
Monday.
	   Competition from other countries in the region has gotten
tougher, and a hotel construction boom has created a glut in the
market. A number of projects are on hold.
	   Following a boom in the mid-1990s, Vietnam expects 1.5 million
foreign arrivals this year, compared with 1.7 million in 1997, the
New Hanoi newspaper said. Of those, an estimated 41 percent are
tourists.
	   Vietnam had only 250,000 foreign arrivals in 1990. The figure
boomed to 1 million in 1994, but the rapid growth has slowed
dramatically, with only a 6.7 percent increase last year.
	   The government has set a target of 2 million foreign arrivals by
2000. That will be difficult to achieve, given strong competition
from neighboring countries and the very low rate of tourists coming
to Vietnam more than once.

 &UR; NICARAGUA: Death toll rises along western Caribbean coasts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Rescue workers on on their way to a
town in northern Nicaragua that was hit by massive mudslides,
killing at least 58 and pushing the death toll of former hurricane
Mitch nearly 500.
	   More than 2,400 people living in the 10 communities at the foot
of the Casitas Volcano were still unaccounted for, Mayor Felicita
Zeledon of Posoltega told the government's Radio Nicaragua. She
said 58 bodies had been pulled from the mud in her town, about 50
miles northwest of Managua.
	   ``It is like a desert littered with buried bodies,'' Zeledon
said, citing reports from rescue workers.
	   A woman who claimed to have survived the mudslides told Radio
Nicaragua on Sunday morning that she had seen thousands of bodies.
	   ``In the patios of the orchards there are many unburied
bodies,'' said Mercedes Rodriguez Zapata, who claimed to have left
the area Saturday and traveled to the capital of Managua on
horseback and on foot. ``An epidemic is feared.''
 &UR; SURINAME: Guyana and Suriname to reopen negotiations in border
dispute
	   PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) _ The presidents of Suriname and
Guyana have agreed to reopen negotiations in a dispute over a
triangle of land deep in the South American jungle.
	   In a statement signed Saturday, Surinamese President Jules
Wijdenbosch and Guyanese President Janet Jagan promised to
reactivate a commission created in the early 1990s to debate the
future of the land between the Curini River and New River about 200
miles (320 kilometers) from the Atlantic coast.
	   Jagan was in Paramaribo to discuss progress on economic
development pacts between the two nations.
	   Leaders of both countries made similar promises in 1996, but a
meeting of the commission was postponed repeatedly and finally
canceled.
	   The dispute centers on which river is the headwaters of the
Courentyne River, the boundary between the two countries. A
triangle about 125 miles (200 kilometers) wide at the southern end
and 20 miles (30 kilometers) wide in the north lies between the two
tributaries.
	   Suriname, then a Dutch territory, built a scientific observation
post in the disputed area in the 1940s. The Guyanese army seized
the outpost in 1968, two years after Guyana gained independence
from Britain. The area has been under Guyana's control since then.
 &UR; BARBADOS: Jamaican PM urges Caribbean to band together on death
penalty
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Jamaica's prime minister is urging
Caribbean countries to band together to defend the death penalty
against international pressure to eliminate it.
	   During a speech to a convention of the ruling Barbados Labor
Party on Saturday, P.J. Patterson said the 15-member Caribbean
Community should send a resolution supporting the death penalty to
the United Nations, the Organization of American States and the
British Privy Council, the supreme court for most former British
colonies in the region.
	   ``We cannot allow any ... power to dictate what should be our
law and what should be the penalties,'' Patterson said.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook has urged Caribbean
countries to abandon the death penalty, and international watchdog
groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have increased
their own lobbying.
	   Caribbean countries have accused the Privy Council of trying to
restrict executions with a 1993 ruling that it is inhumane to keep
any prisoner on death row for more than five years. The ruling
effectively overturned the death sentences of dozens of convicts.
	   Jamaica and Trinidad have also accused the OAS' Interamerican
Human Rights Commission, an international appeals tribunal, of
delaying reviews of death-sentence cases.
 &UR; CUBA: Police crack down on crime in Cuban capital
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Cuba's National Revolutionary Police banged on the
apartment door at 4 a.m. They roused a pair of prostitutes and
their foreign clients out of their rented rooms and hauled them
down to the station.
	   Then, in an unusual move in a country that has recently
tolerated prostitution, three neighbors who were renting rooms to
hookers were accused of pandering. A dozen people, including the
men who brought the couples to the informal bordello, were charged.
	   ``I didn't ask them what they were going to do. I just rented
the rooms,'' said one of those charged, Maria Garcia, 71, a former
rebel who spent nine months in the Sierra Maestra mountains during
the revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power in 1959.
	   Free on $2,000 bail until she goes to trial, Garcia could face
up to eight years in prison.
	   Cuban police in recent weeks have cracked down on crime in
Havana, which had seen growing hordes of prostitutes and a surge in
violent acts such as robbery and murder.
	   The streetwalkers who once swarmed around tourist locales and
the shadowy men offering cheap cigars and independent taxis have
all but disappeared from the streets.
	   Dozens of new white Peugot police cars patrol nightly, stopping
suspicious vehicles and ordering any prostitutes still bold enough
to go outside to return home.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Lawmaker proposes law allowing Cubans in Major
Leagues
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ U.S. Rep. Jose Serrano said he has
filed a bill allowing Cuban baseball players to participate in the
North American major leagues without defecting from the communist
country.
	   Serrano, a Democrat from New York, told the Associated Press
Saturday his measure would allow the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to grant work visas similar to those given to players from
other countries. The visas would expire annually after the World
Series.
	   The Cubans would remain permanent residents and citizens of
their own country. Serrano said he believes current U.S. law, which
permits only defectors to work in the United States, is unfair.
	   ``If a Cuban player comes to the United States and says, `I have
no problems with my country, with my government _ I'm coming to
play baseball,' ... then they won't let him play,'' Serrano said.
	   Serrano said other lawmakers have warned him they oppose the
measure because they fear players' pay would be confiscated by the
communist government, which severely limits how much its citizens
can earn.
	   On Friday, Cuba's government news agency quoted sports minister
Humberto Rodriguez as saying President Fidel Castro's government
would consider allowing players to play in the major leagues ``as
long as it respects the principles of Cuban socialist sports.''

Israeli suspect in killing of Palestinian turns himself in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ An Israeli suspect in the killing of a
Palestinian farmer surrendered to police Monday.
	   Security forces had been searching for a week Gur Hamel, who is
believed to have bludgeoned to death Palestinian Mohammed Zalout as
the farmer worked in his West Bank olive grove on Oct. 26.
	   Zalout's body was found near the Jewish settlement of Itamar.
Israeli radio reports quoted Itamar settlers as saying that Hamel
was an extremist whose request to live in Itamar was turned down.
	   On Monday morning, Hamel surrendered to police at the Kfar Saba
station in central Israel. Legislator Benny Elon from the
ultra-nationalist Moledet party served as a mediator between Hamel
and the police.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuchin said Hamel was taken for
questioning.

Car of Rabin assassin's family set on fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A car belonging to the family of Yitzhak
Rabin's assassin was set on fire as Israel marked the third
anniversary of the prime minister's death, police said Monday.
	   The Volkswagen beetle was parked outside the home of assassin
Yigal Amir's parents in the coastal town of Herzliya on Sunday when
it was torched. No one was injured.
	   Amir is serving a life term in prison for killing Rabin at a
peace rally on Nov. 4, 1995.
	   Israel marked the anniversary of Rabin's death on Sunday, going
by the Hebrew calendar. Rallies and memorial services were held
throughout the country.
	   The anniversary was accompanied by anguished debate on whether
there could be another political killing in Israel. Concern grew
last week after ultranationalists opposed to the
Israeli-Palestinian land-for-security agreement labeled Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a traitor.
	   Rabin was attacked in a similar fashion in the weeks leading up
to his assassination, and Amir said he killed Rabin for handing
land to the Palestinians.

Investigator says elements of Indonesian military involved in
</HEADLINE>
riots &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Members of the Indonesian military
were involved in deadly riots that swept Jakarta in May and helped
oust former President Suharto, a chief investigator said Monday.
	   The disclosure is likely to further embarrass the military,
which is struggling to revamp its image amid evidence of widespread
abuses while the authoritarian Suharto was in power.
	   A report on riots in six cities compiled by a government-backed
team of investigators alleges that members of the military
instigated some of the violence, team member Bambang Widjojanto
said. The report was expected to be released this week.
	   ``We found that security forces were involved in several areas
where riots occurred,'' Bambang said in a telephone interview.
``However, we still don't know if it was the involvement of
individuals or the institution.''
	   The conclusion was based on extensive interviews with witnesses,
said Bambang, a human rights lawyer and chairman of the Indonesian
Legal Aid Institute.
	   Some witnesses have said they saw men with short, military-style
haircuts roaming Jakarta and other cities in trucks and urging
crowds to riot. Some of the men were armed.
	   Bambang did not speculate why members of the military would take
part in the riots. Some government opponents have alleged military
hard-liners wanted an excuse to crack down on dissent, a charge
that the government has vehemently denied.
	   As many as 1,200 people died in the riots in Jakarta, many of
them looters trapped in burning shopping malls.
	   Suharto's reform-minded successor, President B.J. Habibie,
formed the 18-member fact-finding team in July. Its members include
human rights activists, senior police officers, lawyers,
bureaucrats and community leaders.
	   The report also says that 52 ethnic Chinese women were raped or
sexually assaulted during the violence, according to a source close
to the investigation. The Chinese minority, which dominates the
economy, has been a frequent target of attacks as Indonesia endures
a period of prolonged economic hardship.
	   The report recommends that the government give financial
compensation to victims of the riots and that it monitor the
security forces for any abuses with greater thoroughness, said the
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The report urges the government to prosecute rioters as well as
military officials who were implicated in the kidnapping of
political activists earlier this year. Ten members of Indonesia's
special forces, known as Kopassus, have been arrested.
	   Suharto's son-in-law, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, was fired in
August because of his involvement in the abductions of nine
anti-government activists. The military has said it will
court-martial him.

Hamas activist identified as suicide bomber

	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ A 22-year-old Hamas activist was
identified Monday as the suicide bomber who blew himself up near a
bus carrying Israeli school children in the Gaza Strip last week,
Palestinian police said.
	   The assailant was Suhib Timraz, a resident of the Jebaliya
refugee camp near Gaza City, said a Palestinian police official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Timraz was a low-level member in Hamas, police said.
	   Last Thursday, the assailant drove his car packed with
explosives into an Israeli convoy, killing an Israeli soldier and
himself. Forty children riding in an armored bus as part of the
convoy escaped unharmed.
	   Timraz' father was a leading figure in the Muslim brotherhood, a
forerunner of Hamas, and was arrested by Israeli security forces in
1983, along with Hamas founder Sheik Ahmed Yassin, police said. The
elder Timraz was released in 1985 as part of a prisoner swap.
	   Yassin was placed under house arrest several hours after
Thursday's bombing, as part of a crackdown on Hamas by the
Palestinian security forces.
	   Ismail Haniyeh, a leader of Hamas, on Monday distanced the group
from a leaflet in which the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, made unprecedented threats against Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   In the leaflet, Izzedine al Qassam said Arafat had ``reached the
point of treason'' by moving against Hamas in response to
Thursday's suicide bombing.
	   Hanieh said the leaflet was not issued by Hamas. He said the
group's policy is to avoid civil war at all costs.
	   It is not unusual for Hamas to issue conflicting statements
since the shadowy group is broken up into small cells that often
don't know of each others' activities.

FIFA team in Seoul to inspect preparations for 2002 World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A five-member delegation from FIFA,
soccer's world governing body, arrived in Seoul Monday to inspect
preparations for the 2002 World Cup, for which South Korea and
Japan are co-hosts.
	   The delegation, led by Antonio Matarrese, a FIFA vice president,
is scheduled to visit the sites in Seoul and several other cities
where South Korea plans to build stadiums for the first World Cup
ever held in Asia.
	   Ten South Korean cities, including Seoul, Pusan and Ulsan, have
applied to stage the South Korean portion of the World Cup. The
main stadium in Seoul is in the initial stage of construction.
	   On the basis of the delegation's findings, FIFA plans to fix the
host cities in South Korea and Japan by next May.
	   Because of a prolonged economic crisis, the South Korean
government wants to reduce the number of its host cities to six or
seven.
	   South Korea is lagging far behind in building stadiums. Most
candidate stadiums in Japan are either completed or under
construction.
	   FIFA rules say a nation must have a minimum of six venues to
play host for the cup. South Korea and Japan will each be host to
32 matches.

Protest in Indonesian capital targets U.S.-based mining company

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Dancing and playing traditional drums,
about 100 people from a remote Indonesian province protested Monday
against a U.S.-based mining company.
	   The demonstrators alleged that Freeport Indonesia, a unit of New
Orleans-based Freeport-McMoran Copper and Gold Inc., was exploiting
mineral-rich Irian Jaya.
	   Freeport operates the world's single largest copper and gold
deposit mine in the province in the western half of New Guinea.
	   Students from Irian Jaya rallied outside the attorney general's
office, saying Freeport had failed to adequately help out the poor
province while reaping the benefits of its natural resources.
	   ``There is financial support for the Irianese but it's only a
small amount after years of robbing our copper and gold,'' said
Hendrik Mansnembra, a protest organizer.
	   Mansnembra said Freeport had made little effort to negotiate
with the Irianese after three decades of mining in the eastern
Indonesian province.
	   Freeport pumps some money back into the local economy, and has
built schools and bridges. Critics say more aid is needed.
	   Freeport has long been shrouded in controversy due to its close
ties with the Indonesian government and perceived links with former
President Suharto, who quit in May after riots and protests forced
him to end 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   The attorney general's office is investigating the alleged
involvement of Indonesian senior economic minister Ginandjar
Kartasasmita in a 1991 share transaction between Freeport and an
Indonesian conglomerate, the Bakrie group.
	   The deal led to the renewal of Freeport's operating contract
with the Indonesian government that year.
	   Ginandjar, who was mines and energy minister at the time, has
rejected the allegations and says the deal was aboveboard.

Kuwaiti strategist calls for reconciliation with Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Kuwaiti strategist said in remarks published
Monday that his country should open the way for reconciliation with
Iraq _ its strong neighbor and former occupier _ in the first such
call since the end of the 1991 Gulf War.
	   But the views of Sami al-Faraj are not echoed the government of
this oil-rich Gulf state, where there is no trust in Iraqi leader
Saddam Hussein.
	   Al-Faraj believes Kuwait should propose to Baghdad a series of
``confidence-buiding'' measures which, if implemented, could be
followed by a peace treaty.
	   The strategist spoke at a closed-door seminar on Gulf security
organized last month by the independent daily Al-Qabas, which is
now publishing the proceedings in full.
	   ``If we still consider our neighbor a pest, isn't it wise to put
an end to this by directing the attention of this neighbor to the
common interests that bring us together,'' said al-Faraj, who heads
a private center for strategic studies.
	   His suggestions for ending the ``crisis-ridden relations'' with
Iraq included redeployment of Iraqi troops so as not to threaten
Kuwait, restrictions on Iraq's military powers, and cooperation
between Kuwaiti and Iraqi navies.
	   On the economic and political fronts, Baghdad must drop all
historic claims to Kuwait and stop teaching its children that
Kuwait is one of its provinces.
	   The exchange _ and benefit to Iraq _ would be revival of
pre-Gulf war economic joint projects and opening of Kuwait's ports
to Iraqis, al-Faraj said.
	   Conceding that this generation might never forget the horrors of
the 1990 Iraqi invasion, al-Faraj said ``national interest
considerations should be placed above the psychological effects''
of the seven-month Iraqi occupation.
	   He said Kuwait could not give up its demand for war reparations
and determining the fate of more than 600 Kuwaitis and other people
still missing.
	   However, it could be more flexible on other requests such as an
apology from the Iraqi regime for the invasion, al-Faraj said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of Malaysia's most
famous dissident, Anwar Ibrahim, began Monday with the defense
asking the judge to hold Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in
contempt of court for prejudging the case.
	   The politically charged corruption trial of Malaysia's one-time
heir apparent began amid tight security and under the scrutiny of
international human rights officials.
	   Riot police armed with automatic rifles blocked some 200
supporters of the ousted deputy prime minister from reaching the
courthouse. Demonstrations in support of Anwar have been held
regularly since his arrest Sept. 20.
	   Lawyers opened their defense by asking the judge to hold
Mahathir in contempt of court for saying publicly that Anwar should
be convicted.
	   ``You should hold this man for contempt,'' said Raja Aziz
Addruse, who leads a team of nine defense lawyers. Mahathir was
quoted in local papers last month as saying a conviction would help
preserve the ethnically diverse Southeast Asian country's racial
harmony.
	   Judge Augustine Paul began hearing arguments Monday on four
counts of corruption. Anwar will be tried later for one more charge
of abuse of power and five illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar has denied all 10 charges, saying they were politically
motivated. The 51-year-old politician has called on Mahathir to
step down after 17 years in power.
	   Mahathir, 72, says he fired his deputy on moral grounds because
homosexual acts are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia.
	   Defense lawyers asked for the charges to be struck down because
the special anti-corruption law used against Anwar was under review
by Parliament. Paul dismissed the request, saying the law was still
on the books.
	   Mahathir could be called as one of the 52 witnesses to testify
against Anwar, lawyers said.
	   ``His name is on the list. We believe he might be called,'' said
Kamar Ainiah, a defense lawyer, after the hearing adjourned until
Tuesday afternoon.
	   Anwar was brought into the courtroom through an underground
tunnel. He was pale and gaunt. His sister said he had lost nearly
20 pounds (9 kilograms) during the ordeal.
	   ``I am in good health,'' he told reporters from the dock, where
four policemen stood guard. He hugged his wife and children and was
later seen sharing a candy bar with his wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   He said prison life was not bad, relatively speaking.
	   ``They don't harass and beat me up.''
	   After the day's proceedings, Anwar appeared pessimistic.
	   ``I can't expect a fair trial,'' he said.
	   Anwar did not wear the neck brace he had sported during previous
court appearances. He had said he was assaulted by police on his
first night in custody, 18 days after Mahathir fired him.
	   Anwar's dismissal and his arrest have led to unprecedented
demonstrations by usually docile Malaysians. They have focused
attention on the issues of political dissent, freedom of expression
and human rights in this Southeast Asian country.
	   ``This is an excellent opportunity ... to prove that the legal
and judicial system isn't backward and lacking,'' Sulaiman
Abdullah, another defense lawyer, told the court.
	   More than 100 reporters and international observers hoping to
watch the legal proceedings milled about outside the court
building. The High Court faces Independence Square, where several
pro-Anwar protests have taken place.
	   London-based Amnesty International and the Human Rights Watch
were among the groups that sent representatives to observe the
trial.
	   ``We will totally monitor Anwar's trial to examine the nature
and basis of evidence brought against him and to assess the
proceedings in light of international standards on fair trial,''
said Amnesty's Mark Daly.
	   Although the judge dismissed pleas by the defense to accord
special status to observers, representatives of some rights groups
were allowed to sit in the public gallery.
	   ``The presence of these people here would interfere with the
exercise of (judicial) powers,'' said Paul.
	   Anwar faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each of the
corruption charges linked to his alleged abuse of power during his
tenure from 1993 until his dismissal on Sept. 2.
	   Each illegal sex charge is punishable by 20 years in prison and
a whipping with a rattan cane.
	   On Nov. 14, the court will break for more than one week as
Malaysia plays host to a meeting of 20 world leaders for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The trial was conducted partly in English and partly in the
local Malay language. Paul had initially ruled that the trial would
be conducted in English because of the interest abroad. But last
week, the chief justice ordered the trial to be conducted in the
language of majority Malays.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Ten people were confirmed dead and
another nine remained missing after two speedboats collided on a
river in Borneo, police said Monday.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted a local government
official as saying strong currents were hampering search efforts.
	   He doubted that any of the missing would be found alive.
	   The two boats collided in poor visibility Saturday with a total
of 92 passengers and crew aboard.
	   Police Cpl. Muryadi said 73 people were rescued on the Katingan
River, near Palangkaraya, about 880 kilometers (550 miles)
northwest of Jakarta.
	   Eleven survivors were hospitalized, he said. Ten bodies had been
recovered.
	   Immediately after the accident, police had feared the death toll
would be higher. However, many of those who were initially listed
as missing managed to swim to the river banks.
	   Speedboats are a common form of transport in parts of Borneo.

Armed men rob prescription medicine from Philippine warehouse

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Armed men wearing police shirts
raided the warehouse of the Philippines' biggest drug company and
took a vanload of prescription medicine, police said Monday.
	   Police said 12 to 15 men, carrying rifles and pistols, broke
into the warehouse of the Mercury Drug Corp. in suburban Quezon
City Saturday night, disarming and tying up five guards.
	   The men used a saw to cut through iron grills in a window and
enter a room where they took expensive prescription medicine.
Cartons of medicine were loaded in a company van, which the men
also took, police investigator Ramon Fernandez said.
	   Apparently nothing else was taken, Fernandez said.
	   The quantity and type of medicine taken by the robbers would be
known Tuesday when Mercury officials make an inventory, Fernandez
said, adding that he did not know if it included Viagra, an
anti-impotence drug introduced in the Philippines last week.

Tiger killed by bus on Malaysian highway
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A male tiger that had strayed on
to a highway was struck and killed by a speeding bus in the eastern
Malaysian state of Pahang, a wildlife official said Monday.
	   The Malayan tiger is an endangered species. Tiger hunts were
banned in Malaysia in 1972.
	   The tiger was killed Sunday while crossing the Genting-Karak
Highway, about 80 kilometers (50 miles) from the capital, Kuala
Lumpur, said Sivanathan Elagupillay, a tiger specialist in the
government's wildlife department.
	   The 130-kilogram (286-pound), 1.4-meter (4.6-foot) tiger was
crossing to look for food in a nearby forest, Sivanathan told The
Associated Press.
	   The department was notified Monday morning by local police and
highway authorities.
	   The tiger's whiskers, testicles, claws and teeth were missing
from the carcass, Sivanathan said.
	   Authorities believe the parts were stolen by local residents.
Tiger parts are widely used in Asia for traditional Chinese
medicines believed to cure a range of ailments from body aches to
impotency.
	   The Malaysian government estimates only 500 tigers are still
alive in the country, down from 5,000 in 1952. Many of the tiger
habitats have shrunk in recent years with the expansion of rubber
and palm oil plantations and with human encroachment.
	   In such areas, tigers have often attacked humans because their
normal prey, like deer and hogs, are depleted.

Mounties asked to hunt for Swiss murderer suspect in Rockies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JASPER, Alberta (AP) _ Swiss authorities have asked the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police to search in the Rocky Mountain region for
the prime suspect in one of the worst mass murders in Switzerland's
history.
	   Based on an anonymous tip, Swiss authorities believe Carl Arnold
Bernhardt Doser, 51, might be hiding in a Rocky Mountain community.
	   Doser is wanted in the murders of five people _ three adults and
two children _ who were shot to death in Solothurn, Switzerland, in
June 1976.
	   ``The murders are still quite a hot topic in Switzerland,'' said
RCMP Const. Stephen Pavlov, who agreed to help investigate the
possible sighting of Doser.
	   All five victims were shot at close range by a rifle and Doser
was a suspect at the time. He was later released for lack of
evidence.
	   Two years ago, police discovered the murder weapon _ a rifle
registered in Doser's name _ and Swiss television ran reports about
the crime.
	   A Swiss viewer recognized Doser from the program as a man he had
bumped into twice as a tourist in Canada.
	   He wrote an anonymous letter to investigators saying he
remembered the man clearly because he spoke a specific Swiss
dialect of German and said he couldn't return to Switzerland
because he was wanted.
	   The tourist said he first met the man in June 1995 at Helmcken
Falls in British Columbia's Wells Grey Provincial Park and saw him
again in Jasper in 1996.
	   He didn't make the connection to Doser until he saw the TV
program.
	   Even though the last sighting was two years ago, Swiss police
are desperate to warm up the murder trail.
	   ``Swiss authorities are grasping at straws,'' said Pavlov.
``We're grasping at straws too.''

While Yeltsin rests, critics launch new attacks

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Boris Yeltsin rested at a Black Sea resort,
his critics launched a new round of attacks against the president
Monday and again called for his resignation.
	   ``The president is not governing. He is not responding to the
citizens. He has degraded and is drinking so much that he is unable
to fulfill his duties,'' Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We insist on an immediate medical checkup of the president and
I'm sure the doctor's conclusion will be that which is already
known to the whole nation,'' he added.
	   Yeltsin began a two-week stay in southern resort of Sochi on
Friday, where he's recovering from what's been described as fatigue
and high blood pressure. The president had been working only
sporadically in recent weeks due to a variety of ailments.
	   His most recent illnesses have renewed concerns about Yeltsin's
ability to serve out his term, which runs until the middle of the
year 2000. The president insists he has no serious health problems.
	   A nationwide poll showed that only 3 percent of Russians had
confidence in Yeltsin, while 89 percent either lacked confidence in
the president, or were undecided.
	   No margin of error was given, but the results were in line with
other recent surveys, which also have put Yeltsin's approval rating
in the low single digits.
	   NTV television, which cited the poll Sunday evening, said it was
carried out by the independent Public Opinion Foundation. A total
of 1,500 people were surveyed.
	   Yeltsin has handed over some day-to-day duties to Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, the president's staff has said in recent days.
	   Yeltsin's Deputy Chief of Staff Oleg Sysuyev gave several
interviews on the subject last week, but said some of his remarks
were misinterpreted.
	   Britain's Financial Times quoted Sysuyev as saying that Yeltsin
would formally announce the transfer of some of his powers in a
speech to the parliament next year. Sysuyev, speaking on NTV on
Sunday evening, said that was inaccurate.
	   He said Yeltsin had given Primakov control over economic
questions, but claimed Yeltsin's political role will ``only be
strengthening.'' Yeltsin will concentrate on setting up guarantees
for fair elections and launching a constitutional reform, he said.
	   Sysuyev also lashed out at Zyuganov, saying the Kremlin intends
to sue him for calling Yeltsin a ``drunkard.''
	   Yeltsin's opponents long have accused the president of heavy
drinking _ claims he has denied.

South Korean student to return home from illegal visit to North
</HEADLINE>
Korea &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A militant South Korean student leader
will return home Tuesday after making an illegal visit to North
Korea, the North's media reported.
	   Hwang Son, a senior at Seoul's Duksong Women's University,
visited North Korea in August along with a male student leader to
promote national unification.
	   In a message sent to South Korea Monday, North Korea's Red Cross
Society requested safe passage for Hwang.
	   But South Korean officials have already said the two students
will be arrested when they return home from the unauthorized trip
to the North, defined as an enemy country under Seoul's national
security laws.
	   The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Monday that
Hwang will cross the heavily armed border at the truce village of
Panmunjom Tuesday afternoon.
	   It made no mention of the other South Korean student who
traveled to the North with Hwang and is believed to still be there.
	   About a dozen South Korean students, representing the nation's
most militant student group, Hanchongryon, have visited North Korea
in the past several years without government approval. All were
arrested when they returned and served brief prison terms.
	   The Koreas were divided into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. Their border is sealed and there are no
direct means of communication between them.
	   South Koreans and North Koreans are banned from traveling to the
other side without government approval, which is rarely given.

Death toll in Swedish fire rises to 62
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ After clinging to life for three days,
two youths trapped in a dance-hall fire died early Monday, bringing
the death toll in the inferno to 62.
	   With another 17 people still in intensive care, the grim figure
could still go higher in what is already Sweden's worst fire
disaster of modern times.
	   The dead, as young as 12 and none older than 20, were among an
estimated 400 people who were at a disco dance in a rented
second-floor hall when an explosive fire broke out shortly before
midnight Thursday.
	   The hall had been rented out for the night by the tenant, the
local association of Macedonian immigrants, to teen-agers who
arranged the dance.
	   The hall had a legal capacity of only 150 and officials say it
is possible that the arrangers who allowed the hall to be severely
overcrowded could be charged with contributing to others' deaths.
	   ''It's important that people have a clear understanding that the
authorities' approval of the premises was not a joke,'' chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren, who is leading the fire investigation, was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   However, Noren said, a decision on that question would wait
until the cause of the fire has been determined.
	   The fire's ferociously quick spread has prompted wide
speculation that it was set. But witnesses have given widely
varying accounts _ some saying it appeared to start in the
equipment used by the disc jockey and others saying there was smoke
coming up fom the emergency exit's stairway before the flames raced
through the hall.
	   The emergency exit was blocked by flames, forcing the panicked
dancers to try to flee down the one remaining stairway or leap out
of second-story windows.
	   Most of those at the dance were immigrants or children of
immigrant parents.

Conservationists urge tougher measures to protect Antarctic fish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Antarctic nations were urged Monday to
take drastic action against poachers who are depleting valuable
fishing stocks and killing thousands of sea birds.
	   As the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources started a weeklong meeting in Hobart,
conservationists said new figures showed poachers were out of
control.
	   The figures came from scientists who met last week to provide
expert advice to the representatives of the commission's 28 member
nations.
	   Greenpeace said illegal fishing, mainly by Norwegians, South
Americans and Spaniards, was at crisis level.
	   Greenpeace and Humane Society International both urged the
commission to require all legal fishing boats to carry satellite
monitoring systems, to insist that all member countries deny port
access to illegal fishers, and to impose a ban on the international
trade of all illegally caught Patagonian toothfish.
	   The Humane Society went further, urging the commission to stop
giving legal toothfish quotas.
	   Greenpeace campaigner Darren Gladman said the scientists
estimated at least 70,000 metric tons of the valuable toothfish
were caught last year. Illegal fishing accounted for between 60 and
90 percent of the catch.
	   Stocks were already depleted to dangerous levels in South
Africa's Antarctic waters.
	   Moreover, between 77,000 and 101,000 sea birds were killed by
taking the fishing boats' longlines. Almost all the deaths came
from illegal fishing because the legal operators used protective
measures like setting their lines at night.
	   Gladman said the figures included between 31,000 and 56,000
white chinned petrels and 11,000 and 20,000 albatrosses.
	   The most worrying was the 2,000 to 4,000 giant petrels killed
last year, which represented between 10 and 20 percent of the
breeding stock.
	   ``This is the first overfishing crisis for (the commission),''
Gladman said.
	   ``If it can't deal with it, we would wonder if the crisis should
not be handled in a different way.''
	   Humane Society campaigner Nicola Beynon said that if the council
did not take tough action, her organization would press the
Australian government to nominate toothfish to be covered by the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
	   Beynon said illegal fishing was seriously jeopardizing the
future of toothfish.
	   She said it would also be outrageous for the organization set up
to preserve Antarctic life to continue to allow poachers to kill so
many birds.

Three suspected graveyard robbers detained in Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Three men have been detained in the central
Ukrainian city of Cherkasy on suspicion of desecrating at least 10
graves at a cemetery, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Prosecutor Petro Koval said the suspects may have been involved
in other desecrations as well, since a large number of metal
crosses and graveyard fences was found in their possession. Koval
did not say when exactly the three were detained.
	   The three suspects selected crosses and fences made of
non-ferrous metals, which they could later sell as valuable scrap
metal, the newspaper Kievskiye Vedomosti noted.

Mahathir calls for regulating currency trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
warned Monday that steps to revive the global economy will fail if
currency speculation is not recognized as the fundamental problem.
	   ``Cosmetic adjustments, correcting peripheral causes, will not
do any good at all,'' Mahathir told a gathering of financial
experts.
	   His comments came just days after the Group of Seven leading
industrial nations released a communique on how to tackle the
ailing world economy and study the activities of hedge funds.
	   The G-7 prescription involved creation of a new International
Monetary Fund credit line that would provide loans to healthy
economies threatened by financial contagion.
	   Mahathir has been the most vocal proponent of a new global
financial architecture, arguing that speculative capital flows
sparked the Asian financial crisis that has now hit Russia and is
looming over Latin America.
	   ``Currency trading must be forced into the open. There's no
reason why the world cannot act in concert to regulate currency
trading,'' Mahathir said.
	   He said currency traders should be registered and licensed, and
banks should be made to cut the amount of cash they are allowed to
lend to hedge funds.
	   Malaysia slipped into a recession this year. Mahathir has blamed
currency speculators for organizing attacks on the Malaysian
ringgit to weaken it.

Troubled bank to sell about 75 percent of capital by spring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The troubled state-owned bank Credit Lyonnais,
scheduled for privatization next year, is worth 35-40 billion
francs (about dlrs 6.4-7.3 billion) -- about 75 percent of which
will be sold, the bank's president said Monday.
	   Jean Peyrelevade, speaking on French radio, said the government
intends to sell between 25-30 billion francs (about dlrs 4.5-5.5
billion) of the bank's capital -- but not to direct competitors.
	   Peyrelevade said he does not want either Banque Nationale de
Paris or Societe Generale to take a piece of Credit Lyonnais.
	   ``We don't want direct competitors to be our shareholders,'' he
said.
	   However, Peyrelevade said he did not object to German insurance
company Allianz (G.ALL), French insurer Axa (F.AXB) or French
investment banker Paribas (F.PBS) entering Credit Lyonnais'
capital.
	   On the privatization process, Peyrelevade expressed hope that
``it will be done by the spring.''
	   He added that he estimates the state-owned bank's total losses
to be ``a few hundred billion francs.''
	   The privatization process, which the European Union has
stipulated must be carried out by October 1999, is the final effort
to try to save what once was France's biggest bank.
	   On Friday, Credit Lyonnais experienced its latest in a series of
dramas, with a fire on two underground floors at its headquarters
-- the second such fire in 2 and a-half years.
	   The May 1996 fire that ravaged the headquarters was determined
to be arson. The investigation was continuing into Friday's blaze,
which came a day after Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
announced the plans to begin selling off the bank.

Japan's foreign minister arrives for talks in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko
Komura arrived in Jakarta Monday to discuss efforts to revive the
region's battered economies.
	   Komura was to hold talks Tuesday with President B.J. Habibie and
Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
	   Japan, though itself in recession, has been called on to lead
the region to recovery from the worst economic crisis in decades.
It has contributed to a multibillion-dollar bailout for Indonesia
that was crafted by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Millions of people have lost their jobs in Indonesia and prices
of basic commodities have soared. Economic hardship sparked riots
that helped oust former President Suharto in May.

Disputed island reverts to Yemeni control
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANA`A, Yemen (AP) _ As Eritrean forces withdrew, Yemen's flag
was raised once again over the Red Sea island of Greater Hanish,
effectively ending a nearly three-year dispute between Yemen and
Eritrea over control of the island.
	   The ceremony Sunday, which was attended by Yemeni Defense
Minister Mohammed Dhaifullah Mohammed, is the final step in the
hand over of the disputed island.
	   Yemen and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands in
December 1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen
retained control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   On Oct. 9, the International Court of Arbitration - a panel of
experts based in The Hague - awarded all three islands to Yemen and
stipulated that its decision should be honored within 90 days. The
court's decisions are legally binding.
	   The hand over was a ``step toward security in the Red Sea,''
Mohammed told The Associated Press.
	   The decision leaves Yemen free to develop the islands for
tourism, scuba diving, oil and other enterprises.
	   The islands sit across one of the world's major shipping lanes,
160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the
southern entrance to the Red Sea.
	   Marring the festivities was the death of one Yemeni soldier who
drowned when a dingy carrying him to the island overturned.

Colombian farmers feel carrot and stick in U.S. narcotics drive

<TEXT>
	   ALBANIA, Colombia (AP) _ On a farm outside town, a dlrs 9,000
government loan is helping Fernando Trujillo and a few neighbors
make the switch from growing coca leaves _ the raw material of
cocaine _ to making brown sugar.
	   In Milan, just 25 miles (40 kilometers) down the Orteguaza
River, another poor farmer surveys his 2.5-acre (one hectare) coca
field, a target of government planes spraying herbicides. The
soaking didn't kill the shiny green coca plants, but it sapped all
life from 50 now drooping banana trees planted among the illicit
crops.
	   ``We sprinted out of there,'' said Rudolfo Lopez, who was
tending the plot with field hands when the crop dusters raided the
field. ``They almost drenched us with that poison.''
	   In Colombia's guerrilla-infested south, two radically different
strategies _ the carrot and the stick _ are vying for dominance in
the battle to break the coca-growing habit of an estimated 100,000
farmers.
	   A similar tug-of-war is occurring internationally, pitting
Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, against drug warriors in
Washington. Pastrana prefers the carrot. The warriors, chiefly
Republican lawmakers, favor the stick.
	   Sensitive to environmentalists' complaints and mindful that
Colombia's coca crop has doubled despite four years of record
fumigation, Pastrana is trying to attract extensive foreign aid for
``alternative development.'' He wants to pay peasants to rip up
their lucrative coca crops and plant fruits and vegetables.
	   Warming to the idea, U.S. officials in October set aside dlrs 60
million a year for alternative development programs in the
coca-growing nations of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru. And President
Clinton sent Pastrana home from a state visit last week with an
additional dlrs 280 million, much of it for development.
	   But the United States remains committed to aerial eradication of
coca, and Congress has just approved dlrs 200 million for that in
Colombia. The intent is to increase the effectiveness and frequency
of missions by crop-dusting planes and armed helicopter escorts
that make daily spraying runs over coca fields in the Amazon and
Orinoco river basins.
	   The difference in emphasis was largely glossed over during
Pastrana's visit to Washington.
	   Pastrana said he would continue with eradication. But he also
said crop substitution is essential, ``or the plague, no matter how
often we stamp it out, will return.''
	   The debate could ultimately hinge on what happens in Colombia,
where fumigation has few enthusiasts but alternative development
has yet to prove it can succeed on a large scale.
	   In Caqueta state, typical of Colombia's southern coca belt,
alternative development faces major obstacles:
	   _Prices: Even with coca farmers' costs rising steeply, no other
crop is nearly as profitable.
	   _Infrastructure: Most coca growers live in neglected areas, far
from paved roads. Legitimate produce like beef, milk, fresh fruits
and vegetables would spoil before making it to market.
	   _Skimpy budgets: Drug traffickers' financial resources dwarf
those of the agencies trying to offer an alternative. The United
Nations estimates Colombia needs dlrs 1 billion for alternative
development.
	   Add to those problems the rebels, who finance their insurgency
by taxing coca production and protecting traffickers' laboratories
and airstrips.
	   ``They try to show they're for alternative development, but they
don't really support it,'' said Juan Carlos Claros, who runs the
state office of the government's crop-substitution program. ``They
are very dependent on the illegal crops.''
	   Since 1996, Claros' office has given out dlrs 4.5 million in low
interest loans to about 600 farmers. Most have gone into cattle
raising, rubber plantations or fisheries. But even Claros admits
the projects are meager, given all the dollars chasing coca.
	   ``The money changing hands in one weekend in the (coca paste)
markets is equal to my entire annual budget,'' he said.
	   Government officials haven't offered any loans to coca farmer
Rudolfo Lopez, who says all he has gotten is raids by crop dusters.
``Tell Clinton that instead of sending those planes, send me some
tractors and machinery and seeds,'' he said.
	   Over in Albania, Fernando Trujillo's brown sugar cooperative is
just getting off the ground. Like all loan recipients, Trujillo
signed a pledge to stop growing coca. Like many, he's cheating.
	   ``You can't just eliminate the thing that's putting food on the
table,'' he said with an impish grin, standing in a cane field
twice his height and pointing toward where the coca still grows.
``I haven't gotten rid of anything. I just haven't planted any
more.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday
that the land-for-security agreement with the Palestinians will get
off to a late start because Israel's Cabinet and parliament have
not yet approved it.
	   The agreement was to take effect Monday, but the Cabinet will
only to discuss it on Tuesday, with no date set for a vote.
Parliament will not vote on the agreement until next week.
	   U.S. officials said that despite the delays, the timetable
should not be disrupted. Under the plan, Israel is to withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, with each phase
accompanied by Palestinian security measures, such as the
confiscation of illegal weapons.
	   In the first week, no major Israeli steps are required. The
Palestinians are to outline their plan for fighting Islamic
militants to the United States, and several Israeli-Palestinian
committees are to begin meeting.
	   ``It is the U.S. position that the schedule would be
unaffected,'' said the U.S. Embassy spokesman, Larry Schwartz.
	   Netanyahu played down the importance of the delay.
	   ``There conceivably could be a delay, but I think we can limit
it to a technical delay of a few days. So I don't think there will
be a problem,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   The prime minister also said he was confident parliament would
ratify the agreement, but appeared less certain about the backing
of his Cabinet ministers. ``I am sure the Knesset will approve it,
assuming it passes the government,'' he said.
	   Netanyahu said he was acting on the recommendations of the
attorney general, Eliyakim Rubinstein. Earlier Monday, legislator
Hanan Porat, an avowed opponent of the agreement, had asked
Rubinstein to make a ruling on the issue.
	   Netanyahu denied media reports that Israel had agreed to slow
the expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
as part of the agreement with the Palestinians.
	   Netanyahu said Israel would keep building to accommodate the
natural population growth in the settlements, but would not
establish new communities.
	   On Monday, construction continued on the expansion of Kiryat
Arba, a settlement of 6,000 residents just outside the tense,
divided West Bank town of Hebron. Workers were paving roads and
working on the utilities for a 200-apartment neighborhood, said the
mayor of Kiryat Arba, Zvi Katzover.
	   In other developments Monday, Palestinian police identified a
19-year-old Hamas activist as the suicide bomber in last week's
attack on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   The assailant was Suhib Timraz, a resident of the Jebaliya
refugee camp, said the commander of the Palestinian security
forces, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali.
	   The attack killed an Israeli soldier and the assailant, but 40
Israeli school children in the convoy escaped unharmed.
	   A Hamas leader, Ismail Hanieh, distanced the group from a
leaflet in which the armed wing of Hamas, Izzedine al Qassam, made
unprecedented threats against Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   In the leaflet, Izzedine al Qassam said Arafat had ``reached the
point of treason'' by arresting more than 100 Hamas activists in
response to Thursday's suicide bombing.
	   Hanieh said the leaflet was not issued by Hamas. He said the
group's policy is to avoid civil war at all costs.
	   It is not unusual for Hamas to issue conflicting statements
since the shadowy group is broken up into small cells that often
don't know of each others' activities.
	   Also Monday, lifted a 50-day blockade on Palestinian areas in a
move described as a good-will gesture. Some 60,000 laborers will be
permitted to return to their jobs in Israel.

Protest by Chinese steel workers ends with injuries, arrests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Police arrested several organizers of a protest
by 500 steel workers that ended in a clash with police in which
four people were seriously injured, an official in southwestern
China's Sichuan province said Monday.
	   Workers blocked railway lines in Jiangyou city, about 1,350
kilometers (850 miles) southwest of Beijing, on Oct. 21 to protest
not having been paid for three months, said an official at the
Fujiang Steel Works, who gave only his surname, Yang.
	   After more than four hours, police were ordered to disperse the
protest and a clash ensued, leaving about 10 demonstrators injured,
four of them badly enough that they required intensive care, Yang
said, confirming a report by the Hong Kong-based Information Center
of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
	   Yang said that of some 15 workers detained by police, three or
four ``organizers'' had been formally arrested. The others were
required to write letters of ``self-criticism'' before they were
released, he said.
	   Local police and other local officials contacted by telephone
declined to comment.
	   Protests are erupting with increasing frequency across China as
workers are laid off from struggling state-owned factories that in
many cases have failed for months to pay wages or unemployment
stipends.

Electronics giant to close a third of its factories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Intent on scaling back bloated
production facilities, Dutch electronics giant Royal Philips
Electronics NV said Monday it will close about a third of its
factories worldwide.
	   Philips spokesman Ben Geerts said the company had already
announced in March that it would examine its industrial
infrastructure.
	   At that time, ``we had 269 factories and we will have reduced
this to 266 by the end of 1998,'' Geerts said.
	   The company, Europe's largest consumer electronics group, had
``built too big a production capacity for requirements,'' Philips
President Cor Boonstra was quoted as saying in Monday's editions of
the Financial Times.
	   It was not immediately clear whether employees at the targeted
factories would be laid off or reassigned.
	   The Dutch group wants to cut the number of production sites to
between 160 and 170 from the current 244 by 2002, the newspaper
reported.
	   Geerts said the company didn't have a specific plan on how to
scale back the number, but that it would be done mainly through
streamlining operations and combining some production lines.
	   Monday's news came amid a rough season for Philips. The company
said last month that third-quarter income from normal operations
fell 38 percent to 449 million guilders (dlrs 237 million). Philips
also plans to end its telecommunications joint venture with U.S.
company Lucent Technologies Inc.
	   The news followed a profit warning in September that income from
normal operations in 1998 should be unchanged from 1997.
	   Boonstra said in the newspaper interview that Philips is still
open to purchases in areas such as medical products, semiconductors
and lighting.
	   ``Now we can take our pick where we acquire and grow,'' Boonstra
was quoted as saying.
	   He also said the company wants to expand mainly in the United
States.
	   Philips shares rose sharply on Monday's news, jumping 5.7
percent to 105.10 guilders (dlrs 55) in early morning trading on
the Amsterdam stock exchange.

Despite eradication efforts, coca cultivation remains constant
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Colombia-Curbing Coca
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Some facts about cocaine production and eradication efforts in
South America:
	   ___
	   BOLIVIA:
	   Area under cultivation: 113,200 acres (45,800 hectares), down 6
percent from 1993.
	   Government's coca reduction focus: Mixture of forced eradication
with voluntary cash-for-crops program. President Hugo Banzer, who
took office last year and vows to eliminate coca before leaving
office in 2002, has increased police and military presence in
coca-growing Chapare region. New coca plants are destroyed by
police and soldiers, who have clashed with peasant farmers. Older
plots are legal, and government offers farmers dlrs 2,500 for every
two acres voluntarily destroyed.
	   ___
	   COLOMBIA:
	   Total area under cultivation: 196,400 acres (79,500 hectares),
up 100 percent from 1993.
	   Government's coca reduction focus: Aerial eradication with
crop-killing herbicides. U.S. government spends tens of millions of
dollars annually on crop-dusters that fumigate vast expanses of
southern Colombia and armed helicopters that protect them from
rebel gunfire. President Andres Pastrana wants to change to
emphasis on providing loans and technical assistance to help
farmers switch to legal crops.
	   ___
	   PERU:
	   Total area under cultivation: 170,500 acres (69,000 hectares)
acres, down 36 percent from 1993.
	   Government's coca reduction focus: Air interdiction to block
Peru-Colombia border. In 1995, President Alberto Fujimori ordered
warplanes to force down flights carrying coca paste from Peru to be
processed in Colombia. Shutdown of ``air bridge'' caused sharp drop
in coca price and production. Traffickers now moving product into
Colombia by land and rivers, a longer and more costly process.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ A Chinese jetliner with 102 people aboard
made an emergency landing Monday after a wheel fell off its nose
landing gear, state media said. No injuries were reported.
	   The crew of the China Eastern Airlines flight bound for Osaka,
Japan, discovered the problem shortly after takeoff at 9:45 a.m.
(0145 GMT), the Xinhua News Agency said. The Airbus A-300 returned
to Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai and landed safely at 12:03 p.m.
(0403 GMT).
	   Aboard were 87 passengers, including 55 Japanese and a person
from Taiwan, and 15 crew members, the report said.
	   Xinhua said the airport was closed at 11:50 a.m. (0350 GMT) and
reopened after the landing.
	   Shanghai government officials went to the airport afterward,
Shanghai state-run television reported.
	   Airport officials declined comment.
	   Another jetliner from the same airline made an emergency landing
in Shanghai Sept. 10, sliding along the runway in a shower of
sparks after its front landing gear jammed.
	   The McDonnell Douglas MD-11 with 137 people aboard was bound for
Beijing when its landing gear failed. The official newspaper China
Daily said Chinese technicians have identified the cause the
problem, but gave no details.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ A veteran U.S. climber who died while
leading a nine-member trekking team to Mt. Kalapatar in the
Himalayas two days ago was cremated by his friends Monday.
	   Lute Jerstad, 61, who in 1963 became one of the first Americans
to climb Mt. Everest, died of a heart attack on Saturday in Tukla,
just 500 feet (150 meters) short of the 15,000 feet (4,545 meter)
peak of Mt. Kalapatar. From that high point, Jerstad hoped to gaze
on Mt. Everest, the peak he climbed 35 years ago.
	   Jerstad's body was brought by helicopter to Katmandu and
cremated on the banks of the holy Bagmati river.
	   The trekking group he led included his stepdaughter and her
12-year-old son.
	   The group left Katmandu early last week for the trek in the
Everest region and was scheduled to return on Friday.
	   Jerstad, of Portland, Oregon, had climbed Everest _ at 29,028
feet (8,796 meters) the world's highest mountain _ when he was 26.

Jewish group uses race laws to seek withdrawal of Internet
</HEADLINE>
material &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with information from Internet site &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A Jewish group said Monday it is
seeking the removal of ``malicious anti-Jewish propaganda'' from an
Internet website and an apology from its operator.
	   The Executive Council of Australia Jewry has complained to the
New South Wales state Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission
about a site posted by the Adelaide Institute and is seeking a
declaration that the institute has breached the Racial
Discrimination Act by publishing allegedly anti-Jewish material.
	   The case is the first time Australia's national race
discrimination laws have been tested in relation to the Internet.
	   The website contains a series of anti-Semitic statements, ``most
of it in the nature of Holocaust denial,'' council vice president
and lawyer Peter Wertheim said.
	   ``But there are other things there as well about the Jewish
religion, Jewish people, Jewish history which really amount to a
stream of derogatory generalizations about the Jewish people,'' he
said.
	   At a commission hearing Monday, proceedings had hardly begun
before institute director Frederick Toben stormed out after an
exchange with commissioner Kathleen McEvoy.
	   Toben took exception to what he claimed was the refusal of the
commission to accept the ``truth as a defense,'' and walked out
after McEvoy questioned the contents of a document Toben wanted to
present to the commission.
	   The document argued there had not been a systematic
extermination of European Jewry in gas chambers during World War
II.
	   ``If the truth cannot be heard, the lie must prevail,'' Toben
said before storming out.
	   It was the second time Toben had walked out of a commission
hearing. The commission will now make its determination without
taking evidence from Toben.
	   Wertheim said Toben's walkout was grandstanding. ``He's done it
once before and it's simply a refusal to face the real issues,'' he
said.
	   The Adelaide Institute was privately funded by Toben and had no
legitimate accreditation, Wertheim said.
	   ``It is a very respectable sounding name behind which, in our
view, lurks a nakedly racist organization,'' he said.
	   On the website, little information is given about the institute
or how many people are members. The site says the institute is ``a
group of individuals looking at ... alleged homicidal gassings''
during the Nazi holocaust.
	   The site denies it represents racism or that ``questioning the
alleged gas chamber story'' constitutes ``hate talk.''
	   The site has various photographs of Toben inside and outside the
Auschwitz death camp.
	   The council is seeking a public apology, removal of the website
material, and an order preventing future Internet publication of
similar material by the institute.

Government orders sale of 5 percent stake in Gazprom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cash-strapped Russian government on Monday
moved to auction off a 5 percent stake in one of its most valuable
assets _ the natural gas monopoly Gazprom.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who was recovering from his latest
illness at a the Black Sea resort of Sochi, issued a decree
approving the auction and allowing foreign investors to take part.
No date was set.
	   The government has repeatedly postponed the sale because the
Russian stock market crashed so dramatically this year. The
government is therefore likely to get less than it wanted for
selling shares in the world's largest gas company.
	   The government had been mulling how large a stake to sell.
Officials said some people in the government wanted to sell only
2.5 percent of Gazprom because of weak market.
	   However, with the International Monetary Fund reluctant to give
Russia more loans, the government has little option but to sell
more shares to pay off its huge debts.
	   The government currently holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares and
said it may gradually reduce its holdings in the company to 25
percent.
	   Private investors, both in Russia and abroad, hold the remaining
shares.
	   Foreign ownership of Gazprom stock has previously been limited
to 9 percent, but the decree signed by Yeltsin raises that limit to
14 percent.
	   Back in August, the Russian government set the starting price
for a 5 percent stake in Gazprom at dlrs 1.65 billion _ more than
double the current international market price. Yeltsin's decree did
not say whether the government would reassess the price.
	   The government's wants to raise badly-needed cash through
privatization auctions. But the country's financial collapse has
scared away foreign investors and driven down the price.
	   The government has already canceled plans to sell stakes in
several state-run oil companies.
	   If the government can raise money through privatization sales,
it may have to print more money to pay off overdue wages and
pensions.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other government officials
have said they will keep money-printing to a minimum to avoid high
inflation.
	   The government on Saturday approved a plan to combat the
economic crisis, including tighter state control over the economy.
The plan has drawn a cool reaction from the IMF.

South Koreans rush to apply to visit North Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ When the Korean War broke out in 1950,
then 20-year-old Shin Hyun-man enlisted in the South Korean army
despite his family's opposition.
	   He said he thought ``fighting for your country is an honorable
thing to do'' and that he would be reunited with his family when
the war ended. He was wrong on the second count.
	   His home, Kaesung, which had been in South Korea before the war,
was now in North Korea and Shin, like millions of others, was
separated from his family.
	   ``Who would have imagined it?'' Shin said, taking out from his
jumper pocket a folded paper with several Korean Peninsula maps on
it that show how the border changed through the war.
	   So when South Korea's Hyundai group began taking applications
for unprecedented tours to scenic Diamond Mountain on North Korea's
east coast Monday, Shin was one of thousands who rushed to
register.
	   His wrinkled face reddened with emotion, Shin, 68, sat at a desk
at the Hyundai Dream Tour agency in downtown Seoul and carefully
filled out an application form.
	   For some 7.7 million Koreans like Shin, many in their 60s or
older, it could be the last chance to get just a step closer to
their families and relatives still living in the North.
	   ``The mountain is quite far away from my hometown. But just
being in the North would make me feel that I am home, at last,
after all those years,'' Shin said.
	   He left three brothers and one sister, all aged 82 or older now,
but never tried to contact them because he feared it would
jeopardize their safety.
	   With the border sealed and communication between the two Koreas
forbidden, only 212 meetings between members of separated families
have been reported since the war, according to the Korean Red
Cross.
	   Most of meetings took place in China, where many North Korean
refugees live in hiding after escaping the communist country that
is suffering from three years of food shortage.
	   Shin is one of the few who already have been to Diamond
Mountain.
	   ``I fought against North Korean solders in the mountain from
September to October 1952. I saw many soldiers die. It was really
horrible,'' Shin said.
	   ``But you know what, even during the battles, I sometimes
thought, it was so beautiful there. After so many years, I still
can't forget it.''
	   Shin, who retired as a school guard 10 years ago, saved money
for more than 10 years before retirement for an occasion like this.
``I believed a day like this would come someday.''
	   Not all can afford the tour in the midst of the worst financial
crisis in years. It costs between 1.1 million and 3.2 million won
(dlrs 785 and dlrs 2,285).
	   Chung Ju-yung, honorary chairman of the Hyundai group, returned
home from North Korea last week with approval to send up to 2,000
people a week to the mountain aboard two luxury cruise ships.
	   The tours, the first since the Korean Peninsula was divided into
two Koreas in 1945, are scheduled to begin Nov. 18. Hyundai is
taking applications for the first tour through Thursday.
	   Officials said 64 tour agencies across the nation received tens
of thousands of phone calls Monday and some had to halt their
regular business. About 1,200 people registered.
	   ``I hope these tours will lead to the unification of the two
Koreas someday,'' Shin said. ``When the day comes, I will bring my
wife and three children to meet my brothers, sister and their
children and maybe we all could visit the mountain again.''

Death toll in Swedish fire rises to 62
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JAN M. OLSEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ After clinging to life for three days,
two youths trapped in a dance-hall fire died early Monday, bringing
the death toll in the inferno to 62.
	   With another 17 people still in intensive care, the figure could
still go higher in what is already Sweden's worst fire disaster of
modern times.
	   The dead, as young as 12 and none older than 20, were among an
estimated 400 people who were at a disco dance in a rented
second-floor hall when an explosive fire broke out shortly before
midnight Thursday.
	   The hall had been rented out for the night by the tenant, the
local association of Macedonian immigrants, to teen-agers who
arranged the dance.
	   The hall had a legal capacity of only 150 and officials say it
is possible that the arrangers who allowed the hall to be severely
overcrowded could be charged with contributing to others' deaths.
	   ``It's important that people have a clear understanding that the
authorities' approval of the premises was not a joke,'' chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren, who is leading the fire investigation, was
quoted as saying in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   However, Noren said, a decision on that question would wait
until the cause of the fire has been determined.
	   The fire's ferociously quick spread has prompted wide
speculation that it was set. But witnesses have given widely
varying accounts _ some saying it appeared to start in the
equipment used by the disc jockey and others saying there was smoke
coming up fom the emergency exit's stairway before the flames raced
through the hall.
	   The emergency exit was blocked by flames, forcing the panicked
dancers to try to flee down the one remaining stairway or leap out
of second-story windows.
	   Most of those at the dance were immigrants or children of
immigrant parents.

Electronics giant to close a third of its factories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Intent on scaling back bloated
production facilities, Dutch electronics giant Royal Philips
Electronics NV said Monday it will close about a third of its
factories worldwide.
	   Philips spokesman Ben Geerts said the company had already
announced in March that it would examine its industrial
infrastructure.
	   At that time, ``we had 269 factories and we will have reduced
this to 266 by the end of 1998,'' Geerts said.
	   The company, Europe's largest consumer electronics group, had
``built too big a production capacity for requirements,'' Philips
President Cor Boonstra was quoted as saying in Monday's editions of
the Financial Times.
	   It was not immediately clear whether employees at the targeted
factories would be laid off or reassigned.
	   The Dutch group wants to cut the number of production sites to
between 160 and 170 from the current 244 by 2002, the newspaper
reported.
	   Geerts said the company didn't have a specific plan on how to
scale back the number, but that it would be done mainly through
streamlining operations and combining some production lines.
	   Monday's news came amid a rough season for Philips. The company
said last month that third-quarter income from normal operations
fell 38 percent to 449 million guilders (dlrs 237 million). Philips
also plans to end its telecommunications joint venture with U.S.
company Lucent Technologies Inc.
	   The news followed a profit warning in September that income from
normal operations in 1998 should be unchanged from 1997.
	   Boonstra said in the newspaper interview that Philips is still
open to purchases in areas such as medical products, semiconductors
and lighting.
	   ``Now we can take our pick where we acquire and grow,'' Boonstra
was quoted as saying.
	   He also said the company wants to expand mainly in the United
States.
	   Philips shares rose sharply on Monday's news, jumping 5.7
percent to 105.10 guilders (dlrs 55) in early morning trading on
the Amsterdam stock exchange.

Bombs explode on two Philippine buses, killing two passengers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ILIGAN, Philippines (AP) _ Homemade bombs exploded Monday on two
buses in the southern Philippines, killing two passengers and
injuring more than 40 others, police said.
	   The explosions were the latest in a series of recent bomb
attacks, mostly blamed on Muslim extremists, in a number of
southern provinces.
	   Police said the first bomb went off apparently in the baggage
compartment of a bus parked at a terminal in Cagayan de Oro city,
instantly killing a male passenger and injuring about 30 other
passengers. Another passenger died on the way to a hospital.
	   The bus was taking on passengers, many of whom came from
observing All Souls' Day at cemeteries.
	   The second bomb exploded on a bus traveling in the coastal
village of Bacolod in Lanao del Norte province, injuring 11 of more
than 60 passengers, police said.
	   The bus, from Iligan city, was en route to Dipolog city in
nearby Zamboanga del Norte province when the explosion occurred in
the rear section, police said.
	   Muslim separatist guerrillas operate in both provinces but
police investigators said they could not immediately determine the
motive for the bombings.

Newspaper: Churchill considered poison gas attack on Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Winston Churchill considered unleashing poison gas
on Germany in the last year of World War II, The Guardian newspaper
reported Monday.
	   Citing a memo recently discovered in Britain's public archives,
the newspaper said Churchill contemplated a mustard gas attack that
would ``drench the cities of Ruhr and many other cities in Germany
in such a way that most of the population would be requiring
medical attention.''
	   Churchill's comments were made in the letter to General Sir
Hastings Ismay, secretary of the War Cabinet, on July 6, 1944 _ one
month after the D-Day landings, the newspaper said. The memo will
be featured in a Scottish Television program, Secret Scotland, on
Tuesday.
	   Churchill said the only reason that Germany had not used the gas
on Allies was because ``they fear retaliation.''
	   ``Not certainly out of moral scruples or affection for us,'' he
wrote.
	   But Churchill added that he would not use the gas unless it
could be shown it was ``life or death for us'' or ``it would
shorten the war by a year,'' The Guardian said.
	   ``In the meanwhile, I want the matter studied in cold blood by
sensible people and not by that particular set of psalm-singing
uniformed defeatists which one runs across now here now there,''
Churchill wrote.
	   After some study, Ismay told Churchill the military chiefs
thought a gas attack would not have a ``decisive'' effect on the
war and Churchill accepted their decision.

Woman accused of WWII-era crimes extradited to Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A Croatian woman accused of torturing
inmates at a concentration camp during World War II was en route to
Zagreb on Monday after being extradited from Argentina.
	   Nada Sakic, 76, landed at Frankfurt airport Monday morning after
an overnight flight from Buenos Aires, the German border patrol
said. She was to fly on to Zagreb on Croatian Airlines at 1700 GMT.
	   Mrs. Sakic is suspect of having run a women's block at the
Jasenovac concentration camp complex from 1942-45.
	   Thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies were killed at Jasenovac,
the most notorious of more than 20 concentration camps run by
Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet state.
	   Her husband, Dinko Sakic, commanded the Jasenovac complex. He
was extradited to Croatia on June 18 and is awaiting trial in
Zagreb.
	   Mrs. Sakic was arrested in July in the city of Dolores, some 200
kilometers (125 miles) south of Buenos Aires, at the request of
Yugoslav officials, who have charged her with genocide.
	   Croatia then also asked for her extradition, apparently to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia where she
would face a tougher trial. The majority of victims at the camp
were Serbs.
	   In court papers, Croatian authorities said Mrs. Sakic was
suspected of ``violating the principles of international laws by
carrying out torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as
terror, intimidation and collective punishment of civilians'' from
1942-1945.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The warring sides in the bitter
5-month-old Guinea-Bissau civil war have signed an accord to end
the conflict, officials announced Monday.
	   The agreement came late Sunday night during talks between
Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira and the rebel leader,
Brig. Ansumane Mane, held in secrecy at the mansion of Nigeria's
military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   Abubakar endorsed the agreement, as did Gambian President Yaya

introduction of an buffer force of West African peacekeepers. A
government of national unity is to be formed within 10 days and
president elections are to be held no later than next March.
	   Officials announced the agreement Monday morning.
	   The talks began in Gambia's capital of Banjul on Friday and were
moved to Nigeria's capital early Saturday to coincide with a summit
of leaders summit from the Economic Community of Western States.
	   The two-day ECOWAS summit closed on Sunday night with a written
appeal by the organization for the warring parties to resolve their
differences peacefully. But the Guinea-Bissau talks continued into
the night.
	   ECOWAS has on several occasions intervened in regional disputes.
Nigeria, the region's powerhouse, leads a West African force called
ECOMOG that played an aggressive role in ended fighting in Liberia
in 1996 and toppling Sierra Leone's junta in March.
	   The conflict in the former Portuguese colony began June 7 when a

Asian stock markets close higher
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed higher across the
board Monday, with prices surging in Tokyo on word of a possible
alliance between two of Japan's largest banks.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 388.24
points, or 2.86 percent, closing at 13,952.75. On Friday, the
average had fallen 104.21 points, or 0.76 percent.
	   Traders said investors pushed up heavily weighted banking shares
after Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. said Saturday
that they may form a strategic alliance in trust banking
operations.
	   The news boosted investors' hopes that other banks might follow
suit in a bid to improve their business.
	   The proposed merger is the first between Japan's top lenders,
but only the latest effort to cope with increased competition, a
recessionary economy and bad loans.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 115.70 yen in late
afternoon, down 0.38 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also below
its New York level of 116.14 yen late Friday.
	   Singapore shares soared on expectations of interest rate cuts in
the next few days, dealers said.
	   The Straits Times Index gained 58.52 points, or 4.9 percent, to
1,273.14.
	   The spread between Singapore domestic interbank rates and prime
lending rates has widened to more than 4 percentage points, putting
pressure on banks to slash rates soon.
	   The prime lending rate currently stands at 7 percent after two
recent 25-basis point cuts.
	   New Zealand share prices also closed sharply higher, with the
key index posting its largest single-day points gain since April
1994 thanks to renewed overseas buying interest.
	   Brokers said the renewed interest was sparked by gains on
regional markets Monday following a 97.07-point rise on Wall Street
on Friday.
	   The NZSE-40 Capital Index surged 71.19 points, or 3.8 percent,
closing at 1,949.74. It was the largest single-session gain since
73.15 points on April 6, 1994.
	   Malaysian share prices surged 3.6 percent as the trial of former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim began in the High Court on
corruption charges.
	   Dealers said Malaysian shares were buoyed by an influx of cash
from government-linked investment funds as well as changes in
market regulations.
	   The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's benchmark Composite Index rose
14.45 points, closing at 419.78.
	   Markets in the Philippines were closed for a holiday.
	   JAKARTA: Share prices closed higher on continued buying in some
state-owned stocks. The Composite Index rose 6.428 points, or 2.1
percent, to 307.198.
	   TAIPEI: Shares closed higher, boosted by the rise in the Taiwan
currency against the U.S. dollar. The market's key Weighted Stock
Price Index rose 52.11 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,218.09.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed little changed in moderate
trading. The Hang Seng Index rose 15.14 points, or 0.1 percent,
closing at 10,170.08.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed higher for the sixth
straight session, fueled by speculation of a cut in interest rates.
The All Ordinaries Index rose 25.2 points, or nearly 1 percent, to
2,672.5.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed higher. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand Index rose 3.64 points, or 1.0 percent, to 334.93.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed slightly higher. The Korea Composite
Stock Price Index rose 1.17 points, or 0.2 percent, to 404.61.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Money may be short and political
tensions high, but that didn't stop thousands of Cambodians from
paying homage to the mighty Mekong River and ancient glories in the
annual Water Festival Monday.
	   The festivities were marred by gunshots when police carrying out
heavy security operations fired in the air in pursuit of a car that
fled a traffic accident. The driver was eventually stopped and
arrested. Police said no one was hurt.
	   But the main event was more than 300 long, sleek traditional
boats, each with some 30 rowers, competing before crowds gathered
along the river in front of the Royal Palace.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen Monineath attended the opening
of the three-day festival, but strongman Hun Sen, the key political
rival of the king's son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, canceled his
scheduled attendance. Officials in his entourage refused to
comment.
	   Security was tight, with armed police and soldiers present at
every street corner in the area.
	   Assassination attempts, extra-judicial killings and bitter
rivalries have marked the political scene following an inconclusive
election in July. The economy is barely staggering along.
	   But there was brisk business at makeshift riverside stalls
selling food, drinks, toys and even condoms. Stages were readied
for shows and other entertainment.
	   ``This event is held every year to pay our gratitude to the
Mekong River for its contribution of fertility to the country's
agriculture,'' said Vann Seng Ly, a member of the festival's
organizing committee.
	   The festival celebrates one of Southeast Asia's most remarkable
natural phenomena.
	   Swelled by melting snows and monsoon rains, the Mekong backs up
and sends water rushing up the Tonle Sap tributary to Cambodia's
Great Lake. The lake expands enormously, becoming a major source of
fish and water for irrigation.
	   The Great Lake normally reaches its maximum extent in October,
when the water begins to recede and the tributary reverses its flow
toward the Mekong, leaving behind fertile sediment.
	   The boat races associated with the festival recall the powerful
navy of King Jayavarman II, the 9th century founder of the great
Angkorian Empire.
	   The festival was revived in the early 1990s after a lapse of
nearly two decades when Cambodia suffered through war, the Khmer
Rouge reign of terror and other conflicts.
	   It was not clear how much the cash-strapped government was
spending on the event, but Seng Ly said regardless of costs the
event will proceed for the full three days.
	   ``It is hard not to celebrate the event as the people are
strongly attached to it,'' he said.

China looks to boost its soccer team for Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's national soccer team could call back four
players from overseas to boost its chances at the Asian Games in
Thailand in December, an official newspaper reported Monday.
	   Two of the players, Fan Zhiyi and Sun Jihai, play for Crystal
Palace in the English First Division. Another, Yang Chen, plays in
Germany, while Li Jinyu is with Nantes in France.
	   Englishman Bob Houghton, who coaches the national team, said
recalling Fan and Sun for the Asian Games would allow him to ``see
if they can bring the things they have learned recently in England
to the national team,'' the China Sports Daily said.
	   Houghton also said that Yang, who plays in Frankfurt, ``very
possibly could become an extremely important player in the national
team,'' the newspaper reported. Li, who has not had many chances to
play since his move to France, also ``is very willing to come
back,'' the newspaper said.
	   China and South Korea will both field their Asian Games teams at
a friendly warm-up match Nov. 22, the newspaper said.
	   The Asian Games are held every four years.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The warring sides in the bitter
5-month-old Guinea-Bissau civil war have signed an accord to end
the conflict, officials announced Monday.
	   The agreement came late Sunday night during talks between
Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira and the rebel leader,
Brig. Ansumane Mane, held in secrecy at the mansion of Nigeria's
military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   Abubakar endorsed the agreement, as did Gambian President Yaya
Jammeh.
	   The agreement calls for a re-affirmation of a ceasefire signed
in August, the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the
introduction of a buffer force of West African peacekeepers. A
government of national unity is to be formed within 10 days and
president elections are to be held no later than next March.
	   Officials announced the agreement Monday morning.
	   The talks began in Gambia's capital of Banjul on Friday and were
moved to Nigeria's capital early Saturday to coincide with a summit
of leaders summit from the 16-member Economic Community of West
African States.
	   The two-day ECOWAS summit closed on Sunday night with a written
appeal by the organization for the warring parties to resolve their
differences peacefully. But the Guinea-Bissau talks continued into
the night.
	   Gambian Foreign Minister Sedat Jobe said mediators prevailed on
the protagonists to accept the plan, drawn up with the assistance
of ECOWAS officials, by ``making them feel responsible for the
crisis.''
	   He said he was optimistic the accord would hold, saying his
president ``was convinced that if (the antagonists) could be
brought together, then there was a very good chance of a truce
being reached. That is exactly what happened in Abuja.''

Dresdner Bank hikes lost loan provision, shows lower pre-tax

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Dresdner Bank said Monday that the
financial crises in Asia and Russia considerably hurt business,
forcing it earmark over a billion German marks for possible bad
loans.
	   The bank said it had earmarked 1.25 billion marks (dlrs 781
million) in lost loan provisions for the first nine months of 1998,
up from 932 million marks (dlrs 582 million) over the same period
last year.
	   Dresdner Bank's pre-tax profit in the first three-quarters fell
to 2.42 billion marks (dlrs 1.51 billion) from 2.51 billion marks
(dlrs 1.56 billion) over the same period in 1997.
	   The bank also said it lost 40 million marks (dlrs 25 million) in
the collapse of U.S. hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management.
	   Despite the profits drop, the figures were better than analysts
had expected.
	   In a letter to shareholders, Dresdner said financial turmoil in
Asia and especially in Indonesia posed a risk. The third-largest
German bank also said that Russia was causing ``special concern.''
	   With the increased risk provision, Dresdner said ``all risks
foreseeable at present have been covered.''
	   But it also noted ``further developments on the international
markets are difficult to predict.''

Hong Kong officials arrest four in pirate CD raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officials raided a pirate compact disc
operation Monday, seizing more than 600,000 bogus CDs and videos
worth 10 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.28 million) and
arresting four Hong Kong men.
	   Under international pressure, mainly from the United States and
Japan, Hong Kong authorities have recently cracked down on pirate
CD dealers, including Monday's raid, which broke up a ring bringing
in the goods from Macau, a Portuguese enclave 40 miles (64
kilometers) to the west.
	   Hong Kong officials say they have halted all production of the
CDs in this territory, prompting the illicit industry to move
manufacturing elsewhere.
	   The items seized Monday included copies of Japanese television
dramas, Ben Leung, deputy head of the Intellectual Property
Investigation Bureau, told the government-run Radio Hong Kong.
	   Despite frequent raids, pirated compact discs, video compact
discs and computer software are readily available in stores across
Hong Kong. Copies of local or Hollywood movies are sold for less
than 40 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5) _ sometimes before they
have even been released in local cinemas.
	   Last year, customs officials seized 66 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 8.46 million) worth of counterfeit products and arrested
850 suspects.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defense attorneys for Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim lost a crucial opening
gambit in his corruption trial Monday.
	   They contended that the jailed dissident's graft charges should
be thrown out because the lower house of Parliament had repealed
the special anti-corruption law before the criminal charges were
filed against Anwar.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul dismissed the defense strategy,
saying that because the law was still under review by the upper
house of Parliament, it was still on the books.
	   The politically charged trial of Malaysia's one-time heir
apparent began amid tight security and under the scrutiny of
international human rights officials.
	   Riot police armed with automatic rifles blocked some 200
supporters of Anwar from reaching the courthouse.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts, charges he vehemently denies and says were cooked up to
undermine his growing challenge to the 17-year leadership of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Defense attorneys also called Monday for the judge to hold
Mahathir in contempt of court for tainting the case by saying Anwar
should be convicted.
	   ``You should hold this man for contempt,'' said Raja Aziz
Addruse, who leads a team of nine defense lawyers. Mahathir was
quoted in local papers as saying a conviction would help preserve
racial harmony in the ethnically diverse Southeast Asian country by
easing the growing unrest.
	   Mahathir could be called as one of the 52 witnesses to testify
against Anwar, lawyers said.
	   ``His name is on the list. We believe he might be called,'' said
Kamar Ainiah, a defense lawyer, after the hearing adjourned until
Tuesday afternoon.
	   Demonstrations in support of Anwar have been held regularly
since his arrest Sept. 20. A full-scale riot broke out Oct. 24 when
police fired tear gas at a mosque and people retaliated by throwing
stones and bricks.
	   ``I can't expect a fair trial,'' said Anwar, who was brought
into the courtroom through an underground tunnel.
	   He was pale and gaunt. His sister said he had lost nearly 20
pounds (9 kilograms) during the ordeal.
	   ``I am in good health,'' he told reporters from the dock, where
four policemen stood guard. He hugged his wife and children and was
later seen sharing a candy bar with his wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   He said prison life was not bad, relatively speaking.
	   ``They don't harass and beat me up.''
	   The 51-year-old politician, who has called for political reforms
and Mahathir's resignation, did not wear the neck brace he had
sported during previous court appearances. He had said he was
assaulted by police on his first night in custody, 18 days after
Mahathir fired him.
	   Paul began hearing arguments Monday about four counts of
corruption. Anwar will be tried later for one more charge of abuse
of power and five illegal sex acts.
	   Mahathir, 72, said he fired his deputy on moral grounds because
homosexual acts are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia.
	   More than 100 reporters and international observers hoping to
watch the legal proceedings milled about outside the court
building. The High Court faces Independence Square, where several
pro-Anwar protests have taken place.
	   Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch were among the
groups that sent representatives to the trial.
	   ``We will totally monitor Anwar's trial to examine the nature
and basis of evidence brought against him and to assess the
proceedings in light of international standards on fair trial,''
said Amnesty's Mark Daly.
	   Although the judge dismissed pleas by the defense to accord
special status to observers, representatives of some rights groups
were allowed to sit in the public gallery.
	   Anwar faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each of the
corruption charges linked to his alleged abuse of power during his
tenure from 1993 until his dismissal Sept. 2.
	   Each illegal sex charge is punishable by 20 years in prison and
a whipping with a rattan cane.
	   On Nov. 14, the court will break for more than one week as
Malaysia plays host to a meeting of 20 world leaders for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The trial was conducted partly in English and partly in the
local Malay language. Paul had initially ruled that the trial would
be conducted in English because of the large number of foreign
observers and media.
	   But last week, the chief justice ordered the trial to be
conducted in the language of majority Malays.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian soldier standing guard at a spy academy
in the Russian capital left his post and was later found dead at an
electrical power station, officials said Monday.
	   Pvt. Konstantin Murzin deserted his post at the Chief
Intelligence Directorate, known under its Russian acronym, GRU,
late on Sunday, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Officials quickly checked the premises and found Murzin dead at
a nearby transformer station, the report added. There was no sign
that anyone else was involved in the death.
	   Desertions, shootings and suicides have become increasingly
common in the cash-strapped and demoralized Russian military. Many
have been linked to hazings of young conscripts carried out by
older soldiers.
	   On Sunday, three conscripts serving sentences in a military
penitentiary in the Perm region in the Ural Mountains, bound a
guard and escaped, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported. The report
did not say why the conscripts were in prison.
	   Other crimes, including widespread thefts of weapons and other
military hardware has also been rampant in the military and
security services.
	   Last Friday, two officers of the secretive Federal Government
Communications and Information Agency (FAPSI) were arrested while
trying to sell an arsenal of three grenade launchers, three hand
grenades, several guns and ammunition, the ITAR-Tass said on
Monday.
	   The FAPSI is one of the successors of the former KGB, running
the government's vast communications network and ensuring its
security.

Lawmaker: Russia's nuclear forces declining
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian military is in a major crisis, its
nuclear capability has fallen far behind that of the United States
and it is nearing the point of no longer being effective, a top
lawmaker said Monday.
	   Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the Security Committee of the Duma,
the lower chamber of parliament, said the effectiveness of existing
Russian nuclear forces was equal to about 40 percent of current
U.S. capability, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   ``It would be true to say that the armed forces are in the
deepest thinkable crisis, effectively full-scale disintegration,
and unable, as their experts say, to carry out strategic
operations,'' he said.
	   Ilyukhin, a member of the Communist Party, made the remarks to a
Duma commission drawing up impeachment charges against President
Boris Yeltsin. The possible charges include the destruction of the
Soviet Union and the subsequent decline of Russian military power.
	   Ilyukin said that by 2007 Russia's stockpile of nuclear warheads
will be one-seventh of the U.S. stockpile. He added that Russia now
has just 67 strategic bombers, compared to hundreds during the
Soviet era.
	   The Russian military is in a major crisis, unable to pay troops
or buy new weapons because of the country's constant economic
problems. Military leaders have said they will use their limited
funds to maintain the nuclear forces, but Ilyukhin and others say
this policy also is failing for lack of money.

Amnesty International criticizes Thai execution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Amnesty International criticized
Thailand Monday for secretly executing a former police officer who
killed a man and women and wounded fellow officers with a hand
grenade when they tried to arrest him.
	   Supoj Pengklai, a former police master sergeant, was executed
Thursday by gunfire at Bang Kwang maximum security prison in
Bangkok. He was convicted of murder two years ago.
	   ``Amnesty International is very disturbed to learn that an
execution took place on Oct. 29, 1998,'' said Donna Guest,
spokeswoman for the London-based human rights group. ``It appeared
that the execution was done in secrecy, as it appeared in the press
two days later.''
	   The execution was the fourth in the past two years following an
eight-year hiatus, though death sentences are handed down
regularly. Most are reduced on appeal in the courts or by royal
pardon.
	   A new constitution passed a year ago prohibits torture and cruel
or inhuman punishment but allows the death penalty. Execution by
shooting, introduced in 1935, has been carried out 279 times.

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Euphoric supporters of an opposition
coalition danced in the streets till dawn Monday, celebrating an
overwhelming victory over the incumbent former Communists in
parliamentary elections.
	   Honking car sirens and waving flags in the party's red and
yellow, up to 10,000 people poured into the streets of Macedonia's
capital Skopje shortly after midnight, following an announcement
from the coalition's election headquarters that it had won 59 of
120 parliament seats.
	   Initial unofficial results released early Monday indicated the
incumbents secured 29 seats, while a coalition of two major ethnic
Albanian parties secured 24 seats.
	   Final official results from the first round of voting Oct. 18
and Sunday were expected later Monday.
	   The final outcome of the elections could affect NATO's plans to
verify the Yugoslav troop pullback in neighboring Serbia's Kosovo
province.
	   NATO wants to use Macedonia as a base for its aerial
surveillance of the province. It also wants to station a security
force to protect the 2,000-member ground verification force in
Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian province of the Yugoslav
republic of Serbia.
	   During the election campaign, the opposition coalition said it
opposed the stationing of foreign military forces in Macedonia.
After the first round, however, it appeared to soften that
position, saying it would maintain ``continuity'' in international
agreements reached by the current government.
	   Although the unofficial tallies carried by independent media
late Sunday were based on party observers at the polls from both
the opposition and the ruling Social Democrats, no dramatic
last-minute twists were likely.
	   Shortly after midnight, incumbent premier Branko Crvenkovski
appeared on state-run TV to concede defeat. He said his Social
Democratic alliance had ``already proven to be a responsible
leader'' and promised ``tough opposition in parliament.''
	   ``We already have the next government,'' the coalition's leader
Ljupco Georgievski, poised to become the next premier, told the
crowd gathered in Skopje's central square,
	   Georgievski's coalition, made up of the Internal Macedonian
Revolutionary Organization-Democratic Party for Macedonian National
Unity and Democratic Alternative needs two more seats to hold a
majority in the parliament. It has promised to institute economic
reforms and a better standard of living.
	   The coalition leader was convinced these would be secured in
counting the final ballots. Failing this, the small Liberal Party,
which has 4 seats so far, could join the alliance.
	   The main issues were Macedonia's weak economy and disputes with
neighbors Bulgaria, Albania and Greece. The average monthly salary
is dlrs 210, and unemployment is at 30 percent.
	   Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia six years ago,
the only former republic to have done so without a war. But
tensions are high due to a large ethnic Albanian community and a
border with Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians have been fighting for
independence.
	   Ethnic Albanians make up 23 percent of Macedonia's 2.2 million
people.

Taiwan stresses China ties, but vows diplomatic offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Taiwanese leaders sent mixed signals to
mainland China Monday, calling for closer ties while also saying
they will resume overseas trips by high-ranking officials _ a move
certain to anger Beijing.
	   President Lee Teng-hui, known for his scathing attacks on
Beijing's territorial claim to Taiwan, said links with China need
as much attention as economic and political development.
	   ``We'll keep questing for mutual trust and increase friendly
interaction, making relations between the two sides the driving
force behind overall national development,'' Lee told an official
conference on China policy.
	   Lee's statement seemed to express greater commitment to
improving relations with China following a meeting between top
negotiators for the two sides last month. But his conciliatory
remarks were followed by another announcement that Taiwan would
resume visits abroad by high-level officials, always a sore point
with Chinese leaders.
	   Vice Foreign Minister David Lee accused China of ``superpower
posturing'' to isolate Taiwan, while lacking ``sincerity and
neighborliness.''
	   ``In future, our government will continue high-level visits to
exchange views with foreign leaders and high officials, raising our
international visibility and combating China's plot to isolate
us,'' David Lee told the conference.
	   Taiwan will persist in efforts to join the United Nations and
other international organizations, while seeking better relations
with countries that now recognize mainland China's sovereignty.
	   Claiming strong public support for its policies, Taiwan argues
that overseas diplomacy and contacts with China must be pursued
jointly.
	   But Taiwan had reportedly suspended a pair of visits by Vice
President Lien Chan in a bid to sweeten the atmosphere when
negotiators for the two sides met in Shanghai last month for the
first time in three years.
	   Although the negotiators agreed to move toward restarting talks
that were broken off by China in 1995, Chinese officials indicated
they will press ahead with their campaign to isolate Taiwan
diplomatically.
	   Since the two sides were separated in a civil war in 1949, they
have fought hard over diplomatic recognition. China has recently
gained the upper hand.
	   Last week, the Pacific island kingdom of Tonga switched its
recognition to Beijing, the third Taiwanese ally to desert it this
year.
	   Taiwan claimed Tonga was lured away by Beijing's offer to help
fund its satellite program. Foreign Minister Jason Hu accused China
Monday of ``dollar diplomacy.''
	   ``We don't have those resources. But we're faced with an
opponent who is using incredible resources in aid of dollar
diplomacy,'' Hu told reporters upon his return from a visit to
Middle East countries that have no official ties with Taiwan.
	   Hu said he visited Jordan and other countries, but he wouldn't
elaborate, citing concerns over China's reaction to his hosts.

Iraq refuses to back down, U.S. leaves military option open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with parliament vote, new quotes by Aziz; CHANGES
headline. &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The latest Iraqi crisis is developing with
alarming familiarity.
	   In defying the U.N. Security Council, Iraq says it does not want
a confrontation but only its rights. The United States hopes to act
with U.N. allies to resolve the crisis but will not rule out a
military strike on its own.
	   On Monday, the 250-member National Assembly _ dominated by Iraq
leader Saddam Hussein's Baath Party _ gave an expected unanimous
endorsement to the government decision Saturday to halt all work of
U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told the parliament that the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of arms inspections was being
``used by the United States and Israel to execute their aggressive
schemes against Iraq.''
	   He said Iraq would not reverse its stand unless the U.N.
Security Council ensured a promised review of Iraq's weapons
systems would lead to a lifting of punishing trade sanctions on the
country.
	   ``Any comprehensive review will not succeed unless it is
structured on a clear basis,'' Aziz said.
	   Saadoun Khalifa, a member of the National Assembly, told
reporters the government's action had the people's backing. ``I am
sure that all Iraqi people are in full support with this
decision,'' he said.
	   Aziz's rhetoric and parliament vote showed the crisis that began
with Iraq's decision Saturday _ and the Security Council
condemnation of it _ is headed in the same direction as last
winter's confrontation.
	   The only difference, so far, is that the United States is not
rushing warships and planes to the Gulf.
	   The next step may come after President Clinton meets with his
foreign policy team today in Washington to discuss the Iraq
situation.
	   National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said Sunday that
``all options remain on the table.'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Washington prefers to act with its allies but will not
rule out unilateral military action.
	   For now, however, there seemed little chance of an immediate
military response.
	   On Sunday, Clinton expressed satisfaction that Russia and
France, which earlier leaned toward easing U.N. sanctions on Iraq,
joined the Security Council in denouncing Saddam's latest defiance.
	   ``I personally am very pleased that the U.N. Security Council,
including some people I thought had been a little tolerant with him
in the past, strongly condemned what he did,'' Clinton said in a
radio interview.
	   In Baghdad, officials already are saying Iraq can withstand a
U.S. attack.
	   ``Iraq does not fear the threat of the United States because it
has been threatening Iraq for the past eight years,'' Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan told reporters Sunday.
	   His comments echoed last January's mood when the United States
and Britain sent forces to the Gulf in preparation for an attack.
That crisis ended with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reaching a
compromise with Iraq.
	   Saddam's government had hoped that pact would lead to the
lifting of the sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which have limited Iraqi oil sales and destroyed the
country's economy.
	   On Sunday, Aziz laid out Iraq's demands for renewing cooperation
with the arms inspectors who must ensure that Iraq has eliminated
its weapons systems before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   Along with a promise that sanctions will be lifted, Iraq wants
the U.N. Special Commission reconstituted and commission chairman
Richard Butler fired, Aziz said.
	   He renewed charges that the arms inspectors were ``a
subsidiary'' of Israeli and American intelligence, a reference to
recent revelations that inspectors consulted both Israel's Mossad
and the CIA in seeking Iraq's weapons sites.
	   Aziz said, however, that Iraq would not order the arms
inspectors to leave Iraq. In New York, Butler said he had no
intention of pulling his teams out and suggested a compromise was
still possible.

Swiss hold U.S.-Egyptian citizen over credit card fraud
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A dual citizen of the United States
and Egypt is under arrest in Switzerland on charges of credit card
fraud, Zurich state police said Monday.
	   The 41-year-old man, who was not identified, was stopped at
Zurich airport in April after a tip from airline employees, a
police statement said.
	   He is wanted in the United States for use of stolen and forged
credit cards and robbery, and a U.S. request for his extradition is
pending.
	   The suspect was given a 10-month jail sentence for credit card
fraud in Geneva in 1996 and deported, Zurich police said. Spokesman
Hans Leuenberger said he had no details on where the man lived.
	   He had frequently been seen on flights from Amsterdam to Cairo
via Zurich, Leuenberger added.
	   One of the credit cards the man was carrying was overdrawn by
70,000 francs (dlrs 51,900). The suspect is accused of making
illegal purchases to the value of more than 200,000 Swiss francs
(dlrs 148,000), police said.
	   The five cards used all had a credit limit between dlrs 250 and
dlrs 350.
	   Most of the purchases were made at airport duty-free shops and
on board airplanes, where crew members noticed frequent purchases
he made with different credit cards.

Thai police find two women, one dead, in car trunk
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Robbers seized two maids who
interrupted a burglary, stuffed them into the trunk of a
Mercedes-Benz sedan and then drove it into a canal, killing one of
them, police said Monday.
	   The surviving maid, identified only as Yee, 14, was heard
shouting for help from the partially submerged vehicle six hours
later, and was rescued. Her colleague, Siriwan Parinatang, 40, was
dead.
	   Police were unclear as to whether Siriwan died of drowning or
from injuries suffered after the robbers took the housekeepers
captive Saturday evening when the two returned from shopping and
stumbled on the burglary at their employer's home.
	   A villager spotted the back of the car sticking out of the canal
50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Bangkok. Yee was screaming, her
hands and legs bound, when police arrived and opened the trunk.
	   The burglars escaped with about 5 million baht (dlrs 136,000)
worth of cash and valuables.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES at stumps on day three &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Nasser Hussain put aside seeing blood on
the pitch to post England's first century of the Ashes tour in the
first-class match against Western Australia on Monday.
	   Hussain came in to bat on Sunday after opener Mark Butcher was
hit above his right eye and was forced to retire hurt with a gash
which required 10 stitches.
	   Hussain admitted he saw Butcher's blood on the ground as he
began his innings. After reaching 93 on Sunday Hussain converted
the innings into a century Monday before falling for 118.
	   Hussain, who scored a double hundred on Australia's last tour of
England, brought up his century with a hooked boundary. He reached
the milestone in 271 minutes, off 229 balls, with 14 fours.
	   Butcher was unable to bat and England's innings finished at 321
for nine in reply to Australia's 334 for eight declared.
	   Matthew Nicholson, playing just his fourth first-class match and
fourth since 1996 because of chronic fatigue syndrome, took 7-77 in
England's innings.
	   Batting a second time, Western Australia was 1-170 at stumps on
the third day of the four-day game for a lead of 183.
	   Ryan Campbell, missed early by substitute fieldsman Mike
Atherton off Darren Gough, pounded an unbeaten 117 from only 121
deliveries and Justin Langer was 23.
	   Meanwhile, England captain Alec Stewart, who was forced to miss
the match because of a back injury, had his first session in the
nets for three days Monday.
	   ``If the match had started today and I had woken up feeling like
this then I would have probably played,'' Stewart said. ``I'm
hoping to have another net this afternoon and hopefully I'll be
back to 100 percent tomorrow.''
	   Butcher was still feeling the effects of being struck on the
head. He came to the WACA Ground on Monday but returned to the
hotel as his eye began to close and he suffered headaches.
	   ``I didn't realize the problem immediately,'' Butcher said of
being struck by the second ball of the innings. ``I didn't feel too
bad and then I saw the blood and realized I was in a little
difficulty.''

Russian delegation to meet Iraqi leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian parliamentary delegation was to meet
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Monday and hand over humanitarian
aid and medicines to Iraq, news reports said.
	   Few details were released about the talks, which come in the
wake of Iraq's decision to cut off all work with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The Russian delegation, headed by deputy speaker of parliament's
lower house, Mikhail Gutseriyev, arrived in Baghdad on Saturday,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The lawmakers will also discuss Russia's participation in the
U.N. oil-for-food program _ an exemption to economic sanctions
against Iraq _ during a meeting with Iraq's Oil Minister Lt. Gen.
Amir Mohammed Rashid.
	   The Russian government has urged Iraq to comply with U.N.
resolutions calling for the dismantling of the country's weapons of
mass destruction. Russia also denounced Iraq's decision Saturday to
ban arms inspectors from working in the country.
	   However, Moscow is sympathetic to the Arab nation and has also
called for an early lifting of sanctions against Iraq.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons before the U.N. Security
Council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in
1990.

Five Hong Kong soccer players charged with match-fixing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's top anti-corruption agency charged
five Hong Kong soccer players Monday with fixing matches, including
a World Cup qualifying match against Thailand last year.
	   The Independent Commission Against Corruption said Lee Wai-man,
Lok Kar-win and Chan Chi-keung were charged with conspiring with
fellow player Chan Tsz-kong to obtain 200,000 Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 25,641) from a bookmaker to lose 2-0 to Thailand in
March 1997.
	   Chan Tsz-kong was jailed for one year in July on the
match-fixing charges after he pleaded guilty.
	   Both Hong Kong and Thailand failed to qualify for the World Cup
finals in France in June.
	   Wai Kwan-lung was charged with accepting 30,000 Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 3,846) from Chan Tsz-kong for failing to perform
to the best of his ability in the match against Thailand, the
commission said.
	   Lau Chi-yuen was charged with fixing four matches involving Hong
Kong's first division Sing Tao team during the 1995-1996 soccer
season.
	   All five players are to appear in court Tuesday.

Police search door to door arresting 70 people
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ZAHID HUSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Paramilitary troops and police searched
door to door Monday arresting at least 70 people believed to be
behind the violence wracking this southern port city.
	   A city-wide police crackdown began last Friday after Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif dismissed the Sindh provincial government and
imposed federal rule.
	   He accused his former coalition partners in the provincial
government -- the Muttaheda Qami Movement -- of harboring the
killers of Hakim Said, a prominent physician and vocal critic of
the MQM.
	   More than 200 people have been arrested since Friday and the
Interior Minister Shujaat Hussein said police have a list of as
many as 7,000 suspected troublemakers, who may be arrested in the
coming weeks.
	   This is likely to require additional security forces, officials
said. They said the government was preparing to recruit another
16,000 paramilitary Rangers to patrol Karachi's troubled streets.
Currently 16,000 Rangers and 28,000 police are available to patrol
the violent streets of Karachi.
	   Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh, has been at the center
of a bitter feud between rival factions of the minority ethnic
group, the Muttaheda Qami Movement (MQM).
	   The smaller faction known as Haqiqi and the larger rival group,
named for its exiled leader Altaf Hussein, have turned entire
neighborhoods into battlefields, with heavily armed activists
roaming the streets setting shops and vehicles on fire.
	   An estimated 1,000 people have died so far this year in the
bitter battle for control of the city.
	   The MQM says it represents Urdu-speakers who moved to Pakistan
from India in 1947, when British colonial rule of the subcontinent
ended.
	   It wasn't immediately known whether the recent arrests involved
activists from either faction.
	   ``Most of the people who have been arrested are innocent,'' said
Nasim Jalil, a spokeswoman for Hussein's MQM faction.
	   On Sunday Haqiqi supporters burned dozens of shops and blocked
roads with smoldering vehicles to protest the arrest of their
workers.
	   Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto condemned Sharif's
crackdown and the dismissal of the Sindh provincial government. She
warned of a civil war brewing in the southern port city.
	   Sharif was in Karachi on Monday holding meeting with senior
officials.

Palestinians strike to protest peace deal with Israel

<TEXT>
	   SIDON, Lebanon (AP) _ Palestinians burned Israeli and American
flags at Lebanon's largest refugee camp Monday to protest the
U.S.-brokered peace accord with Israel.
	   Carrying Palestinian flags and chanting anti-Israeli slogans,
they marched at the teeming refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh on the
outskirts of the port city of Sidon in southern Lebanon.
	   They set fire to car tires at one of the entrances to the camp,
home to 70,000 people and the largest of Lebanon's 13 refugee
camps.
	   Schools, shops and businesses at the camp were closed briefly to
observe a strike called by a coalition of radical Palestinian
factions. A statement from the groups said the action was meant
``to condemn the Wye Plantation agreement'' signed in Washington.
	   The coalition is made up of factions such as the Marxist Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, which oppose Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat's 1993 peace accords with Israel.
	   Supporters of Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction at Ein el-Hilweh
did not join the strike.
	   In the Lebanese capital, Beirut, about 200 Palestinians marched
at the Shatila refugee camp, carrying pamphlets saying, ``No to
Arafat, No to Netanyahu and No to Wye Plantation agreement.''
	   The Wye Plantation accord was signed in Oct. 23 by Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It calls for an Israeli
withdrawal from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank in
exchange for a Palestinian security crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   Many Arabs and Palestinians have criticized the deal as a
sell-out. Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are fearful Arafat's
peace will not lead to their return to their old villages, many now
in Israel, or get them to Palestinian-controlled territory.
	   Similar protests against the Wye accords were held at refugee
camps in northern and eastern regions of Lebanon. There are some
350,000 Palestinians living in the country's 13 refugee camps.

Iraq refuses to back down, U.S. leaves military option open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with parliament vote, new quotes by Aziz; CHANGES
headline. &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The latest Iraqi crisis is developing with
alarming familiarity.
	   In defying the U.N. Security Council, Iraq says it does not want
a confrontation but only its rights. The United States hopes to act
with U.N. allies to resolve the crisis but will not rule out a
military strike on its own.
	   On Monday, the 250-member National Assembly _ dominated by Iraq
leader Saddam Hussein's Baath Party _ gave an expected unanimous
endorsement to the government decision Saturday to halt all work of
U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told the parliament that the
U.N. Special Commission in charge of arms inspections was being
``used by the United States and Israel to execute their aggressive
schemes against Iraq.''
	   He said Iraq would not reverse its stand unless the U.N.
Security Council ensured a promised review of Iraq's weapons
systems would lead to a lifting of punishing trade sanctions on the
country.
	   ``Any comprehensive review will not succeed unless it is
structured on a clear basis,'' Aziz said.
	   Saadoun Khalifa, a member of the National Assembly, told
reporters the government's action had the people's backing. ``I am
sure that all Iraqi people are in full support with this
decision,'' he said.
	   Aziz's rhetoric and parliament vote showed the crisis that began
with Iraq's decision Saturday _ and the Security Council
condemnation of it _ is headed in the same direction as last
winter's confrontation.
	   The only difference, so far, is that the United States is not
rushing warships and planes to the Gulf.
	   The next step may come after President Clinton meets with his
foreign policy team today in Washington to discuss the Iraq
situation.
	   National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said Sunday that
``all options remain on the table.'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Washington prefers to act with its allies but will not
rule out unilateral military action.
	   For now, however, there seemed little chance of an immediate
military response.
	   On Sunday, Clinton expressed satisfaction that Russia and
France, which earlier leaned toward easing U.N. sanctions on Iraq,
joined the Security Council in denouncing Saddam's latest defiance.
	   ``I personally am very pleased that the U.N. Security Council,
including some people I thought had been a little tolerant with him
in the past, strongly condemned what he did,'' Clinton said in a
radio interview.
	   In Baghdad, officials already are saying Iraq can withstand a
U.S. attack.
	   ``Iraq does not fear the threat of the United States because it
has been threatening Iraq for the past eight years,'' Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan told reporters Sunday.
	   His comments echoed last January's mood when the United States
and Britain sent forces to the Gulf in preparation for an attack.
That crisis ended with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reaching a
compromise with Iraq.
	   Saddam's government had hoped that pact would lead to the
lifting of the sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, which have limited Iraqi oil sales and destroyed the
country's economy.
	   On Sunday, Aziz laid out Iraq's demands for renewing cooperation
with the arms inspectors who must ensure that Iraq has eliminated
its weapons systems before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   Along with a promise that sanctions will be lifted, Iraq wants
the U.N. Special Commission reconstituted and commission chairman
Richard Butler fired, Aziz said.

Irish premier seeks progress in Northern Ireland impasse

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Seamus Mallon, RECASTS and trims

 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern traveled to Northern Ireland on Monday to promote progress on
the province's increasingly troubled peace accord.
	   Ahead of Ahern's round-table gathering with Protestant and
Catholic negotiators, the Catholic politician elected to help lead
Northern Ireland's still-unformed coalition government warned that
the two camps cannot afford to let events drift any farther.
	   Seamus Mallon and Protestant leader David Trimble had been
expected by now to have formed the multi-party administration for
Northern Ireland envisaged in April's accord.
	   On Monday, he cited Saturday's fatal shooting of a Catholic
civilian by Protestant extremists as a worrying symptom of a
deteriorating political atmosphere.
	   ``Inertia is the biggest danger to any process. And there's no
reason for it,'' said Mallon, deputy leader of the north's major
Catholic-supported party, the moderate Social Democratic and Labor
Party.
	   ``We must move this forward, we must do it quickly, and in a way
that we can reassure the community that those people who committed
that dreadful murder are not going to write the agenda for all of
us,'' he said.
	   Several important parts of the agreement already have begun
operating.
	   In June, Northern Ireland's voters elected a new legislative
Assembly, and its members in July appointed Trimble and Mallon to
become the top two ministers in a wider administration.
	   But the administration's potential 10 other posts have gone
unfilled because Protestant members of the otherwise-powerless
Assembly are refusing to admit Sinn Fein unless the party's Irish
Republican Army allies start disarming _ something the outlawed
group refuses to do.
	   That already has meant the failure to meet one important
deadline in the accord, an inaugural summit by Oct. 31 between the
new Northern Ireland governing structure and Ahern's government.
	   Instead, Ahern arrived at the Assembly's base in east Belfast to
discuss, in a less formal framework, the same matters that would
have been on their summit agenda anyway _ areas for joint
policy-making between both parts of Ireland.
	   The agreement specified that the Irish and Northern Ireland
governments should identify up to 12 subjects of shared concern,
such as agriculture and transportation links, and establish joint
committees to promote common policies on each.
	   Catholic politicians bill this approach as likely to promote the
logic of Ireland's eventual unification.
	   Trimble, whose Ulster Unionist Party until recent years bluntly
rejected any Irish government role in Northern Ireland _ and would
have boycotted any visit by an Irish prime minister _ now presents
this agenda as purely practical and unlikely to develop momentum
towards unification.
	   Trimble is hoping Ahern will put pressure on Sinn Fein to
deliver an actual start to IRA disarmament. Sinn Fein leader Gerry
Adams is hoping Ahern will tell Trimble that his position is
unrealistic and undermining the IRA's 15-month-old truce.

Hamas activist identified as suicide bomber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution throughout, quotes from Palestinian
police commander, CORRECTS that assailant was 19, sted 22 &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian police commander on
Monday identified the suicide bomber in last week's attack on
Israeli school children as a 19-year-old activist in the Islamic
militant group Hamas.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, the commander, Brig.
Gen. Ghazi Jabali, also defended a decision to place the founder of
the Islamic militant group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house
arrest and disconnect his telephones.
	   Yassin had to be silenced because he relentlessly criticized the
new Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and was getting directions
from the outside, including Iran, Jabali said.
	   ``Sheik Yassin ... says many things against the agreement and he
received telephone calls from the outside, from Tehran, from many
countries,'' Jabali said. ``So we took this decision, the house
arrest, to protect Ahmed Yassin from Ahmed Yassin.''
	   The restrictions on Yassin were imposed as part of a crackdown
on Hamas triggered by Thursday's suicide attack in which an
assailant rammed a car packed with explosives into an Israeli jeep
escorting a school bus. Forty children on the bus escaped unharmed,
but a soldier was killed, along with the assailant.
	   Jabali praised the slain soldier for trying to save the
children. ``He (the soldier) is a hero. He did many things for our
people,'' Jabali said, referring to speculation that had there been
more casualties, the attack might have held up the implementation
of the new peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists, including senior leaders, have
been arrested since the attack.
	   Asked about threats by Hamas against the Palestinian Authority,
Jabali said his men were under orders to open fire if they felt
their lives were being endangered.
	   ``If anyone is going to attack him (a police officer) and shoot
him, he should defend himself,'' Jabali said.
	   On Sunday, the military wing of Hamas, Izzedine al Qassam, said
in a leaflet that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had ``reached
the point of treason'' by moving against Hamas.
	   A senior Hamas figure, Ismail Hanieh, said Monday that the
leaflet was not authentic and that the group wanted to avoid civil
war at all costs. It is not unusual for Hamas to issue conflicting
statements since the shadowy group is broken up into small cells
that often don't know of each others' activities.
	   Last week's suicide bomber was identified as 19-year-old Suhib
Timraz, a resident of the Jebaliya refugee camp near Gaza City,
	   Timraz was a low-level member in Hamas, police said.
	   Timraz' father was a leading figure in the Muslim brotherhood, a
forerunner of Hamas, and was arrested by Israeli security forces in
1983, along Yassin. The elder Timraz was released in 1985 as part
of a prisoner swap.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed higher across the
board Monday, with prices surging in Tokyo on word of a possible
alliance between two of Japan's largest banks. Tokyo's benchmark
225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 388.24 points, or 2.86 percent,
closing at 13,952.75. On Friday, the average had fallen 104.21
points, or 0.76 percent. Traders said investors pushed up heavily
weighted banking shares after Fuji Bank Ltd. and Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank Ltd. said Saturday that they may form a strategic alliance in
trust banking operations. Shares also closed higher in Singapore,
New Zealand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Australia, Thailand and
South Korea. Shares prices closed little changed in moderate
trading in Hong Kong. Markets in the Philippines were closed for a
holiday. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The cash-strapped Russian government on Monday
moved to auction off a 5 percent stake in one of its most valuable
assets _ the natural gas monopoly Gazprom. President Boris Yeltsin,
who was recovering from his latest illness at a the Black Sea
resort of Sochi, issued a decree approving the auction and allowing
foreign investors to take part. No date was set. The government has
repeatedly postponed the sale because the Russian stock market
crashed so dramatically this year. The government is therefore
likely to get less than it wanted for selling shares in the world's
largest gas company. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Citigroup president Jamie Dimon is leaving in a
restructuring of the corporate finance operations of the nation's
biggest financial services company. Citigroup will integrate the
corporate banking operations of Citibank with the Salomon Smith
Barney investment firm as it attempts to refocus its global
strategy, the company said Sunday. The move does not involve
Citigroup's consumer banking operations. Deryck Maughan, the other
co-CEO of Salomon Smith Barney, was appointed a vice chairman of
Citigroup. Citigroup last month reported a third-quarter loss of
dlrs 336 million in income from corporate businesses, excluding
investment activities, compared with a gain of dlrs 1.04 billion in
the year-ago quarter. (US-CITIGROUP RESTRUCTURING)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's top economics minister
called on local debtors and foreign creditors Monday to restructure
a massive private debt mountain, saying a deal was needed to curb
rising poverty and unemployment. More than 1,000 Indonesian
business executives, international lenders and others gathered in
the capital city Monday for a World Bank-sponsored conference aimed
primarily at promoting the Jakarta Initiative, a corporate debt
restructuring plan. The sprawling Southeast Asian island country
has suffered from its worst economic crisis in 30 years. Soaring
prices, mass unemployment and millions of additions to the ranks of
the poor have raised the potential for civil unrest.
(INDONESIA-DEBT CONFERENCE)
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ President Kim Dae-jung expressed hope
Monday that deals struck by South Korea's largest conglomerate with
North Korea would spur economic exchanges and help ease tension on
the peninsula. Kim made the remarks after hearing from Chung
Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai group, on his just concluded trip
to North Korea, during which he discussed joint ventures in the
isolated communist country. During a five-day visit that ended
Saturday, Chung met North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and won his
support for a series of joint venture projects Hyundai is pushing
in the North. (KOREAS-HYUNDAI)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Prodding China to open up its markets to
more imported goods, the head of the European Union said Monday
that economic liberalization is the only way to ride out the Asian
financial crisis. Opening markets and creating a more easily
understood legal system and investment rules would attract foreign
money and technology, EU President Jacques Santer said in a speech
to an audience of European businesspeople. Santer, who is on a
six-day visit to China, said he conveyed that message in meetings
Friday in Beijing with President Jiang Zemin, Premier Zhu Rongji
and legislative head Li Peng. (CHINA-EU)
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Intent on scaling back bloated
production facilities, Dutch electronics giant Royal Philips
Electronics NV said Monday it will close about a third of its
factories worldwide. Philips spokesman Ben Geerts said the company
had already announced in March that it would examine its industrial
infrastructure. The company, Europe's largest consumer electronics
group, had ``built too big a production capacity for
requirements,'' Philips President Cor Boonstra was quoted as saying
in Monday's editions of the Financial Times. It was not immediately
clear whether employees at the targeted factories would be laid off
or reassigned. (NETHERLANDS-PHILIPS)

Official say kidnapped Italian priest is alive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ A regional governor said Monday a
kidnapped Italian priest is alive, despite reports he had died in
captivity due to poor health.
	   Police said Sunday they were checking unconfirmed reports that
the Rev. Luciano Benedetti had died recently, but teams sent to dig
at his supposed burial site found nothing.
	   Nur Misuari, a former Muslim separatist rebel chief now serving
as governor of a southern autonomous Muslim region, said emissaries
who have contact with the abductors told him Benedetti was alive.
	   Misuari is helping the government negotiate for the release of
Benedetti and other foreign and Filipino captives still in the
hands of kidnap gangs in the southern region of Mindanao.
	   Benedetti, 54, from Treviso, was kidnapped Sept. 8 by suspected
Muslim rebels in Sibuco town in Zamboanga del Norte province, about
50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Zamboanga City. The
kidnappers demanded a ransom of 7 million pesos (dlrs 175,000),
police said.
	   At least 15 people have been kidnapped in the southern
Philippines since last month. Benedetti was among five foreigners
and five Filipino traders still being held by their captors in the
region.
	   Government troops launched an offensive Friday against a
suspected rebel lair in Sulu province, also in Mindanao, to try to
rescue two kidnapped Hong Kong citizens and a Malaysian.
	   Military officials said the three captives have not been found.
At least three civilians, believed to be sympathizers of the
kidnappers, have been killed in sporadic gunfights between the
troops and the suspected abductors.
	   President Joseph Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign
against ransom kidnappings and scored a major victory last month
with the rescue of several kidnapping victims and the arrest of
their abductors in Manila.
	   On Monday, police announced the arrest of three more suspects in
the abduction of a Filipino-Chinese store owner, his two children
and a nephew in suburban Quezon City in February.
	   Estrada promised upon taking office in June to end the
kidnappings within six months.

While Yeltsin rests, critics launch new attacks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 4-7 with Yeltsin's spokesman responding to
criticism. New 12th graf with status of impeachment effort. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ While Boris Yeltsin rested at a Black Sea resort,
his critics launched a new round of attacks against the president
Monday and again called for his resignation.
	   ``The president is not governing. He is not responding to the
citizens. He has degraded and is drinking so much that he is unable
to fulfill his duties,'' Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov
was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   ``We insist on an immediate medical checkup of the president and
I'm sure the doctor's conclusion will be that which is already
known to the whole nation,'' he added.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin lashed back at Zyuganov for
``insulting the head of state instead of (having) a civilized
dialogue.''
	   ``The opposition mustn't forget that it owes its very existence
to the democratic reforms carried out by Boris Yeltsin,'' Yakushkin
said, according to the Interfax.
	   Yeltsin began a two-week stay in southern resort of Sochi on
Friday, where he's recovering from what's been described as fatigue
and high blood pressure. The president had been working only
sporadically in recent weeks due to a variety of ailments.
	   Yeltsin had no meetings planned Monday, but was scheduled to
hold talks with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on Tuesday,
Yakushkin said. There was no word on the agenda.
	   The president's most recent illnesses have renewed concerns
about Yeltsin's ability to serve out his term, which runs until the
middle of the year 2000. The president insists he has no serious
health problems.
	   A nationwide poll showed that only 3 percent of Russians had
confidence in Yeltsin, while 89 percent either lacked confidence in
the president, or were undecided.
	   No margin of error was given, but the results were in line with
other recent surveys, which also have put Yeltsin's approval rating
in the low single digits.
	   NTV television, which cited the poll Sunday evening, said it was
carried out by the independent Public Opinion Foundation. A total
of 1,500 people were surveyed.
	   Communists and other hardliners have used Yeltsin's illness to
intensify their calls for his ouster. An impeachment motion against
the president is working its way through parliament, but is given
little chance of success.
	   Yeltsin has handed over some day-to-day duties to Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, the president's staff has said in recent days.
	   Yeltsin's Deputy Chief of Staff Oleg Sysuyev gave several
interviews on the subject last week, but said some of his remarks
were misinterpreted.
	   Britain's Financial Times quoted Sysuyev as saying that Yeltsin
would formally announce the transfer of some of his powers in a
speech to the parliament next year. Sysuyev, speaking on NTV on
Sunday evening, said that was inaccurate.
	   He said Yeltsin had given Primakov control over economic
questions, but claimed Yeltsin's political role will ``only be
strengthening.'' Yeltsin will concentrate on setting up guarantees
for fair elections and launching a constitutional reform, he said.

Frankfurt homeowners begin laying sandbags against swollen Main
</HEADLINE>
River &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ High water moving down the
rain-swollen Main River flooded the historic center of Wertheim on
Monday, while Frankfurt residents began laying sandbags to protect
houses in low-lying areas.
	   About 3,000 people in Wertheim, southeast of Frankfurt where the
Main and Tauber rivers meet, were affected by the flooding. The
water flooded basements and was 60 centimeters (2 feet) deep in
some streets, and officials said it would take a few days before it
receded.
	   Emergency workers downriver in Frankfurt said a street along the
Main and the Eisenersteg pedestrian bridge in the center would
probably be closed Monday night as the high water passes through.
	   Some 30,000 sandbags were ordered to begin protecting houses in
one suburban neighborhood where a tributary joins the Main.
However, officials said they did not expect anywhere near the
levels of 1995's catastrophic flooding.
	   In eastern Germany, ship traffic was stopped on the swollen Elbe
River in Dresden, although officials said the water level was still
below critical levels.
	   Also Monday, divers resumed searching for a 2-year-old boy who
fell into the rushing Holzbach River in North Rhine-Westphalia
state on Sunday.
	   And in Lower Saxony state, special dogs that can smell humans
even under water were called in to help search for two 5-year-old
boys last seen Saturday afternoon playing in a backyard bordering
on the Ilse River near Wolfenbuettel.

Israel calls for international effort to rein in Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Stopping just short of seeking Saddam Hussein's
overthrow, Israel is calling for a world effort to keep Iraq from
acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq has announced it is ceasing cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors and is banning them from visiting sites of suspected
weapons.
	   ``It's very difficult to envision peace in this area with Saddam
Hussein in control of Iraq,'' said David Bar-Illan, an adviser to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel was the target of 39 Iraqi Scud missiles during the 1991
Gulf War. The missiles had conventional warheads, but Israel is
concerned that it might be targeted by chemical or biological
weapons from Iraq in a future conflict.
	   In a statement, the Israeli Foreign Ministry charged Monday that
Iraq is trying to eliminate the U.N. Security Council's ability to
monitor adherence its resolutions following the Gulf war. The
Security Council banned Iraq from possessing non-conventional
weapons and mandated inspection.
	   An Israeli official who insisted on anonymity said Israel is
waiting for the United States to decide what to do before taking
practical steps.
	   Bar-Illan called on the United Nations to do what is necessary
to ``prevent Iraq from becoming not only a regional but an
international threat.''
	   ``This inspection, if anything, must be tighter and closer and
more intensive'' to thwart Iraq's intention of arming itself with
long-range missiles and nuclear weapons ``that can reach not only
Israel but also Europe,'' he said.
	   Sharing Israel's concern, former U.N. weapons inspector Scott
Ritter said Saddam Hussein must be toppled from power. Ritter, who
quit the U.N. inspection team in August, charging the United
Nations was being asked to cover up Iraq's continued weapons
production, told The Associated Press that Saddam Hussein ``is the
problem.''
	   ``He is linked inextricably with these weapons of mass
destruction,'' Ritter said in a telephone interview from his home
in Hastings, New York.

Weizman arrival marks new era in Cyprus-Israel relations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photos available

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - Israeli President Ezer Weizman arrived
for a three-day official visit Monday, marking a new era in
relations between the two countries.
	   It is the first visit by an Israeli president to Cyprus, which
until President Glafcos Clerides's election six years ago had
maintained a pronounced pro-Arab policy and cool relations toward
Israel.
	   Referring to this, Clerides said that ``we have already noted
with big satisfaction a big improvement in these relations during
the last few years.
	   ``Your arrival marks the beginning of a new bright chapter in
the relations between our two countries,'' Clerides said in an
airport welcoming address.
	   Weizman said he was pleased with ``the favorable development of
relations between our two countries. I hope my visit will
contribute to their growing even further.''
	   Noting that both countries ``are suffering from conflicts and
aiming for peace,'' Weizman said the recent Wye agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians was ``a very positive step'' for a
final settlement.
	   ``I hope that soon we will hear that a solution has also been
found to your problem,'' he added.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island after a failed coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   Despite Clerides' warm welcome, both Cyprus and Greece have
expressed concern over Israel's close military ties to Turkey. This
is expected to be one of the main topics of discussion during
Weizman's talks with Clerides.

Central bank chief cautious on predicting Thai upturn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Though the Thai economy is showing some
improvements, the central bank's governor said Monday more time was
needed before he could say the recession has hit bottom and an
upturn could be expected.
	   Bank of Thailand Governor Chatu Mongol Sonakul told reporters
that he believed that statistics released by the central bank
Friday showed decline in some sectors had probably hit rock bottom.
	   But he said he preferred to wait for more economic data over the
next few months before predicting when Thailand will emerge from
recession. The first of Asia's economies to crash last year,
Thailand is being closely watched for signs of being the first to
bounce back.
	   ``We can't really say yet the economy has bottomed out,'' Chatu
Mongol said. ``We shall wait for more data in the next few months
to see a clearer trend.''
	   Friday's figures show that the current and trade accounts are
growing. On Monday, the Commerce Ministry released its consumer
price index for October, showing a 5.9 percent year-on-year
increase, continuing a decline since June.
	   Private analysts interviewed by Dow Jones Newswires agreed that
the two sets of statistics signaled some economic improvement, but
said more measures were needed before the economy could be deemed
healthy.
	   ``We are just about to reach our bottom, but I don't think our
recovery will come fast,'' said Usara Wilaipich, an economist with
Securities One, a finance company.
	   The International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing a dlrs 17.2
billion bailout package for the country, estimates that the economy
will shrink 7 percent this year, Thailand's worst recession in
decades.
	   The trade surplus announced Friday of dlrs 1.27 billion in
September was the biggest since Thailand abandoned fixed exchange
rates July 2, 1997, setting in motion a financial crisis that has
shaken the globe.

Strike shuts Eiffel Tower for third full day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Eiffel Tower -- the most visited monument in
the City of Light -- stood empty for a third full day Monday, with
striking workers refusing to relent on their demand for more
personnel.
	   The press office for the Eiffel Tower refused to predict when
the ``grande dame'' of Paris monuments would reopen its steel
grills to visitors.
	   Workers, mainly hosts and hostesses, went on strike at 4:30 p.m.
(1530 GMT) Friday, shutting out up to 35,000 visitors over the All
Saints Day holiday weekend, and an expected 8,000 visitors on
Monday, a traditionally slow day, the press office said.
	   That adds up to a more than 2 million-franc (dlrs 365,000) loss,
according to a press office spokeswoman, refusing to identify
herself by name.
	   A faxed statement said striking workers are demanding that seven
more people be hired. Management contends that it has hired a
sufficient amount of extra personnel -- 20 part-time workers --
since the start of the 35-hour work week went into effect at the
Tower in April. Five more part-time employees are to be hired at
the beginning of 1999.
	   The 35-hour work week is part of a plan of France's leftist
government to spread jobs around with a shorter work week and
reduce the 11.7 percent unemployment rate.

Romanians lose confidence in authorities, don't vote for mayor

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Despite pleas from politicians and
bounty offered by television stations in exchange for casting a
ballot, Bucharesters overwhelmingly elected not to vote in Sunday's
mayoral elections.
	   Twenty-two candidates ran for mayor of Romania's capital Sunday
in a second round of voting. Some 36 percent of Bucharest's 1.7
million eligible voters cast their ballots, only a few more than in
last week's first round of voting, which was declared invalid due
to low turnout.
	   Yet nine years after communism ended and Romania embarked on the
path to democracy, the low turnout was criticized as a ``vote of
low confidence to all Romanian politicians.''
	   Not even private television stations' prize offerings of houses,
money and umbrellas ``for the hard times ahead'' to those whose
identity cards bore proof of having voted could attract Bucharest
residents to the ballot box.
	   Many of the capitals inhabitants just don't believe that
authorities will do something to benefit ordinary people in the
city of 3 million, plagued by pollution, housing and infrastructure
problems.
	   ``When (politicians) get into office, I believe half their time
is devoted to proper business, and the other half is spent on their
personal affairs or the party they represent,'' said Madalina
Sobaru, a 32-year-old engineer who didn't vote.
	   Aside from corruption believed to taint many politicians, most
of the would-be mayors ran mediocre campaigns, promising little and
concentrating on attacks against their rivals.
	   ``Voter absence is a vote of no-confidence to all Romanian
politicians, a reaction to the signs of confusion, indecision,
incompetence and petty interests which come from them,'' wrote
Bazil Stefan in daily Romania Libera Monday.
	   Voters are to return to the polls next Sunday for a runoff
between incumbent Mayor Viorel Lis, who secured 44.6 percent and
the head of the Municipal Hospital, and Sorin Oprescu, who is
running for the leftist opposition and got 26 percent.
	   The elections became necessary when Bucharest's last elected
mayor Victor Ciorbea became prime minister in 1996. He resigned
from that job in April, quitting the job of mayor at the same time.

Yeltsin allows sale of 5 percent stake in Gazprom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that government may wait until next year
to sell its holdings, and may sell only 3 percent. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree Monday
permitting the cash-strapped Russian government to auction off up
to 5 percent of one of its most valuable assets _ the natural gas
monopoly Gazprom.
	   Yeltsin, who was recovering from his latest illness at a the
Black Sea resort of Sochi, issued a decree approving the auction
and allowing foreign investors to take part. No date was set.
	   However, the Interfax news agency later quoted unidentified
officials as saying that the government may decide not to sell a
stake in Gazprom this year because its stock price has fallen
sharply. If the auction goes ahead, no more than 3 percent of the
company will be sold, it added.
	   The government has repeatedly postponed the sale because it was
hoping to get a better price for selling shares in the world's
largest gas company.
	   But with the International Monetary Fund reluctant to give
Russia more loans, the government has little option but to sell
more shares to pay off its huge debts.
	   The government currently holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares and
said it may gradually reduce its holdings in the company to 25
percent.
	   Private investors, both in Russia and abroad, hold the remaining
shares.
	   Foreign ownership of Gazprom stock has previously been limited
to 9 percent, but the decree signed by Yeltsin raises that limit to
14 percent.
	   Back in August, the Russian government set the starting price
for a 5 percent stake in Gazprom at dlrs 1.65 billion _ more than
double the current international market price.
	   Yeltsin's decree did not say whether the government would
reassess the price, but unidentified officials speaking to Interfax
said the starting price would be ``far below'' dlrs 1 billion.
	   The government's wants to raise badly-needed cash through
privatization auctions. But the country's financial collapse has
scared away foreign investors and driven down the price.
	   The government has already canceled plans to sell stakes in
several state-run oil companies.
	   If the government is unable to raise enough money through taxes,
loans or privatization sales, it may have to print more money to
pay off overdue wages and pensions.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other government officials
have said they will keep money-printing to a minimum to avoid high
inflation.
	   The government on Saturday approved a plan to combat the
economic crisis, including tighter state control over the economy.
The plan has drawn a cool reaction from the IMF.

Asian crisis hits S.African growth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Blaming economic turmoil
spreading from Asia into the world's markets, South Africa on
Monday cut its economic growth predictions.
	   The gloomy news is a further blow to an economy already hit by
high unemployment and the strains of emerging into the global
market place after years of isolation during apartheid.
	   Delivering his mid-term budget policy statement to Parliament,
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said the South African economy would
grow just 0.2 percent in the fiscal year 1998-99, down from the 3
percent predicted before the crisis began.
	   Manuel also said the budget deficit, a figure keenly watched by
investors, would rise to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product in
1998-98 from an original 3.5 percent forecast.
	   ``The slowdown in the world economy and in world trade must
inevitably have an adverse impact on our economy,'' Manuel said.
	   The collapse of the once booming ``Asian Tigers'' has dampened
global demand for the minerals and commodities, especially gold,
that South Africa's economy relies on. About 65 percent of South
African exports are commodity-related.
	   Manuel said South Africa had weathered the financial storm
better than many other developing economies. The country has a
sophisticated banking system and, unlike many Asian firms, South
African companies have mostly avoided getting into heavy debt.
	   Perhaps hoping the worst is over, Manuel predicted a recovery
next year. ``Economic growth is expected to remain subdued in the
second half of 1998, before recovering in 1999,'' he said ``As
external conditions stabilize, economic growth will strengthen.''
	   Manuel's market-friendly economic policy has won the approval of
international investors for its firm fiscal policies and strict
limits on government spending.
	   But with 1999's national election looming, the governing African
National Congress faces increasing pressure from its communist and
labor allies to loosen the purse strings for job creation and
welfare projects.
	   Manuel said current spending on alleviating unemployment and
social services would be protected despite the slowdown, but
signaled he would continue to keep a tight grip on monetary policy.
	   ``We are more conscious than ever before that we cannot spend
our way out of trouble,'' he said.

	   --
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Illegal currency traders speculating on
the value of Congo's new currency will face the death penalty for
war crimes against the government, Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo
has warned.
	   Speaking on Congolese state radio on Sunday, Kongolo said that
anyone suspected of forging notes or illegally trading the national
currency, the Congolese franc, at blackmarket rates will be tried
in a military court.
	   The country's Central Bank had uncovered large sums of
counterfeit currency on the market, he said. The franc was launched
earlier this year to replace the country's failed New Zaire
currency, which collapsed during the rule of the late dictator
Mobutu Sese Seko.
	   Kongolo blamed illegal currency trading on Congo's eastern
neighbors Rwanda and Uganda, which President Laurent Kabila accuses
of masterminding the country's three-month rebel war.
	   --
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Education ministers of the Ivory
Coast and Rwanda have signed an agreement for technical, scientific
and cultural cooperation between the two countries, newspapers
reported Monday.
	   The accord signed Saturday in the Ivorian commercial capital,
Abidjan, would provide for the exchange of teachers, experts and
students as well as mutual research projects, according to the
Abidjan newspaper Soir Info.
	   Addressing reporters after the ceremony, Rwandan Education
minister Jean Pierre Bizimana said Rwanda had facilities to train
only half its 300 university students.
	   His government chose the Ivory Coast because of the human and
material resources readily available for training, Bizimana told
the paper.
	   Rwanda is still trying to recover from the effects of its 1994
genocide when the former Hutu government orchestrated the killings
of minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus during a 90-day
killing spree.
	   The slaughter ended in July 1994 when Tutsi-led rebels seized
power.
	   --
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ An association of eastern and southern
African ports has set up an organization to capture a larger share
of the world's cruise trade for the Indian Ocean, the independent
weekly East African said Monday.
	   At a recent meeting in St. Denis, Reunion, delegates from the
17-member Port Management Associated of Eastern and Southern Africa
created Cruise Indian Ocean to develop a joint marketing strategy
as well as a regional data base on tariffs, port services, shore
excursions and operator listings.
	   The newspaper said at the present time Indian Ocean destinations
_ Mombasa, Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar, Comoros, Seychelles, Mauritius,
Madagascar and Reunion _ account for only 2 percent of the world's
annual cruise market of 7 million passengers.
	   Caribbean islands take 45 percent, followed by the Bahamas and
the Mediterranean with 12 percent each. Mexico, Alaska and Bermuda
are other destinations.
	   --
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ The head of the national malaria
control says two-thirds of rural hospital patients are malaria
sufferers.
	   Dr. Samuel Mabunda said seven in every 100 people die of malaria
in Mozambique because of lack of proper health facilities and
personnel.
	   ``The most affected provinces are Zambezia and Sofala in the
centre, Gaza in the south and Cabo Delgado in the north of the
country,'' he said.
	   Stagnant waters across the country are the main sources of
mosquitos, which spread the disease. Malaria is the third most
fatal disease in Mozambique affecting mainly children and pregnant
mothers. The first two are diarrhea and respiratory infections.
	   --
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A toddler mauled by a lioness
on a game farm outside in the Free State was in stable condition in
a hospital Monday.
	   Two-year-old Tiaan Strydom underwent surgery at Hoogland
Medi-Clinic in Bethlehem after his right calf, thigh and back were
mauled by an adolescent lioness at Camorhi Game Park Sunday.
	   Tiaan's mother, Bernadette Strydom, told South African Press
Association that the fast action of Tiaan's grandfather, David
Windell, had saved the boy's life.
	   Windell was videotaping the family outing when he saw a young
lioness knock Tiaan off his feet and pull him by the foot through a
25-centimeter gap under a fence gate.
	   ``My father threw down the video machine and grabbed Tiaan's
arms to try and pull him away from the animal. At one point it had
its whole mouth around Tiaan,'' Strydom said.
	   While Windell wrestled with the lioness, the boy's father,
Francois, tried to tear open the fence to get into the enclosure
which was locked with a padlock.
	   A game ranger hearing their screams climbed over the fence and
grabbed the lioness around the middle to pull her away from the
boy.

	   MOUNT ATHOS, Greece (AP) _ Rare icons and other religious
objects will be on permanent exhibit at the first museum on Mount
Athos, the all-male Christian Orthodox enclave in northern Greece.
	   The exhibit was inaugurated last week in ceremonies to mark the
1,000-year anniversary of the Mount Athos community, where women
and most female animals are banned, the Macedonian Press Agency
reported Monday.
	   The objects displayed at the Xenophon monastery were part of a
exhibition opened last year in Salonica. Other items, including
Byzantine coins, are expected to be added to the museum collection
later, the agency reported.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The impoverished Russian residents of the Kuril
Islands back a petition that calls for leasing the disputed
territory to Japan for 99 years, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Igor Farkhutdinov, the governor of the Russia's eastern Sakhalin
Island, and the man who also oversees the Kurils, said the petition
drive had shown the depth of the despair over the region's
worsening economic condition.
	   The petition has been supported by the vast majority of the
2,500 adult residents of the Shikotan Island, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Shikotan is the largest of the four islands in the Kuril Chain
that Russia seized from Japan at the end of the World War II.
	   Relations are improving between the countries, but the dispute
over the Kurils has prevented Russia and Japan from signing a peace
treaty formally ending their hostilities.

Thai couple wed 4-year-old twins to dispel bad luck
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai couple held a wedding ceremony
Monday for their 4-year-old twin son and daughter to dispel bad
luck, a television station reported.
	   About 100 guests witnessed the wedding of Kaenpeth and Kaenploy
Kaenchan, conducted according to folk and religious belief that
mixed twins should marry to prevent untimely death. The ceremony
carries no legal standing.
	   The twins wore traditional costumes and performed rituals that
ended with an exchange of a kiss on the cheek. Each received a
diamond ring and 99,999 baht (dlrs 2,702) in cash from relatives.
Many Thais consider nine a lucky number.
	   Samruay Kaenchan, their mother, told Independent Television that
she believed the wedding would serve as a protective measure and
prevent an accident from befalling her children.
	   The twins are not expected to marry each other again when they
grow up, though the ceremony is believed to prevent them from
growing too far apart as they become adults.
	   The ceremony was followed by a reception at the couple's home in
Chon Buri province, about 70 kilometers (50 miles) south of
Bangkok.

Lawyer for German hopes new evidence will clear his client
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCHEHEREZADE FARAMARZI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ German businessman Helmut Hofer remains in
prison, facing death and believing himself a victim of Iran's
divided politics. But his lawyer says he hopes new evidence can
bring a ``divine decree'' that will free his client.
	   Hofer, 54, was convicted of having sex with a 26-year-old
medical student and sentenced to death under Iran's strict Islamic
law since she was a Muslim and he was not. However, he claims he
converted to Islam 10 years ago.
	   A court rejected his claim, saying Hofer never mentioned his
conversion when arrested late last year.
	   But in an interview Sunday, lawyer Malekhoushang Qahari said
documents he has presented to the Supreme Court can prove that
Hofer did indeed convert, paving the way for his release.
	   The 74-year-old Qahari showed a reporter several papers from a
transparent red file that included a document of Hofer's conversion
on April 5, 1988, at the Committee of Islamic Community in the
Bosnian city of Velika Kladusa.
	   In another document, translated from German to Persian, Hofer
wrote to a Catholic Church in Hamburg that he was terminating
payment of taxes, apparently because he no longer belonged to that
church.
	   Qahari said he also possessed a document proving Hofer's divorce
from his Muslim Turkish wife a couple of years ago. He has two sons
from his first marriage.
	   The lawyer said he hopes for an acquittal order soon because
three ``exemplary, God-loving and God-fearing'' judges are
presiding over the case.
	   ``I believe ... the judges in this court will only take the
divine will into consideration,'' Qahari said.
	   ``They have absolutely no political interest,'' he added.
	   Political considerations have been mentioned in the case since
Hofer's death sentence has further strained the chilly relations
between Iran and Germany.
	   Many in Iran believe that Hofer's case reflects infighting in
the fractured Iranian regime, where hard-line factions and
moderates centered around President Mohammad Khatami are vying for
influence. Hard-liners control the powerful judiciary.
	   Some analysts say that hard-liners are against improving ties
with Germany which would bring German business to Iran _ and jobs
for Iranians _ strengthening Khatami's government.
	   While Hofer believes he is a victim of politics, he expects a
fair solution to the case, said Qahari.
	   ``I think he will be freed 100 percent, God willing,'' said
Qahari.
	   He said Hofer, who shares his cell with four or five men at
Tehran's Evin Prison, is treated well and is called ``hajji
Helmut'' by prison officials. A ``hajji'' is someone who has made
the pilgrimage to the holy city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.
	   ``His morale is high,'' said Qahari.
	   He denied that Hofer and Vahideh Qassemi had a sexual
relationship.
	   The two were introduced by a clergyman and another prominent
person in the northeastern city of Mashhad, Qahari said. After two
or three meetings, Hofer proposed to her over a cup of tea in a
hotel lobby.
	   ``My client is a respected man. He didn't come here from a
barren desert to rape. He's a cultured, educated man who wanted to
find a wife,'' said Qahari.
	   He said Hofer's arrest at Tehran's airport was caused because
Hofer does not speak Persian and authorities who questioned him did
not understand German or English.
	   Qassemi, who had gone to the airport to meet Hofer on return
from Germany, drew the attention of officials because some hair was
showing from under her scarf _ a violation of Iran's strict Islamic
dress code.
	   According to the lawyer, Qassemi told an official that she was
waiting for her husband, but then Hofer arrived and said they were
only engaged, causing confusion. ``The official panicked'' and
detained the couple, said Qahari.
	   He said confusion over the case was compounded by a lack of
translation in the early stages, preventing Hofer from explaining
he was a Muslim.
	   ``Mr. Hofer is innocent. He should be cleared of all charges and
deserves an apology,'' said Qahari. ``The laws of the Islamic
Republic, which are inspired from the holy Koran, will not allow
Hofer to be executed. Such a conviction is against the divine
laws.''

Weizman arrival marks new era in Cyprus-Israel relations

<TEXT>
	   LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) - Israeli President Ezer Weizman arrived
for a three-day official visit Monday, marking a new era in
relations between the two countries.
	   It is the first visit by an Israeli president to Cyprus, which
until President Glafcos Clerides's election six years ago had
maintained a pronounced pro-Arab policy and cool relations toward
Israel.
	   Referring to this, Clerides said that ``we have already noted
with big satisfaction a big improvement in these relations during
the last few years.
	   ``Your arrival marks the beginning of a new bright chapter in
the relations between our two countries,'' Clerides said in an
airport welcoming address.
	   Weizman said he was pleased with ``the favorable development of
relations between our two countries. I hope my visit will
contribute to their growing even further.''
	   Noting that both countries ``are suffering from conflicts and
aiming for peace,'' Weizman said the recent Wye agreement between
Israel and the Palestinians was ``a very positive step'' for a
final settlement.
	   ``I hope that soon we will hear that a solution has also been
found to your problem,'' he added.
	   Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot controlled south and
a Turkish-occupied north since 1974 when Turkey invaded and
occupied the northern third of the island after a failed coup by
supporters of union with Greece.
	   Despite Clerides' warm welcome, both Cyprus and Greece have
expressed concern over Israel's close military ties to Turkey. This
is expected to be one of the main topics of discussion during
Weizman's talks with Clerides.

Russian official: Russia must check stocks before seeking aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia may not need foreign food aid this year,
and should not accept any until its takes an inventory of its food
stocks, a Russian agricultural expert was quoted as saying Monday.
	   The government was discussing possible food aid from the United
States during a meeting with U.S. agricultural officials on Monday.
But Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said it was ``too early to
speak of the end of the talks,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   Meanwhile, agriculture expert Leonid Kholod said that before
accepting any assistance, the country should review its food
supplies to see what shortages were likely, and in what regions. He
insisted Russia may not need food aid at all, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   So far, plenty of food has remained in Russia's stores despite
the economic crisis that hit in mid-August. The worst grain harvest
in 40 years and a fall of food imports has caused concerns that
Russia may not have enough food during the winter.
	   Still, accepting food aid is an embarrassing prospect for
Russia, and the government would like to avoid it if possible.
	   Kholod, the economist, also said that Russia would need to
develop a mechanism for distributing food aid.
	   The government does not want food aid to be sold in Russia's
stores at low prices, because it would increase competition to
domestic farmers, but wants it distributed directly to those who
need it.
	   The Russian Agriculture Ministry estimated that Russia's meat
production this year will be down to 1.3 million tons, or 200,000
tons less than in 1997, Interfax reported. Milk production is also
expected to fall 200,000 tons, down to 4.3 million tons, it said.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Defense attorneys for Malaysia's
ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim lost a crucial opening
gambit in his corruption trial Monday.
	   They contended that the jailed dissident's graft charges should
be thrown out because the lower house of Parliament had repealed
the special anti-corruption law before the criminal charges were
filed against Anwar.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul dismissed the defense strategy,
saying that because the law was still under review by the upper
house of Parliament, it was still on the books.
	   The politically charged trial of Malaysia's one-time heir
apparent began amid tight security and under the scrutiny of
international human rights officials.
	   Riot police armed with automatic rifles blocked some 200
supporters of Anwar from reaching the courthouse.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex acts, charges he vehemently denies and says were cooked up to
undermine his growing challenge to the 17-year leadership of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Defense attorneys also called Monday for the judge to hold
Mahathir in contempt of court for tainting the case by saying Anwar
should be convicted.
	   ``You should hold this man for contempt,'' said Raja Aziz
Addruse, who leads a team of nine defense lawyers. Mahathir was
quoted in local papers as saying a conviction would help preserve
racial harmony in the ethnically diverse Southeast Asian country by
easing the growing unrest.
	   Mahathir could be called as one of the 52 witnesses to testify
against Anwar, lawyers said.
	   ``His name is on the list. We believe he might be called,'' said
Kamar Ainiah, a defense lawyer, after the hearing adjourned until
Tuesday afternoon.
	   Demonstrations in support of Anwar have been held regularly
since his arrest Sept. 20. A full-scale riot broke out Oct. 24 when
police fired tear gas at a mosque and people retaliated by throwing
stones and bricks.
	   ``I can't expect a fair trial,'' said Anwar, who was brought
into the courtroom through an underground tunnel.
	   He was pale and gaunt. His sister said he had lost nearly 20
pounds (9 kilograms) during the ordeal.
	   ``I am in good health,'' he told reporters from the dock, where
four policemen stood guard. He hugged his wife and children and was
later seen sharing a candy bar with his wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   He said prison life was not bad, relatively speaking.
	   ``They don't harass and beat me up.''
	   The 51-year-old politician, who has called for political reforms
and Mahathir's resignation, did not wear the neck brace he had
sported during previous court appearances. He had said he was
assaulted by police on his first night in custody, 18 days after
Mahathir fired him.
	   Paul began hearing arguments Monday about four counts of
corruption. Anwar will be tried later for one more charge of abuse
of power and five illegal sex acts.
	   Mahathir, 72, said he fired his deputy on moral grounds because
homosexual acts are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia.
	   More than 100 reporters and international observers hoping to
watch the legal proceedings milled about outside the court
building. The High Court faces Independence Square, where several
pro-Anwar protests have taken place.
	   Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch were among the
groups that sent representatives to the trial.
	   ``We will totally monitor Anwar's trial to examine the nature
and basis of evidence brought against him and to assess the
proceedings in light of international standards on fair trial,''
said Amnesty's Mark Daly.
	   Although the judge dismissed pleas by the defense to accord
special status to observers, representatives of some rights groups
were allowed to sit in the public gallery.
	   Malaysia's Bar Council said later it had been notified that two
of its representatives would be allowed to attend the trial
starting Tuesday.
	   Council President Cyrus Das said in a statement that as the sole
representative of practicing lawyers in the country, it had a duty
to be concerned with the administration of justice in matters of
public importance.
	   At Monday's session, the council, which represents nearly 8,000
lawyers, was furious when its representative was barred.
	   Anwar faces a maximum of 14 years in prison for each of the
corruption charges linked to his alleged abuse of power during his
tenure from 1993 until his dismissal Sept. 2.
	   Each illegal sex charge is punishable by 20 years in prison and
a whipping with a rattan cane.
	   On Nov. 14, the court will break for more than one week as
Malaysia plays host to a meeting of 20 world leaders for the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   The trial was conducted partly in English and partly in the
local Malay language. Paul had initially ruled that the trial would
be conducted in English because of the large number of foreign
observers and media.
	   But last week, the chief justice ordered the trial to be
conducted in the language of majority Malays.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Foreign observers won't have any
special rights to monitor the trial of dissident Anwar Ibrahim, the
High Court judge ruled Monday.
	   ``The presence of these people would interfere with the exercise
of (judicial) powers,'' Judge Augustine Paul said in response to an
appeal by lawyers for Anwar.
	   ``I regret that the application to be observers is an insult to
the court,'' Paul said. ``There is no reason to let foreigners
check us.''
	   Hundreds of foreign reporters and observers have flocked to the
Malaysian capital to watch the trial of the ousted deputy prime
minister and finance minister.
	   Anwar is charged with five counts of corruption and five counts
of sodomy, a crime in this predominantly Muslim country.
	   His case generated international concern after he appeared with
a black eye and bruises during his arraignment. He said he was
beaten by police the night of his arrest Sept. 20.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sept.
2 and has since spearheaded a campaign to oust his former boss. He
says the charges against him were trumped up to quash his growing
challenge to Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   Raja Aziz Addruse, who is leading a team of nine defense
lawyers, asked that the Malaysian Bar Council and six
representatives of international organizations, including United
Nations rapporteur Param Cumaraswamy, be observers at the trial.
	   ``It is totally wrong. Application by international observers is
an alien concept,'' said Paul.
	   Special status for observers would mean reserving seats for them
in the courtroom and allowing them to formally report on the trial.
	   Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, a British jurists'
forum and representatives of Indonesia and the Philippines were
among those who had flown in for the trial.
	   But only a few of them could get into the courtroom after
jostling with reporters and members of Anwar's family at the
doorway. Several got seats in the public gallery but will not be
allowed to formally monitor the trial.
	   Diplomats from the French, Austrian and U.S. embassies were
among those who failed to get in.
	   The Malaysian Bar Council, which represents nearly 8,000
lawyers, was furious when its representative was barred.
	   ``The irony here is you have foreign observers in there,'' said
Mah Weng Kwai, secretary of the council. ``Here we are local and we
cannot observe the trial as representatives of our people.''
	   Later, however, the council said it had been notified that two
of its representatives would be allowed to attend the trial
starting Tuesday.
	   Council President Cyrus Das said in a statement that as the sole
representative of practicing lawyers in the country, it had a duty
to be concerned with the administration of justice in matters of
public importance.

Iran concludes war games on Afghanistan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran concluded on Monday major military
exercises on its border with Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   Some 200,000 troops took part in the maneuvers which began on
Saturday.
	   In the last stage of the maneuvers, held on Iran's eastern
border, fighter bombers and infantry and armored units attacked
mock enemy positions while suspended bridges were installed for the
passage of tanks, the agency quoted Maj. Gen. Ali Shahbazi,
commander of the army, as saying.
	   The goal of the maneuvers was to make it clear that ``any
provocative measure ... will be faced with the strong reaction of
the Iranian army,'' Brig. Gen. Fazlollah Shahin-Rad was quoted as
saying.
	   The exercises _ called Zolfaqar-2 after the sword of Imam Ali,
the son-in-law of Islam's Prophet Mohammed _ took place against a
background of tension with Afghanistan.
	   Iranian-Afghan relations deteriorated sharply in September after
the Taliban militia, which controls most of Afghanistan, admitted
that its forces had killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist
in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But the situation improved in early October after the
intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who shuttled
between Tehran and Kabul and secured the release of 26 Iranians
held captive in Afghanistan.
	   However, several military officials said that troops will remain
stationed in the area although the maneuvers were over.
	   ``As long as concern about acts of sedition and lack of security
in the region exists, the forces deployed in Zolfaqar-2 maneuvers
will remain on the eastern border,'' Shahbazi said.

Moi to visit wounded in northern attack; death toll at 142

<TEXT>
	   GARISSA, Kenya (AP) _ A day after Muslim leaders criticized the
government for failure to act following an attack a week ago in
northeastern Kenya that left 142 dead, an official said Monday
President Daniel arap Moi would visit the wounded.
	   Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu also said an earlier
decision to open hastily made graves to obtain an accurate death
count from the Oct. 24-25 attack had been overturned out of respect
for the Muslim victims.
	   The attack occurred about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of
Wajir at Bagala village. Makhanu said 59 people were still missing,
and seven had been hospitalized in Wajir with serious injuries.
	   He said 39 more graves had been discovered in the area around
Bagala, but he did not say how many more bodies had been found.
	   He blamed rebels of the Oromo Liberation Front from neighboring
Ethiopia for the attack, but he did not offer any proof. At the
same time, he said he did not rule out clan-based banditry as the
cause of the attack.
	   Conflicts over scarce grazing land and access to water in arid
northeastern Kenya are not uncommon among the pastoralist people
who live there.
	   On Sunday, members of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims
opposed exhumation of the bodies, saying it would be an insult to
Muslims whose religion does not permit it.
	   SUPKEM deputy secretary general Ibrahim Lethome said the
government would do better to mobilize security personnel to rescue
the kidnapped and recover stolen livestock.
	   Makhanu said the attackers had been seen herding the 1,785 head
of cattle and 2,075 camels in neighboring Eastern Province. He said
military helicopters and soldiers had been dispatched from Garissa,
the capital of North Eastern Province, and Wajir, 240 kilometers
(150 miles) north, to capture the animals.
	   Moi was expected to travel to Wajir Wednesday to visit the
injured, he said.
	   In a fax to news agencies late last week, the Oromo Liberation
Front denied any role in the attack which it said pitted members of
the Boran and Gabra tribes against Kenyan ethnic Somalis of the
Degodia sub-clan.
	   Instead, the OLF said, the attack was a continuation of an
earlier conflict fostered between the Borana and Degodia by the
Ethiopian government in southwestern Ethiopia, the home of the
Oromo people, who are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia.
	   ``The Ethiopian agents who instigated the conflict in Ethiopia
in 1997 managed to extend it to Kenyan territory,'' the statement
said.
	   Borders drawn by colonial powers cut across ethnic lines in
Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya
	   The OLF seeks independence from Ethiopia for the southern Oromia
region.

	   The agreement was to take effect at midnight Monday, but the
Cabinet will only to discuss it on Tuesday, with no date set for a
vote. Parliament will not vote on the agreement until next week.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank over 12 weeks, with each phase accompanied by
Palestinian security measures. In the first week, no major Israeli
steps are required. The Palestinians are to outline their plan for
fighting Islamic militants to the United States, and several
Israeli-Palestinian committees are to begin meeting.
	   Arafat said he received a call from Netanyahu on Monday. ``He
asked me for some days to delay implementation of what had been
agreed upon,'' Arafat told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. Asked whether he agreed, Arafat said: ``Yes.''
	   U.S. officials said that despite the delay, the timetable should
not be disrupted.
	   ``It is the U.S. position that the schedule would be
unaffected,'' said the U.S. Embassy spokesman, Larry Schwartz.

Russia prepares for launch of International Space Station
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian workers mounted the final piece of
hardware Monday on the first segment of the International Space
Station, which is scheduled to be launched Nov. 20, officials said.
	   The 24-ton Zarya module, built by Russia's Khrunichev company
under contract with the U.S. company Boeing, was equipped with a
nose cap intended to protect it during the launch, the ITAR-Tass
news agency quoted the Krunichev officials as saying.
	   A government panel is expected to review preparations Thursday
for the launch. The Zarya module is to be attached to a Proton
booster rocket in mid-November, several days before the flight.
	   After the Russian launch, which will take place in the former
Soviet republic of Kazakstan, the U.S. space agency NASA is to
follow in December with the launch of the second part, an
American-built passageway.
	   The first crews are not expected to board the International
Space Station until the latter half of 1999 on early in the year
2000.
	   The 16 countries involved in the station have had to delay
construction because of Russia's inability to build its sections on
time.

	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ The tradition-rich Coffe Baum cafe,
where composers Robert Schumann and Richard Wagner once stopped off
for a pick-me-up, reopened Monday after a seven-year, 8 million
mark (dlrs 5 million) renovation.
	   Established in 1720 as the Arabische Coffe Baum (Arabic Coffee
Tree) in the eastern city of Leipzig, it closed in 1991 and two
years later was taken over by the city, which renovated and
restored the entire building.
	   Along with the cafe and restaurant, the site also will include a
coffee museum on two floors with 350 exhibits. It is to open in
January.
	   The Coffe Baum is reputedly the second-oldest cafe-restaurant
still in its original form in Europe, after the Cafe Procope in
Paris.
	   It was famous above all for the sculpture above the doorway,
which shows a Turkish man reclining under a blossoming coffee tree
and extending a cup of coffee to a young boy.

	   The agreement was to take effect at midnight Monday, but the
Cabinet will only to discuss it on Tuesday, with no date set for a
vote. Parliament will not vote on the agreement until next week.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank over 12 weeks, with each phase accompanied by
Palestinian security measures. In the first week, no major Israeli
steps are required. The Palestinians are to outline their plan for
fighting Islamic militants to the United States, and several
Israeli-Palestinian committees are to begin meeting.
	   Arafat said he received a call from Netanyahu on Monday. ``He
asked me for some days to delay implementation of what had been
agreed upon,'' Arafat told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. Asked whether he agreed, Arafat said: ``Yes.''
	   U.S. officials said that despite the delay, the timetable should
not be disrupted.
	   ``It is the U.S. position that the schedule would be
unaffected,'' said the U.S. Embassy spokesman, Larry Schwartz.

Russia says Japanese vessels violated territorial waters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Eight Japanese fishing vessels approached a
disputed island controlled by Russia, but fled before they could be
intercepted by Russian border guard patrols, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Monday.
	   The eight vessels were spotted Sunday by Russian border forces
off Shikotan Island, part of the disputed Kuril Island chain.
	   The Japanese vessels failed to respond to radio messages and
left Russian waters, the report said.
	   The incident happened in the same spot where three Japanese
fishing vessels were detained by Russian patrols last month. The
vessels were expelled after their owners were fined dlrs 15,338
each.
	   Russian complains frequently of incursions by Japanese fishing
vessels and there has been a string of confrontations and
detentions, straining relations between Moscow and Tokyo.
	   Russia captured four islands in the Kuril chain from Japan at
the end of World War II, and the two countries have never signed a
peace treaty. Despite periodic talks in recent years, there have
been no breakthroughs.

Russian official arrested on suspicion of corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ The justice minister of a southern
Russian region was arrested Monday on suspicion of embezzlement of
state funds, police officials said.
	   Tazhutdin Bizhamov, justice minister of Dagestan, has been
formally charged with carrying an unlicensed weapon, the Interior
Ministry press service said.
	   Bizhamov is a suspect in a case involving the alleged
embezzlement of government funds, which is being investigated by a
joint task force from the Interior Ministry, the Federal Security
Service and tax police, the report said.
	   Dagestan, which borders the breakaway republic of Chechnya, is a
restive region plagued by violence and teeming with weapons.

ETA thought it was infiltrated by spies: newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The armed Basque separatist group ETA
declared a ceasefire because it was in disarray after a series of
police raids and believed it was riddled with spies, a newspaper
reported Monday.
	   The newspaper El Pais said ETA, which declared the open-ended
truce on September 16, was also stunned by massive, nationwide
street protests that were triggered by its killing of a young
Basque town councilor in July of 1997 in the Basque country.
	   The paper quoted sources close to the Basque pro-independence
movement and authorities involved in the fight against it, both in
Spain and across the border in France.
	   ETA has been fighting for 30 years to create an independent
Basque homeland straddling parts of northern Spain and southwestern
France. Its bombings and shootings have claimed nearly 800 lives.
	   In a lengthy report on the steps leading to the ceasefire, El
Pais paints a picture of an ETA in decline after a string of police
raids in 1996 and 1997 that broke up key commando groups and saw
the arrest of top ETA members.	   
	   The authorities' success in moving against the organization set
off alarms among ETA leaders, who reportedly concluded the group
had been infiltrated.
	   ``It's all rotten, the whole organization. It's full of holes,
totally infiltrated, at the mercy of moles,'' Jose Javier
Arizkuren, described as an organizer of ETA commando groups, is
quoted as saying in a letter intercepted by French authorities and
passed on to Spain.
	   Arizkuren had been living under surveillance at a farm in
southern France.
	   Early this year ETA was divided between those who wanted to hit
back with violence and others who wanted to declare a truce to put
its house in order and seek other ways of advancing the Basque
nationalist cause, the paper said.
	   The group would go on to hit twice more -- in May and June,
killing two local-level politicians of the ruling Popular Party --
before announcing the truce in September.

	   In new tension in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, meanwhile,
Israeli police scuffled with a senior Palestinian Authority
official, Faisal Husseini, and his bodyguards who were protesting
the construction of a Jewish enclave in the Palestinian
neighborhood of Ras al-Amud.
	   Police clubbed the bodyguards as they clung to Husseini, the top
Palestinian official in Jerusalem. One Palestinian was wrestled to
the ground and screamed in pain as a police officer squeezed his
head.
	   ``It is forbidden for Israel to take unilateral actions,''
Husseini said, breathing quickly after the confrontation with the
police officers. Husseini was referring to a standing U.S. request
that both sides refrain from creating facts on the ground.
	   The United States has been trying to get Israel to stop the
expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Washington also wants to avoid a unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians in May 1999, when the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy ends.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said Monday that the United States
believes it has obtained a verbal assurance from Netanyahu that
Israel would not engage in a ``substantial'' expansion of
settlements.
	   Netanyahu denied the report, saying Israeli would keep building
to accommodate the natural population growth in the settlements,
but would not establish new communities.
	   On Monday, work continued on the expansion of Kiryat Arba, a
settlement of 6,000 residents just outside the tense, divided West
Bank town of Hebron. Workers were paving roads and working on the
utilities for a 200-apartment neighborhood, said the mayor of
Kiryat Arba, Zvi Katzover.
	   In other developments Monday, Palestinian police identified a
19-year-old Hamas activist as the suicide bomber in last week's
attack on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   The assailant was Suhib Timraz, a resident of the Jebaliya
refugee camp, said the commander of the Palestinian security
forces, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali.
	   The attack killed an Israeli soldier and the assailant, but 40
Israeli school children in the convoy escaped unharmed.
	   On Sunday, a leaflet by the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, made unprecedented threats against Arafat, saying he had
``reached the point of treason'' by arresting more than 100 Hamas
activists in response to Thursday's suicide bombing.
	   Arafat dismissed the threats with a wave of the hand. ``It's not
the first time and won't be the last. You know that I have faced
many things like that. I don't care,'' said Arafat who has survived
several attempts on his life.

New Beetle premieres in Europe in Volkswagen's Germany
</HEADLINE>
headquarters &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Appealing to nostalgia for the
rattling, bug-topped Volkswagen Beetle adored by millions,
Volkswagen on Monday introduced a svelter, quieter version of the
1960s classic to the European market.
	   Already a huge success in the United States, Volkswagen hopes
the retro-looking New Beetle with a smile-shaped hood will help the
company shed its image of building reliable, but staid, cars.
	   The reworked Beetle features a Golf engine under its curved
hurt, eliminating the familiar rattle. An electronic stabilization
system and airbags _ and a flower-holder on the dashboard _ also
are new.
	   The company has received about 200,000 requests for the car from
European customers, said Volkswagen spokesman Fred Baerbock. About
half of those were in Germany.
	   Cars normally are bought in Germany after an order is placed
with the dealer, rather than direct from a showroom, as in the
United States. First deliveries are expected Nov. 27, although
about 1,000 imported by aficionados are already on the streets.
	   The new Beetle went on sale in the United States in March.
Volkswagen says it sold over 40,000 cars from mid-March to the end
of September in North America, including Canada and Mexico, where
it is produced.
	   Volkswagen hopes the car will appeal to adults who beetled
around in it in the 1960's or '70's as students, said Baerbock.
	   ``There is an emotional impact to the New Beetle, and that
emotional reaction is strengthened by (interest in) the car's
modern motor. It's a fun car, it's got zest for life,'' Baerbock
said.
	   The car's world premiere was at the Detroit Motor Show in
January, and its success has also boosted sales for Volkswagen's
other models, Baerbock said.
	   New Beetle's premiere is the latest in a series of launches of
cars that emphasize economy of space or colorfulness, such as the
tiny, brightly colored Smart Car, a joint venture between
Daimler-Benz and the Swiss manufacturer of the Swatch wristwatch,
Schweizerische Gesellschaft.
	   Last year, Daimler launched the egg-shaped A-class car, dubbed
the Baby Benz because of its small size.

Chilean official briefed top Vatican authority on Pinochet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A top Chilean official briefed the Vatican's
secretary of state about Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who is under arrest
in Britain, but said he was not seeking papal mediation in the
case.
	   The Vatican on Monday, in a brief statement, would only say that
the Chilean undersecretary of state had sought the opportunity to
inform the Holy See about his talks in Madrid and London.
	   The official, Mariano Fernandez. met on Sunday with Cardinal
Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's No. 2 official.
	   British prosecutors planned Monday to formally appeal a High
Court decision to throw out the arrest of the former Chilean
dictator.
	   A Spanish magistrate is seeking Pinochet's addition on
allegations of murder, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year
regime.
	   Chile maintains that Pinochet enjoys immunity.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ French investigators ended a five-day
visit to Bucharest, where they studied possible links between the
revolutionary known as ``Carlos the Jackal'' and Romania's
communist-era secret police, the French Embassy said Monday.
	   Investigators, led by anti-terrorism Judge Jean-Louis Bruguiere,
analyzed a series of archived documents of the communist government
and met former communist officials between Tuesday and Saturday,
the daily Cronica Romana reported Monday.
	   Bruguiere also met Tudor Postelnicu, the interior minister who
ran the Securitate, the feared secret police of former communist
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
	   Military prosecutors who set up the meetings between French
investigators and former communist officials did not release any
details of what was said.
	   The daily Evenimentul Zilei reported recently that some former
Securitate agents could be indicted in France for collaborating
with ``Carlos the Jackal,'' whose real name is Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez.
	   Ramirez is now imprisoned in France, serving a life term for
shooting two French police investigators and a Lebanese man.
	   Romanian media reported early this year that Ramirez had been
employed by Ceausescu to blow up the Romanian Service of Radio Free
Europe in February 1981.
	   Nine people were injured in the attack on the Munich-based radio
program, which broadcast into communist Eastern Europe.
	   The dictator allegedly was infuriated by Radio Free Europe's
anti-communist broadcasts and by the defection of his intelligence
service chief, Gen. Ion Pacepa, to the United States in 1978.
	   Ramirez found temporary shelter in Romania between 1980 and
1989.
	   Ceausescu was killed during the anti-communist revolt in 1989.
	   Ramirez was captured in Sudan in August 1994 and sentenced last
year in Paris to life in prison for the 1975 triple murder.
	   The 48-year-old Venezuelan-born terrorist is believed
responsible for the deaths of at least 83 people during his
terrorist career in Europe and the Middle East.

Monday, the former hurricane left behind a deadly legacy in
Nicaragua, where mudslides buried four villages, raising the
confirmed death toll in Central America to 1,005.
	   Hundreds, maybe thousands of villagers were buried in the
mudslides when a crater lake collapsed. The number of people killed
in Central America from the storm was at least 1,005 on Monday and
was expected to more than double.

	   GARISSA, Kenya (AP) _ A day after Muslim leaders criticized the
government for failure to act following an attack a week ago in
northeastern Kenya that left 142 dead, an official said Monday
President Daniel arap Moi would visit the wounded.
	   Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu also said an earlier
decision to open hastily made graves to obtain an accurate death
count from the Oct. 24-25 attack had been overturned out of respect
for the Muslim victims.
	   The attack occurred about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of
Wajir at Bagala village. Makhanu said 59 people were still missing,
and seven had been hospitalized in Wajir with serious injuries.
	   He said 39 more graves had been discovered in the area around
Bagala, but he did not say how many more bodies had been found.
	   He blamed rebels of the Oromo Liberation Front from neighboring
Ethiopia for the attack, but he did not offer any proof. At the
same time, he said he did not rule out clan-based banditry as the
cause of the attack.
	   Conflicts over scarce grazing land and access to water in arid
northeastern Kenya are not uncommon among the pastoralist people
who live there.
	   In the capital, Nairobi, the daily East African Standard chided
the government for its delay in explaining the cause of the attack
which the newspaper said ``has created room for rumors and a number
of other wild theories...''
	   During a peaceful demonstration in Nairobi Monday, North Eastern
Province student leader Abdille Yussuf Mohamed said the government
has to protect all its people, ``otherwise you exclude that part of
Kenya.''
	   On Sunday, members of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims
criticized government neglect of the region and opposed exhumation
of the bodies, saying it would be an insult to Muslims whose
religion does not permit it.
	   SUPKEM deputy secretary general Ibrahim Lethome said the
government would do better to mobilize security personnel to rescue
the kidnapped and recover stolen livestock.
	   Makhanu said the attackers had been seen herding the 1,785 head
of cattle and 2,075 camels in neighboring Eastern Province. He said
military helicopters and soldiers had been dispatched from Garissa,
the capital of North Eastern Province, and Wajir, 240 kilometers
(150 miles) north, to capture the animals.
	   Moi was expected to travel to Wajir Wednesday to visit the
injured, he said.
	   In a fax to news agencies late last week, the Oromo Liberation
Front denied any role in the attack which it said pitted members of
the Boran and Gabra tribes against Kenyan ethnic Somalis of the
Degodia sub-clan.
	   Instead, the OLF said, the attack was a continuation of an
earlier conflict fostered between the Borana and Degodia by the
Ethiopian government in southwestern Ethiopia, the home of the
Oromo people, who are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia.
	   ``The Ethiopian agents who instigated the conflict in Ethiopia
in 1997 managed to extend it to Kenyan territory,'' the statement
said.
	   Borders drawn by colonial powers cut across ethnic lines in
Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya
	   The OLF seeks independence from Ethiopia for the southern Oromia
region.

	   In new tension in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, meanwhile,
Israeli police scuffled with a senior Palestinian Authority
official, Faisal Husseini, and his bodyguards who were protesting
the construction of a Jewish enclave in the Palestinian
neighborhood of Ras al-Amud.
	   Police clubbed the bodyguards as they clung to Husseini, the top
Palestinian official in Jerusalem. One Palestinian was wrestled to
the ground and screamed in pain as a police officer squeezed his
head.
	   ``It is forbidden for Israel to take unilateral actions,''
Husseini said, breathing quickly after the confrontation with the
police officers. Husseini was referring to a standing U.S. request
that both sides refrain from creating facts on the ground.
	   The United States has been trying to get Israel to stop the
expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Washington also wants to avoid a unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians in May 1999, when the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy ends.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said Monday that the United States
believes it has obtained a verbal assurance from Netanyahu that
Israel would not engage in a ``substantial'' expansion of
settlements.
	   Netanyahu denied the report, saying Israeli would keep building
to accommodate the natural population growth in the settlements,
but would not establish new communities.
	   On Monday, work continued on the expansion of Kiryat Arba, a
settlement of 6,000 residents just outside the tense, divided West
Bank town of Hebron. Workers were paving roads and working on the
utilities for a 200-apartment neighborhood, said the mayor of
Kiryat Arba, Zvi Katzover.
	   In other developments Monday, Palestinian police identified a
19-year-old Hamas activist as the suicide bomber in last week's
attack on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   The assailant was Suhib Timraz, a resident of the Jebaliya
refugee camp, said the commander of the Palestinian security
forces, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali.
	   The attack killed an Israeli soldier and the assailant, but 40
Israeli school children in the convoy escaped unharmed.
	   On Sunday, a leaflet by the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, made unprecedented threats against Arafat, saying he had
``reached the point of treason'' by arresting more than 100 Hamas
activists in response to Thursday's suicide bombing.
	   Arafat dismissed the threats with a wave of the hand. ``It's not
the first time and won't be the last. You know that I have faced
many things like that. I don't care,'' said Arafat who has survived
several attempts on his life.

Japan collects less in taxes as recession hurts corporate profits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's government said Monday it collected 10
percent less money from taxes in the first half of this fiscal
year, a drop it blamed on dwindling corporate profits due to the
country's slumping economy.
	   The Finance Ministry said tax revenues totaled 15.2 trillion yen
(dlrs 132 billion) in the six months ended Sept. 30, down from 17
trillion yen (dlrs 148 billion) in the same period last year.
	   Money paid into government coffers from corporate income taxes
fell 22 percent to 1.8 trillion yen (dlrs 15.7 billion), the
ministry said.
	   The decline more than offset a rebound in sales tax revenues,
which were up 21 percent from last year to 1.8 trillion yen (dlrs
15.7 billion).
	   The fall in tax revenues comes at a particularly inopportune
time, with the government trying to balance massive fiscal stimulus
spending with voter concern over Japan's ballooning budget
deficits.
	   Until the Japanese economy recovers from its year-old recession,
economists say corporations and individuals will likely have even
less money for the taxman.
	   Andrew Shipley, an economist at the Tokyo office of Schroders
Securities Ltd., told Dow Jones News Service that he sees tax
revenues down 7.1 percent for the entire year and another 16.3
percent next year.

South African official discusses oil-for-arms deal in Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki on Monday discussed a dlrs 1.5 billion oil-for-arms deal with
Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan, a South African official
said.
	   The two sides agreed that a technical team from the Saudi
defense ministry will travel to South Africa soon to discuss the
possible deal in more detail, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The dlrs proposed 1.5 billion sale of G6 motorized artillery
pieces and anti-aircraft weapons to Saudi Arabia, if finalized,
would be the largest arms deal in South African history and could
create 30,000 jobs over five years.
	   In South Africa, Mbeki's spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said the
deputy's president's visit was aimed at strengthening trade links.
``At this stage I'm not aware of any oil for arms deal being
negotiated,'' he said in Johannesburg.
	   Mbeki, who became the ruling African National Congress'
president last year and is expected to win the 1999 presidential
elections, arrived here Sunday on a three-day trip. He met with
Crown Prince Abdullah late Sunday.
	   He is accompanied by a high-level delegation including Defense
Minister Joe Modise, Mining and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna and
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin.
	   The South African delegation will also visit the industrial
cities of Yanbu and Jubail and meet with members of the Saudi
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
	   Economic relations between the two nations have been growing in
recent years. South Africa is trying to rely less on Iran for oil,
from which it imports more than two-thirds of its crude oil needs,
according to South African press reports.
	   In a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, President Nelson Mandela
signed a preliminary agreement with the oil-rich kingdom which
calls for oil imports of 15,000 barrels a day from Saudi Arabia.
	   South Africa's exports to Saudi Arabia more than doubled from
dlrs 47 million in 1994 to dlrs 95 million in 1996. Saudi Arabia's
exports, mainly oil, jumped from dlrs 8 million in 1994 to dlrs 207
million in 1996.

BBC apologizes to Cabinet minister called gay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British Broadcasting Corp. has apologized to a
Cabinet minister who was described during one of its news programs
as gay, igniting a fresh debate about media intrusion into the
private lives of top politicians.
	   Aides to Trade Secretary Peter Mandelson said Monday he had
received a letter of apology from BBC chairman Sir Christopher
Bland.
	   Mandelson, who prefers not to make an issue of his sexual
orientation, would have no comment on the letter, the aides said.
	   The furor began Tuesday when newspaper columnist Matthew Parris
said on a late-night BBC program that Mandelson was ``certainly''
gay.
	   The remark came during speculation about the sexuality of
another Cabinet minister, Ron Davies, who resigned as Welsh
Secretary last week because of what he called a ``lapse of
judgment'' with a stranger he met on London's Clapham Common.
	   Davies has given no clear explanation of what happened. But
through days of banner headlines and tabloid stories that he is a
secret homosexual, he has denied he was on the common seeking gay
sex or drugs.
	   Meanwhile, the BBC added to the controversy by ordering staff
members never to repeat the remark by Parris, who is openly gay, on
any of its programs.
	   That move provoked charges of clumsy censorship and of giving
special treatment to Mandelson, a close adviser to Prime Minister
Tony Blair and among the country's most influential politicians.
	   Protesters included the opposition Conservative Party, several
of whose politicians were pursued by the media over extramarital
affairs when the party was in power, and Northern Ireland Secretary
Mo Mowlam, also a leading member of the Blair Cabinet.
	   Ms. Mowlam said she and other panelists on a Friday night BBC
radio talk show were told not to mention Mandelson and the gay
remark.
	   ``I'm not about to be unfair or unjust to colleagues, but we've
all stated very clearly that to be given guidelines is insulting,''
she said during the show.
	   The BBC altered a news quiz program last week to remove a
running joke about Mandelson, but the TV satire program ``Have I
Got News For You?'' was allowed to broadcast a clip of the Parris
comment.
	   Imposing the ban, BBC chief political adviser Anne Sloman said
in a memo to staff that ``under no circumstances whatsoever should
the allegation about the private life of Peter Mandelson be
repeated or referred to in any broadcast.''

Warring sides sign accord to end Guinea-Bissau conflict

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ The warring sides in the bitter 5-month
Guinea-Bissau civil war have signed an accord to end the conflict,
officials announced Monday.
	   The agreement came late Sunday night during talks between
Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira and the rebel leader,
Brig. Ansumane Mane, held in secrecy at the mansion of Nigeria's
military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   Abubakar endorsed the agreement, as did Gambian President Yaya
Jammeh.
	   The agreement calls for a re-affirmation of a ceasefire signed
in August, the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the
introduction of a buffer force of West African peacekeepers. A
government of national unity is to be formed within 10 days and
president elections are to be held no later than next March.
	   Officials announced the agreement Monday morning.
	   Portugal's Foreign Minister Jaime Gama called the deal a
``decisive step in the right direction.'' A visit by Gama to the
former Portuguese colony last month led to an agreement by Vieira
and Mane to meet face-to-face for the first time since the war
began.
	   The talks began in Gambia's capital of Banjul on Friday and were
moved to Nigeria's capital early Saturday to coincide with the
second day of a summit of leaders from the 16-member Economic
Community of West African States.
	   The ECOWAS summit closed on Saturday night with a written appeal
by the organization for the warring parties to resolve their
differences peacefully. But the Guinea-Bissau talks continued
Sunday into the night.
	   Gambian Foreign Minister Sedat Jobe said mediators prevailed on
the protagonists to accept the plan, drawn up with the assistance
of ECOWAS officials, by ``making them feel responsible for the
crisis.''
	   He said he was optimistic the accord would hold, saying his
president ``was convinced that if (the antagonists) could be
brought together, then there was a very good chance of a truce
being reached. That is exactly what happened in Abuja.''
	   ECOWAS has on several occasions intervened in regional disputes.
Nigeria, the region's powerhouse, leads a West African force called
ECOMOG that played an aggressive role in ending seven years of
fighting in Liberia in 1996 and toppling Sierra Leone's junta in
March.
	   The conflict in the former Portuguese colony began June 7 when a
breakaway faction of disgruntled military veterans seized the main
army garrison and international airport in the capital Bissau.
	   The rebels accused Vieira of corruption and have demanded that
he step down.
	   Although Senegal and Republic of Guinea sent troops to Vieira's
aid, the insurgents have overrun most of the small country.
	   About half of the country's 1 million people have been displaced
by the fighting, although no one knows how many people were killed
and wounded.

Jewels stolen from Gina Lollobrigida in Munich hotel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Thieves at a Munich hotel grabbed a bag
from Gina Lollobrigida containing 30,000 marks (dlrs 18,000) worth
of jewelry, but the Italian actress was more upset about losing two
notebooks that also were inside.
	   The 71-year-old Lollobrigida had checked out of a luxury hotel
Sunday and was waiting for a taxi to the airport when two thieves
made off with her black crocodile leather cosmetic case, which was
sitting near the exit.
	   The actress, who was in Munich for a TV appearance, told
Monday's Suddeutsche Zeitung that she had already written off as
lost forever the gold necklace with rubies, a pair of gold earrings
and other jewelry pieces that were in the bag.
	   But she said she'd pay a reward for the return of two notebooks
that contained private addresses and business cards. These were
``an especially bitter loss,'' she said.
	   The thieves were captured on a hotel video camera, but police
have had not luck in their search.

Chernobyl's only functioning reactor to be stopped, repaired
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Nuclear authorities have ordered a shutdown
of the only functioning reactor at the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant next month for safety repairs, a news agency said Monday.
	   The Nuclear Regulation Administration (NRA) will permit the
state energy company Energoatom to operate the reactor until Dec.
1, but said it has to be stopped afterwards, the UNIAN news agency
said.
	   The order was issued after an inspection of Chernobyl's reactor
No. 3 by the Environment Ministry last week showed that some of the
reactor's safety equipment was reaching the end of its operational
life in December, the NRA said, according to UNIAN.
	   There was no word on how long the repairs would take.
	   The decision was made despite pleas from Energoatom to let the
reactor work through the winter because of growing worries over the
ability of Ukraine's cash-strapped energy system to produce enough
electricity during the fall and winter months.
	   Western countries have long demanded repairs to Chernobyl's only
operational reactor to upgrade safety equipment. There have been
frequent malfunctions at the unit recently.
	   Reactor No. 3 was undergoing lengthy repairs from July 1997
until last May, and has been stopped several times since then for
short-term repairs.
	   The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which
agreed to grant dlrs 118 million for upgrading the reactor,
demanded that it be stopped as of Oct. 1.
	   However, Energoatom managed to persuade representatives of the
world's seven major industrialized nations last month to postpone
the shutdown, although some of the equipment needed for the repairs
was already delivered to Chernobyl, according to the Ukrainian News
agency.
	   Reactor No. 3 has been the only one of Chernobyl's four reactor
in operation since November 1996, and Ukraine has pledged to shut
down the plant entirely by the year 2000.
	   One Chernobyl reactor was destroyed in the 1986 explosion and
fire, the world's worst nuclear accident, while another of the
plant's four reactors was shut down after being damaged by a 1991
fire. A third was shut down two years ago.
	   Although reactor No. 3 accounts for only two percent of
Ukraine's total electricity generating capacity, any loss in energy
generation these days could be ominous for the country's energy
system.
	   The former Soviet republic's energy plants are owed more than
dlrs 1 billion by consumers, and are desperately short of cash to
buy fuel to provide electricity for the approaching winter.
	   Ukraine's five nuclear power plants have 14 reactors, which
account for more than 40 percent of the country's electricity
production.

Turkish police foil radical Islamic attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Istanbul authorities on Monday claimed
police foiled a plan by a radical Islamic group to launch a
kamikaze-style attack on the mausoleum of the founder of secular
Turkey during festivities attended by thousands of people.
	   Twenty-three alleged members of a Germany-based radical Islamic
group were detained Wednesday, a day before the alleged aerial
attack was to take place during the country's 75th anniversary
celebrations last week, said Istanbul Gov. Erol Cakir.
	   Thousands of people, including Turkish leaders and foreign
dignitaries, were at the mausoleum on Oct. 29 to pay respects
before Mustafa Kemal Ataturk's tomb.
	   But Cakir said the group confessed that they had delayed the
plan until Nov. 10 - when the country holds a solemn ceremony to
mark Ataturk's death - because bad weather prevented them from
flying a plane from Bursa, a city south of Istanbul.
	   According to authorities, the group is the Anatolian Federal
Islamic State, which wants to overthrow Turkey's government and
replace it with strict Islamic rule. The group is affiliated to the
Germany-based Association of Islamic Groups and Communities.
	   The governor added that the group planned to launch a
simultaneous attack in which they would take people hostage in a
mosque in downtown Istanbul.
	   Ataturk set up Turkey's secular republic on Oct. 29, 1923,
following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.
	   The celebrations were marred by the hijack of a Turkish Airlines
flight on Thursday. The hijacker, protesting Turkey's military
drive against autonomy seeking Kurdish rebels, was killed and 38
passengers and crew members were safely evacuated by police hours
later.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A top Chilean official briefed the Vatican's
secretary of state about Gen. Augusto Pinochet, who is under arrest
in Britain, but said he was not seeking papal mediation in the
case.
	   The Vatican on Monday, in a brief statement, would only say that
the Chilean undersecretary of state had sought the opportunity to
inform the Holy See about his talks in Madrid and London.
	   The official, Mariano Fernandez. met on Sunday with Cardinal
Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's No. 2 official.
	   British prosecutors planned Monday to formally appeal a High
Court decision to throw out the arrest of the former Chilean
dictator.
	   A Spanish magistrate is seeking Pinochet's extradition on
allegations of murder, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year
regime.
	   Chile maintains that Pinochet enjoys immunity.

U.S. envoy heads to Belgrade for more Kosovo talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Monday developments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was
headed to Belgrade on Monday for talks with top Serbian officials,
trying to jump-start the stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic
Albanians to agree on a political settlement for Kosovo.
	   Hill was scheduled to meet with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic after arriving from the Macedonian capital Skopje, then
head to Kosovo's capital Pristina on Tuesday.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Hill is leading diplomatic
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed this year in authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   ``We continue to work with both sides, going back and forth,''
said Philip Reeker, Hill's spokesman in Skopje, when asked about
the status of talks.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule.
	   But Reeker said the West has never looked at that date as a
deadline.
	   ``This (promise) was to show their compliance and that they are
actively pursuing negotiations,'' he said.
	   He said direct talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians are not
merited until the two sides get closer to a settlement.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to put as many as 2,000 international
monitors on the ground in Kosovo to verify the status of
Milosevic's other promises are proceeding slowly. About 70
Americans who will participate in the verification mission
reportedly arrived in Belgrade on Sunday and were preparing to head
for Pristina.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons in
Kosovo in the next few days will increase the force's size to about
200, OSCE spokesman Walter Kemp said in Vienna.

Anti-Arafat Palestinians and Libya's Gadhafi criticize Wye accord
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Israel-Palestinians

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ A coalition of Damascus-based radical
Palestinian factions condemned the latest Israeli-Palestinian peace
deal on Monday and pledged to continue armed struggle against
Israel.
	   At a news joint conference, the leader of one radical
Palestinian group threatened to ``severely punish'' those who
signed and helped negotiate the Wye Plantation accord.
	   ``Whoever betrays the homeland will receive severe punishment,''
said Saeed Moussa, leader of the Fatah Uprising group, specifically
naming Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu as signers.
	   Moussa, whose group is a breakaway faction of Arafat's Fatah
movement, also said U.S. President Bill Clinton and Jordan's King
Hussein should be punished for helping negotiate the accord signed
Oct. 23 in Washington.
	   In remarks carried Monday by Libya's official news agency,
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi also renewed his criticism of the
pact, saying it focused only on Israel's security.
	   ``They (negotiators) have not discussed the reasons for violence
which stems from the fact that the Zionists occupy Palestinian
land,'' Gadhafi said.
	   The Wye Plantation agreement, mediated by the United States,
calls for Israel to give up 13 percent more land on the West Bank
in exchange for stepped up measures by Palestinians to protect
Israeli citizens from attack.
	   At the Damascus news conference, another radical Palestinian
leader vowed his people would continue struggling to regain their
land.
	   ``The Palestinians are ready to struggle for 100 years to come
and by all means to restore the occupied land,'' Ahmed Jibril, the
secretary-general of the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command said.
	   ``The accord has no future, the future is only for the armed
struggle and for the people who who would never cede their rights
or lands,'' Jibril said.
	   ``The armed struggle is the only alternative for the Palestinian
people.... We have to hold fast to our land and confront our
enemy,'' said Moussa Abu Marzouk of the Hamas movement.

Arafat agrees to Israeli request to delay implementation of deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: COMBINES urgent series, minor editing &QL; 
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat agreed Monday
to a request by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
postpone the start of their land-for-security agreement by several
days.
	   Netanyahu said earlier in the day that the 12-week agreement
could not be implemented until it has been ratified by his Cabinet
and the Israeli parliament.
	   The agreement was to have taken effect at midnight, but the
Israeli Cabinet will only to discuss it on Tuesday, with no date
set for a vote. Parliament will not vote on the agreement until
next week.
	   As part of the agreement signed Oct. 23, Israel is to withdraw
from 13 percent of the West Bank over 12 weeks, with each phase
accompanied by Palestinian security measures. In the first week, no
major Israeli steps are required. The Palestinians are to outline
their plan for fighting Islamic militants to the United States, and
several Israeli-Palestinian committees are to begin meeting.
	   Arafat said he received a call from Netanyahu on Monday. ``He
asked me for some days to delay implementation of what had been
agreed upon,'' Arafat told reporters in the West Bank town of
Ramallah. Asked whether he agreed, Arafat said: ``Yes.''
	   U.S. officials said that despite the delay, the timetable should
not be disrupted.
	   ``It is the U.S. position that the schedule would be
unaffected,'' said the U.S. Embassy spokesman, Larry Schwartz.
	   In new tension in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, meanwhile,
Israeli police scuffled with a senior Palestinian Authority
official, Faisal Husseini, and his bodyguards who were protesting
the construction of a Jewish enclave in the Palestinian
neighborhood of Ras al-Amud.
	   Police clubbed the bodyguards as they clung to Husseini, the top
Palestinian official in Jerusalem. One Palestinian was wrestled to
the ground and screamed in pain as a police officer squeezed his
head.
	   ``It is forbidden for Israel to take unilateral actions,''
Husseini said, breathing quickly after the confrontation with the
police officers. Husseini was referring to a standing U.S. request
that both sides refrain from creating facts on the ground.
	   The United States has been trying to get Israel to stop the
expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Washington also wants to avoid a unilateral declaration of
statehood by the Palestinians in May 1999, when the five-year
period of Palestinian autonomy ends.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz said Monday that the United States
believes it has obtained a verbal assurance from Netanyahu that
Israel would not engage in a ``substantial'' expansion of
settlements.
	   Netanyahu denied the report, saying Israeli would keep building
to accommodate the natural population growth in the settlements,
but would not establish new communities.
	   On Monday, work continued on the expansion of Kiryat Arba, a
settlement of 6,000 residents just outside the tense, divided West
Bank town of Hebron. Workers were paving roads and working on the
utilities for a 200-apartment neighborhood, said the mayor of
Kiryat Arba, Zvi Katzover.
	   In other developments Monday, Palestinian police identified a
19-year-old Hamas activist as the suicide bomber in last week's
attack on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   The assailant was Suhib Timraz, a resident of the Jebaliya
refugee camp, said the commander of the Palestinian security
forces, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali.
	   The attack killed an Israeli soldier and the assailant, but 40
Israeli school children in the convoy escaped unharmed.
	   On Sunday, a leaflet by the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, made unprecedented threats against Arafat, saying he had
``reached the point of treason'' by arresting more than 100 Hamas
activists in response to Thursday's suicide bombing.
	   Arafat dismissed the threats with a wave of the hand. ``It's not
the first time and won't be the last. You know that I have faced
many things like that. I don't care,'' said Arafat who has survived
several attempts on his life.

South African official discusses oil-for-arms deal in Saudi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki on Monday discussed a dlrs 1.5 billion oil-for-arms deal with
Saudi Defense Minister Prince Sultan, a South African official
said.
	   The two sides agreed that a technical team from the Saudi
defense ministry will travel to South Africa soon to discuss the
possible deal in more detail, said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The dlrs proposed 1.5 billion sale of G6 motorized artillery
pieces and anti-aircraft weapons to Saudi Arabia, if finalized,
would be the largest arms deal in South African history and could
create 30,000 jobs over five years.
	   In South Africa, Mbeki's spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said the
deputy's president's visit was aimed at strengthening trade links.
``At this stage I'm not aware of any oil for arms deal being
negotiated,'' he said in Johannesburg.
	   Mbeki, who became the ruling African National Congress'
president last year and is expected to win the 1999 presidential
elections, arrived here Sunday on a three-day trip. He met with
Crown Prince Abdullah late Sunday.
	   He is accompanied by a high-level delegation including Defense
Minister Joe Modise, Mining and Energy Minister Penuell Maduna and
Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin.
	   The South African delegation will also visit the industrial
cities of Yanbu and Jubail and meet with members of the Saudi
Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
	   Economic relations between the two nations have been growing in
recent years. South Africa is trying to rely less on Iran for oil,
from which it imports more than two-thirds of its crude oil needs,
according to South African press reports.
	   In a visit to Saudi Arabia last year, President Nelson Mandela
signed a preliminary agreement with the oil-rich kingdom which
calls for oil imports of 15,000 barrels a day from Saudi Arabia.
	   South Africa's exports to Saudi Arabia more than doubled from
dlrs 47 million in 1994 to dlrs 95 million in 1996. Saudi Arabia's
exports, mainly oil, jumped from dlrs 8 million in 1994 to dlrs 207
million in 1996.

 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a sign of new cooperation, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat on Monday agreed to a request by Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to postpone the start of their
land-for-security agreement by serveral days.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, said he would try to stick to the timetable
of the 12-week agreement and carry out the first troop pullback in
the West Bank as close to the original date of Nov. 16 as possible.
	   While the leaders compromised, tensions grew between the two
sides in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Israeli police scuffled
with a senior Palestinian Authority official, Faisal Husseini, and
his bodyguards who were protesting the construction of a Jewish
enclave in the Palestinian neighborhood of Ras al-Amud.
	   Police clubbed the bodyguards as they clung to Husseini. One
Palestinian was wrestled to the ground and screamed in pain as a
police officer squeezed his head.
	   The peace agreement was to take effect at midnight Monday, or
exactly 10 days after it was signed by Netanyahu and Arafat at the
White House.
	   However, Netanyahu said Monday that he could not start
implementation until the agreement has been ratified by his Cabinet
and by Israel's parliament. The Cabinet is to begin its debate on
Tuesday, but it is not clear when it will vote. The Israeli
parliament session on the accord is scheduled for Nov. 11-12.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank over 12 weeks, with each phase accompanied by
Palestinian security measures, such as confiscation of weapons.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement that in the first two weeks, the
Palestinians would have to take a series of steps, such as
presenting their security work plan to the United States.
	   Israel's first real test will come two weeks into the accord
when 2 percent of the West Bank are to be transferred from sole
Israeli control to shared rule with the Palestinians and another
7.1 percent are handed over to sole Palestinian control.
	   ``If the agreement is approved by the Cabinet and the Knesset,
we will be able to abide by the (withdrawal) date stated at the
White House (16/11/98), or a few days later at the most,'' the
statement said.
	   Arafat said he received a call from Netanyahu on Monday. ``He
asked me for some days to delay implementation of what had been
agreed upon,'' Arafat told The Associated Press in the West Bank
town of Ramallah. Asked whether he agreed, Arafat said: ``Yes.''
	   As part of the agreement, the United States has urged both sides
to refrain from unilateral actions, such as expanding Jewish
settlements and declaring Palestinian statehood unilaterally in May
at the end of the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz, citing U.S. diplomatic officials,
said Monday that the United States believes it has obtained a
verbal assurance from Netanyahu that Israel would not engage in a
``substantial'' expansion of settlements.
	   Netanyahu denied the report, saying Israel would keep building
to accommodate the natural population growth in the settlements,
but would not establish new communities.
	   On Monday, work continued on the expansion of Kiryat Arba, a
settlement of 6,000 residents just outside the tense, divided West

Falling tree kills a man
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A man was killed when strong winds
knocked a bulky spruce tree over the car in which he was traveling,
police said Monday.
	   The accident occurred late Sunday on a forested road near the
town of Blansko, 200 kilometers (124 miles) east of Prague.
	   The driver of the car was seriously injured and three other
passengers escaped with light injuries.
	   A similar case occurred in Prague last week, when a woman
traveling in a car on a busy highway was instantly killed by a
falling tree.
	   The Czech Republic has been suffering from unusually strong
winds and torrential rains in the past several days.

Report Khatami to visit in February
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Iranian President Mohamad Khatami is to visit
France in February, his first official trip to a European country,
Iran's ambassador was quoted Monday as saying in an interview with
the newspaper Le Monde.
	   Khatami places special importance on Iran's relations with
Paris, and has put invitations from other European nations on hold
until he first visits France, Ambassador Ali-Reza Moayeri was
quoted by Le Monde as saying.
	   No exact date for the visit was provided by the daily.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine extended an official
invitation to Khatami during his visit to Tehran in August.
Vedrine's was the highest level visit to Iran in seven years.
	   France, along with other European nations, hopes to further
trade with a more moderate Iran, as well as boost the fortunes of
Khatami, whose stated wish to reach out to the West must be
balanced with efforts to assuage hard liners.

Romania to buy NATO equipment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The government has formally approved
dlrs 30 million for the purchase of a NATO-standard electronic
surveillance and identification system meant to improve the
detection of enemy ground forces, a defense ministry official said
Monday.
	   Lt. Commander Tiberiu Fratila said the equipment will be used in
Romania and abroad, during peacekeeping missions.
	   The equipment will be purchased from a NATO country next year.
	   Romania wanted to join NATO last year but was told it was not
ready economically. Formerly communist Hungary, the Czech Republic
and Poland were invited to join.

Hamas activist identified as suicide bomber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with new attribution, quotes, CORRECTS that
assailant was 19 STED 22 &QL; 
 &UR; By IBRAHIM BARZAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian police commander on
Monday identified the suicide bomber in last week's attack on
Israeli school children as a 19-year-old activist in the Islamic
militant group Hamas.
	   In an interview with The Associated Press, the commander, Brig.
Gen. Ghazi Jabali, also defended a decision to place the founder of
the Islamic militant group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house
arrest and disconnect his telephones.
	   Yassin had to be silenced because he relentlessly criticized the
new Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and was getting directions
from other countries, including Iran, Jabali said.
	   ``Sheik Yassin ... says many things against the agreement and he
received telephone calls from the outside, from Tehran, from many
countries,'' Jabali said. ``So we took this decision, the house
arrest, to protect Ahmed Yassin from Ahmed Yassin.''
	   The restrictions on Yassin were imposed as part of a crackdown
on Hamas triggered by Thursday's suicide attack in which an
assailant rammed a car packed with explosives into an Israeli jeep
escorting a school bus. Forty children on the bus escaped unharmed,
but a soldier was killed, along with the assailant.
	   Last week's suicide bomber was identified as 19-year-old Suhib
Timraz, a resident of the Jebaliya refugee camp near Gaza City,
	   Timraz was a low-level member in Hamas, police said.
	   Jabali praised the slain soldier for trying to save the
children. ``He (the soldier) is a hero. He did many things for our
people,'' Jabali said, referring to speculation that had there been
more casualties, the attack might have held up the implementation
of the new peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   More than 100 Hamas activists, including senior leaders, have
been arrested since the attack.
	   Asked about threats by Hamas against the Palestinian Authority,
Jabali said his men were under orders to open fire if they felt
their lives were being endangered.
	   On Sunday, the military wing of Hamas, Izzedine al Qassam, said
in a leaflet that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had ``reached
the point of treason'' by moving against Hamas.
	   A senior Hamas figure, Ismail Hanieh, said Monday that the
leaflet was not authentic and that the group wanted to avoid civil
war at all costs. It is not unusual for Hamas to issue conflicting
statements since the shadowy group is broken up into small cells
that often don't know of each others' activities.
	   Timraz's father was a leading figure in the Muslim brotherhood,
a forerunner of Hamas, and was arrested by Israeli security forces
in 1983, along Yassin. The elder Timraz was released in 1985 as
part of a prisoner swap.

Iran concludes war games on Afghanistan border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran on Monday concluded major military
exercises on its border with Afghanistan, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
	   Some 200,000 troops took part in the maneuvers, which began on
Saturday.
	   In the last stage of the maneuvers, held on Iran's eastern
border, fighter bombers and infantry and armored units attacked
mock enemy positions while suspended bridges were installed for the
passage of tanks, the agency quoted Maj. Gen. Ali Shahbazi,
commander of the army, as saying.
	   The goal of the maneuvers was to make it clear that ``any
provocative measure ... will be faced with the strong reaction of
the Iranian army,'' Brig. Gen. Fazlollah Shahin-Rad was quoted as
saying.
	   The exercises _ called Zolfaqar-2 after the sword of Imam Ali,
the son-in-law of Islam's Prophet Mohammed _ took place against a
background of tension with Afghanistan.
	   Iranian-Afghan relations deteriorated sharply in September after
the Taliban militia, which controls most of Afghanistan, admitted
that its forces had killed eight Iranian diplomats and a journalist
in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   But the situation improved in early October after the
intervention of U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, who shuttled
between Tehran and Kabul and secured the release of 26 Iranians
held captive in Afghanistan.
	   However, several military officials said that troops will remain
stationed in the area although the maneuvers were over.
	   ``As long as concern about acts of sedition and lack of security
in the region exists, the forces deployed in Zolfaqar-2 maneuvers
will remain on the eastern border,'' Shahbazi said.

Dell opens China manufacturing plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dell Computer Corp. has officially opened it
sales and manufacturing plant in the southeastern Chinese city of
Xiamen, the company announced Monday.
	   The Xiamen plant will make Dell's OptiPlex desktop computers,
Latitude notebooks and PowerEdge servers for the China market.
	   The official opening of the Xiamen site follows Dell's August
launch of direct sales in nine cities in China, including Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xiamen. Dell has also begun to sell its
computers over the Internet in China on a Chinese- and
English-language Web site.
	   The company's sales in China have been directed mainly at
government organizations, large institutions and multinational
companies.
	   Dell's Asia-Pacific president, John Legere, said sales in China
were encouraging, but did not give figures.
	   Overall PC sales in China are expected to grow to 10.6 million
by 2000 from 4 million currently, he said.
	   ``This year, we're less than a dlrs 100 million business in
China, but we're very confident over the next five years that in
China we will have a compounded growth rate in excess of 100
percent,'' he said.
	   Dell's current share of the global PC market ranks second behind
Compaq Computer Corp. But to maintain its position, the company has
to capture a greater share of the market in Asia and China plays a
big part in that, Legere added.
	   Dell has only 2 percent of the Asia-Pacific PC market and ranks
ninth in terms of market share for the region, Legere said.

Inter reeling after three straight defeats
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PIERO VALSECCHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Some critics compare Inter Milan's recent
woes to the sinking of the Titanic.
	   Despite a star-studded roster featuring Brazilian superstar
Ronaldo, the Milan powerhouse has tumbled to three consecutive
Serie A defeats, including Sunday's humiliating 3-2 home loss to
low-ranked Bari.
	   The collapse has sparked violent protests by fans and put coach
Gigi Simoni's job in serious jeopardy.
	   ``The next two games will be decisive for Simoni's future,''
club president Massimo Moratti said following Sunday's defeat,
which dropped Inter six points behind league leader Juventus of
Turin after seven rounds.
	   With a record of 3-1-3, the team is running nine points behind
last season's pace.
	   ``I'm bitterly disappointed as well as all Inter supporters for
the poor performances and bad results,'' added Moratti, an oil
industrialist who made huge investments in the last two years to
strengthen the team.
	   The big-spending policy resulted in a dlrs 27.1 million deficit
in the last fiscal year.
	   Simoni's future as Inter's coach will depend on the outcome of
Wednesday's Champions League game against Spartak Moscow and
Sunday's league match against crosstown rival AC Milan.
	   Simoni, in his second season at Inter, is a conservative coach
who never earned the full support of fans despite guiding Inter
last season to the UEFA Cup title and a second-place finish in ther
Serie A standings.
	   Inter has allowed 12 goals in seven league games this season,
including five in one match against Lazio of Rome.
	   The 5-3 rout by Lazio started Inter's losing streak, which
continued with a 1-0 loss to Turin's archrival Juventus and the
upset by Bari. It's the first time since 1994 that Inter has
suffered three straight league defeats.
	   In Italian sports dailies, Monday's headlines about Inter's loss
to Bari were as big as the ones devoted to Michael Scumacher's and
Ferrari's failure in the Japanese Grand Prix.
	   ``Inter is like the Titanic,'' said the Milan sports daily
Gazzetta dello Sport.
	   Inter still is in the running for a quarterfinal berth in the
Champions League, with 6 points in three matches. But its debut in
the European competition, following a 10-year absence, was spoiled
by a 2-0 loss to Real Madrid.
	   Simoni has complained that injuries and post-World Cup fatigue
of key players has prevented him from fielding the same team in
consecutive games.
	   Inter has especially suffered from the absence of Ronaldo, the
key to Inter's sensational results last season.
	   The young Brazilian striker, suffering from World Cup stress and
tendinitis in both knees, has played only two full games and the
second half against Bari so far.
	   Though in questionable form, Ronaldo still scored three goals in
league and cup action and led his team close to a last-minute
miracle draw against Bari.
	   The flashy Brazilian earned and converted a penalty, fed
Francesco Colennese for Inter's second goal and nearly scored the
equalizer in injury time.
	   Italian veteran star Roberto Baggio, also troubled by a knee
injury, is another long-time absentee from the starting lineup.
	   France's World Cup player Youri Djorkaeff, Uruguayan Alvaro
Recoba and Brazilian Ze Elias are all sidelined with injuries.
	   ``As soon as we can play at full force, I'm sure that Inter will
fight back,'' said Ronaldo, the league's top scorer with 25 goals
in his first season in the Italian league.
	   However, Inter fans seemed to have lost their patience already.
	   They hurled eggs at the bus taking Inter players to the San Siro
stadium for an Italian Cup game last week and booed and jeered the
players following Sunday's defeat.
	   And time seems to be running out for Simoni.
	   Italian media are already speculating about his possible
successor _ former AC Milan coach Fabio Capello.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange fell
184 points, or 8.52 percent in October closing at 1,975.5 points,
the National Investments Co. said Monday.
	   According to a report prepared by the company, the index would
have closed much lower were it not for the impact of an official
statement promising that the government would take steps to
increase liquidity in the market.
	   The government is planning to open the market to foreign
investors and increase information available to them about the
performance of the 76 listed companies. Only Kuwaitis and citizens
of other Gulf Arab states are allowed to trade on the market.
	   Some 674.90 million shares changed hands in the 21 trading days
of October, down by 68.64 percent from 2.15 billion shares in the
22 days of trading the previous month. The value of these stocks
were 151.60 million dinars (dlrs 501.98 million), down by 65.9
percent from September's 444.63 million dinars (dlrs 1.47 billion).
 &UR; ___
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Imports by the United Arab
Emirates, which declined 4 percent last year, are expected to fall
further, the Emirates Industrial Bank said in a study released
Monday.
	   ``The slowdown in the economy, caused by the fall in oil prices
and a lower gross domestic product this year, means that demand
will be dampened for sometime. A decline in import value in real
terms is not only a possibility, but a likelihood,'' it said.
	   In 1997, imports declined four percent to 81.5 billion dirhams
(dlrs 22.2 billion) from 85 billion dirhams (dlrs 23.2 billion) in
1996.
	   The bank said the slowdown followed what it called a ``virtually
break-neck increase'' between 1992 and 1996, when imports grew by a
phenomenal 63 percent.
	   It said the Emirates and its partners in the six-nation Gulf
Cooperation Council, which heavily depend on foreign goods, were
now planning to align their laws on standards for imported
products. Currently, Gulf-wide standards exist only for certain
items.
	   It also said that domestic manufacturing had not been able to
make any impact on imports.
 &UR; ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ The Saudi Hollandi Bank, a leading
commercial bank in Saudi Arabia, is opening a representative office
in Lebanon, the bank said in a statement Monday.
	   The official opening on Tuesday represents the first
international expansion for the bank.
	   ``Lebanon was chosen for this first step outside of the (Saudi)
Kingdom in view of the expanding business and social ties between
Lebanon and Saudi Arabia,'' the statement said.
	   The bank's managing director, Herman Erbe, said the positive
outlook for Lebanon and the potential for profitable business
opportunities were the main force behind the opening of an office
in Beirut.
	   Netherlands ABN-Amro Bank owns a 40 percent stake in the Saudi
Hollandi Bank.
	   Several international and regional companies and financial
institutions have opened offices in Lebanon since the end of the
1975-90 civil war, encouraged by the country's multibillion dollar
reconstruction program.

<TEXT>
	   GARISSA, Kenya (AP) _ The death toll in an attack on a remote
northeastern Kenyan settlement now stands at 142, a district
official said Monday.
	   North Eastern Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu said
another 34 graves had been found over the weekend after the Oct.
24-25 attack at Bagala about 200 kilometers (125 miles) west of
Wajir. He said 59 people were still missing, and seven had been
hospitalized in Wajir with serious injuries.
	   It was not clear how many bodies were in each of the newly
discovered graves. Some of the graves found earlier contained as
many as five bodies.
	   Makhanu said an earlier decision to open all the hastily made
graves to obtain a more precise death count had been overturned out
of respect for the Muslim victims.
	   A day after Muslim leaders criticized the government for failure
to act following the attack, Makhanu said President Daniel arap Moi
would visit the wounded Wednesday in Wajir, 240 kilometers (150
miles) north of Garissa, the provincial capital.
	   Makhanu blamed rebels of the Oromo Liberation Front from
neighboring Ethiopia for the attack, but he did not offer any
proof. At the same time, he said he did not rule out clan-based
banditry as the cause of the attack.
	   Conflicts over scarce grazing land and access to water in arid
northeastern Kenya are not uncommon among the pastoralist people
who live there.
	   In the capital, Nairobi, the daily East African Standard chided
the government for its delay in explaining the cause of the attack
which the newspaper said ``has created room for rumors and a number
of other wild theories...''
	   During a peaceful demonstration in Nairobi Monday, North Eastern
Province student leader Abdille Yussuf Mohamed said the government
has to protect all its people, ``otherwise you exclude that part of
Kenya.''
	   On Sunday, members of the Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims
criticized government neglect of the region and opposed exhumation
of the bodies, saying it would be an insult to Muslims whose
religion does not permit it.
	   SUPKEM deputy secretary general Ibrahim Lethome said the
government would do better to mobilize security personnel to rescue
the kidnapped and recover stolen livestock.
	   Makhanu said the attackers had been seen herding the 1,785 head
of cattle and 2,075 camels in neighboring Eastern Province. He said
military helicopters and soldiers had been dispatched from Garissa
and Wajir to capture the animals.
	   In a fax to news agencies late last week, the Oromo Liberation
Front denied any role in the attack which it said pitted members of
the Boran and Gabra tribes against Kenyan ethnic Somalis of the
Degodia sub-clan.
	   Instead, the OLF said, the attack was a continuation of an
earlier conflict fostered between the Borana and Degodia by the
Ethiopian government in southwestern Ethiopia, the home of the
Oromo people, who are the largest ethnic group in Ethiopia.
	   ``The Ethiopian agents who instigated the conflict in Ethiopia
in 1997 managed to extend it to Kenyan territory,'' the statement
said.
	   Borders drawn by colonial powers cut across ethnic lines in
Ethiopia, Somalia and Kenya

Government considers using postal savings to ease credit crunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan is considering new economic stimulus measures
that would allow it to tap the nation's massive postal savings
system to help companies ride out a severe credit crunch, a news
report said Monday.
	   Under the measure, the government would be free to lend money
from the postal savings system to companies that have found their
credit lines cut as Japan's banks divert capital to writing off an
estimated trillion dollars in bad debt, Kyodo News reported without
citing sources.
	   The measure would relax restrictions on where the Ministry of
Finance, which manages the savings system on behalf of the post
office, can invest the system's funds.
	   Millions of ordinary Japanese keep a total of 235 trillion yen
(dlrs 1.6 trillion) deposited at the post office, making it the
largest bank in the world.
	   If adopted, the measure would make it easier to invest some of
that money in corporate bonds, thus keeping a line of credit open
to companies having difficulty raising money elsewhere, the report
said.

Clashes over Jerusalem settlement, Netanyahu says growth goes on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a clash over Israeli construction in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli police scuffled Monday
with a senior Palestinian official and clubbed his bodyguards.
	   Three Palestinians were injured, including two who were
hospitalized.
	   The disputed site is a four-acre plot owned by U.S. millionaire
Irving Moskowitz in Ras al-Amud, a Palestinian neighborhood just
outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City.
	   Moskowitz plans to build 132 homes for Jews at the site. The
government has approved the construction and recently allowed
settlers working with Moskowitz to erect a fence around the
property.
	   On Monday, Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian Authority
official in Jerusalem, arrived at the site, ringed by several
bodyguards, to try and stop the work.
	   Some 80 police officers blocked Husseini and his supporters. The
two sides began pushing and shoving, with the bodyguards clinging
to Husseini to protect him. At one point, officers took a guard
into a chokehold and wrestled him to the ground. The Palestinian
screamed in pain as officers pushed him down.
	   ``We are here protecting our city. We're here defending the
future of our rights here,'' Husseini said.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish their capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. The final status of the city is to be determined in
negotiations on a permanent peace agreement that have not yet
begun.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, denied a report in
the Israeli Haaretz daily that he had given the United States to
understand that there would not be a substantial expansion of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Netanyahu said Israel would stick to its policy, which has been
to allow the natural growth of settlements.
	   ``Contrary to the reports, I did not commit to any changes in
our policy,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   The Israeli group Peace Now, which opposes settlement building,
found allocations for settlement and road building in the West Bank
amounting to dlrs 114 million (483 million Israeli shekels) in the
1998 state budget now being considered by Israel's parliament.
	   In the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron, construction crews
continued Monday to build roads and lay pipelines for a new
neighborhood of 200 apartments, said the mayor of Kiryat Arba, Zvi
Katzover.

Frankfurt homeowners begin laying sandbags against swollen Main
</HEADLINE>
River &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional details on missing children, no heavy
rain forecast for coming days &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ High water moving down the
rain-swollen Main River flooded the historic center of Wertheim on
Monday, while Frankfurt residents began laying sandbags to protect
houses in low-lying areas.
	   At least one boy drowned after falling into a racing river over
the weekend, and four others in western Germany were missing and
presumed dead as well.
	   With no more heavy rains predicted for the next few days,
officials hoped the situation along rivers in western Germany would
ease, avoiding a repeat of 1995's catastrophic flooding.
	   But high waters continued to threaten low-lying areas as waves
moved downstream, especially along the Main River.
	   About 3,000 people in Wertheim, southeast of Frankfurt where the
Main and Tauber rivers meet, were affected by the flooding. The
water flooded basements and was 60 centimeters (2 feet) deep in
some streets, and officials said it would take a few days before it
receded.
	   Emergency workers downriver in Frankfurt said a street along the
Main and the Eisenersteg pedestrian bridge in the center would
probably be closed Monday night as the high water passes through.
	   Some 30,000 sandbags were ordered to begin protecting houses in
one suburban neighborhood where a tributary joins the Main.
However, officials said they did not expect anywhere near the
levels of 1995's flooding.
	   In eastern Germany, ship traffic was stopped on the swollen Elbe
River in Dresden, although officials said the water level was still
below critical levels.
	   Police in Kaiserslautern reported a 4-year-old boy fell into the
Sachsbach River Sunday afternoon; his body was recovered a
kilometer (half a mile) downstream.
	   Divers resumed searching for a 2-year-old boy who fell into the
rushing Holzbach River in North Rhine-Westphalia state on Sunday. A
search also continued in Veitschoechheim, near Frankfurt, for
another 2-year-old last seen running toward the Main River on
Saturday.
	   And in Lower Saxony state, special dogs that can pick up human
scent under water were called in to help search for two 5-year-old
boys last seen Saturday afternoon playing in a backyard bordering
on the Ilse River near Wolfenbuettel.
	   In each case, police said there was little hope of finding the
boys alive.

U.S. envoy heads to Belgrade for more Kosovo talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in final five grafs with quotes, color from Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was
headed to Belgrade on Monday for talks with top Serbian officials,
trying to jump-start the stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic
Albanians to agree on a political settlement for Kosovo.
	   Hill was scheduled to meet with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic after arriving from the Macedonian capital Skopje, then
head to Kosovo's capital Pristina on Tuesday.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Hill is leading diplomatic
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed this year in authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   ``We continue to work with both sides, going back and forth,''
said Philip Reeker, Hill's spokesman in Skopje, when asked about
the status of talks.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule.
	   But Reeker said the West has never looked at that date as a
deadline.
	   ``This (promise) was to show their compliance and that they are
actively pursuing negotiations,'' he said.
	   He said direct talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians are not
merited until the two sides get closer to a settlement.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to put as many as 2,000 international
monitors on the ground in Kosovo to verify the status of
Milosevic's other promises are proceeding slowly. About 70
Americans who will participate in the verification mission
reportedly arrived in Belgrade on Sunday and were preparing to head
for Pristina.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons in
Kosovo in the next few days will increase the force's size to about
200, OSCE spokesman Walter Kemp said in Vienna.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind Monday brought the first winter weather for refugees
struggling to return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that harassment by Serb
police prevented them from moving back to their villages in the
region.
	   Ahmet Morina, 25, drove 13 family members huddled under plastic
sheeting on a tractor-pulled cart to a relative's house because
police fired shots at them and took their 30 cattle, killing three,
the day before at Quka Goareve village.
	   In nearby Bubavec, relatives of Murat Kryezim, 53, told how they
finally were able to return to the family home on Saturday to
collect his bones, which had been lying outside his house since a
shell killed him during a Serb attack on July 28.
	   ``We tried a few times, but police would shoot and keep us
away,'' said Kryezim's niece, Sadbere, next to a canvas bag
containing his remains.

Clashes over Jerusalem settlement, Netanyahu says growth goes on
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Israel-Palestinians &QL; 
 &UR; By DINA KRAFT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a clash over Israeli construction in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, Israeli police scuffled Monday
with a senior Palestinian official and clubbed his bodyguards.
	   Three Palestinians were injured, including two who were
hospitalized.
	   The disputed site is a four-acre (1.6-hectare) plot owned by
U.S. millionaire Irving Moskowitz in Ras al-Amud, a Palestinian
neighborhood just outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City.
	   Moskowitz plans to build 132 homes for Jews at the site. The
government has approved the construction and recently allowed
settlers working with Moskowitz to erect a fence around the
property.
	   On Monday, Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian Authority
official in Jerusalem, arrived at the site, ringed by several
bodyguards, to try to stop the work.
	   Some 80 police officers blocked Husseini and his supporters. The
two sides began pushing and shoving, with the bodyguards clinging
to Husseini to protect him. At one point, officers took a guard
into a chokehold and wrestled him to the ground. The Palestinian
screamed in pain as officers pushed him down.
	   ``We are here protecting our city. We're here defending the
future of our rights here,'' Husseini said.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish their capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. The final status of the city is to be determined in
negotiations on a permanent peace agreement that have not yet
begun.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, denied a report in
the Israeli Haaretz daily that he had given the United States to
understand that there would not be a substantial expansion of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Netanyahu said Israel would stick to its policy, which has been
to allow the natural growth of settlements.
	   ``Contrary to the reports, I did not commit to any changes in
our policy,'' Netanyahu told reporters.
	   The Israeli group Peace Now, which opposes settlement building,
found allocations for settlement and road building in the West Bank
amounting to dlrs 114 million (483 million Israeli shekels) in the
1998 state budget now being considered by Israel's parliament.
	   In the Kiryat Arba settlement near Hebron, construction crews
continued Monday to build roads and lay pipelines for a new
neighborhood of 200 apartments, said the mayor of Kiryat Arba, Zvi
Katzover.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Australia's Mark Philippoussis and Tommy Haas of
Germany got off to a winning start Monday on the first day of the
dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open -- the last Super 9 event of the year.
	   Philippoussis, the world No. 19 who just missed out on a seeding
here, had a tough first round contest, needing two tie breaks to
beat the Czech Republic's Daniel Vacek 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6).
	   The Australian is to play another Czech, No. 10 seed Petr Korda
in the second round.
	   In his first appearance at the Paris Open, Haas defeated Spain's
Carlos Costa, 7-5, 6-1.
	   Haas reached the final of the recent Lyon Grand Prix after
walkovers against Pete Sampras and Marcelo Rios.
	   In the next round here, the 20-year-old German faces Spain's
Alex Corretja, the player who beat him at the Lyon final.

Arafat agrees to Israeli request to delay implementation of deal

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat agreed Monday
to a request by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to
postpone the start of their land-for-security agreement by several
days.
	   Netanyahu, in turn, said he would try to stick to the timetable
of the 12-week agreement and carry out the first troop pullback in
the West Bank as close to the original date of Nov. 16 as possible.
	   While the leaders compromised, tensions grew between the two
sides in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem. Israeli police scuffled
with a senior Palestinian Authority official, Faisal Husseini, and
his bodyguards who were protesting the construction of a Jewish
enclave in the Palestinian neighborhood of Ras al-Amud.
	   Police clubbed the bodyguards as they clung to Husseini. One
Palestinian was wrestled to the ground and screamed in pain as a
police officer squeezed his head.
	   The peace agreement was to have taken effect at midnight Monday,
or exactly 10 days after it was signed by Netanyahu and Arafat at
the White House.
	   However, Netanyahu said Monday that he could not start
implementation until the agreement has been ratified by his Cabinet
and by Israel's parliament. The Cabinet is to begin its debate on
Tuesday, but it is not clear when it will vote. The Israeli
parliament session on the accord is scheduled to begin Nov. 11.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent
of the West Bank over 12 weeks, with each phase accompanied by
Palestinian security measures, such as confiscation of weapons.
	   Netanyahu said in a statement that in the first two weeks, the
Palestinians would have to take a series of steps, such as
presenting their security work plan to the United States.
	   Israel's first real test will come two weeks into the accord
when 2 percent of the West Bank are to be transferred from sole
Israeli control to shared rule with the Palestinians and another
7.1 percent are handed over to sole Palestinian control.
	   ``If the agreement is approved by the Cabinet and the Knesset,
we will be able to abide by the (withdrawal) date stated at the
White House (16/11/98), or a few days later at the most,'' the
statement said.
	   Arafat said he received a call from Netanyahu on Monday. ``He
asked me for some days to delay implementation of what had been
agreed upon,'' Arafat told The Associated Press in the West Bank
town of Ramallah. Asked whether he agreed, Arafat said: ``Yes.''
	   As part of the agreement, the United States has urged both sides
to refrain from unilateral actions, such as expanding Jewish
settlements and declaring Palestinian statehood unilaterally in May
at the end of the five-year period of Palestinian autonomy.
	   The Israeli daily Haaretz, citing U.S. diplomatic officials,
said Monday that the United States believes it has obtained a
verbal assurance from Netanyahu that Israel would not engage in a
``substantial'' expansion of settlements.
	   Netanyahu denied the report, saying Israel would keep building
to accommodate the natural population growth in the settlements but
would not establish new communities.
	   On Monday, work continued on the expansion of Kiryat Arba, a
settlement of 6,000 residents just outside the tense, divided West
Bank town of Hebron. Workers were paving roads and working on the
utilities for a 200-apartment neighborhood, said the mayor of
Kiryat Arba, Zvi Katzover.
	   In other developments Monday, Palestinian police identified a
19-year-old Hamas activist as the suicide bomber in last week's
attack on an Israeli convoy in the Gaza Strip.
	   The assailant was Suhib Timraz, a resident of the Jebaliya
refugee camp, said the commander of the Palestinian security
forces, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali.
	   The attack killed an Israeli soldier and the assailant, but 40
Israeli school children in the convoy escaped unharmed.
	   On Sunday, a leaflet by the Hamas military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, made unprecedented threats against Arafat, saying he had
``reached the point of treason'' by arresting more than 100 Hamas
activists in response to Thursday's suicide bombing.
	   Arafat dismissed the threats with a wave of the hand. ``It's not
the first time and won't be the last. You know that I have faced
many things like that. I don't care,'' said Arafat who has survived
several attempts on his life.
	   Meanwhile, Palestinians burned Israeli and American flags at
Lebanon's largest refugee camp Monday to protest the U.S.-brokered
peace accord with Israel.
	   And in Damascus, Syria, a coalition of radical Palestinian
factions condemned the peace deal on Monday and pledged to continue
armed struggle against Israel.
	   Many Arabs and Palestinians have criticized the deal as a
sell-out. Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are fearful Arafat's
peace will not lead to their return to their old villages, many now
in Israel, or get them to Palestinian-controlled territory.

Thirty-four arrested for Georgian revolt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Thirty-four people have been arrested
for alleged involvement in a one-day revolt against President
Eduard Shevardnadze, but the mutiny's leader remained at large,
prosecutors said Monday.
	   The suspects include 26 civilians and eight members of the
military, chief military prosecutor Badri Bitisadze said on
national television.
	   Soldiers from a western Georgian garrison who took part in the
mutiny last month have returned to their base. The suspected leader
of the revolt, Akaky Eliava, and some of his allies have been
charged with treason and went into hiding after the Oct. 19 revolt
failed. They remained at large Monday, Bitisadze said.
	   Eliava is a military commander who supported the late Georgian
president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia.
	   Gamsakhurdia, Georgia's leader when it gained independence in
1991 with Soviet collapse, was ousted in early 1992 and fought a
short war in a bid to return to power. He died under mysterious
circumstances in 1994. His followers remain bitterly opposed to
Shevardnadze.

	   PORT SAID, Egypt (AP) _ Suez Canal revenues for the first nine
months of the year totaled dlrs 1.29 billion, a fall of dlrs 33
million from the corresponding period last year, the head of the
Suez Canal Authority said Monday.
	   Lt. Gen. Ahmed Ali Fadel said the fall in income was due to a
drop in the value of the dollar.
	   Revenues have suffered for years as supertankers travel around
the tip of Africa and avoid the canal. The increased use of
pipelines has also led to a decrease in use of the canal.
	   Canal fees remained unchanged in 1998 for the fourth consecutive
year.

Jewels stolen from Gina Lollobrigida in Munich hotel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional details on theft &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Thieves at a Munich hotel stole a bag
from Gina Lollobrigida containing 30,000 marks (dlrs 18,000) worth
of jewelry, but the Italian actress was more upset about losing two
notebooks that also were inside.
	   The 71-year-old Lollobrigida had checked out of a luxury hotel
Sunday and was waiting in the lobby for a taxi to the airport when
the theft occurred.
	   Two well-groomed men walked past her bags, which were standing
just inside the hotel exit. One picked up her black crocodile
leather cosmetic case while the other blocked him from view. The
man with the bag then jumped in a car and took off; his accomplice
fled on foot.
	   The thieves were captured on a hotel video camera, but police
say they have no leads in finding them.
	   The actress, who was in Munich for a TV appearance, told
Monday's Suddeutsche Zeitung that she had already written off as
lost forever the gold necklace with rubies, a pair of gold earrings
and other jewelry pieces that were in the bag.
	   But she said she'd pay a reward for the return of two notebooks
that contained private addresses and business cards. These were
``an especially bitter loss,'' she said.

	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ South Korea and Australia played to a
1-1 tie Monday in the 20th Champions Trophy men's field hockey
tournament in the Pakistani city of Lahore.
	   In the only match of the day, a 24th minute goal from Kim Young
Kui was equaled by Australian Troy Elder's fine deflection 10
minutes before the final bell.
	   South Korean goalkeeper Ku Jin Soo saved a number of attacks as
Australians enforced five short corners in the first half. Adam
Commens was off target on a reverse flick, while captain Jay Stacy
and James Elmer were neatly stopped by Jin Soo late in the first
half.
	   With a 1-0 lead at half time, South Korea slowed down the pace
of the game in the second half. This allowed the Australians to hit
back with a 60th minute goal from Elder who was finely set up by
Matthew Wells' strong drive from outside the circle.
	   Both teams now have four points from two games. Holland is in
the lead with six points. Hosts Pakistan as well as Spain have one
point each, while Germany with two defeats in as many games are at
the bottom of the table in this six-team competition.
	   Result: South Korea 1 (Kim Young Kui (24th min); Australia 1
(Troy Elder (60th min).
	   Teams: Australia: Adam Commens, Jason Duff, Troy Elder, James
Elmer, Lachlan Dreher, Ben Taylor, Jay Stacy (captain), Daniel
Sproule, Lachlan Vivian-Taylor, Mark Hickman, Scott Webster,
Stephen Holt, Matthew Wells, Murray Richards, Brent Livermore, Dean

Jewish settlements to get millions in new Israeli budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is to spend dlrs 114 million on Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights next
year, a group critical of the settlements reported Monday.
	   The Peace Now group which advocates an Israeli withdrawal from
most of the West Bank and Gaza and dismantling of Israeli
settlements there, released a report about the state budget
proposal now under consideration by Israel's parliament.
	   It found allocations, ``some obvious and some concealed,''
amounting to dlrs 114 million (483 million shekels) for settlements
and access roads in the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan, captured by
Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   The group notes that in the Wye River accord signed Oct. 23 in
Washington, Israel and the Palestinians pledged to refrain from
unilateral steps. Israel's government maintains that the Wye
agreement does not apply to construction inside settlements.
	   Peace Now claims that attempts were made to hide some of the
allocations by changing the names of the budget lines. For example,
``West Bank'' does not appear in the Agriculture Ministry budget.

South African troops begin withdrawing from Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A convoy carrying 800 South
African soldiers rumbled out of Lesotho on Monday, reducing troops
strength of an intervention force by almost one-quarter.
	   The withdrawal came after South Africa's armed forces chief,
Gen. Siphiwe Nyanda, announced the situation in Lesotho had
stabilized.
	   South African troops crossed the border into the mountainous
kingdom on Sept. 22 to quell an army mutiny and unrest linked to
the May election, which the ruling party won by a landslide but
which opposition parites claimed were rigged.
	   Botswanan soldier joined the intervention, waged on behalf of
the Southern African Development Community, a day later. Dozens of
people died in what had been expected to be a peaceful
intervention.
	   Monday's withdrawal reduces the number of South African and
Botswanan soldiers in Lesotho from 3,500 to 2,700.
	   Ppposition parties received 39 percent of the vote in the May
election but only one of 80 seats in parliament.
	   Opposition parties have reportedly agreed to a proposed interim
committee which will prepare for new elections and propose a more
democratic and representative electoral system.

Police base in remote state capital besieged by rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with deputy police commander saying
reinforcements had not yet entered town. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK BAJAK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A remote state capital remained cut off
Monday after a fierce attack by more than 800 guerrillas who
pummeled the besieged police garrison with homemade missiles.
	   The 120 police officers stationed in Mitu _ about a fourth of
them teen-agers _ fought for more than 12 hours on Sunday against
the rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or
FARC.
	   In their last radio contact at 2 p.m. Sunday, the police
reported four officers killed and nine wounded. Authorities feared
the toll could be far higher.
	   Reinforcements were not expected to reach the town of 15,000
people near the border with Brazil until sometime later Monday.
	   ``The combat ended yesterday at about 6 p.m. but the
(reinforcement) troops have not yet entered town,'' The deputy
police commander, Gen. Luis Ernesto Gilibert, said Monday morning.
Asked for a casualty update, he said, ``We don't know a thing.''
	   The Colombian Red Cross had a rescue team in Mitu, said
Gilibert, but had not yet reported anything.
	   The homemade missiles _ fired by the FARC from modified six-foot
propane gas cylinders _ were first used by the rebels in an Aug. 3
assault that leveled a police anti-narcotics base in the same
region.
	   The FARC, who have not lost a battle in nearly a decade,
captured 130 police and soldiers in that raid.
	   Mitu is only accessible by air and water. Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano, the national police commander, said the rebels seized
control of the airport and cut communications at the outset of the
attack, blowing up the phone company's microwave tower.
	   The Mitu attack came a week before the government's promised
Nov. 7 deadline for withdrawal of all troops from a huge area of
southern Colombia _ 16,200 square miles (41,958 square kilometers)
_ to meet get peace talks under way. FARC is the hemisphere's
largest and oldest rebel group.
	   No date has been announced for the talks, and a letter from the
FARC commander to the government's chief negotiator, released
Sunday, suggested that it may be weeks before negotiations begin.
	   In the Oct. 20 letter, Manuel Marulanda said ``the military high
command has created special commando units to sabotage the
beginning of the dialogue,'' accusing them of planning to kill him
and President Andres Pastrana at an inaugural ceremony.
	   ``For this reason, my presence at the act is not assured,''
Marulanda said in the letter, which was sent to the Radionet
network.
	   He alleged that hooded soldiers were searching vehicles in the
zone.
	   The federal ombudsman said last week that paramilitary gunmen _
private armies that have been linked to the military and kill
alleged guerrilla sympathizers _ had entered the zone and could
imperil peace talks.
	   Before Sunday's attack, the FARC was holding at least 248
soldiers and police officers captive. It has asked the government
to exchange them for 452 jailed rebels before peace talks commence.
	   So far, Pastrana has refused.

Russia and Belarus to set up joint parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and Belarusian lawmakers decided Monday to
set up a joint parliament to legislate a loose union treaty between
the nations.
	   Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, an autocratic leader
openly nostalgic for the Soviet Union, has strongly pushed for the
full merger of his nation of 10 million with its giant eastern
neighbor.
	   The two nations signed a union treaty in April 1997 that
envisaged close political, economic and military ties but stopped
short of creating a single state.
	   On Monday, members of the Russian and Belarusian parliaments met
in the Russian city of Yaroslavl on the Volga River, opening their
session with the Soviet anthem.
	   They decided to create a joint legislature, though it was
unclear whether any further approval was needed to form the new
body.
	   Without substituting national parliaments, the joint legislature
would pass laws dealing with union issues.
	   The joint parliament would consist of two chambers. The lower
house would be created by popular vote and consist of 75 Russian
and 25 Belarusian members. The vote will be held simultaneously
with parliamentary elections in both nations.

Prosecutors expected to appeal High Court decision
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Isabel Allende delegation arrives; new quotes and
info &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Charging that Britain could become a haven for
dictators, prominent Chilean opponents of Gen. Augusto Pinochet
arrived Monday to bolster an appeal by British prosecutors against
a court decision calling the general's arrest illegal.
	   ``We are fighting for justice,'' said Isabel Allende, daughter
of the late Salvador Allende, the leftist president toppled by
Pinochet in a 1973 coup.
	   Ms. Allende, a congresswoman, arrived at London's Heathrow
Airport with a delegation of lawmakers and human rights activists,
some of whom want to testify at the appeal.
	   British prosecutors _ acting on behalf of a Spanish magistrate
seeking the former Chilean dictator's extradition on allegations of
murder, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year rule _ have until
the end of the business day Monday to appeal formally appeal.
	   The High Court ruled last week that Pinochet is immune from
prosecution as a former head of state.
	   Hearings before five judges in the House of Lords, Britain's
highest court, are tentatively scheduled for Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested in a central London hospital Oct. 16
after undergoing back surgery. He was granted bail Friday, but
remains under police guard at another hospital, Grovelands Priory,
in north London.
	   Chile's democratically elected government has appealed to
Britain to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds and says his
arrest threatens to split the country's new democracy, built up
after he stepped down in 1990.
	   Juan Pablo Letelier, a congressman whose father, Allende's
foreign minister Orlando Letelier, was killed by a bomb in
Washington in 1976, said the ``problem'' was in the British courts
_ not the government.
	   ``What is worrying, not only to us but I'm sure to the majority
of this society, is that England cannot become a safe haven for
dictators or violators of human rights,'' said Letelier, whose
father's assassination was officially blamed on Pinochet's secret
police.
	   ``We know that is not something the government supports, nor the
opposition supports, nor the English people support,'' he added.
	   If the appeal to the House of Lords fails, Pinochet likely would
be free to leave England, despite moves by courts in several other
European countries to have extradited at the instigation of Chilean
exiles.
	   A medically equipped Chilean air force jet is waiting at the
Royal Air Force base Brize Norton outside London to take him home.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says some
3,000 people disappeared during Pinochet's rule.

Warring sides sign accord to end Guinea-Bissau conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to ADD details of agreement, rebel
participation in government, other details. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's warring sides have signed
an accord to end 5 months of bitter fighting in the West African
country and form a new coalition government, officials announced
Monday.
	   A Nigerian-led West African intervention force will arrive later
this month to keep the peace, Gambian Foreign Minister Sedat Jobe
said.
	   The agreement came late Sunday night during talks between
Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira and the rebel leader,
Brig. Ansumane Mane, held in secrecy at the mansion of Nigeria's
military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   Abubakar endorsed the agreement as did Gambian President Yaya
Jammeh.
	   The pact, announced Monday morning, calls for a re-affirmation
of a ceasefire signed in August, the withdrawal of all foreign
forces and the introduction of a buffer force of West African
peacekeepers.
	   Mane has indicated he will not participate in the new government
of national unity, but the rebels will appoint several people to
the coalition cabinet to be led by Vieira, Jobe said.
	   The new government will be formed within 10 days and
presidential elections are to be held no later than next March.
	   Members of the West African force called ECOMOG are expected to
arrive in Guinea-Bissau later this month.
	   Under the leadership of regional powerhouse Nigeria, ECOMOG has
played aggressive roles in ending seven years of fighting in
Liberia in 1996 and toppling Sierra Leone's junta in March. Several
thousand peacekeepers remain in both countries.
	   Portugal's Foreign Minister Jaime Gama called the deal a
``decisive step in the right direction.'' Gama's visit to the
former Portuguese colony last month led to an agreement by Vieira
and Mane to meet face-to-face for the first time since the war
began.
	   The talks began in Gambia's capital of Banjul on Friday and were
moved to Nigeria's capital early Saturday to coincide with the
second day of a summit of leaders from the 16-member Economic
Community of West African States.
	   The ECOWAS summit closed on Saturday night with a written appeal
by the organization for the warring parties to resolve their
differences peacefully. But the Guinea-Bissau talks continued
Sunday into the night.
	   Jobe said mediators prevailed on the protagonists to accept the
plan, drawn up with the assistance of ECOWAS officials, by ``making
them feel responsible for the crisis.''
	   About half of the country's 1 million people have been displaced
by the fighting, although no one knows how many people were killed
and wounded.
	   Jobe said he was optimistic the accord would hold, saying his
president ``was convinced that if (the antagonists) could be
brought together, then there was a very good chance of a truce
being reached. That is exactly what happened in Abuja.''
	   The conflict in the former Portuguese colony began June 7 when a
breakaway faction of disgruntled military veterans seized the main
army garrison and international airport in the capital Bissau.
	   The rebels accused Vieira of corruption and had demanded that he
step down.
	   Although Senegal and Republic of Guinea sent troops to Vieira's
aid, the insurgents have overrun most of the small country.

Three Latvian parties propose forming government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ After near a month of negotiations, three of
the six parties in the new Latvian parliament on Monday said they
were ready to form a minority coalition government.
	   But it is not clear whether the proposal would be accepted by
the parliament. The three parties in the proposed coalition hold
only 46 of the 100 seats in the Saeima, and the proposal leaves out
the People's Party, which has the single largest bloc of seats.
	   The coalition proposal includes two centrist parties _ Latvia's
Way and the New Party _ and the right-wing Fatherland and Freedom
party.
	   The three parties are in broad agreement about continuing the
former Soviet republic's generally successful market-oriented
economic reforms. But the nationalist Fatherland and Freedom takes
a tougher line than the others on the potentially volatile issue of
integrating ethnic minorities.
	   Fatherland and Freedom supported efforts to overturn reforms to
the Latvia's naturalization law that make it easier to apply for
citizenship. Russia had threatened trade sanctions against Latvia
unless it eased conditions for the small country's hundreds of
thousands of non-citizen ethnic Russians.
	   The reforms were narrowly supported in a referendum last month,
but nationalist sentiment still runs strong.
	   The three parties are proposing Vilis Kristopans of Latvia's Way
as the new prime minister, to replace incumbent Guntars Krasts of
Fatherland and Freedom.
	   President Guntis Ulmanis has said he will name a prime
ministerial candidate on Tuesday, when the new Saeima convenes, and
that he will push for a government to be approved by the parliament
by Nov. 18, which is Latvia's Independence Day.
	   The president is not required to favor parties that have signed
a coalition agreement. After previous elections, he has asked the
party receiving the most votes in the election to take the lead in
forming a government, which in this case would mean the People's
Party.
	   But the head of the People's Party, former prime minister Andris
Skele, is deeply disliked by leaders of the other main parties, who
describe him as too pushy and heavy-handed.

Israel to clears the way to opening of Gaza airport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Paving the way to the opening of the first
Palestinian airport, Israel will release Monday the night vision
landing equipment held up in its port for over a year, a
Palestinian official said.
	   The opening of the Gaza International Airport is one of the
central provisions of the latest Mideast peace accord signed by the
two sides last month in Washington.
	   Fayez Zeidan, Palestinian negotiator in charge of the airport
said the new facility was scheduled to begin operating Thursday
with the landing of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's personal
plane. However, delays in the timetable of the agreement could
postpone the opening.
	   According to the peace accord, the airport could open as early
as Wednesday.
	   But Monday, both sides agreed to delay the implementation of the
nascent accord by two days until the Israeli Cabinet approves the
deal.
	   ``With the release of the equipment, the airport will be ready
to handle arrivals and departures at any hour,'' Zeidan said.
	   Zeidan said completion of a joint Israeli-Palestinian building
for passport inspection, security and travel permits needs to be
completed before commercial flights will be able to land.
	   Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said the Palestinians are
responsible for the construction of that building and said the
authority was trying to finish it quickly.
	   The one-terminal airport in the southern city of Rafah in the
Gaza Strip will provide Palestinians with their first unfettered
route out of Palestinian territories.

maybe thousands of villagers were buried in the mudslides when a
crater lake collapsed in Nicaragua.
	   Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that
between 1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile
(82.88 square-kilometer) area below the slopes of the Casita
volcano in northern Nicaragua.
	   ``We perhaps will never know how many people died,'' Bolanos
said.
	   The international Red Cross said Monday it will triple its
appeal for assistance to those hit by Mitch, and it is now seeking
10 million Swiss francs (dlrs 7.4 million).
	   ``It is almost impossible to get an overview of damage in this
huge region, but help can't wait,'' said Santiago Gil, head of the
Americas Department of the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies.
	   Decomposing bodies protruded everywhere from the mud, which let
loose when an overflowing volcano crater caused a hillside to
collapse and cover four villages.
	   Soldiers reached the area on Sunday, two days after the
catastrophe. They found 360 bodies, burying most where they lay
because the rotting corpses posed a health threat, army spokesman
Capt. Milton Sandoval said.
	   A journalist who flew to the area on a military helicopter said
a body _ sometimes just an arm sticking up out of the mud _ could
be seen every 10 yards (meters) in an area stretching 10 miles (16
kilometers) by 4 miles (7 kilometers). The stench of rotting flesh
was almost unbearable.
	   One resident, Francisco Manuel Pineda, sat on a tree trunk above
what had been his village of El Porvenir _ 50 miles (80 kilometers)
northwest of the capital, Managua _ and recounted what other
survivors had told him:
	   ``It was raining torrentially. They heard something like a fleet
of helicopters, and within minutes an avalanche of mud, tree trucks
and rocks wiped out everything,'' he said through tears.
	   Pineda had left his village Friday morning to buy medicine. He
hitched a ride with the military Sunday to see what was left of his
world.
	   There wasn't much.
	   He found no sign of his house, nor of his wife, his father, his
mother, his brothers, his sisters or his sons. All were believed
buried in the mud.
	   ``We saw corpses everywhere. Hands, legs and the entire bodies
of two girls who were decomposing in the mud,'' he said. ``There
were more than 60 corpses in plain view.''
	   It was unclear how many residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa may have
fled in time to avoid the mudslide.
	   Dr. Marcos Espinosa said in a telephone interview that 126
survivors from the four villages had been treated at a hospital in
nearby Chinandega for ``fractures and serious wounds'' that had
become infected after the victims spent nearly two days in the mud.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman declared three days of national
mourning in what he said was the country's worst natural disaster
since an earthquake killed 5,000 people in 1972.
	   Turmoil caused by the storm took additional lives Sunday, when
the mayor of the Honduran capital and three others died in a
helicopter crash while out surveying flood damage in that country.
Tegucigalpa Mayor Cesar Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely
presidential candidate in 2001 elections.
	   And a C-47 cargo plane crashed Sunday in western Guatemala,
killing 12 people aboard and injuring six. The accident may have
been caused by bad weather associated with Mitch, airport officials
in Guatemala City said. The plane apparently was operated by a
Protestant missionary group with ties to the United States, but the
victims' nationalities were not known.
	   In all, Nicaragua reported 585 confirmed dead; Honduras, 246. El
Salvador said 140 people died and Guatemala reported 33. Mexico
reported one death from the hurricane.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 crew members aboard that hasn't been heard
from since Tuesday.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, army rescue helicopters evacuated 52 famished
and ailing men, women and children from San Francisco Libre, a
Nicaraguan town on the northern banks of Managua Lake, 25 miles (40
kilometers) north of the capital. In that community alone, 1,600
families were left homeless.
	   One survivor, Candido Mejia, 58, was so weak he could barely
give his name after he and his two children were airlifted to
safety.
	   Townspeople said they had to climb trees and onto roofs last
week when the lake flooded the farming community. No deaths were
reported, but many residents had not eaten for several days.
	   Rescue workers left behind rice, corn, beans and other
provisions before taking the sick to get medical care.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near an astonishing 180 mph
(289 kph), had dropped to 30 mph (48 kph), and the storm _ now
classified as a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on
Mexico's southern Pacific coast. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph
(13kph) and was dissipating.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Young blacks on Monday mourned
the shooting death of a rising star of kwaito, the rap-derived
music that has become a leading art form to emerge in
post-apartheid South Africa.
	   Oupa Mafokate, known as Makhendlas, apparently shot himself in
the head in despair after wounding an abusive concertgoer Saturday
night at a stadium near Nelspruit, 300 kilometers (185 miles) east
of Johannesburg, police said.
	   The shooting highlighted lax security and episodes of violence
that sometimes accompany kwaito concerts, called ``bashes,'' which
can be marked by scuffling fans and trashed arenas.
	   It also brought attention a genre that has become a symbol of
black empowerment. Kwaito blossomed with the fall of apartheid,
when black-owned record companies and private radio stations began
arriving on the scene.
	   Kwaito is ``the post-apartheid cultural expression of young
black people,'' said Diane Coetzer, a free-lance music writer.
``It's the first time South Africa's youth have something they can
call their own.''
	   According to the musician's manager, Mpho Makhetha, three or
four drunken men slipped through security backstage before the
concert and began harassing the musicians.
	   Mafokate intervened. ``When he tried to talk to them, they just
kept on swearing at him and taunting him. ... Oupa as a last resort
drew his gun, with the hope of firing a warning shot to try to
scare them away,'' Makhetha said in a telephone interview. ``By
accident he shot one of them.''
	   Makhetha called Mafokate's apparent suicide a sudden act of
remorse.
	   ``I guess Oupa thought at the time he had killed the guy. That's
why he did what he did,'' the manager said. ``He was doing so well
career-wise. He was the father of a 4-month old boy.''
	   The Soweto-born Mafokate, 27, was emerging from the shadow of
his older brother Arthur, one of South Africa's top kwaito stars.
	   The younger Mafokate's single Emenwe Phezulu (``Fingers Up'' _ a
sign of joy) was a hit last year, and its celebratory lyrics about
partying made it an anthem at kwaito concerts.
	   His latest album ``Jammer'' sold more than 80,000 copies, a
major success for South Africa, said Sean Watson-Smith, general
manager of CCP Records, Mafokate's label. It was Mafokate's third
album.
	   YFM, a Johannesburg-area station that champions kwaito, received
scores of calls Monday from saddened listeners, and played tributes
to Mafokate. A memorial was scheduled for Thursday in Johannesburg.
	   Kwaito is an African-flavored rap with injections of rhythm and
blues, hip-hop and rave. Most of the lyrics are in Iscamtho, a
street lingo that combines Zulu, Sotho, Tswanah, Afrikaans and
other African languages as well as English. It is said to be named
after a township gang, the Amakwaito, or the Afrikaans word
``kwai,'' or ``cool.''
	   ``Next to gospel, it's the biggest-selling genre money-wise and
in terms of influence in South Africa,'' Coetzer said.
	   The songs dwell on life in the townships but have little of the
violent and sexist lyrics found in much American rap.
	   ``It is music that represents the identity of what people are
about now,'' said Randall Abrahams, YFM's station manager.

U.S. envoy heads to Belgrade for more Kosovo talks

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill was
headed to Belgrade on Monday for talks with top Serbian officials
to try to jump-start the stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic
Albanians to agree on a political settlement for Kosovo.
	   The U.S. ambassador to the neighboring country of Macedonia is
leading diplomatic efforts to bring the two sides closer to a
political solution for the secessionist Serbian province, where
hundreds of people have been killed this year in fighting.
	   Hill was scheduled to meet with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic on Monday after arriving from the Macedonian capital,
Skopje, then head to Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on Tuesday.
	   ``We continue to work with both sides, going back and forth,''
said Philip Reeker, Hill's spokesman in Skopje, when asked about
the status of talks.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule.
	   But Reeker said the West has never looked at that date as a
deadline.
	   ``This (promise) was to show their compliance and that they are
actively pursuing negotiations,'' he said.
	   He said direct talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians are not
merited until the two sides get closer to a settlement.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to put as many as 2,000 international
monitors on the ground in Kosovo to verify the status of
Milosevic's other promises were proceeding slowly. About 70
Americans who will participate in the verification mission
reportedly arrived in Belgrade on Sunday and were preparing to head
for Pristina.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons in
Kosovo in the next few days will increase the force's size to about
200, OSCE spokesman Walter Kemp said in Vienna.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind Monday brought the first winter weather for refugees
struggling to return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that harassment by Serb
police prevented them from moving back to their villages in the
region.
	   Ahmet Morina, 25, drove 13 family members huddled under plastic
sheeting on a tractor-pulled cart to a relative's house because
police fired shots at them and took their 30 cattle, killing three,
the day before at Quka Goareve village.
	   In nearby Bubavec, relatives of Murat Kryezim, 53, told how they
finally were able to return to the family home on Saturday to
collect his bones, which had been lying outside his house since a
shell killed him during a Serb attack on July 28.
	   ``We tried a few times, but police would shoot and keep us
away,'' said Kryezim's niece, Sadbere, next to a canvas bag
containing his remains.

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The latest fad in Bosnia _
hand-held laser toys _ are drawing words of warning after a laser
aimed at a U.S. helicopter injured two crew members.
	   ``We don't know what type of laser was used in this incident.
Because of strength, we are assuming it was not a small laser, but
we don't exclude there could be someone just playing with a toy,''
NATO spokesman Lt. Col. Stephen Kerrick said Monday.
	   The two UH-60 helicopter crew members sustained minor corneal
burns last week near the town of Zenica.
	   The injured men were identified as the pilot, Chief Warrant
Officer Steven McCoy, and crew member Sgt. Juan Villareal, both
from the 1st Cavalry Division in Texas. No other information on the
men was immediately available.
	   It was the first incident involving lasers in which medical
treatment was required. There have been three other reports of
suspected pen-type laser devices being aimed at U.S. aircraft in
northern Bosnia, but no injures were reported.
	   The two injured crew members have been temporarily removed from
flight duty.
	   Because of last week's incident, U.S. helicopter crew members
now must wear protective glasses during flights.
	   ``We are assuming this was not any type of hostility,'' Kerrick
said from northern Bosnia, where most of the 6,900 U.S. troops are
deployed.
	   He said the military believes children heard the helicopter and
aimed a toy laser at it to see what would happen. ``There are a lot
of people who don't understand that the toys could be dangerous if
improperly used.''
	   NATO officials have contacted local police and governments,
trying to learn more about the incident and to warn people how
dangerous the toys can be.

Khatami to visit France in February
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to include Embassy confirms Le Monde report of visit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Iranian President Mohamad Khatami is to visit
France in February, his first official trip to a European country,
the spokesman for the Iranian Embassy said Monday.
	   The spokesman, Amir Shahidi, was confirming a report in the
newspaper Le Monde.
	   Shahidi said the visit would take place toward the end of
February, but he could not provide an exact date.
	   Khatami places special importance on Iran's relations with
Paris, and has put invitations from other European nations on hold
until he first visits France, the daily Le Monde quoted Iran's new
ambassador to Paris, Ali-Reza Moayeri, as saying.
	   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine extended an official
invitation to Khatami during his visit to Tehran in August.
Vedrine's was the highest level visit to Iran in seven years.
	   France, along with other European nations, hopes to further
trade with a more moderate Iran, as well as boost the fortunes of
Khatami, whose stated wish to reach out to the West must be
balanced with efforts to assuage hard liners.
	   Ambassador Ali-Reza Moayeri replaces Ambassador Hamidreza
Assefi, whose term in Paris had ended, the embassy said.

Strike shuts Eiffel Tower for third full day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf to show no pay cut with 35-hour week &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Eiffel Tower -- the most visited monument in
the City of Light -- stood empty for a third full day Monday, with
striking workers refusing to relent on their demand for more
personnel.
	   The press office for the Eiffel Tower refused to predict when
the ``grande dame'' of Paris monuments would reopen its steel
grills to visitors.
	   Workers, mainly hosts and hostesses, went on strike at 4:30 p.m.
(1530 GMT) Friday, shutting out up to 35,000 visitors over the All
Saints Day holiday weekend, and an expected 8,000 visitors on
Monday, a traditionally slow day, the press office said.
	   That adds up to a more than 2 million-franc (dlrs 365,000) loss,
according to a press office spokeswoman, refusing to identify
herself by name.
	   A faxed statement said striking workers are demanding that seven
more people be hired. Management contends that it has hired a
sufficient amount of extra personnel -- 20 part-time workers --
since the start of the 35-hour work week went into effect at the
Tower in April. Five more part-time employees are to be hired at
the beginning of 1999.
	   The 35-hour work week is part of a plan of France's leftist
government to spread jobs around with a shorter work week and
reduce the 11.7 percent unemployment rate. Workers who trim their
hours from 39 to 35 receive the same pay.

Moldovan National Bank will let national currency slide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Moldova's central bank abandoned its
support of the currency on Monday, after spending nearly half its
hard currency reserves to prop up the leu since August because of
Russia's financial troubles.
	   The head of the Moldovan National Bank, Leonid Talmaci, said the
former Soviet republic has spent dlrs 120 million to support the
leu since Russia's crisis hit in mid-August.
	   ``We have dlrs 180 million left in our deposits and we cannot
afford to spend them (to support the currency),'' said Talmaci.
	   The Moldovan leu has depreciated 34.3 percent against the dollar
since August, from 4.7 lei to the dollar to 6.4 Monday.
	   Talmaci predicted the leu would fall to 8 to the dollar in the
next few days.
	   Inflation will likely hit 40 percent this year because of the
devaluation, he said, four times higher than the government had
predicted.
	   The central bank also decided Monday to require commercial banks
to sell 25 percent of their dollars to the central bank, up from
the earlier requirement of 8 percent.
	   Exporters will most benefit from the leu's free slide. About 65
per cent of Moldova's exports go to Russia, 9 percent to Ukraine
and 5.5 per cent to Romania, the National Bank said in a statement.

Brewery hires guards to protect billboards in battle for beer
</HEADLINE>
supremacy &QL; 
 &UR; By GEORGE MWANGI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya Breweries said Monday it has hired
guards to protect its giant yellow and black billboards as the
battle with Castle Brewing of South Africa over the lucrative
Kenyan beer market heats up.
	   ``Over 20 billboards have been defaced in Nairobi only,'' said
KBL spokesman Muthui Kariuki. ``They are sprayed with indelible
paints, or the paper is torn; after that the best you can do is to
remove them.''
	   Kariuki said one 12-foot by 45-foot billboard (3.6 m x 13.5 m)
costs about 430,000 shillings (dlrs 7,166).
	   Castle Brewing opened a brewery and bottling plant outside
Nairobi earlier this year in a major move into the Kenyan market.
South African Breweries, of which Castle is a division, already has
brewing deals in Tanzania and Uganda.
	   On Monday Castle placed ads in local newspapers saying their
billboards had also been defaced by unidentified people.
	   ``We believe the vast majority of Kenyans would agree that such
actions are totally against the spirit of competition''
advertisement said.
	   Neither Castle nor the public relations firm representing it in
Kenya would comment on the attacks on KBL billboards or say how
many of its own had been defaced.
	   But at a launch last week of Castle products, managing director
Roger Smith likened the competition with the 75-year-old Kenyan
brewer, previously known as East African Breweries and reknown for
its Tusker Export label, to being in a war zone.
	   As Castle prepared to enter the Kenyan market, KBL invested
heavily in sophisticated outdoor and radio and TV advertising with
the slogan ``One country, one beer'' or ``My country, my beer.''
	   Entire buildings in towns and villages across the East African
nation are painted the intense KBL yellow, and the brewery has
poured money into sponsorship of the Kenyan national soccer team,
the Harambee Stars, and the first division soccer league.
	   Smith said Castle would also concentrate on sports-related
advertising.
	   In order to compete with the canned beer Castle produces at its
Thika brewery, KBL has contracted with Mauritius Breweries on the
Indian Ocean island to produce Tusker in black, white and yellow
cans until its own canning line begins operations.
	   But KBL's trademark Tusker elephant has run up against a wire
fence in South Africa, and the firm has been forced to withdraw its
bottled Tusker Premium from that market.
	   Sabmark International, the holding company of the trademarks
licensed to South African Breweries, claims exclusive right to
anything resembling an elephant in on a bottle or can of beer.

Settler rabbi demands compliance with evacuation orders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Warning that all settlements could be lost, a
West Bank rabbi is calling on settlers to obey government orders,
even if it means leaving parts of the West Bank.
	   ``It is absolutely forbidden to engage in a violent struggle,''
writes Rabbi Yoel Bin Nun in the latest issue of the settler
magazine ``Nekuda,'' due to be published this week.
	   Bin Nun is a spokesman for moderate settlers and critical of
hard-liners who advocate resistance against Israeli government
decisions they do not accept. In the past he has needed bodyguards
after his life was threatened by extremists.
	   ``Nekuda'' is read by settlers throughout the West Bank and
Gaza. In his article, Bin Nun calls on rabbinical authorities in
the West Bank to issue religious rulings requiring settlers to
follow instructions of Israeli police or soldiers, including orders
to evacuate ``a road, a hill, an area.''
	   Otherwise, he warns, ``we will not have the ability even to
defend existing settlements'' from evacuation in a future peace
agreement, arguing that only consensus, not confrontation, can save
the settlements.
	   In the past, West Bank rabbis have issued rulings and opinions
justifying resistance against evacuation of settlements. Surveys
show that thousands of Israelis are prepared resist violently.
	   Bin Nun demands that settler leaders and rabbis draw ``red
lines,'' allowing demonstrations but forbidding all violence,
physical and verbal, and following orders from Israeli police and
soldiers ``immediately, with no delay or hesitation.''

Belgian justice system faces renewed attacks after another blunder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's embattled justice system came
under renewed attack Monday after it became clear a string of
violent holdups will not come to court because a 10-year statue of
limitations will soon run out.
	   ``This should not be possible ... the judiciary has committed
another grave error,'' said Louis Vanvelthoven, parliamentary
leader of the ruling Socialist party.
	   The incident is the latest in a long series of embarrassments
for Belgium's legal system, which has been widely criticized
recently, most notably over handling of a series of child sex
killings.
	   ``The judiciary humiliates itself again,'' wrote the Brussels
daily De Standaard.
	   The so-called Securitas Gang committed a series of robberies in
1987 and 1988 on armored cars transporting money. The gang shot and
seriously injured two guards, and stole 100 million francs (dlrs 3
million).
	   Police charged 21 suspects in the crimes, but failed to bring
the case to court. One of the key suspects escaped and a
17,000-page legal dossier on the case was mysteriously stolen.
	   Procedures were further slowed by the replacement of
magistrates, and a court agenda filled to overflow brought the
10-year deadline ever closer. Defense lawyers added to the delays
with appeals. It took a local court 18 months to reject just the
admissibility of an appeal.
	   The official deadline for the case runs until December 30, but
officials have said it was next to impossible to bring the case to
court before that.
	   ``It is a slap in the face of the population and the victims of
the case,'' Vanvelthoven told Monday's edition of the daily Het
Belang van Limburg newspaper. ``This is criminal negligence on the
part of the justice system.''
	   The center-left government is currently in the midst of a reform
of the justice and police systems in an attempt to cure
deficiencies.
	   Two years ago, the rescue of two young girls hidden in the
basement of convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux and the later
discovery of the four slain girls prompted two parliamentary
investigations that condemned the inefficiency of the police and
justice system.
	   Further underlining the inefficiency of the security system,
Dutroux, the nation's No. 1 criminal suspect, escaped pretrial
custody in April, setting off an international manhunt before he
was recaptured hours later.

Yeltsin allows sale of 5 percent stake in Gazprom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Gazprom share prices rising on news of sale,
Maslyukov saying IMF approved plan to print 12 billion rubles,
Central Bank requesting EBRD loan. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree Monday
permitting the cash-strapped Russian government to auction off up
to 5 percent of one of its most valuable assets _ the natural gas
monopoly Gazprom, the world's largest gas company.
	   Yeltsin, who was recovering from his latest illness at the Black
Sea resort of Sochi, signed the order approving the auction and
allowing foreign investors to take part. No date was set.
	   However, the Interfax news agency later quoted unidentified
officials as saying that the government may decide not to sell a
stake in Gazprom this year because its stock price has fallen
sharply. If the auction goes ahead, no more than 3 percent of the
company will be sold, it added.
	   The government has repeatedly postponed the sale because it was
hoping to get a better price. Russia's financial troubles have
scared away foreign investors and driven down share prices.
	   But with the International Monetary Fund reluctant to give
Russia more loans, the government has little choice but to sell
more shares to pay off its huge debts.
	   The government currently holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares and
said it may gradually reduce its holdings to 25 percent. Private
investors in Russia and abroad hold the remaining shares.
	   Foreign ownership of Gazprom stock was previously limited to 9
percent, but the decree signed by Yeltsin raises that limit to 14
percent.
	   In August, the Russian government set the starting price for a 5
percent stake in Gazprom at dlrs 1.65 billion _ more than double
the current international market price.
	   Yeltsin's decree did not say whether the government would
reassess the price, but unidentified officials speaking to Interfax
said the starting price would be ``far below'' dlrs 1 billion.
	   The decree sent Gazprom prices rising sharply at the Moscow
Stock Exchange. In the first 43 minutes after the announcement, the
prices climbed 14 percent, from 1.52 rubles per share to 1.738,
Interfax reported.
	   The government has already canceled plans to sell stakes in
several state-run oil companies.
	   If Russia cannot raise enough cash through taxes, loans or
privatization sales, it may have to print more money to pay off
overdue wages and pensions.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and other government officials
have said they will keep money-printing to a minimum to avoid high
inflation.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said Monday that the
IMF has approved the government's plan to print up to 12 billion
rubles (dlrs 760,000 at the current rate) this year, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported. Russia's top IMF representative, Martin
Gilman, was not available for comment Monday.
	   Russia's Central Bank has also requested a loan from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to restructure the
country's banking system, the EBRD Moscow representative, Neil
Parison, said Monday.
	   The collapse of the ruble and the government's default on its
treasury debt has rattled Russia's banking system.

Police say 4-year-old died in game that went wrong
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Two brothers, ages 5 and 7, killed a
4-year-old boy when child's play turned into an argument, police
said Monday after more than two months of investigation.
	   The victim, identified only as Kevin, was found dead on the
shore of a lake Aug. 16 in Arvika, about 300 kilometers (180 miles)
west of Stockholm. After initially suspecting the death was caused
by an adult molester, police began focusing on neighborhood
children.
	   Arvika police commissioner Rolf Sandberg said at a news
conference that the children had been playing in a usual way,
climbing trees and doing broad-jumps, when an argument broke out
over whether to pretend they were fishing.
	   The two older boys began hitting Kevin and struck him on the
neck with a branch, the blow that killed him, according to
Sandberg. The boys then tried to hide the body by placing it on a
wooden pallet that was floating at the water's edge, he said.
	   ''The children knew that Kevin was dead. That's why they moved
the body,'' Sandberg said, according to the news agency TT.
	   Children under 15 cannot be charged with crimes in Sweden.
Social service authorities will decide in confidential proceedings
what to do with the boys.
	   ''These two boys need help now, and probably will for a long
time,'' Sandberg said.
	   ''The parents are having it very tough today, since they have
understood what happened. They're also under care now, together
with the children,'' he said.

Graf comeback in doubles ends in loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf's latest comeback from
injury after a two-month layoff began Tuesday with a first-round
defeat in doubles at the dlrs 450,000 Leipzig Open.
	   Graf, the former No.1 plagued by injuries most of the past two
years, played for the first time since a hand injury that flared up
at the U.S. Open led to an operation.
	   Graf teamed up with a member of her juniors program, 16-year-old
Mia Buric, and fell 5-7, 4-6 to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and
Natascha Zvereva.
	   The 29-year-old Graf returns in singles Tuesday against
Romania's Ruxanda Dragomir. Her return is earlier than expected
because the hand healed faster than anticipated.
	   The German, who dominated women's tennis for a decade with her
powerful forehand, had been scheduled to return Nov. 9 at the
Philadelphia event.
	   The hand injury derailed the latest comeback of Graf, who has
captured 103 tournaments in her career, from a knee injury last
year that threatened to end her long career.
	   Altogether the German has suffered over 50 injuries in her
career, with the problems growing in recent years. Her world
ranking has dropped to 22.
	   Graf's juniors program is located in Leipzig and she was one of
the founders of the tournament.

Disputed island reverts to Yemeni control
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix category code &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANA`A, Yemen (AP) _ As Eritrean forces withdrew, Yemen's flag
was raised once again over the Red Sea island of Greater Hanish,
effectively ending a nearly three-year dispute between Yemen and
Eritrea over control of the island.
	   The ceremony Sunday, which was attended by Yemeni Defense
Minister Mohammed Dhaifullah Mohammed, is the final step in the
hand over of the disputed island.
	   Yemen and Eritrea fought a battle over three Red Sea islands in
December 1995. Eritrea captured Greater Hanish island, while Yemen
retained control of Lesser Hanish and Zuqar.
	   On Oct. 9, the International Court of Arbitration - a panel of
experts based in The Hague - awarded all three islands to Yemen and
stipulated that its decision should be honored within 90 days. The
court's decisions are legally binding.
	   The hand over was a ``step toward security in the Red Sea,''
Mohammed told The Associated Press.
	   The decision leaves Yemen free to develop the islands for
tourism, scuba diving, oil and other enterprises.
	   The islands sit across one of the world's major shipping lanes,
160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the Bab el-Mandeb strait at the
southern entrance to the Red Sea.
	   Marring the festivities was the death of one Yemeni soldier who
drowned when a dingy carrying him to the island overturned.

Italians lead charge again; Spain, France contending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Italians have virtually owned the UEFA Cup for
a decade. And they don't look ready to give it up.
	   All four Italian teams _ Parma, Fiorentina, Bologna and Roma _
are positioned to advance from Tuesday's 15 second-round,
second-leg matches.
	   Five Spanish and four French sides are still alive _ and only
one trails after the first leg. But both countries have abysmal
records in this cup. France has never won it and Spain last took it
in 1986 with Real Madrid.
	   Compare that to Italy's record.
	   In an all-Italian final six months ago, Inter Milan beat Lazio
3-0. Of the last 10 UEFA Cups, Italians have won seven. And of the
last 20 teams in those finals, 13 have been Italian.
	   Of the four Italians clubs in this season's UEFA Cup, Parma is
probably the pick. The '95 UEFA Cup champions are home to Poland's
Wisla Krakow after a 1-1 draw two weeks ago and a 2-0 win over
Fiorentina Saturday _ moving up to fifth place in Serie A.
	   Parma has yielded only two goals in seven league matches and
will be difficult to break down at home. Argentine striker Hernan
Crespo, who scored twice against Fiorentina, is expected to be
rested and replaced by fellow Argentine Abel Bablo.
	   Dino Baggio, who was struck in the head by a metal object thrown
from the stands in Krakow (he claimed it was a pocket knife), will
be in the lineup after being suspended on Saturday.
	   Fiorentina is home to Switzerland's Grasshoppers with a 2-0
lead.
	   ``Nothing was lost,'' said Fiorentina coach Giovanni Trapattoni
of the weekend stumble. ``We still are in the running for all three
season targets, the league title, the UEFA Cup and the Italian Cup.
I expect some quick revenge against the Swiss.''
	   Fiorentina may rest Brazilian star Edmundo, who is suffering
stomach problems, with Brazilian-born Belgian Luis Oliveira teaming
up front with Argentine Garbiel Batistuta, who leads the Italian
league with eight goals.
	   Roma, playing some of Italy's best soccer and in third place
behind leader Juventus, goes to England's Leeds with a 1-0
advantage.
	   Roma coach Zdenek Zeman is expected to start captain Francesco
Totti up front with Marco Delvecchio, countering with Cafu and
Aldair on defense. No. 1 goalkeeper Michael Konsel is out following
tendon surgery, with substitute Antonio Chimenti expected to play.
	   Leeds is without South African defender Lucas Radebe (knee) and
England international goalkeeper Nigel Martyn (ribs).
	   Bologna, leading 2-1 going to Slavia Prague and fresh from a 2-0
win over Venezia, is relying on long-injured Swedish striker Kennet
Andersson. Andersson teams with Bebbe Signore.
	   Slavia Prague has some hope after beating FC Opava 3-0 last week
_ the first time this season it has scored more than one goal in
league play.
	   Of the five Spanish teams, only one _ Celta's Vigo _ trails
after the first leg. Valencia is home to Liverpool after a
scoreless draw. Real Sociedad plays in San Sebastian leading Dynamo
Moscow 3-2. Betis is in Seville after a 1-1 draw at Willem II, and
Atletico Madrid is home after beating CSKA Sofia 4-2.
	   For struggling Betis, it will be the first UEFA match under new
coach Javier Clemente, fired in September as the national coach. At
Valencia, 500 police are being deployed to cope with any trouble
from English fans.
	   Real Sociedad is coming off a 4-1 loss Saturday to Barcelona,
and Celta is down 1-0 going to England's Aston Villa.
	   The four French clubs _ Lyon, Monaco, Olympique Marseille and
Bordeaux all play home matches.
	   Marseille is a favorite to beat Werder Bremen after a 1-1 draw.
The French leaders will be without midfielder Eric Roy, who has a
knee injury. Two other injured starters are doubtful: Fabrizio
Ravanelli and Patrick Blondeau.
	   Lyon, 2-1 winners against Red Star Belgrade, will miss injured
sweeper Hubert Fournier. Jacek Bak, who scored a key goal in the
first round against Blackburn Rovers, takes his place.
	   Monaco coach Jean Tigana gets a boost after a 3-3 draw against
Grazer AK with the return of injured French World Cup striker David
Trezeguet. But another French World Cup star, Thierry Henry, is
doubtful.
	   Bordeaux takes a 1-0 lead into its home match with Vitesse.
	   In other Thursday games with first-leg scores, it's Club Brugges
vs. VfB Stuttgart (1-1); FC Zurich vs. Glasgow Celtic (1-1).
	   On Thursday, Scotland's Rangers play at home with a 2-1 lead
over Bayer Leverkusen.

Mark Johnson and Neal Broten on rescue mission for U.S. hockey
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Mark Johnson and Neal Broten worked magic 18 years
ago for the United States, conjuring up the ``miracle on ice'' at
the Lake Placid Olympics.
	   They're back together again in a USA uniform. But this time
they're on mission to save the Americans from the scrap heap of
international hockey.
	   With NHL players unavailable, three retired old-timers _
Johnson, 41, Broten, 38, and future NHL Hall of Famer Joe Mullen,
41 _ lead the Americans as they open a three-game World
Championship qualifying series Thursday in Klagenfurt, Austria.
	   Relying on Europe-based players, the Americans face favorite
Kazakhstan, Estonia and Austria. The top two qualify for the
16-team World Championship in May in Norway. In nearby Ljubljana,
Slovenia, Germany, Ukraine, France and Slovenia face off in another
group.
	   The four non-qualifiers fall into Group B of world hockey with
also-rans like Hungary and Denmark. The Americans were last in that
secondary division in 1983.
	   This tournament doesn't jeopardize American participation in the
2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. The United States qualifies
automatically as host.
	   But it has psychological and even moral overtones.
	   It's been a horrible year for American hockey. There was the
infamous room-trashing at the Nagano Olympics _ the guilty never
confessed. Three months later, without a single Olympic team
member, the United States finished an embarrassing 12th at the
World Championship in Switzerland, a result which forced the
Americans into this week's qualifying.
	   ``It (the Olympics) put a black eye on all players in the United
States,'' Johnson said in a telephone interview as the team arrived
Monday in Austria. ``With the entire world watching it had a big
impact. It was disappointing.''
	   ``Then what happened last spring in the world championship left
a bad taste in people's mouths,'' added Johnson, an assistant coach
at the University of Wisconsin and an 11-season NHL player. ``Maybe
this can be the start of going in the right direction again.''
	   Played in May at the height of the NHL season, the world
championship is always plagued by the absence of North American
stars. Jeff Jackson, who coached the Americans last year, was
blunt.
	   ``The event has no respect in the United States,'' he said.
	   Maybe not, but other world hockey powers like Sweden, Finland,
Russia and the Czech Republic take it seriously.
	   ``We know the USA is a great hockey country and it would be
unfortunate to lose them from the top group,'' said Kimmo Leinonen,
spokesman for the IIHF, hockey's world governing body. ``Maybe
these older guys will bring that the spirit of that 1980 team.''
	   Broten, describing himself as ``75 percent in shape,'' has been
practicing for three weeks at home in Minnesota with brothers Aaron
and Paul, retired NHL players who are also on the team.
	   Broten is only playing because his brothers are.
	   ``I really haven't skated much for a year and a half,'' said
Broten, who retired in '97 after 18 seasons in the NHL. ``We're not
going to out-skate or out-shoot or out-pass 'em. We'll just have to
out-smart em.''
	   Unlike Neal Broten, Johnson has been working out since August
and skates daily. Like Broten, he isn't looking for a leading role.
	   ``I wouldn't anticipate a lot of ice time. We're going in
support and maybe provide some leadership,'' he said. ``Sure, and
if you like, add some memories.''
	   The team is coached by Ben Smith, who took the U.S. women to
Olympic gold in Nagano.
	   ``We hope that will rub off,'' said Darryl Seibel, spokesman for
USA Hockey.
	   Of the 23 players on the roster, seven _ including Neal Broten
and Johnson _ played in the Olympics. The others are forwards David
Emma, John Lilley, Corey Millen, and defensemen Greg Brown and
Chris Imes.
	   About a dozen have NHL experience. Most are playing in leagues
in Germany, Britain, Slovenia, Finland and Austria, with one
college player _ Jason Blake of the University of North Dakota _
and two from the American Hockey League.
	   And then there's Mullen. In 17 NHL seasons, he became the
all-time top scorer among American-born players with 502 goals and
561 assists in 1,062 games.
	   ``When we were growing up you dreamed about playing for your
country in events like this,'' Johnson said. ``The younger players
need to know that these tournaments often are inconvenient, but
when the country needs help, you ought to be there.''

	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ The Prince of Wales started his first
visit to this little Alpine nation Monday, visiting Slovenia's
tourist pearls and meeting with officials.
	   Slovene President Milan Kucan invited Prince Charles to visit
the former Yugoslav republic, for the first time since it gained
independence in 1991.
	   Prince Charles, known as being ardently interested in
architecture, heritage and ecology, received an official welcome
when he touched down at Ljubljana airport, where he was greeted by
a small girl bearing flowers.
	   He later visited the little town of Bled, set high in the Alps,
overlooking a picturesque lake and the mountainous Triglav national
park, where he saw the Pericnik waterfall and watched the training
of a mountain rescue service.
	   In addition to visiting the countryside, the Charles will also
be briefed about Slovenia's political and economic situation.
Slovenia is eager to become part of NATO and the European Union.
	   Later Monday, President Kucan is to host a dinner for Prince
Charles in the Brdo castle, former residence of the late, former
Yugoslavia's president Josip Broz Tito.
	   During the dinner, Prince Charles is to meet Leon Stukelj,
Slovenia's oldest Olympic winner, who is to celebrate his 100th
birthday on Nov. 12. Prince Charles will turn 50 two days later.
	   Prince Charles is to spend Tuesday in the capital Ljubljana,
before continuing to Romania, Bulgaria and Macedonia, another
former Yugoslav republic.
	   The Prince did not speak to reporters.

Reports of two tests handed over to judge in Diana investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The chief judge investigating the car crash that
killed Princess Diana received two key reports Monday, one showing
the Mercedes had no mechanical difficulties and another on the
driver's blood, judicial sources said.
	   Two other reports are expected to be turned over to Judge Herve
Stephan this week: one on the level of medical care Diana received
and another general report on the causes of the accident.
	   Civil parties to the investigation have one month to request the
judge to order a new panel of experts to provide a second opinion
on any of the reports once they are officially submitted, the
sources said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Once he has received all the reports, Stephan must decide
whether he has enough information to complete his investigation.
Requests for new tests by civil parties could possibly delay the
conclusion of the investigation.
	   Sources close to the investigation, speaking on condition of
anonymity, 10 days ago told The Associated Press the results of the
tests on the Mercedes show the car had no mechanical problems, was
going slower than originally believed and brushed against a Fiat
Uno.
	   The tests on the Mercedes, which were conducted for 13 months at
a police lab outside Paris, were considered the largest part of the
puzzle still missing in the investigation into Diana's death in a
Paris traffic tunnel Aug. 31, 1997.
	   Both crash tests and tests using a computer found the Mercedes
had no brake problems, contrary to reported testimony in the police
record that the car was dangerous when braking suddenly.
	   The car also had no problems with its air bags, and it was only
going 62 mph at the time of the crash, much slower than initial
reports indicated. Still, it is twice the speed limit for the area.
	   The tests also showed the Mercedes, as has long been believed,
brushed with a Fiat Uno before crashing although it is not known
what role that played in the crash.
	   Driver Henri Paul, who was legally drunk at the time of the
accident, was killed, as was Diana's boyfriend, Dodi Fayed. The
only survivor was bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones.
	   No details were available on the blood tests. A lingering
mystery has been the presence of a higher than normal level of
carbon monoxide in Paul's blood.
	   The main causes of the crash are still believed to be
drunkenness and speed.
	   The outcome of the judge's investigation will be important in
determining the fate of 10 paparazzi who are under formal
investigation in the crash. It is believed they will be cleared on
the manslaughter charge, but some may be tried on the charge of
failing to aid people in danger.

Judge orders son to provide evidence about Robert Maxwell's
</HEADLINE>
business &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A judge Monday ordered Kevin Maxwell, son of the
late publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, to provide the Trade
Department with a written statement of what he knows about the 1991
flotation on the stock exchange of his late father's Mirror Group.
	   Maxwell has refused to help unless he gets a lawyer paid for by
the government on grounds that he cannot afford the fees. He also
says the Trade Department is trying to force him to provide
evidence that could be used for another criminal prosecution
against him.
	   The Trade Department has been investigating for six years the
controversial 500 million pound (dlrs 850 million) flotation of the
Mirror Group in 1991. Maxwell disappeared in mysterious
circumstances at sea off his yacht later that year.
	   Two years ago Kevin Maxwell was acquitted of misusing dlrs 35
million in assets from a pension fund to pay off bankers as the
Maxwell empire was crumbling, and of conspiring with his father to
sell dlrs 160 million of stock from a pension fund to prop up
troubled Maxwell companies.
	   Maxwell, who lives in a 16th century country home near Oxford
and is now a director of several new companies, received some 10
million pounds (dlrs 17 million) in government legal aid during the
long and complex criminal trial. The payment of the lawyers' fees
caused considerable public anger.
	   Judge Sir David Neuberger, as a compromise, on Monday said
Maxwell could ask the Trade Department to show him the documents
they have used in the investigation at the next hearing in the New
Year.
	   ``I am entirely unhappy about the procedures adopted by the
(Trade Department) inspectors and I am being asked to provide
evidence without legal representation,'' Maxwell told the court. ``
I cannot be expected to assist the inspectors when legal
representation is not available.''
	   However, he said later the judge's ruling was a step forward as
he would get to see the Trade Department's investigation papers.
Inspectors have interviewed accountants and lawyers from top London
firms who helped in the flotation and former Mirror Group
executives.

Foundation seeks to help victims of East German communism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Groups seeking to help victims of East Germany's
communist dictatorship and preserve the history of opposition to
the collapsed regime got a boost Monday with the opening of a
federally sponsored foundation in Berlin.
	   With a budget of 1.3 million (dlrs 813,000) marks for this year
and 3.1 million (dlrs 1.9 million) in 1999, the foundation is
focusing first on rescuing and preserving documentary evidence of
resistance to the communist government, said Markus Meckel, head of
the advisory council.
	   The goal is to prevent the dictatorial nature of the East German
regime from being covered up or idealized through nostalgia, said
Meckel, who was a priest and pro-democracy activist in East Germany
before unification.
	   Because copiers were strictly controlled in East Germany, civil
rights and opposition groups printed fliers illegally on church
mimeograph machines. Today, archives of such material are in danger
of becoming worthless because the ink is slowly fading away, Meckel
said.
	   The foundation also intends to offer support to citizen's groups
dedicated to coming to terms with East German oppression and
counseling people who feel they were victimized by the state.
	   It also wants to promote international cooperation in coming to
terms with dictatorships, especially in other former communist
countries in eastern Europe.
	   The foundation is operating now with six employees out of
temporary quarters, but plans eventually to move into the former
headquarters of East Germany's communist party.
	   The building, now called the ``House of Democracy,'' is home to
numerous human rights and citizen initiative groups.

U.N. chief weapons inspector calls Iraq crisis most serious ever
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector Monday
called the crisis with Iraq the most serious ever because Baghdad
is directly confronting the U.N. Security Council by banning
monitoring of its weapons sites.
	   ``I think that's what makes this the worst confrontation by Iraq
with the Security Council that we've yet seen,'' Richard Butler
said in an interview on NBC's Today show.
	   Butler said the decision on whether to use force against Iraq is
up to the 15-member Security Council _ not just the United States,
which has said it will consider air strikes if Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein doesn't back down.
	   ``The Council has made binding international law. Iraq has to be
disarmed under that law,'' he said. ``If it refuses to comply and
do the things required - and that's what we appear to have on our
hands now - the council, of course, has to consider what steps it
will take to see that that law is enforced.''
	   With the start of a new month, the rotating presidency of the
Security Council changes _ in November to the United States. U.S.
diplomats said acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh will hold the
traditional bilateral meetings with other council members Monday to
discuss the council's agenda for the month.
	   The full council is unlikely to meet until Tuesday, when Iraq
will be at the top of the agenda.
	   ``I think that, in the first instance, this week we'll see the
council consider further non-military means,'' Butler said. ``But
beyond that, it's their call. And quite frankly, I can't speculate
what that call will be or when it will occur.''
	   Butler agreed with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen that
everyone is getting tired of dealing with Saddam.
	   ``Six months ago, I called it the Iraq syndrome; you know,
recurrent obsessive behavior that leads nowhere. Well, here we go
again _ the Iraq syndrome,'' he said.
	   Butler was asked in the NBC interview whether he would comply
with Iraq's demand that he step down as chief weapons inspector.
	   ``If the problem were as simple as that, of course that would
occur,'' Butler said. ``But that's just nonsense. It's a diversion
from their obligation to be disarmed. And that's what everyone has
to keep their eye on.''
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is ``almost
finished'' with its disarmament mission _ but Iraq cut off
inspections of new sites on Aug. 5, saying, ``We'll go no
further,'' Butler said.
	   Once Iraq is disarmed, UNSCOM is charged with monitoring its
weapons sites over the long-term ``to see they don't do it again''
_ but Baghdad cut off that monitoring on Saturday, he said.
	   The Iraqi announcement came less than 24 hours after the
Security Council sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
outlining the framework of a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions. But the letter did not meet
Iraq's demand that a review should lead to the lifting of crippling
economic sanctions.
	   ``Iraq didn't like the terms of that letter because it didn't
promise in advance the result that they wanted. It was like saying,
``We're not going to play this game until we know in advance that
we're going to be the winners.'' And, of course, that's wrong and
won't stand,'' Butler said.

Dresdner Bank hikes lost loan provision, shows lower pre-tax profit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS thruout with new material; CORRECTS LTCM losses to 240
million, graf 2 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Dresdner Bank on Monday became the
second major German bank in days to announce trading losses on the
world's financial markets, recording an operating profit drop over
the first nine months of nearly 27 percent.
	   The bank blamed financial crises in Asia and in Russia for the
losses, but also noted it lost 240 million marks (dlrs 150 million)
invested in the collapsed U.S. hedge fund Long-Term Capital
Management.
	   The bank, Germany's third-biggest, recorded a loss of 57 million
German marks (dlrs 35.6 million) in the third quarter, compared to
a profit of 632 million marks (dlrs 395 million) over the same
period last year.
	   The loss dragged down operating profits so far this year to 1.73
billion marks (dlrs 1.08 billion), a drop of 26.8 percent.
	   On Friday, Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest commercial bank,
said operating profits fell 24 percent over the first nine months
to 3.13 billion marks (dlrs 1.95 billion).
	   Despite Dresdner's profits drop, the figures were better than
analysts had expected.
	   In a letter to shareholders, Dresdner said Russia was causing
``special concern.''
	   Responding to risk from those quarters, the bank, Germany's
third-largest, said it had increased its provision for possible
loan writeoffs to 1.25 billion marks (dlrs 781 million,) a rise of
34 percent over the first nine months last year.
	   ``The third quarter shows the emerging-markets crisis has left
its mark on Dresdner Bank,'' said Volker von Kruechten, banking
analyst with BHF Trust in Frankfurt, adding the figure could
demonstrate a weakening profit trend.

Oriano Quilici, papal nuncio in Switzerland, dies at 69
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRIBOURG, Switzerland (AP) _ Oriano Quilici, the papal nuncio in
Switzerland, died Monday after a long illness, the Swiss bishops'
conference announced. He was 69.
	   Quilici, who was also nuncio in neighboring Liechtenstein, died
of cancer at the Insel clinic in the Swiss capital, Bern. He was
named as papal nuncio in Switzerland in July 1997.
	   Born near the Italian town of Lucca in 1929, Quilici took a
doctorate in ecclesiastical law at the papal Lateran University.
	   He was ordained a priest in 1954 and made a bishop in 1975. He
joined the Vatican's diplomatic corps in 1959 and served as papal
envoy to Chad and the Republic of Congo.
	   In 1981 Quilici was named as nuncio in Guatemala, and he served
as nuncio in Venezuela from 1990 to last year.
	   His deputy, Gian Baptista Ricca, will take over his post until
the Vatican names a successor.
	   Quilici's period as nuncio in Switzerland coincided with the
culmination of a crisis between the Vatican and Switzerland over a
conservative bishop.
	   Pope John Paul II moved last December to install Wolfgang Haas
as archbishop of Liechtenstein in an attempt to defuse tensions
with Switzerland, where Haas had served since 1990 as bishop of
Chur.
	   Haas angered liberals in his flock by opposing moves to allow
lay preachers and enhance the role of women in the church.
	   Quilici's funeral is expected to take place Thursday. Details of
survivors were unavailable.

Electronics giant to close a third of its factories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Philips shares closing 9.1 percent higher; ADDS
reaction from analysts. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Intent on scaling back bloated
production facilities, Dutch electronics giant Royal Philips
Electronics NV said Monday it will close about a third of its
factories worldwide.
	   Philips spokesman Ben Geerts said the company had already
announced in March that it would examine its industrial
infrastructure.
	   At that time, ``we had 269 factories and we will have reduced
this to 266 by the end of 1998,'' Geerts said.
	   The company, Europe's largest consumer electronics group,
``built too big a production capacity for requirements,'' Philips
President Cor Boonstra was quoted as saying in Monday's editions of
the Financial Times of London.
	   It was not immediately clear whether employees at the targeted
factories would be laid off or reassigned.
	   The Dutch group wants to cut the number of production sites to
between 160 and 170 from the current 244 by 2002, the newspaper
reported.
	   Geerts said the company didn't have a specific plan on how to
scale back the number, but that it would be done mainly through
streamlining operations and combining some production lines.
	   Monday's news boosted Philips' shares on the Amsterdam stock
exchange, which jumped 9.1 percent to close at 108.40 guilders
(dlrs 58).
	   Analysts said the company was simply continuing a restructuring
process it started two years ago. Jan Coen Balt of Effectenbank
Stroeve in Amsterdam said Philips was focusing more on distribution
and marketing than manufacturing, hoping that by cutting costs it
will be able to react faster to market demand.
	   The cuts come amid a rough season for Philips. The company said
last month that third-quarter income from normal operations fell 38
percent to 449 million guilders (dlrs 241 million). Philips also
plans to end its telecommunications joint venture with U.S.-based
Lucent Technologies.
	   The news followed a profit warning in September that income from
normal operations in 1998 should be unchanged from 1997.
	   Boonstra said Philips is still open to purchases in areas such
as medical products, semiconductors and lighting.
	   ``Now we can take our pick where we acquire and grow,'' he said,
adding that the company wants to expand mainly in the United
States.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) - Israeli warplanes fired rockets at
suspected guerrilla hideouts in three air raids Monday around the
wooded hills of Ein al-Tineh in south Lebanon, security officials
said.
	   The air attacks appeared to be prompted by the claim of the
Shiite Muslim militia Hezbollah that its guerrillas ambushed
Israeli commandos advancing in the area, ``scoring direct hits and
inflicting casualties.''
	   Ein al-Tineh is three kilometers (two miles) from the
Israeli-occupied zone in south Lebanon set up in 1985 to protect
northern Israel from guerrilla attacks.
	   Along with Monday's first raid by two jets at 3:30 p.m.
(1330GMT), Israeli gunners fired 25 artillery shells on the
targeted area, said the Lebanese security officials, speaking on
the customary condition of anonymity.
	   The two jets returned to fire two more rockets 40 minutes later,
the officials said. A third raid by two jets firing air-to-surface
rockets took place at 5 p.m. (1500gmt) on an area three kilometers
(two miles) to the northeast.
	   No casualties were reported from the air and artillery fire.
Lebanese army and guerrilla anti-aircraft batteries fired on the
raiding jets, the officials added.
	   In Israel, military officials said the air force attacked the
area, but gave no details. ``The pilots reported precise hits on
their targets and all pilots returned safely to their bases,'' an
army announcement said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah and other guerrilla groups are
fighting to oust 1,500 Israeli troops and 2,500 members of an
Israeli-backed Lebanese militia from the occupied enclave.

Iraq refuses to back down, U.S. leaves military option open

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq _ The 250-member National Assembly _ dominated by
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's Baath Party _ gave an expected
unanimous endorsement Monday to the government decision to halt all
work of U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq.
	   In defying the U.N. Security Council, Iraq says it does not want
a confrontation but only its rights. The United States hopes to act
with U.N. allies to resolve the crisis, but will not rule out a
military strike on its own.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told the parliament the U.N.
Special Commission in charge of arms inspections was being ``used
by the United States and Israel to execute their aggressive schemes
against Iraq.''
	   He said Iraq would not reverse its stand unless the U.N.
Security Council ensured that a promised review of Iraq's weapons
systems would lead to a lifting of punishing trade sanctions on the
country.
	   Saadoun Khalifa, a member of the National Assembly, told
reporters the government's action had the people's backing. ``I am
sure that all Iraqi people are in full support with this
decision,'' he said.
	   Aziz's rhetoric and parliament's vote to endorse the
government's decision showed the crisis that began Saturday with
Iraq cutting off all links to U.N. arms inspectors _ followed by
Security Council condemnation of the action _ are a repeat of last
winter's confrontation.
	   The only difference, so far, is that the United States is not
rushing warships and planes to the Gulf.
	   The next step may come after U.S. President Bill Clinton meets
with his foreign policy team Monday in Washington to discuss the
Iraq situation.
	   U.S. National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said Sunday
that ``all options remain on the table.'' Defense Secretary William
Cohen said Washington prefers to act with its allies, but will not
rule out unilateral military action.
	   Britain, the United States' staunchest ally in the Gulf War,
said Monday that Iraq must back down ``or face the consequences.''
Defense Secretary George Robertson said international forces
assembled in February, when Saddam last openly defied the United
Nations, remained in place.
	   For now, however, there seemed little chance of an immediate
military response.
	   On Sunday, Clinton expressed satisfaction that Russia and
France, which earlier leaned toward easing U.N. sanctions on Iraq,
joined the Security Council in denouncing Saddam's latest defiance.
	   ``I personally am very pleased that the U.N. Security Council,
including some people I thought had been a little tolerant with him
in the past, strongly condemned what he did,'' Clinton said in a
radio interview.
	   In Iraq on Monday, U.N. technicians were allowed to check the
cameras set up at monitoring sites to change the batteries and
video cassettes _ a task not included in Saturday's ban. Inspectors
from the International Atomic Energy Agency _ also not included in
the ban _ also carried on their work, said a U.N. Special
Commission spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   A Russian parliamentary delegation was to meet Saddam and hand
over humanitarian aid and medicines to Iraq, according to news
reports.
	   In Baghdad, officials already were saying Iraq can withstand a
U.S. attack.
	   ``Iraq does not fear the threat of the United States because it
has been threatening Iraq for the past eight years,'' Vice
President Taha Yassin Ramadan told reporters Sunday.
	   His comments echoed last January's mood when the United States
and Britain sent forces to the gulf in preparation for an attack.
That crisis ended with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan reaching a
compromise with Iraq.
	   Saddam's government had hoped that pact would lead to the
lifting of sanctions limiting Iraqi oil sales that were imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   On Sunday, Aziz laid out Iraq's demands for renewing cooperation
with the arms inspectors, who must ensure Iraq has eliminated its
weapons systems before the sanctions can be lifted.
	   Along with a pledge to lift sanctions, Iraq wants the U.N.
Special Commission reconstituted and commission chairman Richard
Butler fired, Aziz said.
	   Aziz said, however, that Iraq would not order the arms
inspectors to leave Iraq. In New York, Butler said he had no
intention of pulling his teams out and suggested a compromise was
still possible.

Victims of embassy bombing harassed, aid group says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ The Red Cross said Monday it is
investigating complaints of harassment from relatives of those
killed in the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya.
	   In particular, widows are falling prey to relatives who demand
large shares of a 100,000 Kenyan shilling (dlrs 1,670) death
benefit paid from a national fund as well as a share of marital
property, it said.
	   Deprived of their rightful compensation, and even family
property by relatives, some women report they are homeless, the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies
said.
	   ``Greed is global,'' said Al Panico, delegation chief in
Nairobi. ``But it is extremely disturbing to hear from women
already traumatized by the Nairobi tragedy, and now struggling to
care for their children, that their plight is being worsened by
those who would profit from their suffering.''
	   A total of 213 people, including a dozen Americans, were killed
in the terrorist bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi on Aug. 7.
Another 11 people were killed in the nearly simultaneous bombing of
the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania. More than 5,500 people
were injured.
	   A U.S. federal indictment alleges that four followers of Islamic
extremist Osama bin Laden plotted a far-reaching terrorist campaign
to kill Americans, including the bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Three suspects are in custody in New York, while a fourth is
being sought.
	   The federation is supporting a Kenya Red Cross program to
provide medical and social assistance to those disabled in the
bombing, as well as immediate families of bombing victims. About
1,000 people will be helped over the next year.

Algeria opposes deportation of Islamic militant to African nation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Algeria considers it ``inadmissible''
that Burkina Faso has taken in an Islamic militant expelled from
Switzerland and suspected of ties with a leading insurgency
movement, the government spokesman said Monday.
	   The Foreign Ministry summoned the charge d'affaires of the west
African nation demanding an explanation for the decision to accept
Ahmed Zaoui, deported from Switzerland on Thursday.
	   According to Ministry spokesman Abelaziz Sebaa, Algeria's envoy
to Ougadougou asked authorities in Burkina Faso to explain why they
accorded entry rights to ``one of the planners of terrorist action
in Algeria.''
	   Sebaa said Algeria finds it ``unacceptable'' that the nation
that currently holds the presidency of the Organization of African
Unity took in Zaoui -- ``at a time when the international community
is mobilizing against terrorism.''
	   Zaoui was once a leading member of Algeria's banned Islamic
Salvation Front, but recently split to form a dissident faction of
the party.
	   French authorities have linked him to the radical Armed Islamic
Group blamed for most massacres in Algeria, where some 75,000
people have been killed in an Islamic insurgency, now in its
seventh year.
	   Zaoui was deported along with his family from Switzerland nearly
a year after he slipped into the country to seek political asylum.
He had been based in Belgium, where he was convicted in 1995 of
playing a prominent role in a criminal association.
	   Switzerland had been reluctant to deport him to Algeria, and
waited until it found a third country to accept him, authorities
there said. A handful of other Muslim militants have been in
Burkina Faso for years, deported there by France.
	   Swiss Justice Ministry spokesman Viktor Schlumpf Switzerland
committed itself to paying part of the family's living costs.

 &UR; Rising star on SAfrican music scene dead of gunshot

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Young blacks on Monday mourned
the shooting death of a rising star of kwaito, the rap-derived
music that has become a leading art form to emerge in
post-apartheid South Africa.
	   Oupa Mafokate, known as Makhendlas, apparently shot himself in
the head in despair after wounding an abusive concertgoer Saturday
night at a stadium near Nelspruit, 300 kilometers (185 miles) east
of Johannesburg, police said.
	   The shooting highlighted lax security and episodes of violence
that sometimes accompany kwaito concerts, called ``bashes,'' which
can be marked by scuffling fans and trashed arenas.
	   It also brought attention a genre that has become a symbol of
black empowerment. Kwaito blossomed with the fall of apartheid,
when black-owned record companies and private radio stations began
arriving on the scene.
	   Kwaito is ``the post-apartheid cultural expression of young
black people,'' said Diane Coetzer, a free-lance music writer.
``It's the first time South Africa's youth have something they can
call their own.''
	   According to the musician's manager, Mpho Makhetha, three or
four drunken men slipped through security backstage before the
concert and began harassing the musicians.
	   Mafokate intervened. ``When he tried to talk to them, they just
kept on swearing at him and taunting him. ... Oupa as a last resort
drew his gun, with the hope of firing a warning shot to try to
scare them away,'' Makhetha said in a telephone interview. ``By
accident he shot one of them.''
	   Makhetha called Mafokate's apparent suicide a sudden act of
remorse.
	   ``I guess Oupa thought at the time he had killed the guy. That's
why he did what he did,'' the manager said. ``He was doing so well
career-wise. He was the father of a 4-month old boy.''
	   The Soweto-born Mafokate, 27, was emerging from the shadow of
his older brother Arthur, one of South Africa's top kwaito stars.
	   The younger Mafokate's single Emenwe Phezulu (``Fingers Up'' _ a
sign of joy) was a hit last year, and its celebratory lyrics about
partying made it an anthem at kwaito concerts.
	   His latest album ``Jammer'' sold more than 80,000 copies, a
major success for South Africa, said Sean Watson-Smith, general
manager of CCP Records, Mafokate's label. It was Mafokate's third
album.
	   YFM, a Johannesburg-area station that champions kwaito, received
scores of calls Monday from saddened listeners, and played tributes
to Mafokate. A memorial was scheduled for Thursday in Johannesburg.
	   Kwaito is an African-flavored rap with injections of rhythm and
blues, hip-hop and rave. Most of the lyrics are in Iscamtho, a
street lingo that combines Zulu, Sotho, Tswanah, Afrikaans and
other African languages as well as English. It is said to be named
after a township gang, the Amakwaito, or the Afrikaans word
``kwai,'' or ``cool.''
	   ``Next to gospel, it's the biggest-selling genre money-wise and
in terms of influence in South Africa,'' Coetzer said.
	   The songs dwell on life in the townships but have little of the
violent and sexist lyrics found in much American rap.
	   ``It is music that represents the identity of what people are
about now,'' said Randall Abrahams, YFM's station manager.

Lockout talks resume Monday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ With the NBA regular season originally scheduled
to begin Tuesday night, this was supposed to be the last chance for
diehard basketball fans to get a good night's sleep.
	   Instead, hoops junkies are facing a month _ or maybe more _ of
going cold turkey.
	   The only basketball action taking place this week will be in a
boardroom of some law firm or a conference room of some
cookie-cutter hotel as owners and players _ and, of course, their
attorneys _ continue the fight over how to divide dlrs 2 billion.
	   Monday's installment of the 125-day-old lockout features the
dueling Jeffs _ Mishkin for the owners, Kessler for the players _
trying to outfox each other in negotiations that will one day lead
to a settlement and a season.
	   ``We're going to try to look at a variety of the secondary
issues,'' Kessler said Monday morning. ``Hopefully we can plow
through and take care of a lot of it.''
	   Among those issues are player conduct and discipline issues,
salary cap calculations and licensing agreements. The attorneys
planned to meet for four or five hours.
	   Not exactly ``Fan-tastic,'' eh?
	   ``This thing is pretty much in David Stern's hands, and I'm not
unduly optimistic,'' said agent Steve Kaufman, a member of the
union's agents advisory committee said of the commissioner.
	   ``To me, there's two windows to get it done. One is right now.
You get the season started by Dec. 1, satisfy TNT and possibly
enable a full schedule. But if it's not done in next week to 10
days, you're looking at a Christmas or New Year's scenario for
starting the season. And I don't think either side will make a bad
deal just to reach the Dec. 1 goal.''
	   The two sides made more progress last week than they had in the
previous 4 1/2 months, agreeing on a loose framework for a
collective bargaining agreement.
	   The biggest hurdle is an agreement on what percentage of
revenues will be devoted to salaries by the time the new system has
been in place a few years. The owners want to pay 50 percent (a
movement off their previous demand for 48) and the players want to
receive 60 percent (a move from 63 percent).
	   If the sides split the difference, it would give the players 55
percent of revenues. But the players received 57 percent last
season, and there's a feeling among many agents that the union
shouldn't drop to 55 percent because it has already given the
owners numerous concessions.
	   The owners have been asking for a maximum salary equal to 30
percent of the salary cap (about dlrs 9.3 million next season), and
revised that demand last week by setting dlrs 12 million as the
maximum salary for players who have been in the league 10 years or
more and dlrs 8 million for players with six years' or less of
experience.
	   The owners also moved off their demand for the elimination of
the dlrs 1 million exception, which allowed every team, even if
over the cap, to sign an extra player for dlrs 1 million once every
two years.
	   They proposed an exception starting at dlrs 1.5 million and
growing to dlrs 2 million in three years, while the union has stuck
to its demand for an exception available every season for the
amount of the average salary, which was dlrs 2.6 million last
season.
	   Clearly, there has been some compromise already, and more is
expected.
	   The question now is whether the sides will wrap this up quickly
or drag the dispute into a sixth month.
	   ``The owners are right and the players are right,'' Dennis
Rodman told the Chicago Tribune. ``There is no happy medium.
	   ``They should just cancel the whole season and let everybody get
a real job. Then you'll see how they really feel. I bet then
they'll come to an agreement real quick,'' Rodman said.

While Yeltsin rests, critics launch new attacks

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With Boris Yeltsin's foes saying he is practically
incapacitated, the Kremlin insisted Monday that the ailing
president will hold all meetings with foreign leaders planned for
November.
	   Yeltsin was resting at a Black Sea resort to recover from what
his aides call fatigue and high blood pressure, the latest in a
string of maladies that have provoked a new round of attacks and
calls for Yeltsin's resignation by his Communist rivals.
	   ``The president is not controlling anything. He can't go to
work, he has lost touch with the citizens. He really has degraded.
He drinks; he drinks so much that he is unable to fulfill his
duties,'' Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said.
	   ``We insist on an immediate medical checkup of the president,
and I'm sure the doctor's conclusion will be that which is already
known to the whole nation,'' he added.
	   The president's recent illnesses have renewed concerns about his
ability to serve out his term, which runs until the middle of the
year 2000. Yeltsin insists he has no serious health problems.
	   Yeltsin's spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin lashed back at Zyuganov for
``insulting the head of state instead of (having) a civilized
dialogue.''
	   ``The opposition mustn't forget that it owes its very existence
to the democratic reforms carried out by Boris Yeltsin,'' Yakushkin
said.
	   Yeltsin began a two-week stay in southern resort of Sochi on
Friday, but had been working only sporadically in recent weeks
because of his poor health.
	   He had no meetings planned Monday, but was scheduled to hold
talks with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev on Tuesday, Yakushkin
said. Yeltsin will return to Moscow to meet with Japan's Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi on Nov. 12, Yakushkin said.
	   Yeltsin is also scheduled to play host to German
Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro and Queen Beatrix of The Netherlands in November.
	   ``No changes have been made in the schedule of the Russian
president's international contacts,'' Yakushkin was quoted as
saying by ITAR-Tass.
	   He would not say when Yeltsin may fly back to Moscow or whether
the Russian leader would resume vacation between foreign meetings.
	   A nationwide poll cited by the NTV network Sunday showed that
only 3 percent of Russians had confidence in Yeltsin, while 89
percent lacked confidence in the president. The rest were
undecided.
	   No margin of error was given, but the results were in line with
other recent surveys, which also have put Yeltsin's approval rating
in the low single digits. The poll of 1,500 people was conducted by
the independent Public Opinion Foundation.
	   Communists and other hard-liners have used Yeltsin's illness to
intensify calls for his ouster. An impeachment motion is working
its way through parliament, but is given little chance of success.
	   Yeltsin has handed over control over the economy and some other
day-to-day duties to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Yeltsin's Deputy Chief of Staff Oleg Sysuyev insisted Sunday,
however, that Yeltsin's political role will ``only be
strengthening.''
	   Zyuganov, meanwhile, said the Communists planned a
signature-collection drive for Yeltsin's ouster, and pledged to try
to reverse some democratic reforms in Russia.
	   ``Nobody will be able to pursue the old policy. Radical
liberalism has flopped,'' Zyuganov was quoted as saying by the
Interfax news agency.

Judge rules petty crimes shouldn't affect refugee claim
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A family of Polish gypsies who steal for a living
can still make a refugee claim in Canada because the crimes are
petty _ and not serious, extraditable ones _ a federal judge has
ruled.
	   Justice Allan Lutfy has set aside the decision of the
Immigration and Refugee board, which found that Jan Brzezinski, his
wife and two daughters weren't eligible to be refugees because of
their history of theft.
	   For years, the family has stolen small items for everyday use as
well as clothing to re-sell for a profit. Recent loot from Canadian
shops includes pillows, blankets, a dress and a chocolate cake.
	   Both Brzezinski parents, who now live in the Ottawa area, have
criminal convictions for property-related crimes and have stolen in
other countries.
	   In a 1997 ruling, the refugee board found the Brzezinskis'
chronic but petty pilfering was serious enough to exclude the
family from the United Nations Convention definition of a refugee.
	   Lutfy overturned the board's ruling in July, saying that people
can only be excluded from making refugee claims if they have
committed more serious crimes, such as rape or murder. Shoplifting
doesn't qualify, Lutfy said.
	   Mike Bell, the Ottawa lawyer representing the Brzezinski family,
is happy with the decision, which means the family may make a
second refugee claim.
	   Bell believes the family would be persecuted if they returned to
Poland.

Muslim women students protest ban on campus prayers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOHAG, Egypt (AP) _ About 1,000 Muslim women students
demonstrated Monday against a decision by a southern Egyptian
university to ban mass dawn prayers, police said.
	   Officials at Sohag University had ordered a halt to such prayers
in dormitories after Christian students complained that they were
awakened by the loud calls to prayer and knocks on their doors by
students trying to wake up fellow Muslims.
	   A police official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity,
said the protesters, veiled in Islamic fashion, shouted ``Allahu
Akbar,'' or ``God is great.'' They demanded a reversal of the ban,
which they described as ``hypocritical and non-Islamic.''
	   Sohag, some 600 kilometers (400 miles) south of Cairo, has a
large population of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority. It's been
tense in recent weeks after accusations that police tortured
Christians during a murder investigation in a village in Sohag
province. The government denies any torture took place.
	   Police did not allow the protesters to enter streets around the
university Monday for fear they would be joined by the city's
residents.
	   No arrests were made but three students were being investigated
by a university committee on charges they incited the protest, the
police official said.

Social Democrats nominate former state governor to run for
</HEADLINE>
president &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Social Democrats on Monday nominated
the former North Rhine-Westphalia state governor to run for
president in elections scheduled for next May.
	   Johannes Rau lost a bitterly contested race against Roman Herzog
during the last presidential election, and was the party favorite
for the nomination despite calls from female lawmakers in the new
Social Democratic-led government for a woman.
	   Rau gave up the North Rhine-Westphalia post in May after 19
years at the urging of party members, who at the time hinted they'd
promote his candidacy for president in the next elections,
scheduled for May 23, 1999.
	   When he left office, state legislators mindful of Rau's
presidential ambitions gave him a library ladder as a parting gift
for use in ``high-ceilinged rooms, in other places,'' a reference
to the president's residence in Berlin, Schloss Bellevue.
	   The president is elected to a five-year term by a special body
comprising the lower house of parliament and an equal number of
delegates from Germany's 16 states. The election of Herzog's
successor will take place in Berlin's Reichstag building, the
future seat of parliament.
	   Backing by the Social Democrats should ensure Rau's victory,
even if other parties put forward a candidate. He would be the
first Social Democratic president since Gustav Heinemann, elected
in 1969.
	   Rau, the son of a minister with strong religious beliefs,
married Heinemann's granddaughter in 1982. The couple has three
children.

U.N. chief weapons inspector calls Iraq crisis most serious ever

secretary-general on planned meetings with Butler, U.S. deputy
secretary of state, council members; Picks up 3rd graf pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector Monday
called the crisis with Iraq the most serious ever because Baghdad
is directly confronting the U.N. Security Council by banning
monitoring of its weapons sites.
	   ``I think that's what makes this the worst confrontation by Iraq
with the Security Council that we've yet seen,'' Richard Butler
said in an interview on NBC's Today show.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he would meet Monday with
Butler ``to see where we go from here.'' He was also scheduled to
meet U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and hold
consultations with council members.
	   The secretary-general called Iraq's announcement Saturday that
it was cutting off all dealings with U.N. weapons inspectors ``a
total breach of Security Council resolutions,'' and noted the
council's demand that Baghdad resume cooperation immediately.
	   ``I think the council as a whole has spoken very clearly and
they are going to remain engaged,'' Annan said.

Electronics giant to close a third of its factories
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Philips shares closing 9.1 percent higher; ADDS
reaction from analysts. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Intent on scaling back bloated
production facilities, Dutch electronics giant Royal Philips
Electronics NV said Monday it will close about a third of its
factories worldwide.
	   Philips spokesman Ben Geerts said the company had already
announced in March that it would examine its industrial
infrastructure.
	   At that time, ``we had 269 factories and we will have reduced
this to 266 by the end of 1998,'' Geerts said.
	   The company, Europe's largest consumer electronics group,
``built too big a production capacity for requirements,'' Philips
President Cor Boonstra was quoted as saying in Monday's editions of
the Financial Times of London.
	   It was not immediately clear whether employees at the targeted
factories would be laid off or reassigned.
	   The Dutch group wants to cut the number of production sites to
between 160 and 170 from the current 244 by 2002, the newspaper
reported.
	   Geerts said the company didn't have a specific plan on how to
scale back the number, but that it would be done mainly through
streamlining operations and combining some production lines.
	   Monday's news boosted Philips' shares on the Amsterdam stock
exchange, which jumped 9.1 percent to close at 108.40 guilders
(dlrs 58).
	   Analysts said the company was simply continuing a restructuring
process it started two years ago. Jan Coen Balt of Effectenbank
Stroeve in Amsterdam said Philips was focusing more on distribution
and marketing than manufacturing, hoping that by cutting costs it
will be able to react faster to market demand.
	   The cuts come amid a rough season for Philips. The company said
last month that third-quarter income from normal operations fell 38
percent to 449 million guilders (dlrs 241 million). Philips also
plans to end its telecommunications joint venture with U.S.-based
Lucent Technologies.
	   The news followed a profit warning in September that income from
normal operations in 1998 should be unchanged from 1997.
	   Boonstra said Philips is still open to purchases in areas such
as medical products, semiconductors and lighting.
	   ``Now we can take our pick where we acquire and grow,'' he said,
adding that the company wants to expand mainly in the United
States.

Germany, Britain forge new cooperation on center-left politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain and Germany announced plans Monday to try
to bring more of their shared center-left politics into European
relations as they tackle the world economic crisis and look to
Europe's future.
	   After two hours of talks, Prime Minister Tony Blair and new
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced the establishment of
a working group of their trade and industry chiefs, who will meet
regularly to plan ways to practice their so-called ``Third Way,''
or ``Neue Mittel,'' politics more effectively.
	   Schroeder said it was no coincidence that he chose London as the
destination for his first foreign trip since being sworn in last
week: He had followed Blair's electoral strategy of moving his
traditionally left-wing party to the center to win power.
	   ``How can we manage a modern economy whilst not letting social
justice slip off the table? That is the central question we want to
address,'' Schroeder said.
	   He emphasized the personal chemistry between the two leaders,
which he described as ``the spontaneous attitudes we seem to have
in addressing our problems.''
	   However, the two men stressed the meeting in no way indicated a
weakening of the traditional Paris-Bonn axis at the core of Europe.
	   ``This cooperation is certainly not directed against anybody and
it is by no means a cooperation that is meant to jeopardize the
Franco-German relations that are important for Europe,'' Schroeder
said.
	   Blair added that ``there is room for lots of different
relationships within Europe and that's the best way for us to go
without directing our cooperation against anybody at all.''
	   The two leaders also discussed the world financial crisis, with
both saying they had not come to a common position on interest
rates and stressing that neither intends to interfere with the
independence of their respective central banks on the setting of
interest rates.
	   Blair and Schroeder also discussed preparations for the Jan. 1
launch of the single European currency, called the euro.
	   Britain will not join in the first round, but British Chancellor
of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has unveiled plans for a new
initiative designed to make sure Britain would be ready to join if
the government and voters wanted to.
	   ``I see a very strong determination of working very
constructively in Europe'' on the question of the single currency,
Schroeder said.
	   ``What that is exactly going to look like and how it is going to
be assessed in the corresponding historical situation, that's going
to be decided here in Great Britain by a government that knows how
to do so,'' he said.
	   Schroeder was scheduled to speak to the Conference of British
Industry in Birmingham later on Monday before returning to Germany.

Court postpones trial for 16 teenagers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ A bomb scare on Monday forced the
postponement of a trial for 16 fans arrested during violent
incidents that led to the cancellation of a weekend first division
soccer match between PAOK Salonica and Olympiakos Piraeus.
	   It was not known if the hoax about a bomb in this northern port
city's central court was related to the case, but the evacuation
forced a number of trial postponements. Their trial was set for
Tuesday.
	   The 16 were arrested Saturday after angry PAOK supporters
entered the pitch and clashed with police when the referee canceled
a goal by the hosts eight minutes before the end of the game.
Olympiakos was leading 2-1 at the time.
	   Yiannis Papapetrou, who confirmed the goal at the beginning,
canceled it when his assistant, Tassos Vlachos, claimed that Mirko
Taccola netted the ball using his hand.
	   One hour later, Papapetrou called the match off when he was
informed that Nikos Fessopoulos, his second assistant, was hit in
the head and hospitalized with concussion.
	   Three policemen and eight civilians were also injured in the
incidents.
	   A final decision on the fate of the game will be taken by the
Association of Greek Professional Soccer Teams, organizers of the
league.
	   PAOK asked for a repeat of the game on the ground that the
referee should have replaced Fessopoulos with the fourth referee
and continued the game. He also asked that Papapetrou and his two
assistants be banned from first-division league play.
	   Olympiakos ranks third in the 18-team first division soccer
league, while PAOK is eight. Both are now one game behind the
34-round season.

Belarusian opposition newspaper robbed, editor blames government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ The office of Belarus' leading opposition
newspaper was robbed of computers and archives in what its chief
editor said Monday may have been another attempt by the autocratic
government to halt publication.
	   Four computers and a fax machine were stolen over the weekend
from the office of the Naviny newspaper, editor Igor Gremenchuk
said. The computers contained the newspaper's archives, databases,
files, and about 2,000 photographs.
	   ``I don't exclude that it was the work of secret services. Some
details point at that: For example, some valuable and more
`sellable' things _ a monitor and a compact disk player and very
expensive Japanese television set _ were left intact,'' Gremenchuk
told The Associated Press.
	   Naviny, or News, has published since 1990, when Belarus was
still part of the Soviet Union, and has become the main rostrum of
Belarusian opposition to autocratic President Alexander Lukashenko.
It was originally called Svaboda, or Freedom.
	   The government has regularly fined the newspaper, confiscated
its issues, and barred it from being printed in Belarus.
	   With a circulation ranging between 18,000 and 50,000 in recent
months, Naviny is a popular paper in this country of 10 million and
is respected for its analytical coverage.
	   Last year the government banned it for two articles presenting
the views of President Alexander Lukashenko's political opponents.
Two months later, the newspaper resumed publication under the new
name.
	   The Naviny office is located in a private apartment in the
capital Minsk, because no organization has agreed to lease its
space to the newspaper for fear of government persecution.
	   ``Now we are looking for somebody to loan us computers, at least
for some time. There can be no talk of closing the newspaper,''
Gremenchuk said.

 &UR; Britain tells Iraq to back down or face military action &QL;

 &UR; With BC-US-Iraq, BC-Iraq-UN &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain, the staunchest U.S. ally in the Gulf War,
said Monday that Iraq must back down in its latest confrontation
over U.N. weapons inspectors ``or face the consequences.''
	   Prime Minister Tony Blair warned that the West again stood ready
to use force if Saddam Hussein failed to comply with U.N.
resolutions.
	   ``It's clear that Iraq is not in compliance with the agreement
it entered into,'' Blair said at a news conference Monday following
talks with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
	   ``We have absolutely no doubt at all that they must comply and
we are ready to use whatever means are necessary to ensure that
they do,'' the prime minister said.
	   On Saturday, Iraq banned U.N. weapons inspection teams from
working in the country after the U.N. Security Council again
refused to lift economic sanctions. The Security Council demanded
that Iraq reverse the ban.
	   ``We cannot have a situation in which Iraq, in defiance of U.N.
Security Council resolutions, builds up weapons of mass
destruction,'' Blair said. ``We have made it clear that's our
position and remains our position, and we will discuss with friends
and colleagues the best way forward at this time.''
	   Defense Secretary George Robertson, addressing business leaders
in the central England city of Birmingham, said that international
forces assembled in February, when Hussein last openly defied the
United Nations, remained in place.
	   ``The message has got to be the message we had in February: He
must comply. He must obey the will of the international community
and the U.N. or face the consequences,'' Robertson told a meeting
of the Confederation of British Industry.
	   ``If he seems hell-bent on confrontation with the U.N., the
international community will stand up to him in the same way as it
did then,'' the defense secretary said.
	   Twelve British Tornado fighter-bombers deployed in Kuwait near
the Iraqi border during the February crisis remain there, Robertson
noted.
	   ``We are ready. We still have the capability in place and we
remain alert,'' he said.

Social Democrats nominate former state governor to run for

 &UR; Eds: ADDs Rau's age in graf 3 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The Social Democrats on Monday nominated
the former North Rhine-Westphalia state governor to run for
president in elections scheduled for next May.
	   Johannes Rau lost a bitterly contested race against Roman Herzog
during the last presidential election, and was the party favorite
for the nomination despite calls from female lawmakers in the new
Social Democratic-led government for a woman.
	   Rau, 67, gave up the North Rhine-Westphalia post in May after 19
years at the urging of party members, who at the time hinted they'd
promote his candidacy for president in the next elections,
scheduled for May 23, 1999.
	   When he left office, state legislators mindful of Rau's
presidential ambitions gave him a library ladder as a parting gift
for use in ``high-ceilinged rooms, in other places,'' a reference
to the president's residence in Berlin, Schloss Bellevue.
	   The president is elected to a five-year term by a special body
comprising the lower house of parliament and an equal number of
delegates from Germany's 16 states. The election of Herzog's
successor will take place in Berlin's Reichstag building, the
future seat of parliament.
	   Backing by the Social Democrats should ensure Rau's victory,
even if other parties put forward a candidate. He would be the
first Social Democratic president since Gustav Heinemann, elected
in 1969.
	   Rau, the son of a minister with strong religious beliefs,
married Heinemann's granddaughter in 1982. The couple has three
children.

France issues international arrest warrant for Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLAS MARMIE &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French judge on Monday issued an international
arrest warrant for former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet on
charges of ``sequestration followed by torture,'' judicial
officials said.
	   The officials, who requested anonymity, said Paris Judge Roger
Le Loire had issued the request, a necessary step before France can
officially ask for Pinochet's extradition.
	   Last week, a lawyer representing three French families whose
relatives disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973
filed a complaint with a French court, asking for Pinochet's
extradition to face charges of crimes against humanity.
	   French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou has said she would ask
Britain to extradite the former dictator if such a step were deemed
``necessary and possible.''
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested in a central London hospital Oct. 16
after undergoing back surgery.
	   Britain's High Court ruled last week that he was immune from
prosecution as a former head of state. He was granted bail, but
remains under police guard at another hospital in north London.
	   British prosecutors _ acting on behalf of a Spanish magistrate
seeking the former Chilean dictator's extradition on allegations of
murder, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year rule _ have until
the end of the business day Monday to appeal formally.
	   Switzerland has also requested Pinochet's arrest and extradition
on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says some
3,000 people disappeared during Pinochet's rule.

Relaxed Graf, 'feeling good,' starts comeback with doubles loss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf's latest comeback began
Tuesday with the former world No. 1 firing an ace and then losing
in doubles at the dlrs 450,000 Leipzig Open.
	   Graf, plagued by injuries most of the past two years, appeared
relaxed playing for the first time in 56 days following an
operation on her right hand after the U.S. Open.
	   Graf, teaming up alongside inexperienced 16-year-old Mia Buric,
was healthy if rusty as the pair lost to Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
and Natascha Zvereva, 7-5, 6-4.
	   ``Physically I feel good. But since we were playing one of the
world's top doubles team, we approached the match in a pretty
easy-going way,'' said Graf, who dominated the women's game for a
decade before a knee injury threatened her career end in 1996.
	   The 29-year-old Graf steps on the court Tuesday in singles
against Romania's Ruxanda Dragomir, the latest comeback coming
earlier than anticipated. The German had originally planned to
return Nov. 9 at the Philadelphia event.
	   She took a wild card at Leipzig, which she helped found and won
every year between 1990 and 1993, because her latest injury had
healed faster than expected.
	   ``I'm ready to play singles, but I'm not expecting to reach the
final,'' said the German.
	   Graf displayed her usual on-court intensity during the match
against Zvereva and Sanchez-Vicario, both ranked in the world's top
10 in doubles, but at the press conference afterwards described the
match as just ``horsing around.''
	   Graf landed most of her strong serves, although she
double-faulted at match point. But rust showed in her volleys and
returns.
	   Her playing partner, Buric, is ranked 551st in the world in
doubles. She is one of three juniors coached by Graf under a
program sponsored by Porsche.
	   ``Because of my injuries I could play with the girls a lot,''
said Graf, who has said teaching the young players was more
gratifying than she'd expected and something she wants to pursue
after her career ends.
	   Graf boasts 103 career titles but has yet to claim another since
returning from the knee injury last year.
	   But the German showed signs that she still can compete against
the new generation of players like current No. 1 Lindsay Davenport
and Swiss teenager Martina Hingis before the hand injury sidelined
her again.
	   In a warmup tournament leading up to the U.S. Open, Graf beat
Jana Novotna and Lindsay Davenport, then ranked No. 2 and No. 3 in
the world.

Court postpones trial for 16 soccer fans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ A bomb scare on Monday forced the
postponement of a trial for 16 fans arrested during a riot that led
to the cancellation of a weekend first division soccer match
between PAOK Salonica and Olympiakos Piraeus.
	   It was not known if the bomb hoax in this northern port city's
central court was related to the case, but the evacuation forced a
number of trial postponements. The fans' trial was set for Tuesday.
	   The 16 were arrested Saturday after angry PAOK supporters
entered the pitch and clashed with police when the referee canceled
a tying goal by the hosts eight minutes before the end of the game.
Olympiakos was leading 2-1 at the time.
	   Yiannis Papapetrou, who first confirmed the goal, changed his
mind when his assistant, Tassos Vlachos, claimed that Mirko Taccola
netted the ball using his hand.
	   Outraged PAOK fans stormed the field and one hour later,
Papapetrou called the match off when he was informed that Nikos
Fessopoulos, his second assistant, was hit in the head and
hospitalized with a concussion.
	   Three policemen and eight civilians were also injured.
	   A final decision on the fate of the game will be taken by the
Association of Greek Professional Soccer Teams, organizers of the
league.
	   PAOK asked for a repeat of the game on the ground that the
referee should have replaced Fessopoulos with the fourth referee
and continued the game. The team also asked that Papapetrou and his
two assistants be banned from first-division league play.
	   Olympiakos ranks third in the 18-team first division soccer
league, while PAOK is eighth.

Strikes hit national library, Eiffel Tower, transport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Commuters couldn't ride, scholars couldn't read and
tourists stayed roped off from the Eiffel Tower as nagging strikes
disrupted the capital Monday.
	   The Eiffel Tower _ the most visited monument in the City of
Light _ stood empty for a fourth day, with striking workers
refusing to back down on their demand for more personnel.
	   Commuters in the Paris region faced minor inconveniences from
the latest strike by public transport workers. But the strikers
failed in their bid to bring the system to a halt.
	   Two out of three Metro lines were working at rush hour and buses
experienced only minor difficulties, according to France Info
radio.
	   But commuters on some high-speed lines encountered reduced
service, and had to find alternative routes.
	   The strikes were the latest in a series of social protests that
have swept France this fall. Last month thousands of high school
students took to the streets demanding smaller classes and better
facilities.
	   Striking library workers continued to man picket lines Monday at
the new National Library, barring access for the third straight
week to the high-tech facility that opened to researchers less than
a month ago. The library opened to the general public in December
1996.
	   The strike was launched by library workers fed up with computer
glitches that delay the automatic delivery of books and other
research materials.
	   Library spokesman Alain Veinstein said strikers are demanding
better working conditions and for the library to close on Mondays.
	   Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann has refused to consider a
Monday closure, but talks were still underway, he said.
	   A spokesman for the Eiffel Tower refused to predict when the
``grande dame'' of Paris monuments would reopen its steel grills to
visitors.
	   Workers, mainly hosts and hostesses, went on strike Friday,
shutting out some 35,000 visitors over the All Saints Day holiday
weekend, and an expected 8,000 visitors on Monday, a traditionally
slow day, the press office said.
	   That adds up to a more than 2 million-franc (dlrs 365,000) loss,
according to a press office spokeswoman, who refused to identify
herself by name.
	   The transport strike was the latest protest against a growing
security problem on suburban trains, buses and the Metro system.
	   The workers are seeking better security measures and more staff
after a spate of violent attacks on colleagues.
	   The government has deployed CRS elite police on trains and buses
in recent weeks, and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has promised to
revise the penal code to deal more harshly with violence against
transport workers.
	   But the assaults continue. They are often blamed on youths from
working class suburbs hit hard by double-digit unemployment.

Relaxed Graf, 'feeling good,' starts comeback with doubles loss

 &UR; EDS: CORRECTS day in lead to Monday &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LEIPZIG, Germany (AP) _ Steffi Graf's latest comeback began
Monday with the former world No. 1 firing an ace and then losing in
doubles at the dlrs 450,000 Leipzig Open.
	   Graf, plagued by injuries most of the past two years, appeared
relaxed playing for the first time in 56 days following an
operation on her right hand after the U.S. Open.
	   Graf, teaming up alongside inexperienced 16-year-old Mia Buric,
was healthy if rusty as the pair lost to Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario
and Natascha Zvereva, 7-5, 6-4.
	   ``Physically I feel good. But since we were playing one of the
world's top doubles team, we approached the match in a pretty
easy-going way,'' said Graf, who dominated the women's game for a
decade before a knee injury threatened her career end in 1996.
	   The 29-year-old Graf steps on the court Tuesday in singles
against Romania's Ruxanda Dragomir, the latest comeback coming
earlier than anticipated. The German had originally planned to
return Nov. 9 at the Philadelphia event.
	   She took a wild card at Leipzig, which she helped found and won
every year between 1990 and 1993, because her latest injury had
healed faster than expected.
	   ``I'm ready to play singles, but I'm not expecting to reach the
final,'' said the German.
	   Graf displayed her usual on-court intensity during the match
against Zvereva and Sanchez-Vicario, both ranked in the world's top
10 in doubles, but at the press conference afterwards described the
match as just ``horsing around.''
	   Graf landed most of her strong serves, although she
double-faulted at match point. But rust showed in her volleys and
returns.
	   Her playing partner, Buric, is ranked 551st in the world in
doubles. She is one of three juniors coached by Graf under a
program sponsored by Porsche.
	   ``Because of my injuries I could play with the girls a lot,''
said Graf, who has said teaching the young players was more
gratifying than she'd expected and something she wants to pursue
after her career ends.
	   Graf boasts 103 career titles but has yet to claim another since
returning from the knee injury last year.
	   But the German showed signs that she still can compete against
the new generation of players like current No. 1 Lindsay Davenport
and Swiss teenager Martina Hingis before the hand injury sidelined
her again.
	   In a warmup tournament leading up to the U.S. Open, Graf beat
Jana Novotna and Davenport, then ranked No. 2 and No. 3 in the
world.

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ The fashion model fiancee of Brazilian
soccer star Ronaldo fulfilled a teenage dream in this northern
Portuguese city as she shared the catwalk with Canadian super model
Linda Evangelista.
	   ``I've admired Linda, Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford ever
since I started modeling at 14. I never thought I'd be in a fashion
show with one of them,'' Susana Werner told reporters late Sunday,
the Portuguese daily Diario de Noticias reported.

having a superstar boyfriend had helped her career.
	   ``My career turned international after I started dating
Ronaldo,'' the paper quoted her as saying.
	   Werner and Evangelista were in Oporto, Portugal's second largest
city, to add a little glitz to the country's top fashion show,
known as ``Portugal Fashion.''

Yeltsin allows sale of 5 percent stake in Gazprom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Gazprom prices rising 30 percent in 10th graf,
Zyuganov quotes and background on Yeltsin's illness in new grafs
11-12. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree Monday
permitting the cash-strapped Russian government to auction off up
to 5 percent of one of its most valuable assets _ the natural gas
monopoly Gazprom, the world's largest gas company.
	   Yeltsin, who was recovering from his latest illness at the Black
Sea resort of Sochi, signed the order approving the auction and
allowing foreign investors to take part. No date was set.
	   However, the Interfax news agency later quoted unidentified
officials as saying that the government may decide not to sell a
stake in Gazprom this year because its stock price has fallen
sharply. If the auction goes ahead, no more than 3 percent of the
company will be sold, it added.
	   The government has repeatedly postponed the sale because it was
hoping to get a better price. Russia's financial troubles have
scared away foreign investors and driven down share prices.
	   But with the International Monetary Fund reluctant to give
Russia more loans, the government has little choice but to sell
more shares to pay off its huge debts.
	   The government currently holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares and
said it may gradually reduce its holdings to 25 percent. Private
investors in Russia and abroad hold the remaining shares.
	   Foreign ownership of Gazprom stock was previously limited to 9
percent, but Monday's decree raises that limit to 14 percent.
	   In August, the Russian government set the starting price for a 5
percent stake in Gazprom at dlrs 1.65 billion _ more than double
the current international market price.
	   Yeltsin's decree did not say whether the government would
reassess the price, but unidentified officials speaking to Interfax
said the starting price would be ``far below'' dlrs 1 billion.
	   The announcement of the decree sent Gazprom prices up 30 percent
at the Moscow Stock Exchange, from 1.52 rubles per share to 1.9,
ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Signing the decree was Yeltsin's only work-related activity
Monday, his spokesman said. The president is on doctors' orders to
rest from fatigue and high blood pressure, the latest in a string
of ailments that have provoked increasing calls for his
resignation.
	   ``The president is not controlling anything. He can't go to
work, he has lost touch with the citizens. He really has degraded.
He drinks; he drinks so much that he is unable to fulfill his
duties,'' Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said Monday.
	   The government has already canceled plans to sell stakes in
several state-run oil companies.
	   If Russia cannot raise enough cash through taxes, loans or
privatization sales, it may have to print more money to pay off
overdue wages and pensions. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
other government officials have said they will keep money-printing
to a minimum to avoid high inflation.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov said Monday that the
IMF has approved the government's plan to print up to 12 billion
rubles (dlrs 760,000 at the current rate) this year, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported. Russia's top IMF representative, Martin
Gilman, was not available for comment Monday.
	   Russia's Central Bank has also requested a loan from the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development to restructure the
country's banking system, the EBRD Moscow representative, Neil
Parison, said Monday.
	   The collapse of the ruble and the government's default on its
treasury debt has rattled Russia's banking system.

Italian scientists probe sarcophagus of Holy Roman emperor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PALERMO, Sicily (AP) _ Scientists poked into the tomb of one of
the Holy Roman emperors Monday, hoping to learn how well the
mummified medieval remains are holding up.
	   Frederick II became king of Sicily in 1198 at the age of 4 and
king of Germany at 18. He was crowned emperor in 1220 and ruled
until his death on Dec. 13, 1250 at the age of 55. He is buried in
a marble sarcophagus in the cathedral in Palermo.
	   He led several crusades, capturing Bethlehem, Jerusalem and
Nazareth and battled for years with the popes over papal authority
over his empire. His court in Palermo, then a great center of art
and learning, was famed throughout Europe.
	   On Monday, scientists from the University of Palermo used
sterile equipment to lift the top of his marble sarcophagus in the
cathedral in Palermo, inserting tiny video cameras and other
equipment.
	   They plan to spend the next month and a half taking tissue, bone
and cloth samples and doing other research on the contents of the
tomb. Alfredo Salerno, a pathologist on the team, said the
researchers also hope to get a DNA sample.
	   The researchers hope to learn more about the technique used to
mummify Frederick and gain some clues on how to better preserve
ancient remains.
	   The project angered one of the emperor's direct descendants,
Princess Yasmin Aprilis di Lanslebourg Hohenstaufen Hohenzollern.
	   She told the ANSA news agency in Milan that no one asked the
family foundation for permission to open the sarcophagus. The
foundation issued a statement objecting to turning the emperor's
resting place into a ``laboratory.''
	   This is not the first time Frederick has been disturbed in
death.
	   The sarcophagus was left open for about a month in 1781 when the
cathedral underwent restoration. And in 1994, scientists used an
endoscope, a tiny medical instrument, to peer into the tomb.
	   Historical accounts of the 1781 opening say Frederick's body
appeared to have been mummified and he was laid to rest holding a
globe representing his empire.

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ A Croatian woman accused of torturing
inmates at a concentration camp during World War II was headed to
Zagreb Monday after being extradited from Argentina.
	   Nada Sakic, 76, landed at Frankfurt airport Monday morning after
an overnight flight from Buenos Aires, the German border police
said.
	   She was to flying to Zagreb on a Croatian Airlines flight
scheduled to leave at 6 p.m (1700 GMT), a border police spokesman
said.
	   The airport's on-duty traffic supervisor confirmed the plane was
headed for the runway and takeoff at 6:05 p.m. (1805 GMT).
	   Mrs. Sakic is suspected of having run a women's block at the
Jasenovac concentration camp complex from 1942-45.
	   Thousands of Serbs, Jews and Gypsies were killed at Jasenovac,
the most notorious of more than 20 concentration camps run by
Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet state.
	   Her husband, Dinko Sakic, commanded the Jasenovac complex. He
was extradited to Croatia on June 18 and is awaiting trial in
Zagreb.
	   Mrs. Sakic was arrested in July in the city of Dolores, some 200
kilometers (125 miles) south of Buenos Aires, at the request of
Yugoslav officials, who have charged her with genocide.
	   Croatia then also asked for her extradition, apparently to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia where she
would face a tougher trial. The majority of victims at the camp
were Serbs.
	   In court papers, Croatian authorities said Mrs. Sakic was
suspected of ``violating the principles of international laws by
carrying out torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as
terror, intimidation and collective punishment of civilians'' from
1942-1945.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
top officials in Belgrade on Monday, trying to jump-start the
stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on a
political settlement for Kosovo.
	   Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch after
arriving from the Macedonian capital Skopje. He plans to continue
his shuttle diplomacy in Kosovo's capital Pristina on Tuesday.
	   The U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, Hill is leading international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed this year in authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   ``We continue to work with both sides, going back and forth,''
said Philip Reeker, Hill's spokesman, when asked about the status
of talks.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule. But most ethnic Albanians still prefer independence for
Kosovo _ a southern province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Reeker said the West had never looked at Monday as a deadline.
	   ``This (promise) was to show their compliance and that they are
actively pursuing negotiations,'' he said.
	   He said direct talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians are not
merited until the two sides get closer to a settlement.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind Monday brought the first winter weather for refugees
struggling to return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that harassment by Serb
police prevented them from moving back to their villages in the
region.
	   Ahmet Morina, 25, drove 13 family members huddled under plastic
sheeting on a tractor-pulled cart to a relative's house because
police fired shots at them and took their 30 cattle, killing three,
the day before at Quka Goareve village.
	   In nearby Bubavec, relatives of Murat Kryezim, 53, told how they
finally were able to return to the family home on Saturday to
collect his bones, which had been lying outside his house since a
shell killed him during a Serb attack on July 28.
	   ``We tried a few times, but police would shoot and keep us
away,'' said Kryezim's niece, Sadbere, next to a canvas bag
containing his remains.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, claimed that the Serb military on Monday
shelled the village of Jablanica, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southwest of Pristina, for the third straight day.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to put as many as 2,000 international
monitors on the ground in Kosovo to verify the status of
Milosevic's promises continued proceeding slowly.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons
and 70 Americans in Kosovo later this week will increase the
force's size to more than 200, OSCE officials said.
	   Tony Lloyd, Britain's minister of state, met with top OSCE
officials in Vienna, Austria, to discuss the state of the Kosovo
mission and see if anything can be done to speed up deployment. He
said afterward that the monitors' safety is the top priority.
	   In Pristina, a statement from the Kosovo Liberation Army said
the KLA had met over the weekend with international diplomats who
eventually will become part of the verification mission.
	   ``Both teams agreed that there can be no movement forward
without KLA's participation in the peace-establishing process and
serious negotiations,'' the rebels said in a statement sent to
ethnic Albanian media.

 &UR; South African troops begin withdrawing from Lesotho &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with commanders testifying before
parliamentary committee, Lesotho prime minister's comments &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South African troops weren't
sufficiently prepared when they entered Lesotho for a military
intervention last month, their commanders told a committee in
parliament Monday.
	   Meanwhile, a convoy carrying 800 South African soldiers rumbled
out of the neighboring kingdom on Monday, reducing troop strength
of the intervention force by almost one-quarter.
	   The withdrawal came after South Africa's armed forces chief,
Gen. Siphiwe Nyanda, announced the situation in Lesotho had
stabilized.
	   South African troops crossed into the mountainous kingdom on
Sept. 22 to quell an army mutiny and unrest linked to the May
election, which the ruling party won by a landslide but which
opposition parites claimed were rigged.
	   Botswanan soldiers joined the intervention, waged on behalf of
the Southern African Development Community, a day later. Dozens of
people died in what commanders had thought would be a peaceful
intervention.
	   Deputy Defense Minister Ronnie Kasrils said the intervention had
prevented a civil war in Lesotho.
	   But Nyanda said the SADC must establish security and military
guidelines for the carrying out of such operations in the future.
	   A lack of time for proper planning and practice drills led to
the operation's ``weakness,'' South Africa's joint operations
chief, Lt. Gen. Deon Ferreira, told parliament's foreign affairs
and defense committees.
	   Commanders on the ground had complained that they didn't have
the proper weapons or enough troops at the start of the mission.
	   Instead of a peacekeeping operation, the intervention turned
into a mini-war because the South Africans hadn't announced to
Lesotho's people they were coming. Lesotho troops _ both mutineers
and loyalists _ thought they were being invaded and fought the
South Africans.
	   During the combat outside the capital, Maseru, mobs went on a
looting and arson spree that destroyed most of its business
district.
	   The intervention has cost South Africa's army more than 24
million rands (dlrs 4.2 million) and has depleted its already
strained budget, the commanders said.
	   Monday's withdrawal reduced the number of South African and
Botswanan soldiers in Lesotho from 3,500 to 2,700. No timetable was
set for the withdrawal of the rest of the forces.
	   Nyanda said the intervention force troops needed to know what to
do with Lesotho Defense Force weapons currrently under their
control and what strategy to follow with regard to disarmament of
the country's civilian population.
	   Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili told the National
Assembly in Maseru that he requested the military intervention
because Lesotho's armed forces had failed to maintain law and
order.
	   Opposition parties _ which received 39 percent of the vote in
the May election but only one of 80 seats in parliament _ have
reportedly agreed to a proposed interim committee which will
prepare for new elections.The committee is also tasked with
proposing a more democratic and representative electoral system.

Agassi among early entries for Australian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Andre Agassi is among the early entries for the
Australian Open in January, the International Tennis Federation
said Monday.
	   Agassi, winner of the 1995 Australian Open, has won five
tournaments this year. Over the past 12 months, he has moved from
No. 141 to No. 5 in the ATP rankings.
	   A year ago, Agassi was granted a wild card to play in the 1998
Australian Open, although he eventually received direct entry into
the draw.
	   ``To think a year ago Andre originally needed a wild card and is
now a serious contender is a transformation to say the least,''
tournament director Paul McNamee said in the latest ITF news
bulletin. ``That he could even be the tournament's top seed in 1999
is extraodinary.''
	   Other early entries are former champions Mary Pierce (1995), Jim
Courier (1992/93), Goran Ivanisevic, Mary Joe Fernandez and Iva
Majoli.

	   The confirmed death toll early Monday was 1,005. But hundreds,
maybe thousands of villagers were buried in the mudslides when a
crater lake collapsed in Nicaragua.
	   The international Red Cross said Monday it will triple its
appeal for assistance to those hit by Mitch, and it is now seeking
10 million Swiss francs (dlrs 7.4 million).
	   ``It is almost impossible to get an overview of damage in this
huge region, but help can't wait,'' said Santiago Gil, head of the
Americas Department of the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies.
	   Decomposing bodies protruded everywhere from the mud, which let
loose when an overflowing volcano crater caused a hillside to
collapse and cover four villages.
	   Soldiers reached the area on Sunday, two days after the
catastrophe. They found 360 bodies, burying most where they lay
because the rotting corpses posed a health threat, army spokesman
Capt. Milton Sandoval said.
	   A journalist who flew to the area on a military helicopter said
a body _ sometimes just an arm sticking up out of the mud _ could
be seen every 10 yards (meters) in an area stretching 10 miles (16
kilometers) by 4 miles (7 kilometers). The stench of rotting flesh
was almost unbearable.
	   One resident, Francisco Manuel Pineda, sat on a tree trunk above
what had been his village of El Porvenir _ 50 miles (80 kilometers)
northwest of the capital, Managua _ and recounted what other
survivors had told him:
	   ``It was raining torrentially. They heard something like a fleet
of helicopters, and within minutes an avalanche of mud, tree trucks
and rocks wiped out everything,'' he said through tears.
	   Pineda had left his village Friday morning to buy medicine. He
hitched a ride with the military Sunday to see what was left of his
world.
	   There wasn't much.
	   He found no sign of his house, nor of his wife, his father, his
mother, his brothers, his sisters or his sons. All were believed
buried in the mud.
	   ``We saw corpses everywhere. Hands, legs and the entire bodies
of two girls who were decomposing in the mud,'' he said. ``There
were more than 60 corpses in plain view.''
	   It was unclear how many residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa may have
fled in time to avoid the mudslide.
	   Dr. Marcos Espinosa said in a telephone interview that 126
survivors from the four villages had been treated at a hospital in
nearby Chinandega for ``fractures and serious wounds'' that had
become infected after the victims spent nearly two days in the mud.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman declared three days of national
mourning in what he said was the country's worst natural disaster
since an earthquake killed 5,000 people in 1972.
	   Turmoil caused by the storm took additional lives Sunday, when
the mayor of the Honduran capital and three others died in a
helicopter crash while out surveying flood damage in that country.
Tegucigalpa Mayor Cesar Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely
presidential candidate in 2001 elections.
	   And a C-47 cargo plane crashed Sunday in western Guatemala,
killing 12 people aboard and injuring six. The accident may have
been caused by bad weather associated with Mitch, airport officials
in Guatemala City said. The plane apparently was operated by a
Protestant missionary group with ties to the United States, but the
victims' nationalities were not known.
	   In all, Nicaragua reported 585 confirmed dead; Honduras, 246. El
Salvador said 140 people died and Guatemala reported 33. Mexico
reported one death from the hurricane.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 crew members aboard that hasn't been heard
from since Tuesday.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, army rescue helicopters evacuated 52 famished
and ailing men, women and children from San Francisco Libre, a
Nicaraguan town on the northern banks of Managua Lake, 25 miles (40
kilometers) north of the capital. In that community alone, 1,600
families were left homeless.
	   One survivor, Candido Mejia, 58, was so weak he could barely
give his name after he and his two children were airlifted to
safety.
	   Townspeople said they had to climb trees and onto roofs last
week when the lake flooded the farming community. No deaths were
reported, but many residents had not eaten for several days.
	   Rescue workers left behind rice, corn, beans and other
provisions before taking the sick to get medical care.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near an astonishing 180 mph
(289 kph), had dropped to 30 mph (48 kph), and the storm _ now
classified as a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on
Mexico's southern Pacific coast. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph
(13kph) and was dissipating.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French judge on Monday issued an international
arrest warrant for former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet on
charges of ``sequestration followed by torture,'' judicial
officials said.
	   The officials, who requested anonymity, said Paris Judge Roger
Le Loire had issued the request, a necessary step before France can
officially ask for Pinochet's extradition.
	   Last week, a lawyer representing three French families whose
relatives disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973
filed a complaint with a French court, asking for Pinochet's
extradition to face charges of crimes against humanity.
	   French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou has said she would ask
Britain to extradite the former dictator if such a step were deemed
``necessary and possible.''
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested in a central London hospital Oct. 16
after undergoing back surgery.
	   England's High Court ruled last week that he was immune from
prosecution as a former head of state. He was granted bail, but
remains under police guard at another hospital in north London.

Iraqi parliament endorses halt in work with weapons inspectors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES with Iraq allowing inspectors to maintain
equipment, IAEA inspections continuing, British comments, Iraqi
quotes, CHANGES byline
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's Parliament on Monday unanimously
endorsed a government decision to halt the work of U.N. arms
inspectors and one top official branded the monitors as a ``threat
to Iraqi security.''
	   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Iraq that the West
was ready to use force if Iraq failed to cooperate with the
inspectors.
	   ``We have absolutely no doubt at all that they must comply and
we are ready to use whatever means are necessary to ensure that
they do,'' said Blair, whose country is a strong advocate in the
U.N. Security Council for keeping sanctions on Iraq.
	   In Baghdad, the 250-member National Assembly, which is dominated
by President Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, gave its expected
approval Monday to the government decision.
	   The inspectors are ``a threat to Iraqi security,'' said Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz.
	   ``Although Iraq has complied with all its commitments, sanctions
are still imposed and the Special Commission ... is spying on
Iraq,'' he added.
	   Aziz vowed that Iraq would not reverse its stand until the U.N.
Security Council ensured that a promised review of the commission's
work would lead to a lifting of trade sanctions against the
country.
	   Iraq did, however, allow one team of U.N. technicians to repair
the power supply at a monitoring camera at a possible arms site.
	   Iraq said Saturday that it would bar monitors from inspections
but would allow cameras and chemical sensors at possible arms sites
to continue operating.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said Iraqi officials escorted
technicians to the site to carry out the repair work, but added
that it did not constitute real monitoring of weapons sites.
	   Monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who were
not included in Iraq's latest ban, also continued their work on
Monday.
	   Security Council diplomats have said they will not consider
lifting the sanctions until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of banned weapons. The inspectors have repeatedly accused Iraq
of concealing weapons parts and related documents.
	   Iraq has accused the monitors of bias and is demanding that
commission chairman Richard Butler is fired.
	   In Washington, President Bill Clinton summoned his top national
security aides to the White House to discuss possible responses to
Iraq's defiance.
	   National Security Council spokesman David Leavy said Sunday that
``all options remain on the table.''
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The embargo has devastated the country's economy.
	   At the United Nations, Butler called the crisis with Iraq the
most serious ever because Baghdad is confronting the council by
banning the monitoring.
	   ``I think that's what makes this the worst confrontation by Iraq
with the Security Council that we've yet seen,'' Butler said in an
interview on NBC's Today show.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he would meet Monday with
Butler ``to see where we go from here.'' He was also scheduled to
meet U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.

Four die, two missing after trawler sinks

	   CORK, Ireland (AP) _ A Spanish trawler sank off the southern
coast of Ireland on Monday, killing four crewmen and leaving two
missing, authorities said.
	   The other six crewmen were rescued after the 120-foot
(36.5-meter) trawler, the British-registered Pesca Lanza, capsized
in bad weather 80 miles (130 kms) off the coast of County Cork at
midday.
	   The four bodies were recovered in a rescue operation involving
British, Irish and French vessels and aircraft that was hampered by
almost storm-force gales.
	   The surviving members were picked up by a second Spanish vessel,
the Argorita. The Pesca Lanza had been fishing in the area with two
other boats.
	   Monday's accident came only two days after two fishermen were
lost when their trawler sank off the coast of County Donegal. Their
36-foot (11-meter) vessel went down while on a crab-fishing trip.

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ At least 7,000 people may have died in
Central America in floods and mudslides unleashed by Hurricane
Mitch, officials in Nicaragua and Honduras said Monday.
	   Dimas Alonzo, chief of operations for Honduras' National
Emergency Committee, estimated at least 5,000 people died in his
country. ``We will never know how many people died,'' he said on
local radio.
	   In northern Nicaragua, between 1,000 and 1,500 people were
buried in a 32-square-mile (83-square-kilometer) area below the
slopes of the Casita volcano, Vice President Enrique Bolanos said
Sunday night.
	   At least 600 more people were killed elsewhere in Nicaragua,
Bolanos said.
	   Earlier Monday, the International Red Cross said it was tripling
the amount of assistance it is seeking for those hit by Mitch, to
dlrs 7.4 million.
	   ``It is almost impossible to get an overview of damage in this
huge region, but help can't wait,'' said Santiago Gil, head of the
Americas Department of the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies.
	   Decomposing bodies protruded everywhere from mud let loose when
an overflowing volcano crater caused a hillside to collapse and
cover four villages in northern Nicaragua.
	   Soldiers reached the area Sunday, two days after the
catastrophe. They found 360 bodies, burying most where they lay
because the rotting corpses posed a health threat, army spokesman
Capt. Milton Sandoval said.
	   A journalist who flew to the area on a military helicopter said
a body _ sometimes just an arm sticking up out of the mud _ could
be seen over a wide area. The stench of rotting flesh was almost
unbearable.
	   One resident, Francisco Manuel Pineda, sat on a tree trunk above
what had been his village of El Porvenir _ 50 miles (80 kilometers)
northwest of the capital, Managua _ and recounted what other
survivors had told him:
	   ``It was raining torrentially. They heard something like a fleet
of helicopters, and within minutes an avalanche of mud, tree trunks
and rocks wiped out everything,'' he said through tears.
	   Pineda had left his village Friday morning to buy medicine. He
hitched a ride with the military Sunday to see what was left of his
world.
	   There wasn't much.
	   He found no sign of his house, his wife, his father, his mother,
his brothers, his sisters or his sons. All were believed buried in
the mud.
	   ``We saw corpses everywhere. Hands, legs and the entire bodies
of two girls who were decomposing in the mud,'' he said. ``There
were more than 60 corpses in plain view.''
	   It was unclear how many residents of the villages of El
Porvenir, Versalles, Rolando Rodriguez and Santa Narcisa may have
fled in time to avoid the mudslide.
	   Dr. Marcos Espinosa said in a telephone interview that 126
survivors from the four villages had been treated at a hospital in
nearby Chinandega for ``fractures and serious wounds'' that had
become infected after the victims spent nearly two days in the mud.
	   President Arnoldo Aleman declared three days of national
mourning in what he said was the country's worst natural disaster
since an earthquake killed 5,000 people in 1972.
	   Turmoil caused by the storm took additional lives Sunday, when
the mayor of the Honduran capital and three others died in a
helicopter crash while out surveying flood damage in that country.
Tegucigalpa Mayor Cesar Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely
presidential candidate in 2001 elections.
	   And a C-47 cargo plane crashed Sunday in western Guatemala,
killing 12 people aboard and injuring six. The accident may have
been caused by bad weather associated with Mitch, airport officials
in Guatemala City said. The plane apparently was operated by a
Protestant missionary group with ties to the United States, but the
victims' nationalities were not known.
	   In all, Nicaragua reported 585 confirmed dead; Honduras, 246. El
Salvador said 140 people died and Guatemala reported 33. Mexico
reported one death from the hurricane.
	   In the Caribbean, the U.S. Coast Guard widened a search for a
tourist schooner with 31 crew members aboard that hasn't been heard
from since Tuesday.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, army rescue helicopters evacuated 52 famished
and ailing men, women and children from San Francisco Libre, a
Nicaraguan town on the northern banks of Managua Lake, 25 miles (40
kilometers) north of the capital. In that community alone, 1,600
families were left homeless.
	   One survivor, Candido Mejia, 58, was so weak he could barely
give his name after he and his two children were airlifted to
safety.
	   Townspeople said they had to climb trees and onto roofs last
week when the lake flooded the farming community. No deaths were
reported, but many residents had not eaten for several days.
	   Rescue workers left behind rice, corn, beans and other
provisions before taking the sick to get medical care.
	   By late Sunday, Mitch's winds, once near an astonishing 180 mph
(289 kph), had dropped to 30 mph (48 kph), and the storm _ now
classified as a tropical depression _ was near Tapachula, on
Mexico's southern Pacific coast. Mitch was moving west at 8 mph (13
kph) and was dissipating.

Scramble for salt continues, 90 traders arrested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ For weeks, an onion shortage caused
tears across India. Now traders are rubbing salt in the wound.
	   Police Monday arrested 90 traders for hoarding salt and selling
it at jacked-up prices. The government said raids on shops and
factories would continue.
	   But a huge scramble for salt was on across the country as
panicky consumers bought enough salt to last months, heeding rumors
that it would disappear from the markets the same way onions have
in recent weeks.
	   The traders were arrested under the Essential Commodities Act,
which forbids hoarding of listed goods. If convicted, they face a
prison term of six months.
	   ``I bought 10 kilograms (22.05 pounds). Now there should not be
any problem,'' said Balwinder Shukla, an executive at a management
school, who rushed to the local supermarket in the New Delhi suburb
of Noida. Shukla's family usually consumes a kilogram (2.2 pounds)
per month.
	   A shortage of onions has been blamed on poor crops and hoarding
by unscrupulous wholesalers. The shortage has increased the price
of onions from eight rupees (20 cents) per kilogram to as high as
100 rupees (dlrs 2.38) a kilogram in some towns.
	   Panic buying of salt has forced up prices from 2.50 rupees (six
U.S. cents) per kilogram to as high as 50 rupees (dlrs 1.20) a
kilogram.
	   Thousands of angry consumers stormed warehouses and shops across
northern India over the weekend in search of hoarded onions, salt
and potatoes.
	   The government assured citizens Monday that there was enough
salt available for six to eight months.
	   ``We will ensure regular supply of salt through the length and
breadth of the country at normal prices. The panic has been
triggered by vested interests,'' Industry Secretary T.R. Prasad was
quoted by Press Trust of India news agency as saying.
	   More than 11 million metric tons of salt is produced each year
in India, one of the largest sources of salt in the world,
according to industry estimates. Of this, about 3 million metric
tons is exported to Africa, parts of Europe and some countries in
Asia.
	   The ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party accused
opposition parties for the crisis, saying rumormongers from their
ranks were out to damage the BJP's prospects in state assembly
elections in four states later this month.
	   Salt traders said there was a shortage, but not a crisis.
	   ``We are not hoarding any salt, but the excessive rain during
the monsoons and the cyclone earlier this year has caused huge
damage to stocks,'' said H.B.S. Malhotra, who manufactures salt
plants in the western state of Gujarat. Stocks should improve by
January, he said.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Charging that Britain could become a haven for
dictators, prominent Chilean opponents of Gen. Augusto Pinochet
arrived Monday to bolster an appeal by British prosecutors against
a court decision calling the general's arrest illegal.
	   ``We are fighting for justice,'' said Isabel Allende, daughter
of the late Salvador Allende, the leftist president toppled by
Pinochet in a 1973 coup.
	   Ms. Allende, a congresswoman, arrived at London's Heathrow
Airport with a delegation of lawmakers and human rights activists,
some of whom want to testify at the appeal.
	   British prosecutors _ acting on behalf of a Spanish magistrate
seeking the former Chilean dictator's extradition on allegations of
murder, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year rule _ had until
the end of the business day Monday to appeal formally appeal.
	   The High Court ruled last week that Pinochet is immune from
prosecution as a former head of state.
	   Hearings before five judges in the House of Lords, Britain's
highest court, tentatively were scheduled for Wednesday and
Thursday.
	   Pinochet, 82, was arrested in a central London hospital Oct. 16
after undergoing back surgery. He was granted bail Friday, but
remains under police guard at another hospital, Grovelands Priory,
in north London.
	   Chile's democratically elected government has appealed to
Britain to release Pinochet on humanitarian grounds and says his
arrest threatens to split the country's new democracy, built up
after he stepped down in 1990.
	   A medically equipped Chilean air force jet has been waiting at
the Royal Air Force base Brize Norton outside London to take
Pinochet home.
	   If the appeal to the House of Lords fails, the former dictator
likely would be free to leave England, despite moves by courts in
several other European countries to have extradited at the
instigation of Chilean exiles.
	   On Monday, a French judge issued an international arrest warrant
for Pinochet on charges of ``sequestration followed by torture,''
judicial officials said.
	   The officials, who requested anonymity, said Paris Judge Roger
Le Loire had issued the request, a necessary step before France can
officially ask for Pinochet's extradition.
	   Last week, a lawyer representing three French families whose
relatives disappeared in Chile after Pinochet took power in 1973
filed a complaint with a French court, asking for Pinochet's
extradition to face charges of crimes against humanity.
	   French Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou has said she would ask
Britain to extradite the former dictator if such a step were deemed
``necessary and possible.''
	   Also Monday, the Vatican issued a statement saying a top Chilean
official had briefed the Vatican's secretary of state about
Pinochet's case this weekend, but was not seeking papal mediation.
	   A report by Chile's democratically elected government says some
3,000 people disappeared during Pinochet's rule.

	   CHINANDEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ At least 7,000 people may have died
in Central America in floods and mudslides unleashed by Hurricane
Mitch, officials in Nicaragua and Honduras said Monday.
	   Dimas Alonzo, chief of operations for Honduras' National
Emergency Committee, estimated at least 5,000 people died in his
country. ``We will never know how many people died,'' he said on
local radio.
	   In northern Nicaragua, between 1,000 and 1,500 people were
buried in a 32-square-mile (83-square-kilometer) area below the
slopes of the Casitas volcano, Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique
Bolanos said Sunday night.
	   At least 600 more people were killed elsewhere in Nicaragua,
Bolanos said.
	   Earlier Monday, the International Red Cross said it was tripling
the amount of assistance it is seeking for those hit by Mitch, to
dlrs 7.4 million.
	   ``It is almost impossible to get an overview of damage in this
huge region, but help can't wait,'' said Santiago Gil, head of the
Americas Department of the International Federation of Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies.
	   A flyover of northern Nicaragua on Monday showed the rivers
crisscrossing the region had swollen to up to 10 times their normal
size, sweeping muds from the mountains down to the sea.
	   Decomposing bodies protruded everywhere from mud let loose when
an overflowing volcano crater caused a hillside to collapse and
cover four villages.

Kuwait thrashes Qatar 6-2 in Gulf soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Jassim al-Huwaidy scored twice in the
first half and three times in the second half to lead defending
champion Kuwait to a 6-2 victory over Qatar Monday in the
six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   Monday's victory put Kuwait, an eight-time winner of the Gulf
Cup, back into the tournament after an earlier 2-1 loss to Saudi
Arabia.
	   Al-Huwaidy scored Kuwait's first goal eight minutes after the
kickoff, with a powerful kick to the right corner. In the 38th
minute he scored with a similar shot to left side that sent Qatari
goalkeeper Ahmed Khalil diving in vain.
	   Kuwait's third goal came in the 51th minute from forward Bashaar
Abdullah.
	   Al-Huwaidy's next goal came in the 57th minute with a
well-placed header. He scored again in the 74th minute.
	   Al-Huwaidy's scored his final goal in injury time with a penalty
shot awarded after Khalil tripped him in the penalty area.
	   Despite scoring two goals, Qatar responded well only in the
first half.
	   Qatar scored a 20th minute equalizer from midfielder Abdul Aziz
Hassan and later scored again in a the 80th minute with a curved
shot by Mustafa Mubarak who took a free kick outside the penalty
area.
	   Saudi Arabia plays Bahrain later Monday.

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The latest fad in Bosnia _
hand-held laser toys _ are drawing words of warning after a laser
aimed at a U.S. helicopter injured two crew members.
	   ``We don't know what type of laser was used in this incident.
Because of strength, we are assuming it was not a small laser, but
we don't exclude there could be someone just playing with a toy,''
NATO spokesman Lt. Col. Stephen Kerrick said Monday.
	   The two UH-60 helicopter crew members sustained minor corneal
burns last week near the town of Zenica.
	   The injured men were identified as the pilot, Chief Warrant
Officer Steven McCoy, 37, of Downey, California, and crew member
Sgt. Juan Villareal, 37, of San Antonio, Texas. Both are from the
1st Cavalry Division in Texas.
	   It was the first incident involving lasers in which medical
treatment was required. There have been three other reports of
suspected pen-type laser devices being aimed at U.S. aircraft in
northern Bosnia, but no injures were reported.
	   The two injured crew members have been temporarily removed from
flight duty.
	   Because of last week's incident, U.S. helicopter crew members
now must wear protective glasses during flights.
	   ``We are assuming this was not any type of hostility,'' Kerrick
said from northern Bosnia, where most of the 6,900 U.S. troops are
deployed.
	   He said it is possible that children heard the helicopter and
aimed a toy laser at it to see what would happen. ``There are a lot
of people who don't understand that the toys could be dangerous if
improperly used.''
	   NATO officials have contacted local police and governments,
trying to learn more about the incident and to warn people how
dangerous the toys can be.

Turkish prosecutor asks prison term for leftist leader accused of
</HEADLINE>
aiding Kurds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A prosecutor on Monday asked for a 20
1/2-year prison term for a Marxist party leader on charges of
aiding Kurdish rebels, the Anatolia news agency said.
	   Workers Party leader Dogu Perincek was detained along with other
senior party officials on Sept. 24 after a rebel informant said
Perincek had advised the PKK guerrilla group in its fight for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast.
	   Prosecutor Nuh Mete Yuksel's indictment also accuses Perincek of
possessing secret military documents and ammunition.
	   Eight other party officials, including General Secretary Mehmet
Bedri Gultekin, faces documents or weapons charges and could face
up to13 years in prison. The documents and ammunition were seized
in raids on party offices last month.
	   Perincek has been a Marxist leader since the 1970s and served
several prison terms when Turkey was under military rule. His party
has a small following and no seats in Parliament.

President of Gabon's appeal against account block rejected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A Geneva court has rejected an appeal by the
president of Gabon, Omar Bongo, against the blocking of a bank
account, State Prosecutor Bernard Bertossa said Monday.
	   Bongo's lawyers had appealed the order, made last May in an
investigation connected to a French kickback scandal, on the
grounds that the president had diplomatic immunity from such
action.
	   They argued that Bongo was the legal owner of the account,
opened at a foreign bank in Geneva in the name of a Panamanian
firm.
	   Those arguments were dismissed Friday by the Geneva appeal
court, Bertossa said. An appeal to the Swiss supreme court is
possible.
	   The account was frozen after France requested legal assistance
from Geneva authorities over the scandal. Lawyers for Bongo say it
was opened by Samuel Dossou, his personal adviser.
	   The key player in the Elf scandal is former French Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas. As head of the Constitutional Council, Dumas
is France's fifth-highest official.
	   At issue is a 59 million French franc (dlrs 10 million) payment
made through a Swiss bank account to Dumas' friend, Christine
Deviers-Joncour, after the dlrs 2.5 billion sale of six frigates to
Taiwan.
	   Prosecutors allege that Deviers-Joncour got the money as a
lobbying commission from Elf-Aquitaine, the French oil giant
pushing the warships' sale on behalf of the smaller state company
that built them, Thomson.
	   Judges are investigating whether Dumas used his influence to
obtain a post for Deviers-Joncour with Elf, and whether he then
accepted part of a kickback.

Pakistan says Indian artillery fire destroys 130 shops, wounds 8
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ An artillery assault by Indian troops
across the disputed Kashmir border wounded eight people Monday and
set 130 shops on fire on Pakistan territory, according to official
sources.
	   The hardest-hit town was Jura, 70 kilometers (40 miles) from
Muzzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-ruled Kashmir, they said.
	   In Jura, a telephone exchange building also burned to the ground
and at least six vehicles were damaged, said witnesses.
	   New Delhi had no immediate comment on the charges.
	   Witnesses said Pakistan retaliated but no military casualties
were reported.
	   Pakistan and Indian troops regularly exchange gunfire along the
disputed border, which has been the flash point of two previous
wars between the neighbors.
	   They fought a third war in 1971 over Bangladesh or what was then
East Pakistan.
	   The disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir became the focus of
international attention in May when India and Pakistan conducted
underground tests, declared themselves nuclear powers and generated
global fears of a nuclear confrontation.

Russian delegation to meet Iraqi leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with lawmakers calling for Russia to stop
abiding by U.N. sanctions, comment from Foreign Ministry. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian parliamentary delegation in Baghdad for
talks with President Saddam Hussein called Monday for Russia to
stop abiding by U.N. sanctions against Iraq, news reports said.
	   The visit by the mostly hard-line lawmakers comes in the wake of
Iraq's decision to cut off all work with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The Russian Foreign Ministry has condemned the decision, saying
it blocked prospects for lifting sanctions, and urged Iraq to
comply with U.N. resolutions calling for the dismantling of the
country's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Moscow, which is owed billions of dollars from Iraq, is
generally sympathetic to the Arab nation and has called for an
early lifting of the sanctions, imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait
in 1990.
	   The parliamentary delegation declared that Russia should
consider breaking the sanctions.
	   The lawmakers sent a letter to Russia's parliament speaker
Gennady Seleznyov on Monday, asking him to raise the issue in the
State Duma, said Seleznyov's deputy Mikhail Gutseriyev, who headed
the delegation in Baghdad.
	   ``The U.N. sanctions affect most of all the peaceful population,
old people children and women,'' Gutseriyev said, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``We have a huge potential of cooperation with Iraq and we must
make sure it is realized,'' he said.
	   The delegation also handed over humanitarian aid and medicines
to Iraq on Monday.
	   The lawmakers also discussed Russia's participation in the U.N.
oil-for-food program _ an exemption to the sanctions _ during a
meeting with Iraq's Oil Minister Lt. Gen. Amir Mohammed Rashid.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons before the U.N. Security
Council will lift sanctions.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Charging that Britain could become a haven for
dictators, prominent Chilean opponents of Gen. Augusto Pinochet
arrived Monday to bolster an appeal by British prosecutors against
a court decision calling the general's arrest illegal.
	   ``We are fighting for justice,'' said Isabel Allende, daughter
of the late Salvador Allende, the leftist president toppled by
Pinochet in a 1973 coup.
	   Ms. Allende, a congresswoman, arrived at London's Heathrow
Airport with a delegation of lawmakers and human rights activists,
some of whom want to testify at the appeal.
	   British prosecutors _ acting on behalf of a Spanish magistrate
seeking the former Chilean dictator's extradition on allegations of
murder, kidnapping and torture during his 17-year rule _ formally
filed the appeal papers Monday, the deadline.

Lloyd meets with OSCE officials on Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ British Foreign Office Minister Tony
Lloyd met with top OSCE officials Monday to discuss the progress of
the Kosovo verification mission, saying the monitors' safety must
be the top priority.
	   He said both Serbian forces and the ethnic Albanians must help
ensure the security of the roughly 2,000 verifiers, but Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic ultimately bears full responsibility.
	   ``It is an absolute obligation for the Belgrade authorities,''
he said of the safety issue, which he deemed his No. 1 concern.
	   Asked if Milosevic must remove his forces by a certain deadline
now that the threat of NATO airstrikes has temporarily been lifted,
he indicated it may be more important for him to work toward a
political solution on Kosovo and meet other international demands
for the time being.
	   ``It's more now about tone,'' Lloyd told reporters. ``Obviously
verification is an important part of making sure he's doing
precisely (what he promised). But until the verifiers are on the
ground, it's not possible'' to ensure that military pledges have
been kept, he said.
	   Britain has committed some 200 people for the verification
mission, half of them to be military personnel. About 50 are
expected in Kosovo in the next few days.

U.N. chief weapons inspector calls Iraq crisis most serious ever
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from U.N. spokesman on monitoring,
Annan's role, Butler's position as chief inspector. TIGHTENS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The chief U.N. weapons inspector Monday
called the crisis with Iraq the most serious ever because Baghdad
is directly confronting the U.N. Security Council by banning
monitoring of its weapons sites.
	   ``I think that's what makes this the worst confrontation by Iraq
with the Security Council that we've yet seen,'' Richard Butler
said in an interview on NBC's Today show.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan met Butler Monday and was told
that technicians from the U.N. Special Commission, which is charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, were being
allowed to maintain surveillance equipment.
	   ``But this in no way constitutes an adequate monitoring
function, so monitoring activities are effectively blocked,''
Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   The secretary-general was also scheduled to meet U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and hold consultations with
council members.
	   Annan called Iraq's announcement Saturday that it was cutting
off all dealings with U.N. weapons inspectors ``a total breach of
Security Council resolutions,'' and noted the council's demand that
Baghdad resume cooperation immediately.
	   ``I think the council as a whole has spoken very clearly and
they are going to remain engaged,'' Annan said Monday.
	   The secretary-general played a key role in defusing the last
major crisis with Iraq, which flared when the Iraqis refused to let
inspectors enter Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's palaces and other
sensitive sites. Annan flew to Baghdad in February and reached an
agreement with the Iraqis allowing inspections to resume.
	   Eckhard stressed that Annan would follow the Security Council's
instructions in trying to resolve the current crisis.
	   ``It is primarily the council's responsibility,'' Eckhard said.
``He does not see it as a matter of his credibility.''
	   Butler said the decision on whether to use force against Iraq is
up to the 15-member Security Council _ not just the United States,
which has said it will consider air strikes if Saddam doesn't back
down.
	   ``The Council has made binding international law. Iraq has to be
disarmed under that law,'' he said. ``If it refuses to comply and
do the things required _ and that's what we appear to have on our
hands now _ the council, of course, has to consider what steps it
will take to see that that law is enforced.''
	   Council members were meeting individually Monday with the new
council president, acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh. The full
council was unlikely to meet before Tuesday.
	   Butler agreed with U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen that
everyone is getting tired of dealing with Saddam.
	   ``Six months ago, I called it the Iraq syndrome; you know,
recurrent obsessive behavior that leads nowhere. Well, here we go
again _ the Iraq syndrome,'' he said.
	   Butler was asked in the NBC interview whether he would comply
with Iraq's demand that he step down as chief weapons inspector.
	   ``If the problem were as simple as that, of course that would
occur,'' Butler said. ``But that's just nonsense. It's a diversion
from their obligation to be disarmed. And that's what everyone has
to keep their eye on.''
	   Asked whether Annan would request Butler's resignation, Eckhard
replied: ``The secretary-general has full confidence in Richard
Butler as the head of UNSCOM.''
	   The U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, is ``almost
finished'' with its disarmament mission _ but Iraq cut off
inspections of new sites on Aug. 5, saying, ``We'll go no
further,'' Butler said.
	   Once Iraq is disarmed, UNSCOM is charged with monitoring its
weapons sites over the long-term ``to see they don't do it again''
_ but Baghdad cut off that monitoring on Saturday, he said.
	   The Iraqi announcement came less than 24 hours after the
Security Council sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
outlining the framework of a comprehensive review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions. But the letter did not meet
Iraq's demand that a review should lead to the lifting of crippling
economic sanctions.
	   ``Iraq didn't like the terms of that letter because it didn't
promise in advance the result that they wanted. It was like saying,
``We're not going to play this game until we know in advance that
we're going to be the winners.'' And, of course, that's wrong and
won't stand,'' Butler said.

Warring parties sign accord to end Guinea-Bissau conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout to ADD quotes from Vieira. Edits to
conform. No pickup.
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's warring sides have signed
an accord to end 5 months of bitter fighting in the West African
country and form a new coalition government, officials said Monday.
	   A Nigerian-led West African force will arrive later this month
to keep the peace, said Gambian Foreign Minister Sedat Jobe, a
mediator between the antagonists.
	   The agreement came late Sunday night during talks between
Guinea-Bissau President Joao Bernardo Vieira and the rebel leader,
Brig. Ansumane Mane, held in secrecy at the mansion of Nigeria's
military leader, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar.
	   Abubakar endorsed the agreement as did Gambian President Yaya
Jammeh.
	   Vieira called the agreement a ``victory for the people,'' the
Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   ``The new government will be open to all political parties, and
also the military junta,'' Vieira was quoted as saying Monday
afternoon after flying to Gambia's capital of Banjul.
	   The pact calls for a re-affirmation of a ceasefire signed in
August, the withdrawal of all foreign forces and the introduction
of a buffer force of West African peacekeepers.
	   Mane has indicated he will not participate in the new government
of national unity, but the rebels will appoint several people to
the coalition cabinet to be led by Vieira, Jobe said.
	   The new government will be formed within 10 days and
presidential elections are to be held no later than next March.
Vieira said it was too early to say whether he would stand for
re-election, Lusa reported.
	   Members of the West African force called ECOMOG are expected to
arrive in Guinea-Bissau later this month.
	   Under the leadership of regional powerhouse Nigeria, ECOMOG has
played aggressive roles in ending seven years of fighting in
Liberia in 1996 and toppling Sierra Leone's junta in March. Several
thousand peacekeepers remain in both countries.
	   Portugal's Foreign Minister Jaime Gama called the deal a
``decisive step in the right direction.'' Gama's visit to the
former Portuguese colony last month led to an agreement by Vieira
and Mane to meet face-to-face for the first time since the war
began.
	   The talks began in Gambia's capital on Friday and were moved to
Nigeria's capital early Saturday to coincide with the second day of
a summit of leaders from the 16-member Economic Community of West
African States.
	   The ECOWAS summit closed on Saturday night with a written appeal
by the organization for the warring parties to resolve their
differences peacefully. But the Guinea-Bissau talks continued
Sunday into the night.
	   Jobe said mediators prevailed on the protagonists to accept the
plan, drawn up with the assistance of ECOWAS officials, by ``making
them feel responsible for the crisis.''
	   About half of the country's 1 million people have been displaced
by the fighting, although no one knows how many people were killed
and wounded.
	   Jobe said he was optimistic the accord would hold, saying his
president ``was convinced that if (the antagonists) could be
brought together, then there was a very good chance of a truce
being reached. That is exactly what happened in Abuja.''
	   The conflict in the former Portuguese colony began June 7 when a
breakaway faction of disgruntled military veterans seized the main
army garrison and international airport in the capital Bissau.
	   The rebels accused Vieira of corruption and had demanded that he
step down.
	   Although Senegal and Republic of Guinea sent troops to Vieira's
aid, the insurgents have overrun most of the small country.

Kuwait thrashes Qatar 6-2 in Gulf soccer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Jassim al-Huwaidy scored twice in the
first half and three times in the second half to lead defending
champion Kuwait to a 6-2 victory over Qatar Monday in the
six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   Monday's victory put Kuwait, an eight-time winner of the Gulf
Cup, back into the tournament after an earlier 2-1 loss to Saudi
Arabia.
	   Al-Huwaidy scored Kuwait's first goal eight minutes after the
kickoff, with a powerful kick to the right corner. In the 38th
minute he scored with a similar shot to left side that sent Qatari
goalkeeper Ahmed Khalil diving in vain.
	   Kuwait's third goal came in the 51th minute from forward Bashaar
Abdullah.
	   Al-Huwaidy's next goal came in the 57th minute with a
well-placed header. He scored again in the 74th minute.
	   Al-Huwaidy's scored his final goal in injury time with a penalty
shot awarded after Khalil tripped him in the penalty area.
	   Despite scoring two goals, Qatar responded well only in the
first half.
	   Qatar scored a 20th minute equalizer from midfielder Abdul Aziz
Hassan and later scored again in a the 80th minute with a curved
shot by Mustafa Mubarak who took a free kick outside the penalty
area.
	   Saudi Arabia plays Bahrain later Monday.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the day the new Mideast peace agreement was
to go into effect, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday he would have to delay
implementation by several days.
	   Arafat agreed, winning assurances by Israel that it would stick
as best as it could to the original timetable.
	   Despite an atmosphere of acrimony and hostility over the
construction of a Jewish settlement in war-captured east Jerusalem,
it was a surprising show of good will by two leaders who in the
past two years had either blamed or shunned each other.
	   In a telephone call, Netanyahu promised Arafat that their
land-for-security agreement would be carried out as efficiently as
possible. Specifically, Israel said it would attempt to meet the
target date of Nov. 16 for its first troop pullback from the West
Bank.
	   However, an overdue Palestinian action plan to fight terrorism
could knock back implementation even further. Israel said the plan,
at the heart of the new accord, needed to be submitted by Tuesday
so the Cabinet could ratify the deal and pave the way for
implentation.
	   And in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem where Jewish settlers
continued preparations for a new enclave, violent scuffles broke
out between Israeli police and Palestinians.
	   Led by Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian official in
Jerusalem, Arab residents of the Ras al-Amud neighborhood protested
construction of a Jewish enclave in the middle of a traditionally
Arab area just outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City.
	   Some 80 police officers blocked Husseini and his supporters. The
two sides began pushing and shoving, and police used clubs to beat
back Husseini and his bodyguards. At one point, officers took a
guard into a choke hold and wrestled him to the ground.
	   In the mayhem, three Palestinians and five policemen were
injured.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish their capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. The final status of the city is to be determined in
future negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Israel will continue
building in Jewish settlements, and denied reports that the United
States received assurances from Israel that it would not do so.
	   ``Israel will continue its policy of strengthening and
developing settlements in the West Bank,'' Naveh told Israel
Television.
	   Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia said ``Israel's
continuation to build settlements comes regardless of the signed
agreements ... and it is an outright breech of the agreements.''
	   Israel has set aside dlrs 114 million from its 1999 budget for
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the Golan
Heights next year, according to the Israeli group Peace Now which
monitors settlement activity.
	   The budget passed its first reading in the Knesset Monday with
members of Netanyahu's hardline coalition, who back the settlers,
voting with the premier.
	   Meanwhile, growing protests against the new Israeli-Palestinian
peace accord and threats against Arafat poured in from around the
Arab world.
	   In Syria, a coalition of Damascus-based radical Palestinian
factions condemned the deal on Monday and pledged to continue armed
struggle against Israel.
	   At a news joint conference, the leader of one radical
Palestinian group threatened to ``severely punish'' those who
signed and helped negotiate the Wye River accord.
	   Sunday, the militant group Hamas, which claimed responsibility
for Thursday's suicide bombing aimed at school children, also
threatened Arafat's leadership and called for an end to the
crackdown against its group.
	   Reacting to the criticism, Arafat said, ``it's not the first
time and won't be the last time,'' Waving his hand dismissively,
the Palestinian leader said, ``I don't care.''
	   And there were no signs that Hamas' threat had altered Arafat's
determination to keep his peace commitments and fight terrorism.
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali said in an interview with The Associated
Press that his men men were under orders to open fire on Hamas if
they felt their lives were being endangered.
	   After Thursday's attack in which an Israeli soldier was killed,
Arafat ordered sweeping arrests of Hamas and placed the group's
spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest.
	   Yassin had to be silenced because he relentlessly criticized the
new Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and was getting directions
from other countries, including Iran, Jabali said.
	   ``Sheik Yassin ... says many things against the agreement and he
received telephone calls from the outside, from Tehran, from many
countries,'' Jabali said. ``So we took this decision, the house
arrest, to protect Ahmed Yassin from Ahmed Yassin.''

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ The fashion model fiancee of Brazilian
soccer star Ronaldo has fulfilled a teenage dream by sharing the
catwalk with Canadian super model Linda Evangelista.
	   ``I've admired Linda, Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford ever
since I started modeling at 14. I never thought I'd be in a fashion
show with one of them,'' Susana Werner, 21, told reporters late
Sunday in this northern city.
	   The 1.7-meter (5-foot, 6-inch) Brazilian model admitted that
having a superstar boyfriend had helped her career.
	   ``My career turned international after I started dating
Ronaldo,'' the paper quoted her as saying.
	   Werner and Evangelista were in Oporto, Portugal's second largest
city, to add a little glitz to the country's top fashion show,
known as ``Portugal Fashion.''

Amnesty: Some African leaders give only lip service to human

rights &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Human rights defenders and not
governments are mostly responsible for progress in respect for
human rights in Africa, Amnesty International chief Pierre Sane
said Monday.
	   Speaking at the start of the first-ever all-Africa human rights
conference, Sane said human rights defenders in African countries
have assumed the central role of protecting these rights where
governments have failed to so.
	   Sane said some African leaders have pledged to uphold and
promote the basic human rights of their citizens, but have failed
to do so.
	   ``In many of the countries represented, the state has either
absolved responsibility for protecting human rights or is
responsible for abuses itself,'' Sane said, without specify which
governments are responsible for rights violations.
	   Sane said his London-based organization wants to promote an
international network for the protection of human rights defenders,
who are often subjected to telephone taps, arrest, torture and even
assassination.
	   Such a network could get human rights defenders quickly to a
foreign embassy when they are under threat, and acquire them
temporary asylum in other countries, Sane said.
	   About 100 delegates from 44 African countries were attending the
three-day conference.

Actress Rosamund John, 1940s star, dies at 85

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rosamund John, one of Britain's most popular
actresses during the World War II years, has died at the age of 85.
	   Ms. John, who dominated the British screen with such 1940s films
as ``Green for Danger'' and ``The Way to the Stars,'' died Oct. 27,
according to newspaper death notices. No information on the cause
of death was available.
	   Noted for her strong political views, Ms. John once said she
wanted to stand for election to Parliament. But she retired into
marriage to John Silkin, who became a high-ranking member of the
Labor Party, and often could be seen watching him speak in the
House of Commons.
	   Born Nora Rosamund Jones in London in 1913, she made her movie
debut in ``The Secret of the Loch,'' a 1934 film about a scientist
out to prove the existence of the Loch Ness Monster, and went on to
became one of Britain's most admired, gentle-mannered leading
ladies on both screen and stage.
	   ``In those days, we were much more ladylike than they are now,''
Britain's Independent newspaper quoted her as saying recently. ``We
used to admire ladies in French films because in them actresses
were allowed to be real. But English films made us unreal because
the audience liked being taken out of the reality of the war.''
	   Ms. John once said that her big break came when she was up a
tree picking cherries. ``A girl I knew in an agency phoned to say
Leslie Howard was looking for someone, and she had suggested me,''
she said.
	   After a screen test, Howard gave Ms. John a leading role in the
1942 film ``The First of the Few.''
	   The following year, Howard cast her in another popular wartime
piece, ``The Gentle Sex,'' and in ``The Lamp Still Burns'' with
Stewart Granger.
	   Ms. John's final film was 1956's ``Operation Murder,'' but she
had long virtually abandoned her acting career for politics and her
marriage to Silkin, who died in 1987.
	   In 1949, she became an Equity representative on a government
commission on film production costs and she also served on a
committee that established a minimum rate for chorus workers.
	   Ms. John is survived by her son with Silkin. Funeral
arrangements were unknown.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A suspected guard at a World War II
Nazi-style concentration camp arrived back to her Croatian homeland
on Monday after decades of low-key life in Argentina. Like her
already imprisoned husband, Nada Sakic faces war crimes charges.
	   While still a teenager between 1942 and 1945, Mrs. Sakic,
allegedly was a guard in the women's bloc in the Stara Gradiska
camp, part of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state.
	   Mrs. Sakic, 76, looked frail as she disembarked from the
Croatian Airlines plane that brought her from Frankfurt, Germany,
after an overnight flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina. She
disembarked slowly from the back door of the plane, supported by
the elbows by two men in civilian clothing.
	   Once on the runway, she was escorted by two policewomen in
uniform to a van, which sped off to Zagreb prison. Mrs. Sakic was
not handcuffed.
	   She and her husband, Dinko, had lived in Buenos Aires for more
than 50 years.
	   He was extradited from Argentina on June 18, on suspicion of
committing, ordering and witnessing war crimes committed in the
Jasenovac camp while he ran it between 1942 and 1944 and
involvement in torture that ``led to the death of a large, so far
unknown number of persons.''
	   He is being held in Zagreb prison, pending a pretrial
investigation that is likely to culminate in an indictment and
trial.
	   Mrs. Sakic was extradited on a warrant accusing her of
``violating the principles of international laws by carrying out
torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as terror,
intimidation and collective punishment of civilians.''
	   In Israel, the Simon Wiesenthal Center welcomed the extradition.
	   ``The time has come for both members of this criminal couple to
pay for their crimes,'' said a statement from Efraim Zuroff, a
center employee who headed efforts to bring the Sakic's to justice.
	   Mrs. Sakic suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, so she
will likely be moved to the prison's hospital, said her Zagreb
attorney, Branko Seric. Nevertheless, she was ``ready to come and
clarify her wartime role,'' he said.
	   During the flight via Germany, she was accompanied by a Croat
doctor.
	   Seric said ``there is no reason'' for the couple not to meet in
prison.
	   The Sakics married in late 1944, after apparently meeting each
other through Maks Luburic, Nada's stepfather and Dinko Sakic's
superior. Luburic was in charge of all World War II camps in
Croatia. It is possible that the two actually met in Jasenovac.
	   They fled Croatia in 1945, when Nazi rule was crushed. Both
lived quietly in the Argentine capital until April, when Dinko
Sakic aroused international attention after appearing on Argentine
television to talk about his wartime role. Sakic, who faces a
maximum 20 years in prison on conviction, said those who died in
the camp did so of disease and natural causes.
	   Nada Sakic was arrested in July in the city of Dolores, south of
Buenos Aires, at the request of Yugoslav officials, who accuse her
of genocide.
	   Croatia then also asked for her extradition, apparently to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, where
she would face a tougher trial. The majority of victims at the camp
were Serbs.
	   There is some concern that the Sakic's would get a lenient trial
in Croatia, where some are unwilling to accept that their
compatriots participated in mass murders. But Croatian authorities
say the trials will be fair and open to international observers.

	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ The fashion model fiancee of Brazilian
soccer star Ronaldo has fulfilled a teenage dream by sharing the
catwalk with Canadian super model Linda Evangelista.
	   ``I've admired Linda, Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford ever
since I started modeling at 14. I never thought I'd be in a fashion
show with one of them,'' Susana Werner, 21, told reporters late
Sunday in this northern city.
	   The 1.7-meter (5-foot, 6-inch) Brazilian model admitted that
having a superstar boyfriend had helped her career.
	   ``My career turned international after I started dating
Ronaldo,'' she said.
	   Werner and Evangelista were in Oporto, Portugal's second largest
city, to add a little glitz to the country's top fashion show,
known as ``Portugal Fashion.''

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Paramilitary troops and police searched
door to door Monday arresting at least 70 people believed to be
behind the violence wracking this southern port city.
	   A city-wide police crackdown began last Friday after Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif dismissed the Sindh provincial government and
imposed federal rule.
	   He accused his former coalition partners in the provincial
government -- the Muttaheda Qami Movement -- of harboring the
killers of Hakim Said, a prominent physician and vocal critic of
the MQM.
	   Sharif, who was meeting with senior officials Monday in Karachi,
said the arrests were not targeting any particular group.
	   ``Our whole priority is to root out the criminals, regardless of
party affiliation,'' he said.
	   More than 200 people have been arrested since Friday and the
Interior Minister Shujaat Hussein said police have a list of as
many as 7,000 suspected troublemakers, who may be arrested in the
coming weeks.
	   This is likely to require additional security forces, officials
said. They said the government was preparing to recruit another
16,000 paramilitary Rangers to patrol Karachi's troubled streets.
Currently 16,000 Rangers and 28,000 police are available to patrol
the violent streets of Karachi.
	   Sharif said there will be no peace in Karachi unless the
thousands of weapons flooding the streets are collected. At the
meeting, participants identified 22 different routes that are used
to funnel weapons into Karachi from elsewhere in the country.
	   Many of the weapons come from northwestern Pakistan, which
borders war-ravaged Afghanistan.
	   ``It might take three months or it might take six months . . .
the terrorism here is deep rooted,'' said Sharif. ``It cannot be
changed overnight.''
	   Karachi, the provincial capital of Sindh, has been at the center
of a bitter feud between rival factions of the minority ethnic
group, the Muttaheda Qami Movement (MQM).
	   The smaller faction known as Haqiqi and the larger rival group,
named for its exiled leader Altaf Hussein, have turned entire
neighborhoods into battlefields, with heavily armed activists
roaming the streets setting shops and vehicles on fire.
	   An estimated 1,000 people have died so far this year in the
bitter battle for control of the city.
	   The MQM says it represents Urdu-speakers who moved to Pakistan
from India in 1947, when British colonial rule of the subcontinent
ended.
	   It wasn't immediately known whether the recent arrests involved
activists from either faction.
	   ``Most of the people who have been arrested are innocent,'' said
Nasim Jalil, a spokeswoman for Hussein's MQM faction.
	   On Sunday Haqiqi supporters burned dozens of shops and blocked
roads with smoldering vehicles to protest the arrest of their
workers.
	   Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto condemned Sharif's
crackdown and the dismissal of the Sindh provincial government. She
warned of a civil war brewing in the southern port city.

Murder case going to the jury Tuesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The ex-wife of Maurizio Gucci and her
codefendants in the trial for his slaying can make a final appeal
to a Milan court before the case goes to the jury Tuesday, the
court president said.
	   The five defendants can make final statements before the panel
of two judges and five citizens begin deliberations, Judge Renato
Samek Ludovici said Monday.
	   The are all charged with premeditated murder and the prosecution
has asked they all be sent to prison for life, the stiffest penalty
in this country which does not have capital punishment.
	   The five-month trial has revealed a dark side to this capital of
glamour, the center of Italy's fashion industry, with testimony of
betrayal, greed and social climbing.
	   The prosecution contends that Gucci's ex-wife, Patrizia Reggiani
Martinelli, 50, contracted the killing to gain control over Gucci's
mullimillion-dollar estate.
	   She wanted all of Gucci's fortune, not content with the dlrs
860,000 a year in alimony, and feared he would marry his companion,
Paola Franchi, prosecution witnesses testified.
	   The defense admits she threatened Gucci and repeatedly sought
someone to kill him, but says she never went through with the plan.
	   The main codefendant is Giuseppina Auriemma, Reggiani
Martinelli's longtime psychic and a Neapolitan of humble
background. Auriemma ``exploited'' their friendship and blackmailed
her friend, the defense argues.
	   ``In Pina's eyes, Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli was a golden cow,
to be milked for money,'' Gianni Dedola said in his closing
arguments last week.
	   Gucci, 46, was shot to death March 27, 1995, outside his Milan
office.
	   He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, who founded the fashion
company known for its leather goods and double ``G'' logo. After a
long history of family discord, he was the last Gucci to have an
interest in the company, selling out for dlrs 120 million in 1993,
three years after the couple divorced.
	   The other defendants are the doorman of a seedy hotel in Milan's
prostitute zone, an indebted pizzeria owner and occasional drug
dealer as well as the reputed triggerman, an unemployed auto worker
from Sicily.
	   All the defendants except Gucci's ex-wife and the alleged hitman
have confessed to their roles in the slaying.

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A suspected guard at a World War II
Nazi-style concentration camp arrived back to her Croatian homeland
on Monday after decades of low-key life in Argentina. Like her
already imprisoned husband, Nada Sakic faces war crimes charges.
	   While still a teenager between 1942 and 1945, Mrs. Sakic
allegedly was a guard in the women's bloc in the Stara Gradiska
camp, part of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state.
	   Mrs. Sakic, 72, looked frail as she disembarked from the
Croatian Airlines plane that brought her from Frankfurt, Germany,
after an overnight flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina. She walked
slowly from the back door of the plane, supported by the elbows by
two men in civilian clothing.
	   Once on the runway, she was escorted by two policewomen in
uniform to a van, which sped off to Zagreb prison. Mrs. Sakic was
not handcuffed.
	   She and her husband, Dinko, had lived in Buenos Aires for more
than 50 years.
	   He was extradited from Argentina on June 18, on suspicion of
committing, ordering and witnessing war crimes committed in the
Jasenovac camp while he ran it between 1942 and 1944 and
involvement in torture that ``led to the death of a large, so far
unknown number of persons.''
	   He is being held in Zagreb prison, pending a pretrial
investigation that is likely to culminate in an indictment and
trial.
	   Mrs. Sakic was extradited on a warrant accusing her of
``violating the principles of international laws by carrying out
torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as terror,
intimidation and collective punishment of civilians.''
	   In Israel, the Simon Wiesenthal Center welcomed the extradition.
	   ``The time has come for both members of this criminal couple to
pay for their crimes,'' said a statement from Efraim Zuroff, a
center employee who headed efforts to bring the Sakics' to justice.
	   Mrs. Sakic suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, so she
will likely be moved to the prison's hospital, said her Zagreb
attorney, Branko Seric. Nevertheless, she was ``ready to come and
clarify her wartime role,'' he said.
	   During the flight via Germany, she was accompanied by a Croat
doctor.
	   Seric said ``there is no reason'' for the couple not to meet in
prison. He said Mrs. Sakic was scheduled to appear before an
investigating judge on Tuesday, where she would either enter a plea
or remain silent.

Mellowed captors invite former U.S. hostages back to Iran

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The politics have mellowed, the tone is
conciliatory. Even the few cries of ``Death to America'' lack the
usual spark.
	   And in courtesy to the American people, demonstrators marking
the 19th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy refrained
from burning the American flag.
	   ``We invite all the former hostages to come here and be our
guests,'' said Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, speaker of the 400 students who
on Nov. 4, 1979 overran the U.S. Embassy and took Americans hostage
for 444 days. The crowd of a few thousand broke into thunderous
applause.
	   Asgharzadeh and all but about a half dozen of the students who
were once zealous supporters of the Islamic Revolution and its
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, are now considered moderates
and back President Mohammad Khatami's call for dialogue with the
American people.
	   Some of the former students serve as high-ranking officials in
Khatami's administration, including Vice President Massoumeh
Ebtekar, who acted as a translator between the students and the
American diplomats.
	   Abbas Abdi, a former student leader and an editor of the
pro-Khatami Salam newspaper, finds nothing odd about the
zealots-turned moderates.
	   ``Extremism is an exceptional state,'' Abdi said. ``It doesn't
mean that we have to have a revolution every day.''
	   The newspaper he works for is run by Seyed Mohammad Musavi
Khoiniha, the spiritual mentor of the students during the
occupation of the embassy.
	   Monday's rally outside the former U.S. Embassy was organized by
the Office of Fostering Unity, a student group which supports
Khatami. It decided to hold the demonstration two days ahead of the
anniversary to avoid any clash with hard-liners who plan a
demonstration Wednesday.
	   Dozens of riot police formed a human wall between the
demonstrators and about 200 hard-liners who tried to break up the
rally with their cries of ``Death to America.''
	   The outside walls of the U.S. Embassy _ which was referred to as
the ``den of spies'' during the revolution _ were covered with
anti-American and revolutionary graffiti. A poster on one wall
showed a blindfolded U.S. hostage.
	   The embassy is now used as a school for the paramilitary
revolutionary guards.
	   The student group that organized Monday's rally is made up of
associations of Islamic students from 50 universities around the
country. It said in a statement that the purpose of the rally was
to ``crush the wall of mistrust'' between the American and Iranian
people, a phrase used by Khatami in his campaign to end Iran's
isolation.
	   Although the group said it would not burn the American flag _
instead it set fire to an effigy of Uncle Sam _ demonstrators did
shout slogans against the United States twice.
	   ``Death to the Great Satan, America,'' the crowd shouted. But
the old fervor was gone and the chant was unemotional.
	   Asgharzadeh, bespectacled and wearing a gray suit without a tie,
said Khatami should not open direct talks with the United States as
long as American forces were in the Gulf.
	   But he tried to show the world the new and gentler face of the
former captors.
	   ``We have a new language for the world... We defend human rights
and we will try to make Islam such that it will not contradict with
democracy,'' he said.
	   ``We have been wronged. We are not terrorists,'' he added.
	   Most of the demonstrators said they were not against the taking
of the U.S. Embassy. But all interviewed agreed that times have
changed.
	   ``It was good for our independence,'' said Hassan Haji-Lari, 53.
``At that time our country was in the hands of foreigners. But now
we need to be moderate so we can get on with building our
country,''

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Two women killed in the 1980s by
an apartheid security official with letter bombs were never
involved in the armed struggle against apartheid, South Africa's
transportation minister testified Monday.
	   Minister Mac Maharaj, a former anti-apartheid activist, made the
assertion in the amnesty hearing of former apartheid spy Craig
Williamson. He is applying for amnesty for the killing of Ruth
First in Mozambique in 1982 and of Jeanette Schoon and her daughter
Katryn in Angola in 1984.
	   Maharaj told the Truth and Reconciliation's amnesty committee he
had known First and Schoon very well during his years in the
underground structures of the African National Congress.
	   He said First had been an ANC sympathiser but had turned away
from active involvement to concentrate on her academic career at a
university in Mozambique. Unlike her husband Joe Slovo, the head of
the Communist Party, who constantly moved around to evade South
African security forces, First had lived an open life in Maputo.
	   Maharaj said Schoon and her husband Marius were involved in the
ANC's political affairs but not its military struggle.
	   Williamson has testified the attack against the Schoons was
meant to ``sow fear and confusion'' in ANC ranks. He has expressed
deep regret that their daughter was killed.
	   Williamson has said he arranged the attacks on the orders of his
superior, Brig. Piet Goosen, who has since died.
	   The Truth Commission delivered a report on apartheid-era abuses
to President Nelson Mandela last week, but its amnesty hearings are
continuing. The commission can grant amnesty to those who fully
confess to politically motivated crimes committed during apartheid.

French NATO official arrested for allegedly spying for Serbs

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A French NATO commander has been arrested for
allegedly supplying information on planned airstrikes to Serb
authorities during October's standoff over troop withdrawals from
Kosovo, judicial officials said Monday.
	   Pierre Bunel, a 46-year-old French air force official posted in
Brussels, faces charges of supplying ``intelligence to a foreign
power,'' the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.
He was arrested last Thursday.
	   Bunel allegedly gave Serbian officials a list of areas that NATO
was targeting for airstrikes.
	   Sources close to the investigation, who also requested
anonymity, said Bunel admitted to handing over the information,
saying he did it because of pro-Serb sympathies.
	   He has been placed under formal investigation _ one step short
of being charged _ and faces up to 15 years in jail.
	   Western powers led by the United States threatened NATO
airstrikes to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to
respect an Oct. 12 agreement calling for him to withdraw police and
military forces in Kosovo to levels before a February crackdown on
Albanian separatists.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
top officials in Belgrade on Monday, trying to jump-start the
stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on a
political settlement for Kosovo.
	   Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch after
arriving from the Macedonian capital, Skopje. He plans to continue
his shuttle diplomacy in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on Tuesday.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, is leading international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 displaced this year in the
Serb authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule.
	   However, Hill said the West had never looked at Monday as a
deadline.
	   ``They indicated a willingness to try and reach an agreement by
this date,'' Hill said of the Serbs' agreement last month. ``But it
was more an expression of a willingness to move ahead quickly.''
	   ``Obviously an agreement depends on the willingness of the other
side to move with the same date,'' he said.
	   He characterized Monday's talks with Milutinovic as informal,
saying they talked about a draft political settlement for Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind brought the first winter weather for refugees struggling to
return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that Serb police were
preventing them from returning to their villages. Several reported
that police shot at them when they attempted to return to family
homes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, claimed that the Serb military on Monday
shelled the village of Jablanica, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southwest of Pristina, for the third straight day.
	   Efforts to put as many as 2,000 international monitors on the
ground in Kosovo proceeded slowly. The monitors will determine
whether the Serb leadership is keeping its promises, including
ending the crackdown and allowing refugees to return home.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons
and 70 Americans in Kosovo later this week will increase the
force's size to more than 200, OSCE officials said.
	   Tony Lloyd, Britain's foreign office minister, met with top OSCE
officials in Vienna, Austria, to discuss the state of the Kosovo
mission and see if anything can be done to speed up deployment. He
said the safety of the unarmed monitors is the top priority.
	   A spokesman for the American delegation to the OSCE, Charles
Walsh, confirmed that a private mercenary firm was awarded a
contract by the U.S. State Department to provide the approximately
150 U.S. verifiers.
	   DynCorp, based in Reston, Virginia, uses the services of former
U.S. Army soldiers and officers and has hired out some to the
international police force in Bosnia over the past three years.
	   A group of specialists from the company already has arrived in
the Balkans.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
top officials in Belgrade on Monday, trying to jump-start the
stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on a
political settlement for Kosovo.
	   Hill is leading international efforts to bring the two sides
closer to a political solution for the secessionist Serbian
province, where hundreds of people have been killed this year in
fighting over the authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch after
arriving from the Macedonian capital, Skopje, where he is the U.S.
ambassador. He plans to continue his shuttle diplomacy in Kosovo's
capital, Pristina, on Tuesday.
	   ``We continue to work with both sides, going back and forth,''
said Philip Reeker, Hill's spokesman, when asked about the status
of talks.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule. But most ethnic Albanians still prefer independence for
Kosovo _ a southern province of Serbia, the dominant republic in
Yugoslavia.
	   Reeker said the West had never looked at Monday as a deadline.
	   ``This (promise) was to show their compliance and that they are
actively pursuing negotiations,'' he said.
	   He said direct talks between Serbs and ethnic Albanians are not
merited until the two sides get closer to a settlement.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind Monday brought the first winter weather for refugees
struggling to return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that harassment by Serb
police prevented them from moving back to their villages in the
region.
	   Ahmet Morina, 25, drove 13 family members huddled under plastic
sheeting on a tractor-pulled cart to a relative's house because
police fired shots at them and took their 30 cattle, killing three,
the day before at Quka Goareve village.
	   In nearby Bubavec, relatives of Murat Kryezim, 53, told how they
finally were able to return to the family home on Saturday to
collect his bones, which had been lying outside his house since a
shell killed him during a Serb attack on July 28.
	   ``We tried a few times, but police would shoot and keep us
away,'' said Kryezim's niece, Sadbere, next to a canvas bag
containing his remains.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, claimed that the Serb military on Monday
shelled the village of Jablanica, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southwest of Pristina, for the third straight day.
	   Meanwhile, efforts to put as many as 2,000 international
monitors on the ground in Kosovo to verify the status of
Milosevic's promises continued proceeding slowly.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons
and 70 Americans in Kosovo later this week will increase the
force's size to more than 200, OSCE officials said.
	   Tony Lloyd, Britain's minister of state, met with top OSCE
officials in Vienna, Austria, to discuss the state of the Kosovo
mission and see if anything can be done to speed up deployment. He
said afterward that the monitors' safety is the top priority.
	   In Pristina, a statement from the Kosovo Liberation Army said
the KLA had met over the weekend with international diplomats who
eventually will become part of the verification mission.
	   ``Both teams agreed that there can be no movement forward
without KLA's participation in the peace-establishing process and
serious negotiations,'' the rebels said in a statement sent to
ethnic Albanian media.

School kids quiz Glenn's doctor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) - Teachers clapped and cameras flashed as
four blushing teenagers Monday stepped up to the keyboard to fire
their questions into space.
	   A physics class project at the American Community Schools in
Athens turned into a questions session for the crew of the space
shuttle Discovery.
	   But the queries were not for Senator John Glenn, the celebrity
space geriatric, but Scott Parazynski, Discovery's chief doctor who
graduated from the Athens school 19 years ago.
	   Year books from 1976 through '79 were opened at the page where
Parazynski, as a mop-haired teenager, posed for class photos.
	   ``Dr. Parazynski, by what have you been more attracted? By the
scientific challenge of space travel or by space itself?'' asked
11th-grader Nicholas Pappas, the first student to have a go in the
internet question session.
	   Pappas, who wants to study astrophysics, asked one of four
questions chosen from the hundreds entered.
	   The school was waiting late Monday for answers from the
37-year-old Parazynski and his colleagues.
	   History teacher George Peppas, who taught Parazynski in the
1970s, remembers the astronaut as a quiet and friendly boy.
	   ``He was a nice kid, quiet and energetic,'' he said. ``He was a
very intelligent. He has an extraordinary head on his shoulders.''
	   Parazynski, is part of the seven-member crew on the high-profile
space mission with the Shuttle Discovery.
	   The schools' blue-eyed doctor is expected to return to Greece in
June, to attend a graduation ceremony.

	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Jassim al-Huwaidy scored twice in the
first half and three times in the second half to lead defending
champion Kuwait to a 6-2 victory over Qatar Monday in the
six-nation Gulf Cup.
	   Monday's victory put Kuwait, an eight-time winner of the Gulf
Cup, back into the tournament after an earlier 2-1 loss to Saudi
Arabia.
	   In the day's second match, Saudi Arabia drew 1-1 with host
Bahrain.
	   Al-Huwaidy scored Kuwait's first goal eight minutes after the
kickoff, with a powerful shot to the right corner. In the 38th
minute he scored with a similar shot to left side that sent Qatari
goalkeeper Ahmed Khalil diving in vain.
	   Kuwait's third goal came in the 51th minute from forward Bashaar
Abdullah.
	   Al-Huwaidy's next goal came in the 57th minute with a
well-placed header. He scored again in the 74th minute.
	   Al-Huwaidy's scored his final goal in injury time with a penalty
shot awarded after Khalil tripped him in the penalty area.
	   Despite scoring two goals, Qatar responded well only in the
first half.
	   Qatar scored a 20th minute equalizer from midfielder Abdul Aziz
Hassan and later scored again in a the 80th minute with a curved
shot by Mustafa Mubarak who took a free kick outside the penalty
area.
	   Saudi Arabia, the favorites to win the cup, drew 1-1 with host
Bahrain in a later match.
	   Saudi captain Yousif al-Thiniyan scored in the 30th minute of
the first half to give Saudi Arabia the lead.
	   But Bahrain scored the equalizer in the last minute of the first
half when Bahraini midfielder Abdul Razzak Mohammed capitalized on
a free kick outside the penalty box.
	   Bahraini forward Hadi Hameed got the first red card of the
competition in the 75th minute for bringing down Saudi Arabia's
Mohammed al-Khilaiwi.
	   Despite the Saudis world experience and their advantage over a
Bahraini team that was down a player they were unable to score in
the second half.

Suspect in beating French policeman at world cup released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) - A suspect arrested in the beating during
this summer's world cup soccer that left a French policeman in a
coma for six weeks, has been released from jail, a state prosecutor
said Monday.
	   Prosecutor Nikolaus Borchers in Hanover, said the 23-year-old
German man was no longer thought to have been in the group of
soccer thugs that beat policeman Daniel Nivel with clubs on June 21
in Lens, France.
	   He declined to identify the suspect by name.
	   The 44-year-old policeman is still undergoing therapy after
being hospitalized six weeks in a coma.
	   Three other suspects remain in investigative custody in Germany
and another remains jailed in France, the prosecutor said.
	   French authorities also released a suspect in the case several
days ago saying that witnesses could not identify him as taking
part in the attack.

Russia and Belarus to set up joint parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with lawmakers agreeing on joint
citizenship, ADD that both presidents must approve recommendations,
comment from Serb leader. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and Belarusian lawmakers decided Monday to
set up a joint parliament to legislate a loose union treaty between
the nations and agreed to grant joint citizenship to their
residents.
	   The decisions must be approved by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko.
	   Lukashenko, an autocratic leader openly nostalgic for the Soviet
Union, has strongly pushed for the full merger of his nation of 10
million with its 148 million-strong eastern neighbor.
	   The two nations signed a union treaty in April 1997 that
envisaged close political, economic and military ties but stopped
short of creating a single state.
	   On Monday, members of the Russian and Belarusian parliaments met
in the Russian city of Yaroslavl on the Volga River, opening their
session with the Soviet anthem.
	   They decided to create a joint legislature and approved a law
saying that citizens of each nation would have equal legal status
in both countries, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Without substituting national parliaments, the joint legislature
would pass laws dealing with union issues.
	   The joint parliament would consist of two chambers. The lower
house would be formed by popular vote and consist of 75 Russian and
25 Belarusian members. The vote would be held simultaneously with
parliamentary elections in both nations.
	   Russia views Belarus as an important strategic ally. Integration
would effectively move Russia's border to Poland _ one of the first
East European states expected to join NATO.
	   Both countries strongly oppose NATO expansion and NATO's
threatened airstrikes on the Serb-led Yugoslav province of Kosovo
because of Slavic and Orthodox religious ties to Serbia.
	   Serbia's deputy premier, Vojislav Seselj, spoke to the Russian
and Belarusian lawmakers at Monday's session.
	   ``We can defend our freedom only if we unite .... It's necessary
to reunify Orthodox Slav peoples. We are ready for the closest
possible union with Russia and Belarus,'' he said.

Germany, Britain forge new cooperation on center-left politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS last graf with two grafs to UPDATE with Schroeder's
comments at Confederation of British Industry conference &QL; 
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain and Germany announced plans Monday to try
to bring more of their shared center-left politics into European
relations as they tackle the world economic crisis and look to
Europe's future.
	   After two hours of talks, Prime Minister Tony Blair and new
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder announced the establishment of
a working group of their trade and industry chiefs, who will meet
regularly to plan ways to practice their so-called ``Third Way,''
or ``Neue Mittel,'' politics more effectively.
	   Schroeder said it was no coincidence that he chose London as the
destination for his first foreign trip since being sworn in last
week: He had followed Blair's electoral strategy of moving his
traditionally left-wing party to the center to win power.
	   ``How can we manage a modern economy whilst not letting social
justice slip off the table? That is the central question we want to
address,'' Schroeder said.
	   He emphasized the personal chemistry between the two leaders,
which he described as ``the spontaneous attitudes we seem to have
in addressing our problems.''
	   However, the two men stressed the meeting in no way indicated a
weakening of the traditional Paris-Bonn axis at the core of Europe.
	   ``This cooperation is certainly not directed against anybody and
it is by no means a cooperation that is meant to jeopardize the
Franco-German relations that are important for Europe,'' Schroeder
said.
	   Blair added that ``there is room for lots of different
relationships within Europe and that's the best way for us to go
without directing our cooperation against anybody at all.''
	   The two leaders also discussed the world financial crisis, with
both saying they had not come to a common position on interest
rates and stressing that neither intends to interfere with the
independence of their respective central banks on the setting of
interest rates.
	   Blair and Schroeder also discussed preparations for the Jan. 1
launch of the single European currency, called the euro.
	   Britain will not join in the first round, but British Chancellor
of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has unveiled plans for a new
initiative designed to make sure Britain would be ready to join if
the government and voters wanted to.
	   ``I see a very strong determination of working very
constructively in Europe'' on the question of the single currency,
Schroeder said.
	   ``What that is exactly going to look like and how it is going to
be assessed in the corresponding historical situation, that's going
to be decided here in Great Britain by a government that knows how
to do so,'' he said.
	   Later, in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry
conference in Birmingham, Schroeder repeated his endorsement of the
new plan for cooperation, and said his nation was confident enough
to recognize that other countries did some things better than
Germany.
	   In particular, he said, Germany could learn from Britain on
tackling unemployment, adding that he agreed with Blair's emphasis
on the need for a flexible labor market.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A suspected guard at a World War II
Nazi-style concentration camp arrived back to her Croatian homeland
on Monday after decades of low-key life in Argentina. Like her
already imprisoned husband, Nada Sakic faces war crimes charges.
	   While still a teenager between 1942 and 1945, Mrs. Sakic
allegedly was a guard in the women's block in the Stara Gradiska
camp, part of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state.
	   Mrs. Sakic, 72, looked frail as she disembarked from the
Croatian Airlines plane that brought her from Frankfurt, Germany,
after an overnight flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina. She walked
slowly from the back door of the plane, supported by the elbows by
two men in civilian clothing.
	   Once on the runway, she was escorted by two policewomen in
uniform to a van, which sped off to Zagreb prison. Mrs. Sakic was
not handcuffed.
	   She and her husband, Dinko, had lived in Buenos Aires for more
than 50 years.
	   He was extradited from Argentina on June 18, on suspicion of
committing, ordering and witnessing war crimes committed in the
Jasenovac camp he commanded between 1942 and 1944 and involvement
in torture that ``led to the death of a large, so far unknown
number of persons.''
	   He is being held in Zagreb prison, pending a pretrial
investigation that is likely to culminate in an indictment and
trial.
	   Mrs. Sakic was extradited on a warrant accusing her of
``violating the principles of international laws by carrying out
torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as terror,
intimidation and collective punishment of civilians.''
	   In Israel, the Simon Wiesenthal Center welcomed the extradition.
	   ``The time has come for both members of this criminal couple to
pay for their crimes,'' said a statement from Efraim Zuroff, a
center employee who headed efforts to bring the Sakics' to justice.
	   Mrs. Sakic suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, so she
will likely be moved to the prison's hospital, said her Zagreb
attorney, Branko Seric. Nevertheless, she was ``ready to come and
clarify her wartime role,'' he said.
	   During the flight via Germany, she was accompanied by a Croat
doctor.
	   Seric said ``there is no reason'' for the couple not to meet in
prison. He said Mrs. Sakic was scheduled to appear before an
investigating judge on Tuesday, where she would either enter a plea
or remain silent.
	   The Sakics' married in late 1944, after apparently meeting each
other through Maks Luburic, Nada's stepfather and Dinko Sakic's
superior. Luburic was in charge of all World War II camps in
Croatia. It is possible that the two actually met in Jasenovac.
	   They fled Croatia in 1945, when Nazi rule was crushed. Both
lived quietly in the Argentine capital until April, when Dinko
Sakic aroused international attention after appearing on Argentine
television to talk about his wartime role. Sakic, who faces a
maximum 20 years in prison on conviction, said those who died in
the camp did so of disease and natural causes.
	   Nada Sakic was arrested in July in the city of Dolores, south of
Buenos Aires, at the request of Yugoslav officials, who accuse her
of genocide.
	   Croatia then also asked for her extradition, apparently to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, where
she would face a tougher trial. The majority of victims at the camp
were Serbs.
	   There is some concern that the Sakics' would get a lenient trial
in Croatia, where some are unwilling to accept that their
compatriots participated in mass murders. But Croatian authorities
say the trials will be fair and open to international observers.

	   	   NEW YORK (AP) _ More than 31 hours after beginning the New York
City Marathon, Zoe Koplowitz, who is afflicted with multiple
sclerosis, finished the race for the 11th consecutive year.
	   Koplowitz, of New York, began the event at 6:03 a.m. Sunday,
nearly five hours ahead of the field of more than 32,000 runners.
She finished Monday at 1:12 p.m., long after the last previous
competitor.
	   Koplowitz, walking with two custom-made canes, was greeted by a
group of about 60 friends, fans and media when she struggled to the
finish line in Central Park.
	   She completed the Boston Marathon in April in just under 31
hours.
	   Koplowitz was diagnosed about 25 years ago with MS, a
degenerative disease of the central nervous system.

Irish premier seeks progress on troubled Belfast peace agreement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout for AMs &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Led by Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahern, rival Protestant and Catholic politicians on Monday
confronted their deepening difficulties in making Northern
Ireland's peace accord work, but failed to reach a solution.
	   The two parties most crucial for the accord _ the major British
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, and the Irish Republican
Army's allies, Sinn Fein _ took potshots at each other publicly
between negotiating sessions.
	   Ulster Unionist deputy leader John Taylor said Sinn Fein leader
Gerry Adams was ``becoming a joke'' in Northern Ireland politics
because of his insistence that the accord does not require IRA
disarmament before Sinn Fein can take part in the new government.
	   ``Everyone knows ... that page 20 of the Belfast agreement
spells out the necessity for the decommissioning of all illegal
armaments,'' said Taylor, who was shot in the face by the IRA in
1972. ``It's time Mr. Adams begins to deliver on his side of the
agreement.''
	   Adams, who survived a 1984 assassination bid by Protestant
extremists, accused Ulster Unionist leader and Nobel Peace Prize
laureate David Trimble of pursuing ``a quite willful and
premeditated, deliberate go slow'' policy.
	   Adams said Trimble, who was elected in July to head the key
executive branch of the new government, had no excuse now not to
form that multi-party administration with Sinn Fein fully involved
at the cabinet table.
	   He dismissed as overblown the opposition that Trimble faces
among his supporters to sharing power with Sinn Fein.
	   ``Mr. Trimble clearly can deliver. He's the leader of the party.
And he should ask his party to back him or sack him,'' Adams said.
	   Two Protestant parties that opposed the accord _ and together
command nearly as much support among Protestants as Trimble's own
divided party _ boycotted the negotiations with Ahern on the
grounds it amounted to foreign meddling.
	   Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Peter Robinson called
Ahern's presence ``an outrage'' and predicted that British Prime
Minister Tony Blair would soon travel to British-ruled province,
too, to put pressure on Trimble.
	   Robinson said Blair ``does intend to bang heads together and
principally to bang Mr. Trimble's head, because he knows from
practice in the past that he's the one that is most likely to
move.''

Duesseldorf airport to spend dlrs 400 million to renew terminals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) - Officials at Duesseldorf airport on
Monday said they would invest 665 million marks (dlrs 403 million)
to renew two terminals destroyed in a 1996 fire that killed 17
people.
	   A statement from the airport said that terminals A and B at
Germany's busiest charter airport, would be newly reconstructed by
a consortium of companies, including Hochtief, Bilfinger and Berger
Bau, and Philipp Holzman construction copanies.
	   Plans for possibly expanding terminal C at the airport are not
included in the latest decision, the airport said. The expansion is
expected to cost an additional 76 million marks (dlrs 46 million),
and a decision on it won't come before the end of 2000, the
statement said.

No immediate military action likely against Iraq

 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs, Clinton remarks; picks up 4th graf pvs,
Defense Secretary ... &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH SCHUMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton predicted Monday that
Iraq's announced decision to stop all cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors will backfire and only stiffen the international
community's resolve to compel Iraqi disarmament. He pointedly left
open the possibility of a military response.
	   ``Saddam Hussein's latest refusal to cooperate with the
international weapons inspectors is completely unacceptable,''
Clinton said at a White House event on his proposal for a patient's
bill of rights.
	   ``Once again, though, it will backfire,'' the president added.
``His obstructionism was immediately and unanimously condemned by
United Nations Security Council. It has only served to deepen the
international community's resolve.''
	   Clinton said his national security team would be consulting with
allied nations to consider how to respond.
	   ``Until inspectors are back on the job, no options are off the
table,'' he said without explicitly mentioning military force.
	   ``For Iraq, the only path to lifting sancitons is through
complete cooperation with the weapons inspectors _ without
restrictions, runarounds or roadblocks,'' he added.
	   The State Department, meanwhile, said Monday that despite Iraq's
announcement it was halting all cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, the search for illegal weapons is proceeding and Iraq
has not made a move to expel the inspectors.
	   Clinton made his remarks shortly after meeting with his top
national security aides.
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen dashed back to Washington on
Sunday, cutting short a planned Asia trip in order to huddle at the
White House for a series of crisis-response meetings. Also meeting
with Clinton were Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and CIA
Director George Tenet.
	   There was little indication the Clinton administration was
moving toward a quick military response.
	   At the State Department, spokesman James P. Rubin said a
technical team has tended to a monitoring camera and groups of
inspectors have gone to suspect sites for a second consecutive day.
	   Still, Iraq's announcement Saturday is regarded ``as a very
serious matter,'' Rubin said. ``Iraq has confronted the
international community with an escalation by refusing to
cooperate.''
	   The spokesman again raised the threat of force to compel Iraq's
compliance, and said the United States reserved the option of
acting alone, if need be.
	   However, the administration appears ready to let the U.N.
Security Council take the lead in confronting Iraq over the
country's refusal to permit inspections for weapons of mass
destruction.
	   Iraq banned U.N. inspection teams from working in the country
Saturday after the Security Council renewed its refusal to lift
economic sanctions against Iraq. The council then demanded
unanimously that Iraq reverse the ban.
	   France and Russia, council members that have taken more lenient
positions on relaxing the sanctions in the past, firmly rebuked
Iraq and called for compliance with the U.N. Special Commission,
known as UNSCOM.
	   ``I personally am very pleased that the U.N. Security Council,
including some people I thought had been a little tolerant with him
in the past, strongly condemned what he did,'' Clinton said in an
interview Sunday with American Urban Radio Network.
	   Clinton was briefed but did not attend the meeting of his
advisers. No additional U.S. forces were being moved to the Persian
Gulf region, and U.S. forces had not been placed on alert, said a
Pentagon spokesman, Navy Lt. Cmdr. Anthony Cooper.

Iraqis ready for anything that will end U.N. trade sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BAG106 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Amid the rattle of dice on backgammon
boards and the clatter of cups on waiters' trays, the talk at
Al-Zahawi coffee house is again turning to the possibility of U.S.
military attacks.
	   Al-Zahawi's patrons say they'll accept anything _ even missile
strikes _ if that's the price of finally shaking off U.N. sanctions
that have devastated their country.
	   ``I think the government has taken the right decision,'' Imad
Mohammed said. Iraq announced during the weekend that it was
halting cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors until the United
Nations moves to end the sanctions, imposed by the U.N. Security
Council to punish Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   ``Not only is it right, but they should have taken this decision
years ago,'' said Mohammed, 40, gesturing with a black backgammon
chip. ``Eight years of suffering is too much.''
	   A required government escort accompanied an Associated Press
reporter to the coffee house, and the customers all backed the
government line. But the vehemence of the coffee house clients, and
other Iraqis, suggested that many people genuinely believe that
Iraq has nothing to lose in pushing to lift the sanctions.
	   Government officials also suggest there's no choice, except to
bow to a weapons inspection system that they claim is humiliating
and stacked against Iraq.
	   ``There is nothing worse than the present situation,'' Deputy
Prime Minister Tariq Aziz told reporters Sunday. ``Our people are
suffering, and there must be steps to put an end to their plight.''
	   Foreign diplomats see a desperate mood among the people, too.
But the diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there
is clearly some calculation in Iraq's decision to defy the United
Nations once again.
	   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein may be guessing that U.S. President
Bill Clinton is too weakened by the Monica Lewinsky scandal _ and
Congressional impeachment hearings _ to respond as firmly as he has
in the past.
	   In this crisis, U.S. officials are talking about a possible
military option, but Washington has not rushed ships and planes to
the region as it did in last winter's standoff. Iraq also can hope
that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan will be able to head off an
American attack, as he did in a deal with Saddam in February.
	   The U.N. Security Council says the sanctions will not be lifted
until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction. Iraq claims the inspectors refuse to do so on
orders of the United States, which sees the sanctions as a weapon
against Saddam.
	   The sanctions limit the sale of oil _ ruining the country's
oil-dominated economy.
	   The result for people like Mohammed and his friends at Al-Zahawi
coffee house has been eight years of economic hardship.
	   They speak of their lives in terms of ``before the embargo'' and
``after the embargo'' and say there's no relief in sight.
	   Mohammed used to support himself, his wife and two children as a
construction worker, but most building in Iraq has stopped.
	   Now his family makes do on food rations, purchased under a
special U.N. program, and ``pocket change'' that Mohammed earns
buying furniture and other castoffs from his neighbors to resell on
the street.
	   Mohammed's backgammon partner, Ahmed Abdel-Rahman, 36, graduated
from the government's oil training center in 1989 but could find no
job in the oil industry.
	   Instead, he works as a day laborer and lives at home with his
parents, distressed that he can't afford to marry.
	   ``How can I take a wife when I have no money?'' he said.
	   Their friend, Mohammed Kassem, a 50-year-old retiree, describes
himself as ``ruined.''
	   Before the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, he supported his wife and six
children with a dlrs 200 a month job as a police driver. Today,
after the sharp depreciation of the Iraqi currency, his annual
pension of 28,000 Iraqi dinars is worth dlrs 16.
	   ``We have meat once or twice a month,'' Kassem said, ``and
that's only because one of my sons has found work as a carpenter
and he helps us.''
	   Kassem held out his hands, curling into claws from arthritis.
``When the sanctions are lifted,'' he said, ``maybe I can afford an
operation _ if it's not too late.''

SAfrica's De Beers considering loan to Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The South African diamond cartel De Beers may
offer Russia a loan to help the crisis-wracked government, a news
report said Monday.
	   The chairman of De Beers, Nicholas Oppenheimer, is visiting
Moscow this week, and is expected to meet with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday.
	   Oppenheimer will discuss a loan to Russia during his talks with
government officials, the Interfax news agency quoted officials at
Russia's State Treasury as saying Monday. They did not indicate the
size of the possible loan.
	   The money would be secured by diamonds held by the treasury.
Under Russian law, a decision to take diamonds out of the treasury
can only be made by the Russian president.
	   De Beers earlier granted Russia a trade advance of dlrs 1
billion to develop Russian diamond fields. The advance was tied to
a contract giving De Beers the exclusive right to sell Russian
gem-quality diamonds.
	   Also Monday, Russia's chief diamond producer, Almazy
Rossii-Sakha (ARS) said it expected to extend by three years an
agreement to deliver rough diamonds to De Beers.
	   The current agreement expires at the end of this year.
	   ARS didn't say how many uncut diamonds it will deliver to De
Beers under the new agreement, to be signed Tuesday, but said in
recent years the deliveries have totaled dlrs 550 million annually.
	   Russia supplies about 20 percent of the world's uncut gems, and
5 percent of all cut diamonds.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
top officials in Belgrade on Monday, trying to jump-start the
stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on a
political settlement for Kosovo.
	   Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch after
arriving from the Macedonian capital, Skopje. He plans to continue
his shuttle diplomacy in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on Tuesday.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, is leading international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 displaced this year in the
Serb authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule.
	   However, Hill said the West had never looked at Monday as a
deadline.
	   ``They indicated a willingness to try and reach an agreement by
this date,'' Hill said of the Serbs' agreement last month. ``But it
was more an expression of a willingness to move ahead quickly.''
	   ``Obviously an agreement depends on the willingness of the other
side to move with the same date,'' he said.
	   He characterized Monday's talks with Milutinovic as informal,
saying they talked about a draft political settlement for Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind brought the first winter weather for refugees struggling to
return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that Serb police were
preventing them from returning to their villages. Several reported
that police shot at them when they attempted to return to family
homes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, claimed that the Serb military on Monday
shelled the village of Jablanica, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southwest of Pristina, for the third straight day.
	   Efforts to put as many as 2,000 international monitors on the
ground in Kosovo proceeded slowly. The monitors will determine
whether the Serb leadership is keeping its promises, including
ending the crackdown and allowing refugees to return home.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons
and 70 Americans in Kosovo later this week will increase the
force's size to more than 200, OSCE officials said.
	   Shaun Byrnes, head of the American observer team within the
larger monitor contingent already in Kosovo, said the total U.S.
observer presence in Yugoslavia now numbers 140, including those in
Kosovo and the newer arrivals in Belgrade.
	   He confirmed that the multinational observer mission in Kosovo
has met frequently with the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been
at the forefront of the armed struggle of independence for the
majority Albanian Kosovo province, to explain terms of the Oct. 12
agreement mandating an end to hostilities.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's parliament unanimously endorsed a
government decision Monday to halt the work of U.N. arms inspectors
and one top official branded the monitors as a ``threat to Iraqi
security.''
	   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Iraq that the West
was ready to use force if Iraq failed to cooperate with the
inspectors.
	   ``We have absolutely no doubt at all that they must comply and
we are ready to use whatever means are necessary to ensure that
they do,'' said Blair, whose country is a strong advocate in the
U.N. Security Council for keeping sanctions on Iraq.
	   In Baghdad, the 250-member National Assembly, which is dominated
by President Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, gave its expected
approval Monday to the government decision.
	   The inspectors are ``a threat to Iraqi security,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said.
	   ``Although Iraq has complied with all its commitments, sanctions
are still imposed and the Special Commission ... is spying on
Iraq,'' he added.
	   Aziz vowed that Iraq would not reverse its stand until the U.N.
Security Council ensured that a promised review of the commission's
work would lead to a lifting of trade sanctions against the
country.
	   Iraq did, however, allow one team of U.N. technicians to repair
the power supply at a monitoring camera at a possible arms site.
	   Iraq said Saturday that it would bar monitors from inspections
but would allow cameras and chemical sensors at possible arms sites
to continue operating.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said Iraqi officials escorted
technicians to the site to carry out the repair work, but she added
that it did not constitute real monitoring of weapons sites.
	   Monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who were
not included in Iraq's latest ban, also continued their work on
Monday.
	   Security Council diplomats have said they will not consider
lifting the sanctions until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of banned weapons. The inspectors have repeatedly accused Iraq
of concealing weapons parts and related documents.
	   Iraq has accused the monitors of bias and is demanding that
commission chairman Richard Butler is fired.
	   In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton predicted that Iraq's
decision to stop all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors would
backfire and only stiffen the international community's resolve to
compel Iraqi disarmament. He pointedly left open the possibility of
a military response.
	   ``Saddam Hussein's latest refusal to cooperate with the
international weapons inspectors is completely unacceptable,''
Clinton said at a White House event on his proposal for a patient's
bill of rights.
	   Clinton made his remarks shortly after meeting with his top
national security aides.
	   U.N. sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The embargo has devastated the country's economy.
	   At the United Nations, Butler called the crisis with Iraq the
most serious ever because Baghdad is confronting the council by
banning the monitoring.
	   ``I think that's what makes this the worst confrontation by Iraq
with the Security Council that we've yet seen,'' Butler said in an
interview on NBC's Today show.
	   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he would meet Monday with
Butler ``to see where we go from here.'' He was also scheduled to
meet U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.

Iraqi parliament endorses halt in work with weapons inspectors

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's parliament unanimously endorsed a
government decision Monday to halt the work of U.N. arms inspectors
and one top official branded the monitors as a ``threat to Iraqi
security.''
	   In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Iraq that the West
was ready to use force if Iraq failed to cooperate with the
inspectors.
	   ``We have absolutely no doubt at all that they must comply and
we are ready to use whatever means are necessary to ensure that
they do,'' said Blair, whose country is a strong advocate in the
U.N. Security Council for keeping sanctions on Iraq.
	   In Baghdad, the 250-member National Assembly, which is dominated
by President Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, gave its expected
approval Monday to the government decision.
	   The inspectors are ``a threat to Iraqi security,'' Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said.
	   ``Although Iraq has complied with all its commitments, sanctions
are still imposed and the Special Commission ... is spying on
Iraq,'' he added.
	   Aziz vowed that Iraq would not reverse its stand until the U.N.
Security Council ensured that a promised review of the commission's
work would lead to a lifting of trade sanctions against the
country.
	   Iraq did, however, allow one team of U.N. technicians to repair
the power supply at a monitoring camera at a possible arms site.
	   Iraq said Saturday that it would bar monitors from inspections
but would allow cameras and chemical sensors at possible arms sites
to continue operating.
	   U.N. spokeswoman Caroline Cross said Iraqi officials escorted
technicians to the site to carry out the repair work, but she added
that it did not constitute real monitoring of weapons sites.
	   Monitors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, who were
not included in Iraq's latest ban, also continued their work on
Monday.
	   Security Council diplomats have said they will not consider
lifting the sanctions until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq is
free of banned weapons. The inspectors have repeatedly accused Iraq
of concealing weapons parts and related documents.
	   Iraq has accused the monitors of bias and is demanding that
commission chairman Richard Butler is fired.

decision to stop all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors would
backfire and only stiffen the international community's resolve to
compel Iraqi disarmament. He pointedly left open the possibility of

	   ``Saddam Hussein's latest refusal to cooperate with the
international weapons inspectors is completely unacceptable,''
Clinton said at a White House event on his proposal for a patient's
bill of rights.
	   Clinton made his remarks shortly after meeting with his top
national security aides.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli Foreign Ministry issued a statement
Monday accusing Iraq of trying to eliminate the Security Council's
ability to monitor adherence to its resolutions following the Gulf
War.
	   ``It's very difficult to envision peace in this area with Saddam
Hussein in control of Iraq,'' said David Bar-Illan, an adviser to
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israel was the target of 39 Iraqi Scud missiles during the 1991
Gulf War. The missiles had conventional warheads, but Israel is
concerned that it might be targeted by chemical or biological
weapons from Iraq in a future conflict.

Chechen police detain suspects in kidnapping of foreigners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chechen police detained two suspects Monday in the
kidnapping of three Britons and a New Zealander working in
breakaway Chechnya last month, a news report said.
	   Chechnya's deputy security minister, Nasrudi Bashiyev, gave no
details on the suspects, saying only that they were being
questioned in the Chechen capital, Grozny, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The four employees of British Telecom were in Chechnya
installing a cellular telephone system and were taken hostage Oct.
3 after a gang shoot-out with their bodyguards.
	   Also Monday, three other hostages seized in Chechnya were freed
in a major crackdown on kidnappers. The men _ one from Uzbekistan
and two from Ukraine _ were captured in October and released in the
neighboring republic of Ingushetia, Interfax said.
	   Chechnya has seen an increase in violence and kidnappings for
ransom since the end of its 1994-96 war with Russia. Chechnya
considers itself independent following that war, but Moscow still
considers it a Russian republic.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
top officials in Belgrade on Monday, trying to jump-start the
stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on a
political settlement for Kosovo.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, is leading international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 displaced this year in
fighting over the Serb authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch after
arriving from the Macedonian capital, Skopje. He plans to continue
his shuttle diplomacy in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on Tuesday.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule.
	   However, Hill said the West had never looked at Monday as a
deadline.
	   ``They indicated a willingness to try and reach an agreement by
this date,'' Hill said of the Serbs' agreement last month. ``But it
was more an expression of a willingness to move ahead quickly.''
	   ``Obviously an agreement depends on the willingness of the other
side to move with the same date,'' he said.
	   He characterized Monday's talks with Milutinovic as informal,
saying they talked about a draft political settlement for Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind brought the first winter weather for refugees struggling to
return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that Serb police were
preventing them from returning to their villages. Several reported
that police shot at them when they attempted to return to family
homes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, claimed that the Serb military on Monday
shelled the village of Jablanica, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southwest of Pristina, for the third straight day.
	   Efforts to put as many as 2,000 international monitors on the
ground in Kosovo proceeded slowly. The monitors will determine
whether the Serb leadership is keeping its promises, including
ending the crackdown and allowing refugees to return home.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons
and 70 Americans in Kosovo later this week will increase the
force's size to more than 200, OSCE officials said.
	   Shaun Byrnes, head of the American observer team within the
larger monitor contingent already in Kosovo, said the total U.S.
observer presence in Yugoslavia now numbers 140, including those in
Kosovo and the newer arrivals in Belgrade.
	   He confirmed that the multinational observer mission in Kosovo
has met frequently with the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been
at the forefront of the armed struggle of independence for the
majority Albanian Kosovo province, to explain terms of the Oct. 12
agreement mandating an end to hostilities.

British Ford plants less productive, chief says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Ford Motor Co.'s 21 British plants
are far less productive than its plants in the United States and
Europe, the chief of the company's British operations said Monday.
	   Alex Trotman, speaking at the Confederation of British Industry
conference, said Ford plants in Britain were ``at least 20 percent
less productive'' than the company's best plants in the United
States and also lagged far behind plants in other European
countries.
	   Poor productivity among car makers and other manufacturers could
be blamed for the recent wave of job losses in Britain, Trotman
said.
	   ``Productivity is not what it should be, and we're seeing the
repercussions of that now with new layoffs every week,'' he said.
	   Britain must focus on training and education, creating a
flexible labor market and cutting back on regulation to improve
productivity and increase investment from abroad, Trotman said.
	   He warned that mergers and takeovers would shrink the industry
from 40 car-akers worldwide to just six by the next century, with
just two in Europe.
	   The productivity warning was echoed by Confederation of British
Industry economist Kate Barker, who highlighted the productivity
gap between Britain and other industrialized countries.
	   The United States has created far more wealth per worker than
Britain, and France and Germany also were more productive, Barker
said.
	   But she said the reasons were different in each case. The United
States achieves its higher productivity through longer working
hours, while in France and Germany hours are shorter but
unemployment is higher, she said.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The chief judge investigating the car crash that
killed Princess Diana received two key reports Monday, one showing
the Mercedes had no mechanical difficulties and another on the
driver's blood, judicial sources said.
	   Crash tests involving three identical Mercedes at police labs
outside Paris showed the vehicle was traveling at a speed of ``at
least 118 kph'' (73 mph) when it hit a concrete pillar in a Paris
tunnel, the sources, who requested anonymity, said.
	   An analysis of brake marks also showed the vehicle was traveling
at a speed between 126 and 155 kph (78 and 96 mph) when it entered
the tunnel and brushed against a Fiat Uno.
	   The speeds were more than double the legal limit in the area.
	   Tests, including some done by computer, found the Mercedes had
no brake problems, contrary to reported testimony in the police
record that the car was dangerous when braking suddenly. Its
airbags also worked, the sources said.
	   Other conclusions of the report revealed to The Associated Press
on Monday showed that, contrary to previous beliefs, bodyguard
Trevor Rees-Jones, the sole survivor of the crash, was not wearing
a seat belt at the time of the crash, and only survived because of
his airbag. He was traveling in the front passenger seat.
	   The report on driver Henri Paul's blood concluded that a suspect
amount of carbon monoxide found in his blood was due to him
inhaling substances contained in his airbag.
	   Two other reports are expected to be turned over to Judge Herve
Stephan this week: one on the level of medical care Diana received
and another general report on the causes of the accident.
	   Civil parties to the investigation have one month to request the
judge to order a new panel of experts to provide a second opinion
on any of the reports once they are officially submitted, judicial
sources said.
	   Once he has received all the reports, Stephan must decide
whether he has enough information to complete his investigation.
Requests for new tests by civil parties could possibly delay the
conclusion of the investigation.
	   The tests on the Mercedes were considered the largest part of
the puzzle still missing in the investigation into Diana's death on
Aug. 31, 1997.
	   Although the tests show the Mercedes, as has long been believed,
brushed with a Fiat Uno before crashing, it is not known what role
that played in the crash.
	   Paul, who was legally drunk at the time of the accident, was
killed, as was Diana's boyfriend, Dodi Fayed.
	   The main causes of the crash are still believed to be
drunkenness and speed.
	   The outcome of the judge's investigation will be important in
determining the fate of 10 paparazzi who are under formal
investigation in the crash. It is believed they will be cleared on
the manslaughter charge, but some may be tried on the charge of
failing to aid people in danger.

 &UR; Suspected concentration camp guard returned to Croatia
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A suspected guard at a World War II
Nazi-style concentration camp arrived back to her Croatian homeland
on Monday after decades of low-key life in Argentina. Like her
already imprisoned husband, Nada Sakic faces war crimes charges.
	   While still a teenager between 1942 and 1945, Mrs. Sakic
allegedly was a guard in the women's block in the Stara Gradiska
camp, part of the Jasenovac concentration camp complex.
	   Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats
were killed at Jasenovac, the most notorious of more than 20
concentration camps run by Croatia's World War II Nazi puppet
state.
	   Mrs. Sakic, 72, looked frail as she disembarked from the
Croatian Airlines plane that brought her from Frankfurt, Germany,
after an overnight flight from Buenos Aires, Argentina. She walked
slowly from the back door of the plane, supported by the elbows by
two men in civilian clothing.
	   Once on the runway, she was escorted by two policewomen in
uniform to a van, which sped off to Zagreb prison. Mrs. Sakic was
not handcuffed.
	   She and her husband, Dinko, had lived in Buenos Aires for more
than 50 years.
	   He was extradited from Argentina on June 18, on suspicion of
committing, ordering and witnessing war crimes committed in the
Jasenovac camp he commanded between 1942 and 1944 and involvement
in torture that ``led to the death of a large, so far unknown
number of persons.''
	   He is being held in Zagreb prison, pending a pretrial
investigation that is likely to culminate in an indictment and
trial.
	   Mrs. Sakic was extradited on a warrant accusing her of
``violating the principles of international laws by carrying out
torture, inhuman treatment of civilians, as well as terror,
intimidation and collective punishment of civilians.''
	   In Israel, the Simon Wiesenthal Center welcomed the extradition.
	   ``The time has come for both members of this criminal couple to
pay for their crimes,'' said a statement from Efraim Zuroff, a
center employee who headed efforts to bring the Sakics' to justice.
	   Mrs. Sakic suffers from advanced Parkinson's disease, so she
will likely be moved to the prison's hospital, said her Zagreb
attorney, Branko Seric. Nevertheless, she was ``ready to come and
clarify her wartime role,'' he said.
	   During the flight via Germany, she was accompanied by a Croat
doctor.
	   Seric said ``there is no reason'' for the couple not to meet in
prison. He said Mrs. Sakic was scheduled to appear before an
investigating judge on Tuesday, where she would either enter a plea
or remain silent.
	   The Sakics' married in late 1944, after apparently meeting each
other through Maks Luburic, Nada's stepfather and Dinko Sakic's
superior. Luburic was in charge of all World War II camps in
Croatia. It is possible that the two actually met in Jasenovac.
	   They fled Croatia in 1945, when Nazi rule was crushed. Both
lived quietly in the Argentine capital until April, when Dinko
Sakic aroused international attention after appearing on Argentine
television to talk about his wartime role. Sakic, who faces a
maximum 20 years in prison on conviction, said those who died in
the camp did so of disease and natural causes.
	   Nada Sakic was arrested in July in the city of Dolores, south of
Buenos Aires, at the request of Yugoslav officials, who accuse her
of genocide.
	   Croatia then also asked for her extradition, apparently to
prevent her from being tried in Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, where
she would face a tougher trial. The majority of victims at the camp
were Serbs.
	   There is some concern that the Sakics' would get a lenient trial
in Croatia, where some are unwilling to accept that their
compatriots participated in mass murders. But Croatian authorities
say the trials will be fair and open to international observers.

Opposition poised to form new government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS and UPDATES with winners pledging better economy
and no change in foreign policy
 &UR; By KONSTANTIN TESTORIDES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Leading with most votes counted, an
opposition coalition that claimed victory over the former communist
incumbent government in weekend elections pledged Monday to work
for more democracy and continued close ties to the West.
	   Initial unofficial results released Monday showed that the
conservative, center-right coalition of VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic
Alternative parties won 59 of 120 seats in the parliament, with
good chances of extending the alliance with at least a few more
deputies to secure a majority block.
	   ``Macedonia will see serious changes from the current
situation,'' said the coalition leader, Ljupco Georgijevski, and
promised ``further democratization of society and economic recovery
of the country.''
	   He said there would be ``no radical changes'' in the existing
government's foreign policy - to join NATO and the European Union
and to strive for better relations with neighboring, Balkan
countries.
	   According to the still unofficial but generally similar results
from different parties, the ruling Social Democrats headed by
President Kiro Gligorov secured 29 seats. A coalition of two major
ethnic Albanian parties secured 24 seats and the remainder went to
a few smaller parties, some of which are tipped to join the winners
to form a stable government.
	   The outcome of the elections is important for NATO's plans for
verifying the troop pullback of government troops in neighboring
Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   NATO wants to use Macedonia as a base for its aerial
surveillance of adjacent Kosovo. It also wants to station a
security force to protect the 2,000-member ground verification
force in Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   During the election campaign, the opposition coalition said it
opposed the stationing of foreign military forces in Macedonia.
After the first round, however, it softened that position, saying
it would maintain ``continuity'' in international agreements
reached by the current government.
	   The Kosovo issue played big in Macedonian elections because of
the country's own large and restive ethnic Albanian community,
nearly a quarter of the country's 2.2 million people. Unlike in
Serbia, however, Macedonia's ethnic Albanians do not boycott
elections and have been included in the government.
	   The Democratic Alternative leader, Vasil Tupurkovski, pledged
the coalition will ``improve ethnic relations in the country'' and
that ethnic Albanians ``will find themselves among our equal rights
for all.''
	   Although official results still must be published, Georgijevski
already declared victory. He spoke to thousands of euphoric
supporters who celebrated for most of the night in downtown Skopje,
honking car sirens and waving party flags.
	   Hours after polls closed Sunday evening, incumbent Premier
Branko Crvenkovski appeared on state-run TV to concede defeat.
	   Georgijevski also said a final count could even give his
coalition the outright majority, Failing this, the small Liberal
Party, which has four seats so far, could join the alliance, or
some ethnic Albanian deputies could pledge support.
	   A top campaign issue was the country's weak economy and the
state's ongoing disputes with most of its neighbors.
	   Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia six years ago,
the only former republic to have done so without a war. But
tensions are high due to the large ethnic Albanian community and a
border with Kosovo.

Developing countries urged to do more to combat global warming

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina called on developing
nations Monday to do more to reduce greenhouse gases, opening the
biggest U.N. climate conference since a global warming treaty in
December.
	   Kicking off the two-week summit of 163 nations, Argentina's
environmental secretary suggested the agenda should include debate
of ``voluntary'' quotas for poorer nations to combat heat-trapping
gases.
	   The Argentine official, Maria Julia Alsogaray, acknowledged that
the ``the industrialized world is to a large extent responsible for
this critical present condition of climate change.''
	   But she hinted that countries like Argentina should do more.
	   ``We, (the) developing nations, do have the necessary conditions
_ and ethical duty _ to embrace social, economic and technological
development models,'' said Alsogaray at the Buenos Aires convention
center.
	   Argentina is pushing to add ``voluntary'' emissions quotas for
developing countries as part of the formal structure of the Kyoto,
Japan, global warming treaty. No specifics of Argentina's proposal
were unveiled Monday.
	   History was made last year in Kyoto, Japan, when governments set
2012 as the deadline for cutting back on greenhouse gases in the
United States, Japan, the 15-nation European Union and 21 other
industrial nations.
	   Nonetheless, summit participants say progress at developing
specifics for last year's momentous agreement will be crucial at
the Buenos Aires conference.
	   ``The task of this conference is to maintain the political
momentum generated by Kyoto. Climate change must remain high on
national agendas,'' said Michael Zammit Cutajar, the United
Nation's top climate official.
	   As executive secretary of the conference, he convened the
delegates by urging them to now take ``practicable steps'' toward
implementing Kyoto's provisions.
	   The Kyoto accord would require the European Union to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases 8 percent
below 1990 levels, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6
percent. The treaty only calls on developing nations to restrain
emissions as best they can.
	   Many developing countries argue their economies can't assume the
burden of energy restraints that even voluntary quotas would
require. They point out industrialized nations in the North loaded
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide to begin with.
	   The United States, which hasn't yet signed the Kyoto treaty,
backs Argentina's move for voluntary quotas. Washington says it
wants to see a bigger commitment from the developing world.
	   Arizal Effendi, an Indonesia delegate, led off opposition to
voluntary quotas, saying ``developing countries are doing as much
they can.'' He exhorted industrialized countries to achieve their
reductions first.
	   Delegates from India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Tanzania joined
Indonesia in opposing voluntary quotas. Representatives from
Australia, Russia, the United States, and Samoa spoke in support of
Argentina.
	   ``We believe that ultimately all parties must explore and
develop more consensus on how to secure global action on this
problem of climate change,'' said Melinda Kimble, a member of the
U.S. delegation.
	   ``We will need to strengthen all commitments to the
convention,'' she added. ``Other challenges lay ahead.''

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) _ After clinging to life for three days,
two youths trapped in a dance-hall fire died early Monday, bringing
the death toll in the inferno to 62.
	   With another 25 people remaining in intensive care, the grim
figure could still go higher in what is already Sweden's worst fire
disaster of modern times.
	   The dead, as young as 12 and none older than 20, were among an
estimated 400 people who were at a disco dance in a rented
second-floor hall when an explosive fire broke out shortly before
midnight Thursday.
	   The hall had been rented out for the night by the tenant, the
local association of Macedonian immigrants, to teen-agers who
arranged the dance.
	   The hall had a legal capacity of only 150 and officials say it
is possible that the organizers who allowed the hall to be severely
overcrowded could face charges.
	   ``It's important that people have a clear understanding that the
authorities' approval of the premises was not a joke,'' chief
prosecutor Ulf Noren, who is leading the investigation into the
fire, was quoted as saying in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter.
	   However, Noren said, a decision on that question would wait
until the cause of the fire has been determined.
	   Inspectors from the national criminal laboratory were conducting
a painstaking ``centimeter-by-centimeter'' inspection of the
elecrtrical equipment in the hall, police spokesman Bengt Staaf
said.
	   Police also said they were looking for a 15-year-old girl who
reportedly had gone to the dance shortly before the fire broke out
but hasn't been seen since. Her name has not appeared on the list
of the injured.
	   The ferociously quick spread of the fire has prompted wide
speculation that it was set. But witnesses have given widely
varying accounts _ some saying it appeared to start in the
equipment used by the disc jockey and others saying smoke came up
from the emergency exit's stairway before the flames raced through
the hall.
	   The emergency exit was blocked by flames, forcing the panicked
dancers to try to flee down the one remaining stairway or leap out
of second-story windows.
	   Most of those at the dance were immigrants or children of
immigrants.
	   Many of the victims' families did not have life or accident
insurance. The Goteborg local government on Monday decided to
compensate the families of those who died with 20,000 kronor (dlrs
2,600) or double that amount to families who lost two children in
the fire.

Arafat agrees to Israeli request to delay implementation of deal

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ On the day the new Mideast peace agreement was
to go into effect, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Monday he would have to delay
implementation by several days.
	   Arafat agreed, winning assurances by Israel that it would stick
as best as it could to the original timetable.
	   Despite an atmosphere of acrimony and hostility over the
construction of a Jewish settlement in war-captured east Jerusalem,
it was a surprising show of good will by two leaders who in the
past two years had either blamed or shunned each other.
	   In a telephone call, Netanyahu promised Arafat that their
land-for-security agreement would be carried out as efficiently as
possible. Specifically, Israel said it would attempt to meet the
target date of Nov. 16 for its first troop pullback from the West
Bank.
	   However, an overdue Palestinian action plan to fight terrorism
could knock back implementation even further. Israel said the plan,
at the heart of the new accord, needed to be submitted by Tuesday
so the Cabinet could ratify the deal and pave the way for
implementation.
	   Adding to the tension, in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem
where Jewish settlers continued preparations for a new enclave,
violent scuffles broke out between Israeli police and Palestinians.
	   Led by Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian official in
Jerusalem, Arab residents of the Ras al-Amud neighborhood protested
construction of a Jewish enclave in the middle of a traditionally
Arab area just outside the walls of Jerusalem's Old City.
	   Some 80 police officers blocked Husseini and his supporters. The
two sides began pushing and shoving, and police used clubs to beat
back Husseini and his bodyguards. At one point, officers took a
guard into a choke hold and wrestled him to the ground.
	   In the mayhem, three Palestinians and five policemen were
injured.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish their capital in east
Jerusalem, the sector Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast war. The final status of the city is to be determined in
future negotiations on a permanent peace agreement.
	   Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Israel will continue
building in Jewish settlements, and denied reports that the United
States received assurances from Israel that it would not do so.
	   ``Israel will continue its policy of strengthening and
developing settlements in the West Bank,'' Naveh told Israel
Television.
	   Palestinian parliament speaker Ahmed Qureia said ``Israel's
continuation to build settlements comes regardless of the signed
agreements ... and it is an outright breech of the agreements.''
	   Israel has set aside dlrs 114 million from its 1999 budget for
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and the Golan
Heights next year, according to the Israeli group Peace Now which
monitors settlement activity.
	   The budget passed its first reading in the Knesset Monday with
members of Netanyahu's hardline coalition, who back the settlers,
voting with the premier.
	   Meanwhile, growing protests against the new Israeli-Palestinian
peace accord and threats against Arafat poured in from around the
Arab world.
	   In Syria, a coalition of Damascus-based radical Palestinian
factions condemned the deal on Monday and pledged to continue armed
struggle against Israel.
	   At a joint news conference, the leader of one radical
Palestinian group threatened to ``severely punish'' those who
signed and helped negotiate the Wye River accord.
	   Sunday, the militant group Hamas, which claimed responsibility
for Thursday's suicide bombing aimed at school children, also
threatened Arafat's leadership and called for an end to the
crackdown against its group.
	   Reacting to the criticism, Arafat said, ``it's not the first
time and won't be the last time,'' Waving his hand dismissively,
the Palestinian leader said, ``I don't care.''
	   And there were no signs that Hamas' threat had altered Arafat's
determination to keep his peace commitments and fight terrorism.
Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali said in an interview with The Associated
Press that his men were under orders to open fire on Hamas if they
felt their lives were being endangered.
	   After Thursday's attack in which an Israeli soldier was killed,
Arafat ordered sweeping arrests of Hamas activists and placed the
group's spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house arrest.
	   Yassin had to be silenced because he relentlessly criticized the
new Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement and was getting directions
from other countries, including Iran, Jabali said.
	   ``Sheik Yassin ... says many things against the agreement and he
received telephone calls from the outside, from Tehran, from many
countries,'' Jabali said. ``So we took this decision, the house
arrest, to protect Ahmed Yassin from Ahmed Yassin.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Australia's Mark Philippoussis and Tommy Haas of
Germany got off to winning starts Monday on the first day of the
dlrs 2.55 million Paris Open, but Thomas Enqvist surprisingly lost
to veteran Italian Gianluca Pozzi.
	   Philippoussis, the world No. 19 who just missed out on a seeding
here, had a tough first round contest, needing two tiebreaks to
beat the Czech Republic's Daniel Vacek 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (8-6).
	   The big Australian, who fired 20 aces, will play another Czech,
No. 10 seed Petr Korda, in the second round.
	   Haas, who reached the final of last month's Lyon Grand Prix
after walkovers against Pete Sampras and Marcelo Rios, beat Spain's
Carlos Costa, 7-5, 6-1.
	   In the next round the 20-year-old German, making his first
appearance at the Paris Open tournament, faces Spain's Alex
Corretja _ the player who beat him in the Lyon Grand Prix final.
	   Pozzi was one of several surprise winners Monday, overcoming
Sweden's Enqvist, the world's No. 18, 6-3, 6-3.
	   Qualifier Pozzi, ranked 58, won in one hour 14 minutes and will
play Andre Agassi in a second round match on Tuesday.
	   World junior champion Arnaud Di Pasquale beat experienced
Australian Richard Fromberg, 6-3, 6-4, while Swiss qualifier Marc
Rosset, a finalist here in 1994, beat South Africa's Wayne
Ferreira, 6-3, 6-4.
	   Sweden's Thomas Johansson will play favorite Pete Sampras in the
second round, after beating 20-year-old Frenchman Sebastien
Grosjean.
	   Johansson had a far tougher match than expected, beating
Grosjean 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (3-7), 6-4, in two hours, 36 minutes.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina called on developing
nations Monday to do more to reduce greenhouse gases, opening the
biggest U.N. climate conference since a global warming treaty in
December.
	   Kicking off the two-week summit of 163 nations, Argentina's
environmental secretary suggested the agenda should include debate
of ``voluntary'' quotas for poorer nations to combat heat-trapping
gases.
	   The Argentine official, Maria Julia Alsogaray, acknowledged that
the ``the industrialized world is to a large extent responsible for
this critical present condition of climate change.''
	   But she hinted that countries like Argentina should do more.
	   ``We, (the) developing nations, do have the necessary conditions
_ and ethical duty _ to embrace social, economic and technological
development models,'' said Alsogaray at the Buenos Aires convention
center.
	   Argentina is pushing to add ``voluntary'' emissions quotas for
developing countries as part of the formal structure of the Kyoto,
Japan, global warming treaty. No specifics of Argentina's proposal
were unveiled Monday.
	   History was made last year in Kyoto, Japan, when governments set
2012 as the deadline for cutting back on greenhouse gases in the
United States, Japan, the 15-nation European Union and 21 other
industrial nations.
	   Nonetheless, summit participants say progress at developing
specifics for last year's momentous agreement will be crucial at
the Buenos Aires conference.
	   ``The task of this conference is to maintain the political
momentum generated by Kyoto. Climate change must remain high on
national agendas,'' said Michael Zammit Cutajar, the United
Nation's top climate official.
	   As executive secretary of the conference, he convened the
delegates by urging them to now take ``practicable steps'' toward
implementing Kyoto's provisions.
	   The Kyoto accord would require the European Union to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases 8 percent
below 1990 levels, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6
percent. The treaty only calls on developing nations to restrain
emissions as best they can.
	   Many developing countries argue their economies can't assume the
burden of energy restraints that even voluntary quotas would
require. They point out industrialized nations in the North loaded
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide to begin with.
	   The United States, which hasn't yet signed the Kyoto treaty,
backs Argentina's move for voluntary quotas. Washington says it
wants to see a bigger commitment from the developing world.
	   Arizal Effendi, an Indonesia delegate, led off opposition to
voluntary quotas, saying ``developing countries are doing as much
they can.'' He exhorted industrialized countries to achieve their
reductions first.
	   Delegates from India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Tanzania joined
Indonesia in opposing voluntary quotas. Representatives from
Australia, Russia, the United States, and Samoa spoke in support of
Argentina.
	   ``We believe that ultimately all parties must explore and
develop more consensus on how to secure global action on this
problem of climate change,'' said Melinda Kimble, a member of the
U.S. delegation.
	   ``We will need to strengthen all commitments to the
convention,'' she added.
	   Other challenges lay ahead.
	   Under a trading scheme broadly endorsed at Kyoto, countries
would be able to meet their greenhouse gas reductions in part by
trading or purchasing credits from others who have already met
their goals.
	   Washington supports unrestricted swapping, mostly as a
cost-saving to industries. Opponents insist unrestricted trading
would allow the United States to reach its targets without actaully
scaling back emissions.
	   With 1.5 million metric tons a year, the United States leads the
world in carbon dioxide emission _ nearly twice as much as China
and more than three times that of Russia, statistics show.
	   Fifty-seven countries have signed the Kyoto treaty. Only Fiji
has ratified it.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
five gases, chiefly carbon dioxide. Critics say dire warming
scenarios remain unproven nd don't warrant potentially costly
shifts away from fossil fuels.

Britain-Spain summit planned for next year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Spanish
Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar agreed Monday to hold the first
summit between the two countries next year.
	   The two leaders had a ``very friendly'' hourlong meeting at 10
Downing St. Monday that included discussions on the summit, defense
and a variety of other European issues, a spokesman for Blair said.
	   They agreed that NATO must remain the foundation of their
collective security, but that Europe must be able to act militarily
on its own, the spokesman said. The leaders also discussed Kosovo,
and agreed they must remain firm in dealing with Iraq.
	   On Saturday, Iraq banned U.N. weapons inspection teams from
working in the country after the U.N. Security Council again
refused to lift economic sanctions. The Security Council demanded
that Iraq reverse the ban and warned that lack of compliance could
result in force being used.
	   Blair and Aznar decided the first Britain-Spain summit would be
held next year, but specifics were not discussed, Blair's spokesman
said.

Russia's Yavlinsky names top officials in corruption inquiry
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA DOLGOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prominent liberal lawmaker Grigory Yavlinsky named
top government ministers in a request Monday for an investigation
into alleged government corruption.
	   Yavlinsky presented a letter to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
mentioning first deputy prime ministers Yuri Maslyukov and Vadim
Gustov, deputy premiers Gennady Kulik and Valentina Matviyenko and
other senior officials, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   The letter, written by Yavlinsky and lawmakers with his Yabloko
party, did not directly accuse the officials of corruption, but
asked questions about their business connections or lobbying for
business interests.
	   Yavlinsky provoked an uproar last week when he said the present
Russian Cabinet is just as prone to corruption as its predecessors.
Until Monday he had named few names.
	   Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov ordered a preliminary
investigation on possible libel charges against Yavlinsky for his
accusations.
	   Primakov _ whose candidacy for premier was first suggested by
Yavlinsky _ responded to last week's comments by asking Yavlinsky
to provide specific evidence.
	   The letter Monday said that the facts must be gathered by
police, while lawmakers could only indicate potential lines of
inquiry.
	   Primakov again blamed Yavlinsky for failing to provide specific
evidence.
	   ``Give me the facts that somebody was appointed to some or other
Cabinet post for money,'' Primakov told Yavlinsky, according to the
ITAR-Tass news agency. ``Please tell me how much was paid.''
	   At a news conference Monday, Yavlinsky said corruption has
become endemic ``not only to members of the government, but also to
the ... very system that operates there.''
	   Yavlinsky said the ``extremely nervous'' reaction by the
government to his accusations showed that ``serious public
attention ... to the issue of corruption causes them a lot of
worry.''
	   However, Yavlinsky made no accusations against the prime
minister and said he still believed Primakov was the right choice
for the job.
	   Yavlinsky, a reformist economist, also said the government's new
economic program, if implemented, would lead to 200 percent to 300
percent inflation next year and would cause Russia's gross domestic
product to fall 10 percent, Interfax reported.
	   The government has said it expects inflation to be no higher
than 30 percent in 1999. The GDP was predicted to drop about 5
percent this year, but it now appears the fall will be much
steeper.
	   Some of those mentioned in Yavlinsky's letter are among the
communist-minded politicians appointed to Russia's new Cabinet to
appease Boris Yeltsin's opposition. They include Maslyukov, a
Communist Party member and a staunch defender of the
military-industrial complex, and Kulik, a defender of state farms.

	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said ``the
necessary plans were provided on time.'' But Netanyahu's senior
adviser, David Bar-Illan told The Associated Press that the
document was incomplete and unless a newer version was submitted,
Israel's Cabinet would not debate the accord as scheduled Tuesday.
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the document was
a matter between the Palestinians and the United States and not
Israel.

U.S. peace seekers to meet with Mugabe over Congo offensive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The U.S. State Department's top Africa
official arrived in Zimbabwe late Monday for talks with President
Robert Mugabe to seek an end to fighting in the Congo.
	   Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice,
pressing for an immediate cease-fire in the vast mineral-rich
country where Zimbabwe has deployed 6,000 troops to support
Congolese President Laurent Kabila, said she is scheduled to meet
with Mugabe on Tuesday.
	   ``We would like to see the immediate implementation of a
cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign forces,'' Rice said.
	   The Congo conflict was costing lives and resources and she was
planning to consult with Mugabe and ``hear his thoughts'' on a the
fighting, Rice said.
	   The U.S. delegation was expected to receive a cool welcome from
Mugabe.
	   On Sunday, Mugabe sharply criticized U.S. efforts to broker a
peace agreement in the Congo.
	   He accused the United States of not recognizing that Zimbabwe
and its southern African allies _ Angola and Namibia _ were invited
by Kabila to defend his government.
	   He described as ``abominable'' U.S. calls for the withdrawal of
all foreign troops.
	   Earlier on Monday, Rice met with President Frederick Chiluba of
Zambia, who hosted two days of peace talks last week that failed to
hammer out a cease-fire agreement in the Congo.
	   Kabila has claimed Ugandan and Rwandan troops are fighting with
the rebels, but Rwandan officials have persistently denied this.
	   Uganda has admitted its troops were in eastern Congo, but says
its forces are there to attack Congo-based Ugandan rebels.
	   Last week's Lusaka talks were the latest effort to end
hostilities in the three-month civil war in the vast central
African country, which has drawn in Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola, Chad
and reportedly Sudan on the government's side.
	   The rebel forces, composed of ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted
members of Kabila's army and opposition politicians, accuse Kabila
of corruption, mismanagement and stirring up ethnic rivalries.
	   The same forces supported Kabila last year when he ousted
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko from Congo, formerly known as Zaire.
	   Rice is scheduled to leave Zimbabwe late Tuesday for Rwanda and
then visit Uganda, U.S. officials said.

Strikes hit national library, Eiffel Tower, transport
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with court convicting men for attack on train driver &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Commuters couldn't ride, scholars couldn't read and
tourists stayed roped off from the Eiffel Tower as nagging strikes
disrupted the capital Monday.
	   The Eiffel Tower _ the most visited monument in the City of
Light _ stood empty for a fourth day, with striking workers
refusing to back down on their demand for more personnel.
	   Commuters in the Paris region faced minor inconveniences from
the latest strike by public transport workers. But the strikers
failed in their bid to bring the system to a halt.
	   Two out of three Metro lines were working at rush hour and buses
experienced only minor difficulties, according to France Info
radio.
	   But commuters on some high-speed lines encountered reduced
service, and had to find alternative routes.
	   The strikes were the latest in a series of social protests that
have swept France this fall. Last month thousands of high school
students took to the streets demanding smaller classes and better
facilities.
	   Striking library workers continued to man picket lines Monday at
the National Library, barring access for the third straight week to
the high-tech facility that opened there for researchers less than
a month ago.
	   The strike was launched by library workers fed up with computer
glitches that delay the automatic delivery of books and research
materials.
	   Library spokesman Alain Veinstein said strikers are demanding
better working conditions and for the library to close on Mondays.
	   Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann has refused to consider a
Monday closure, but talks were underway, he said.
	   A spokesman for the Eiffel Tower refused to predict when the
``grande dame'' of Paris monuments would reopen its steel grills.
	   Workers, mainly hosts and hostesses, went on strike Friday,
shutting out some 35,000 visitors over the All Saints Day holiday
weekend, and an expected 8,000 visitors on Monday, a traditionally
slow day, the press office said.
	   That adds up to a more than 2 million-franc (dlrs 365,000) loss,
according to a press office spokeswoman, who requested anonymity.
	   The transport strike was the latest protest against a security
problem on suburban trains, buses and the Metro system.
	   Workers are seeking better security measures and more staff
after a spate of violent attacks on colleagues.
	   The government has deployed CRS elite police on trains and
buses, and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has promised to revise the
penal code to deal more harshly with violence against transport
workers. But the assaults continue.
	   On Monday, a court sentenced two men to three months in jail,
and three others to one month, for attacking a train driver in
Yvelines, west of Paris, in September.
	   The men, aged between 18 and 21, were fined 2,000 francs (dlrs
333) and made to pay 40,000 francs (dlrs 6,700) in damages.

	   CHINANDEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Overwhelmed by death and chaos,
Central American officials on Monday estimated more than 7,000
people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Hurricane Mitch.
	   As many as 1,500 people were buried near this town in northwest
Nicaragua when the crater lake of the Casitas Volcano collapsed,
sending a wall of mud and debris onto villages below.
	   ``It looked like a line of helicopters flying really low and
coming at us. You could see houses, trees, everything being
covered,'' said Ricardo Antonio Garcia, a 23-year-old farmer whose
leg was amputated after being crushed in the mudslide.
	   Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said the slide
apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people and that some 600 other
people died elsewhere in the country.
	   ``We perhaps will never know how many people died,'' he said.
	   In neighboring Honduras, ``more than 5,000 people'' probably
died, Dimas Alonzo, operations chief for the National Emergency
Committee, told a local radio station. He said the exact number
would never be known.
	   Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after
Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25
inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before
dissipating Monday in southern Mexico.
	   The president of Honduras told CNN's Spanish-language network
the flooding was so extensive that 70 percent of the upcoming
harvests had been lost.
	   ``There are many hundreds of dead,'' President Carlos Flores
Facusse told CNN. ``There are bodies that are floating in the
rivers'' and people on rooftops awaiting rescue, he said.
	   AP photographer Victor Caivano, who visited Guanaja, said only
10 of the 146 houses in Mangrove Bight survived the storm, which
hovered over the island for two days. The island, where flowers
once abounded, was a desolate gray, with naked sticks of trees
jutting out of the mud.
	   Virtually all of Honduras suffered flooding, from the lowland
marshes on the Atlantic Coast to the mountains, hills and plateaus
of the interior.
	   Floodwaters receded in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on
Monday, but some residents carried machetes and guns because of
reports that looters with automatic rifles had attacked several
houses.
	   All four bridges across the Rio Choluteca, which splits the city
of 800,000 people, were damaged and remained out of service Monday.
	   Many victims have waited days without aid.
	   In Chinandega, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of the
Nicaraguan capital, Managua, Garcia said relatives pulled him from
the debris after the mudslide Friday. He and 40 others were taken
to a one-room, hilltop shack overlooking the village of Rolando
Rodriguez.
	   ``We thought that help would come but it never did,'' Garcia
said.
	   He said a 3-year-old girl beside him was so badly injured she
could not move. ``When she asked me for water, I would drink some
and give it to her from my mouth.''
	   By the time rescuers finally arrived Sunday, three of the
injured had died. But the 3-year-old girl survived.
	   Miguel Rostran Laguna, 42, who was in a hospital bed beside
Garcia, said that from the door of the shack, ``All you could see
was mud where the village had been. Nothing is left of Rolando
Rodriguez.''
	   It was unclear how many residents of Rolando Rodriguez and
nearby villages had escaped. By early Monday, soldiers had found
360 bodies, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval said.
	   The international Red Cross on Monday tripled its appeal for
assistance to those hit by Mitch, to dlrs 7.4 million.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the U.S. government was
providing dlrs 2 million in food, medicine, water and other
emergency relief supplies.
	   ``We'll be looking at what else we can do,'' Clinton said.
	   At least one rescue effort led to additional deaths: the mayor
of the Honduran capital and three others died Sunday in a
helicopter crash while surveying flood damage. Tegucigalpa Mayor
Cesar Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely presidential
candidate in 2001 elections.
	   Officials in neighboring El Salvador were assessing the impact
of floods caused by the storm. The National Emergency Committee
listed 74 dead, 106 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own
regional affiliate in San Miguel province reported 125 dead there
alone.
	   Guatemala reported storm-related 33 deaths. Mexico reported one.

Saudi defense minister meets Mubarak amid Gulf tensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ President Hosni Mubarak met with Saudi
Defense Minister Prince Sultan Monday for talks on Baghdad's
decision to halt cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Washington has not ruled out the use of force if Baghdad does
not agree to let the inspectors resume their work.
	   Prince Sultan arrived in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheik
where Mubarak is vacationing and was immediately taken to see
Mubarak.
	   The talks were prompted by the rising tension in the Gulf, Arab
diplomats said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Egypt and Saudi Arabia were key members of the U.S.-led
coalition that drove Iraqi soldiers from Kuwait in 1991.
	   The two Arab countries, however, have cautioned against the use
of force in recent confrontations with Iraq.
	   There is strong sympathy throughout the Arab world for Iraqi
civilians who have been suffering as a result of U.N. trade
sanctions imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
	   U.N. diplomats have said they will not lift the sanctions until
Iraq fully cooperates with U.N. arms monitors.

Occidental Petroleum pulling out of Russian oil venture
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Occidental Petroleum Inc. is pulling out of joint
oil exploration and drilling projects in northern Russia because of
the slump in world oil prices, a news report said Monday.
	   Occidental had a 75 percent stake in Parmaneft, a joint venture
with Russian partners in the republic of Komi, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   The U.S.-based company is cutting back projects around Europe,
including Russia, Paul McInnes, head of Occidental's operations in
the former Soviet Union, told Komi Governor Yuri Spiridonov.
	   Spiridonov said Parmaneft would work on protecting its
personnel, Interfax said. The report did not elaborate.
	   Occidental won the right to explore and drill in Komi, about
1,000 kilometers (650 miles) northeast of Moscow, in 1992 and paid
dlrs 10 million for a five-year lease.
	   The withdrawal reflects a cost-cutting trend throughout the oil
industry amid low world oil prices and global economic troubles.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
top officials in Belgrade on Monday, trying to jump-start the
stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on a
political settlement for Kosovo.
	   Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch. He plans
to continue his shuttle diplomacy in Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on
Tuesday.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, is leading international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 displaced this year in the
Serb authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule.
	   However, Hill said the West had never looked at Monday as a
deadline.
	   ``They indicated a willingness to try and reach an agreement by
this date,'' Hill said of the Serbs' agreement last month. ``But it
was more an expression of a willingness to move ahead quickly.''
	   ``Obviously an agreement depends on the willingness of the other
side to move with the same date,'' he said.
	   He characterized Monday's talks with Milutinovic as informal,
saying they talked about a draft political settlement for Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind brought the first winter weather for refugees struggling to
return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that Serb police were
preventing them from returning to their villages. Several reported
that police shot at them when they attempted to return to family
homes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which has close connections to
the province's ethnic Albanian leadership, claimed that the Serb
military on Monday shelled the village of Jablanica, 55 kilometers
(35 miles) southwest of Pristina, for the third straight day.
	   Efforts to put as many as 2,000 international monitors on the
ground in Kosovo proceeded slowly. The monitors will determine
whether the Serb leadership is keeping its promises, including
ending the crackdown and allowing refugees to return home.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons
and 70 Americans in Kosovo later this week will increase the
force's size to more than 200, OSCE officials said.
	   Shaun Byrnes, head of the American observer team within the
larger monitor contingent already in Kosovo, said the total U.S.
observer presence in Yugoslavia now numbers 140, including those in
Kosovo and the newer arrivals in Belgrade.
	   He confirmed that the multinational observer mission in Kosovo
has met frequently with the Kosovo Liberation Army, which has been
at the forefront of the armed struggle for independence of the
majority Albanian Kosovo province, to explain terms of the Oct. 12
agreement mandating an end to hostilities.
	   The threat of NATO airstrikes pressured government authorities
to sign on to the agreement. In Paris on Monday, judicial officials
said that a Brussels-based French NATO commander, Pierre Bunel, has
been arrested for allegedly supplying information on the planned
strikes to Serb authorities.

Mellowed captors invite former U.S. hostages back to Iran

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The politics have mellowed, the tone is
conciliatory. Even the few cries of ``Death to America!'' lack the
usual spark.
	   And in courtesy to the American people, demonstrators marking
the 19th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy refrained
from burning the American flag.
	   ``We invite all the former hostages to come here and be our
guests,'' said Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, speaker of the 400 students who
on Nov. 4, 1979, overran the U.S. Embassy and took 52 Americans
hostage for 444 days. The crowd of a few thousand broke into
thunderous applause.
	   Asgharzadeh and all but about a half-dozen of the students who
were once zealous supporters of the Islamic Revolution and its
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, are now considered moderates
who back President Mohammad Khatami's call for dialogue with the
American people.
	   Some of the former students serve as high-ranking officials in
Khatami's administration, including Vice President Massoumeh
Ebtekar, who acted as a translator between the student captors and
the American diplomats.
	   Abbas Abdi, a former student leader and an editor of the
pro-Khatami Salam newspaper, finds nothing odd about the
zealots-turned moderates.
	   ``Extremism is an exceptional state,'' Abdi said. ``It doesn't
mean that we have to have a revolution every day.''
	   The newspaper he works for is run by Seyed Mohammad Musavi
Khoiniha, the spiritual mentor of the students during the
occupation of the embassy.
	   Monday's rally outside the former U.S. Embassy was organized by
the Office of Fostering Unity, a student group that supports
Khatami. It decided to hold the demonstration two days ahead of the
anniversary to avoid any clash with hard-liners who plan a
demonstration Wednesday.
	   Dozens of riot police formed a human wall between the
demonstrators and about 200 hard-liners who tried to break up the
rally with their cries of ``Death to America!''
	   The outside walls of the U.S. Embassy _ which was referred to as
the ``den of spies'' during the revolution _ were covered with
anti-American and revolutionary graffiti. A poster on one wall
showed a blindfolded U.S. hostage.
	   The embassy is now used as a school for the paramilitary
revolutionary guards.
	   Bruce Laingen, who as charge d'affaires was the most senior
diplomat among the American hostages in 1979, said Monday that
``any indication'' from the Iraqi regime ``that it is open to a new
relationship with both the people and the government of the U.S. is
very welcome as far as I'm concerned.''
	   ``I've said I've looked forward for a long time to going back to
Tehran eventually,'' Laingen said in a telephone interview from
Washington with The Associated Press in New York.
	   ``I want to go at the right time and in the right circumstances.
... I want to consider that very carefully. But I welcome this as
an indication of increasing openness to the United States.''
	   Barry Rosen, a former press attache at the embassy who now heads
the public affairs department of Teachers College at Columbia
University, said he would ``be in favor of going back to Iran.''
	   ``The issue is ... those people who spoke at the commemoration
today, one doesn't know where they stand in terms of the whole
power network in Iran. ... Is Iran ready to go that step to invite
hostages? I don't know.
	   ``(But) I second the motion and if that possibility occurs, I
want to be there.''
	   The student group that organized Monday's rally is made up of
associations of Islamic students from 50 universities around the
country. It said in a statement that the purpose of the rally was
to ``crush the wall of mistrust'' between the American and Iranian
people, a phrase used by Khatami in his campaign to end Iran's
isolation.
	   Although the group said it would not burn the American flag _
instead it set fire to an effigy of Uncle Sam _ demonstrators did
shout slogans against the United States twice.
	   ``Death to the Great Satan, America!'' the crowd shouted. But
the old fervor was gone and the chant was unemotional.
	   Asgharzadeh, bespectacled and wearing a gray suit without a tie,
said Khatami should not open direct talks with the United States as
long as American forces were in the Persian Gulf.
	   But he tried to show the world the new and gentler face of the
former captors.
	   ``We have a new language for the world. ... We defend human
rights and we will try to make Islam such that it will not
contradict with democracy,'' he said.
	   ``We have been wronged. We are not terrorists,'' he added.
	   Most of the demonstrators said they were not against the taking
of the U.S. Embassy. But all interviewed agreed that times have
changed.
	   ``It was good for our independence,'' said Hassan Haji-Lari.
``At that time our country was in the hands of foreigners. But now
we need to be moderate so we can get on with building our
country.''

U.S. to give dlrs 15 million for Abkhazian refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The U.S. government has offered dlrs 15 million to
help refugees returning to the breakaway region of Abkhazia after
its war with Georgia, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said
Monday.
	   The money will go toward helping Abkhazians restore their
demolished and burned-down houses, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted
Shevardnadze as saying.
	   Shevardnadze learned of the aid during a meeting with a visiting
U.S. government delegation in Tbilisi, the Georgian capital,
ITAR-Tass said. The report gave no other details.
	   Tensions have remained high in the Black Sea province of
Abkhazia since separatists took control in a 1992-93 war, and many
people displaced by the fighting have yet to return home. U.N.
observers are in Abkhazia to monitor a truce between Georgian
government forces and the rebels.

Opposition poised to form new government in Macedonia

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ An opposition coalition claimed victory
over Macedonia's ruling former communists after weekend elections
and pledged Monday to work for more democracy and continued close
ties to the West.
	   Unofficial results released Monday showed that the conservative,
center-right coalition of VMRO-DPMNE and Democratic Alternative
parties won 59 of 120 seats in the parliament.
	   ``Macedonia will see serious changes from the current
situation,'' said coalition leader Ljupco Georgijevski. He promised
``further democratization of society and economic recovery of the
country.''
	   Georgijevski said there would be ``no radical changes'' in the
existing government's foreign policy: to join NATO and the European
Union and to strive for better relations with neighboring Balkan
countries.
	   According to unofficial results, the ruling Social Democrats
headed by President Kiro Gligorov secured 29 seats. A coalition of
two major ethnic Albanian parties won 24 seats and the remainder
went to a few smaller parties.
	   Georgijevski said a final count could give his coalition an
outright majority. If not, the small Liberal Party, which has four
seats, could join the alliance, or some ethnic Albanian deputies
could pledge support.
	   Macedonia declared independence from Yugoslavia six years ago,
the only former republic to have done so without a war. But
tensions are high due to the large ethnic Albanian community and a
border with Kosovo, a predominantly ethnic Albanian province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia.
	   The outcome of the elections is important to NATO's plans for
verifying the pullback of government troops in neighboring Kosovo.
	   NATO wants to use Macedonia as a base for its aerial
surveillance of Kosovo and for a security force to protect the
2,000-member ground verification force in the province.
	   During the election campaign, the opposition coalition said it
opposed the stationing of foreign military forces in Macedonia.
After the first round, however, it softened that position, saying
it would maintain ``continuity'' in international agreements
reached by the current government.
	   The Kosovo issue played big in Macedonian elections because of
the country's large and restive ethnic Albanian community, nearly
one-quarter of the country's 2.2 million people. Unlike in Serbia,
however, Macedonia's ethnic Albanians do not boycott elections and
have been included in the government.
	   The Democratic Alternative leader, Vasil Tupurkovski, pledged
the coalition will ``improve ethnic relations in the country'' and
that ethnic Albanians ``will find themselves among our equal rights
for all.''
	   Although official results have not been released, Georgijevski
already declared victory. He spoke to thousands of euphoric
supporters who celebrated for most of the night in downtown Skopje,
honking car horns and waving party flags.
	   Hours after polls closed Sunday evening, Premier Branko
Crvenkovski appeared on state-run television to concede defeat.
	   Top campaign issues also were the country's weak economy and the
state's ongoing disputes with most of its neighbors.

Four men convicted of planning bank robbery in Anguilla
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) _ A jury convicted four foreign
nationals Monday of planning to rob the Barclay's Bank branch on
the British Caribbean island of Anguilla in May 1997.
	   Howard Nunes, 21, and Michael Gumbs, 20, both of the Dutch
territory of St. Maarten, were sentenced to four years in prison
along with Kenny Johnson, 21, of St. Kitts and David Crawford, 34,
of Guyana.
	   Residents had reported seeing the men loitering near the bank.
Police discovered a shotgun, a pistol and ammunition in their
vehicle.
	   After a nine-day trial and two hours of deliberation, a jury
found each of them guilty of conspiracy to rob the bank and
possession of firearms and ammunition.
	   In sentencing them, Judge Adrian Saunders said the plot had
``shattered the peace of the island.''
	   ``It was incumbent upon the court to deal with the offenders in
such a manner that others would be deterred from such a course of
conduct,'' Saunders said.

Yeltsin allows sale of 5 percent stake in Gazprom
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 10th graf to ADD dollar value of stock, CORRECT that rise
was 25 percent, sted 30. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree Monday
permitting the cash-strapped Russian government to auction off up
to 5 percent of one of its most valuable assets _ the natural gas
monopoly Gazprom, the world's largest gas company.
	   Yeltsin, who was recovering from his latest illness at the Black
Sea resort of Sochi, signed the order approving the auction and
allowing foreign investors to take part. No date was set.
	   However, the Interfax news agency later quoted unidentified
officials as saying that the government may decide not to sell a
stake in Gazprom this year because its stock price has fallen
sharply. If the auction goes ahead, no more than 3 percent of the
company will be sold, it added.
	   The government has repeatedly postponed the sale because it was
hoping to get a better price. Russia's financial troubles have
scared away foreign investors and driven down share prices.
	   But with the International Monetary Fund reluctant to give
Russia more loans, the government has little choice but to sell
more shares to pay off its huge debts.
	   The government currently holds 40 percent of Gazprom shares and
said it may gradually reduce its holdings to 25 percent. Private
investors in Russia and abroad hold the remaining shares.
	   Foreign ownership of Gazprom stock was previously limited to 9
percent, but Monday's decree raises that limit to 14 percent.
	   In August, the Russian government set the starting price for a 5
percent stake in Gazprom at dlrs 1.65 billion _ more than double
the current international market price.
	   Yeltsin's decree did not say whether the government would
reassess the price, but unidentified officials speaking to Interfax
said the starting price would be ``far below'' dlrs 1 billion.
	   The announcement of the decree sent Gazprom prices up 25 percent
at the Moscow Stock Exchange, from 1.52 rubles (9.6 cents) per
share to 1.9 rubles (12 cents), ITAR-Tass reported.

Italian winner now on national team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Franca Fiacconi doesn't have to worry about
being selected to the Italian national marathon team now.
	   Fiacconi, who was bypassed for the 1996 Olympic team because of
what she termed ``politics,'' earned a place on the 1999 World
Championship team by becoming the first Italian to win the women's
division of the New York City Marathon on Sunday. She also figures
she's a cinch for the 2000 Olympic team.
	   Not only did she win, she set an Italian record of 2 hours, 25
minutes, 17 seconds, she also broke her personal best by nearly
three minutes and she ran the second-fastest New York race ever,
trailing only the 2:24:40 by Australia's Lisa Ondieki in 1992.
	   ``We solved the problem with the (Italian) federation last
year,'' Fiacconi said Monday through a translator.
	   That was a year too late to salve Fiacconi's anger over being
left off the Olympic team.
	   In 1996, the federation skipped over her, despite having the
fastest time by an Italian. Instead, it chose two slower runners,
neither finishing at Atlanta.
	   ``The federation didn't understand me as an athlete, as a woman
or as a person,'' Fiacconi said. ``Now, things have changed.''
	   Two years ago, Renato Canova was the Italian Olympic coach. He
also was the coach of the two runners chosen instead of Fiacconi.
	   Fiacconi, who is coached by her husband, Luciano Milani, was so
upset that she fought the decision in court. She lost after many
heated arguments.
	   ``They (the federation and coach) didn't like me,'' Fiacconi
said.
	   Now, there is no argument for next year and not likely for the
Sydney Games.
	   ``I believe with my time I'm automatically on the team for
Sydney,'' she said. ``I think I can win the next Olympics. The
Italian federation can put me on the team today.''
	   Fiacconi, a workhorse who has run 26 marathons in 10 years,
proved in the New York race that she will be a strong contender for
the world title and the Olympic gold medal.
	   In winning, she beat the world record-holder, Tegla Loroupe of
Kenya, who finished third; she beat the defending champion,
Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland, who placed sixth; she beat
the 1984 Olympic gold medalist, Joan Benoit Samuelson, who was
12th; and she beat the 1996 New York winner, Anuta Catuna of
Romania, who did not finish.
	   ``To win this year, I knew I had to run fast because Tegla and
the others were in the field,'' said Fiacconi, the third-place
finisher in 1997 and the runner-up in 1996. ``For me to win, I had
to be prepared to run 2:25. I was ready to fight for the victory.
It was not much of a surprise that I won.''
	   She was right on target, and was an easy winner. Adriana
Fernandez of Mexico was a distant second at 2:26:33.
	   ``I consider this the best marathon in the world,'' Fiacconi
said. ``It was a dream to win it.''
	   Winning was worth dlrs 75,000 _ dlrs 50,000 first prize and dlrs
25,000 for running under 2:25. Fiacconi also received a new car and
an expensive watch.
	   Along with men's champion John Kagwe of Kenya, Fiacconi also got
the keys to the city from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, was honored at a
luncheon and was a guest on David Letterman's show.
	   In addition, Fiacconi's victory was front-page news in Rome, and
Italian radio and television stations besieged her for interviews.
	   That's why a weary Fiacconi said she would skip workouts Tuesday
and Wednesday.
	   ``For me, it's a holiday,'' she said.
	   The race drew 32,398 starters and wound up with a record 31,456
finishers, a remarkable 97 percent finishing rate.

Mellowed captors invite former U.S. hostages back to Iran

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ The politics have mellowed, the tone is
conciliatory. Even the few cries of ``Death to America!'' lack the
usual spark.
	   And in courtesy to the American people, demonstrators marking
the 19th anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy refrained
from burning the American flag.
	   ``We invite all the former hostages to come here and be our
guests,'' said Ibrahim Asgharzadeh, speaker of the 400 students who
on Nov. 4, 1979, overran the U.S. Embassy and took 52 Americans
hostage for 444 days. The crowd of a few thousand broke into
thunderous applause.
	   Asgharzadeh and all but about a half-dozen of the students who
were once zealous supporters of the Islamic Revolution and its
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, are now considered moderates
who back President Mohammad Khatami's call for dialogue with the
American people.
	   Some of the former students serve as high-ranking officials in
Khatami's administration, including Vice President Massoumeh
Ebtekar, who acted as a translator between the student captors and
the American diplomats.
	   Abbas Abdi, a former student leader and an editor of the
pro-Khatami Salam newspaper, finds nothing odd about the
zealots-turned moderates.
	   ``Extremism is an exceptional state,'' Abdi said. ``It doesn't
mean that we have to have a revolution every day.''
	   The newspaper he works for is run by Seyed Mohammad Musavi
Khoiniha, the spiritual mentor of the students during the
occupation of the embassy.
	   Monday's rally outside the former U.S. Embassy was organized by
the Office of Fostering Unity, a student group that supports
Khatami. It decided to hold the demonstration two days ahead of the
anniversary to avoid any clash with hard-liners who plan a
demonstration Wednesday.
	   Dozens of riot police formed a human wall between the
demonstrators and about 200 hard-liners who tried to break up the
rally with their cries of ``Death to America!''
	   The outside walls of the U.S. Embassy _ which was referred to as
the ``den of spies'' during the revolution _ were covered with
anti-American and revolutionary graffiti. A poster on one wall
showed a blindfolded U.S. hostage.
	   The embassy is now used as a school for the paramilitary
revolutionary guards.
	   Bruce Laingen, who as charge d'affaires was the most senior
diplomat among the American hostages in 1979, said Monday that
``any indication'' from the Iranian regime ``that it is open to a
new relationship with both the people and the government of the
U.S. is very welcome as far as I'm concerned.''
	   ``I've said I've looked forward for a long time to going back to
Tehran eventually,'' Laingen said in a telephone interview from
Washington with The Associated Press in New York.
	   ``I want to go at the right time and in the right circumstances.
... I want to consider that very carefully. But I welcome this as
an indication of increasing openness to the United States.''
	   Barry Rosen, a former press attache at the embassy who now heads
the public affairs department of Teachers College at Columbia
University, said he would ``be in favor of going back to Iran.''
	   ``The issue is ... those people who spoke at the commemoration
today, one doesn't know where they stand in terms of the whole
power network in Iran. ... Is Iran ready to go that step to invite
hostages? I don't know.
	   ``(But) I second the motion and if that possibility occurs, I
want to be there.''
	   The student group that organized Monday's rally is made up of
associations of Islamic students from 50 universities around the
country. It said in a statement that the purpose of the rally was
to ``crush the wall of mistrust'' between the American and Iranian
people, a phrase used by Khatami in his campaign to end Iran's
isolation.
	   Although the group said it would not burn the American flag _
instead it set fire to an effigy of Uncle Sam _ demonstrators did
shout slogans against the United States twice.
	   ``Death to the Great Satan, America!'' the crowd shouted. But
the old fervor was gone and the chant was unemotional.
	   Asgharzadeh, bespectacled and wearing a gray suit without a tie,
said Khatami should not open direct talks with the United States as
long as American forces were in the Persian Gulf.
	   But he tried to show the world the new and gentler face of the
former captors.
	   ``We have a new language for the world. ... We defend human
rights and we will try to make Islam such that it will not
contradict with democracy,'' he said.
	   ``We have been wronged. We are not terrorists,'' he added.
	   Most of the demonstrators said they were not against the taking
of the U.S. Embassy. But all interviewed agreed that times have
changed.
	   ``It was good for our independence,'' said Hassan Haji-Lari.
``At that time our country was in the hands of foreigners. But now
we need to be moderate so we can get on with building our
country.''

composer Jovelina Faria Belfort died of a heart attack Monday,
family members said. She was 54.
	   Belfort, known as Black Pearl, did not make her first record
until the age of 40 but quickly produced seven more.
	   The most succesful were: ``Jovelina'' and ``Big Smile''
(``Sorriso Aberto''), recorded in 1985 and 1987 respectively.
	   Belfort came from a poor family and spent some of her young
working life as a cleaner.
	   Her funeral, near her home in Rio's Jacarepagua district, was
attended by hundreds of friends and fans on Monday. Belfort leaves
three sons.

Over manufacturer objections, USGA to adopt club test to limit
</HEADLINE>
distance &QL; 
 &UR; By JEFFREY GOLD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEWARK, New Jersey (AP) _ The governing body for golf in the
Unites States said Monday it will adopt a controversial test that
could make the next generation of golf clubs illegal.
	   In a related effort to limit the distance that players can drive
a golf ball, the U.S. Golf Association also said it would like to
update two methods for testing balls.
	   ``These measures will not take balls or clubs out of golfers'
bags,'' USGA executive director David Fay said, asserting that the
best players will be affected the most, not average players.
	   Club manufacturers, however, have maintained the new test for
clubs is not needed because the current crop of high-tech drivers
has not changed the game, despite the hoopla surrounding ultra-long
hitters such as Tiger Woods and John Daly.
	   These ``metal woods,'' which cost up to dlrs 500, have been
embraced by many of America's 25 million golfers and are credited
for sharply increasing club sales, to dlrs 1.7 billion wholesale in
1997.
	   The manufacturers also maintained the test stifles innovation,
is technically flawed and doesn't measure how balls are really
struck.
	   At a September forum near the USGA's Far Hills headquarters,
they also left little doubt that unless the association withdrew
its proposal they would sue, presenting a challenge to its
rule-making authority in this nation on par with the Casey Martin
cart case.
	   ``We are disappointed that the USGA is moving forward on this
issue, and cannot comment further until we receive the details,''
said John A. Solheim, president of Karsten Manufacturing Corp.,
maker of Ping golf clubs.
	   Fay said the USGA staff and outside experts considered the
manufacturers' critiques of the club-testing procedure and
concluded the test is scientifically valid.
	   The test was proposed to determine whether clubs violated a
provision added to The Rules of Golf in 1984 that barred clubheads
from having a ``spring-like'' effect, which could propel a ball
farther.
	   Current clubs, some designed by onetime rocket scientists and
aerospace engineers, use lightweight graphite shafts and titanium
to provide a forgiving, oversized clubhead on a longer stick that
makes it easier for players hit the ball farther and straighter.
	   Fay said the test was developed because the USGA opposed ``added
distance resulting solely from enhancements in equipment with no
improvement in the skill level of a player.''
	   ``If history tells us anything, it is that added distance
inevitably will lead to longer golf courses, escalating costs, and
slower play,'' Fay said.
	   The USGA executive committee unanimously approved the measures
on testing clubs and balls Saturday during its meeting in Far
Hills, Fay said. Thirteen of the 16 members attended, and one of
the absent members voted by proxy, he said.
	   Clubs that do not conform to ``The Rules of Golf,'' published by
the USGA and its European counterpart, The Royal and Ancient Golf
Club of St. Andrews, Scotland, cannot be used by pro or amateur
golfers in competition. Fay did not know if the R and A intends to
incorporate the tests, since rules on clubs and balls can be
considered independently, but said he hopes it does.

	   CHINANDEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Overwhelmed by death and chaos,
Central American officials on Monday estimated more than 7,000
people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Hurricane Mitch.
	   As Nicaraguan officials here struggled to account for 1,500
people feared buried by a mudslide, Honduran President Carlos
Flores Facusse de Honduras made an emotional appeal for
international aid and announced he was suspending constitutional
liberties to combat looting.
	   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' the president said in a nationally broadcast speech.
``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.''
	   ``I ask the international community for human solidarity,'' he
said.
	   And the same was true across the border in Nicaragua. As many as
1,500 people were buried near this northwestern town when the
crater lake of the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud
and debris onto villages below.
	   ``It looked like a line of helicopters flying really low and
coming at us. You could see houses, trees, everything being
covered,'' said Ricardo Antonio Garcia, a 23-year-old farmer whose
leg was amputated after being crushed in the mudslide.
	   Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said the slide
apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people and that some 600 other
people died elsewhere in the country.
	   ``We perhaps will never know how many people died,'' he said.
	   In neighboring Honduras, ``more than 5,000 people'' probably
died, Dimas Alonzo, operations chief for the National Emergency
Committee, told a local radio station. He said the exact number
would never be known.
	   Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after
Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25
inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before
dissipating Monday in southern Mexico.
	   Flores Facusse said ``the floods and landslides erased from the
map many villages and households as well as whole neighborhoods of
cities.
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin
throughout the national territory,'' the president said.
	   He announced a ``state of exception'' suspending constitutional
liberties to help officials fight looting and vandalism.
	   AP photographer Victor Caivano, who visited Guanaja, said only
10 of the 146 houses in the town of Mangrove Bight there survived
the storm, which hovered over the island for two days. The island,
where flowers once abounded, was a desolate gray, with naked sticks
of trees jutting out of the mud.

Jets and first place: It just doesn't sound right
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HEMPSTEAD, New York (AP) _ The first-place Jets. It just doesn't
sound right.
	   It will sound even more incongruous if the phrase fits on Dec.
27. Only one team hasn't won as much as a division title since the
1970 American Football League-National Football League merger.
That's right, the Jets.
	   On Monday, following a last-second 20-17 victory at Kansas City,
the Jets stood tied with Miami, New England and Buffalo atop the
AFC East. If it seems proper to find the Dolphins, Patriots and
Bills leading the division, well, it should. They've dominated over
the years.
	   Even the Colts have finished first in the division. But the Jets
_ sorry.
	   ``It's not fair to judge us by old Jets teams with different
coaches,'' said linebacker Bryan Cox, who got a close-up look at
the old Jets _ often known as the ``Same Old Jets'' _ while playing
five seasons in Miami. ``Year to year, it changes, so you can't
stereotype the team. The players or the circumstances change each
year.''
	   Actually, their 5-3 record halfway through the season isn't much
of a change for the Jets, who also were 5-3 a year ago, Bill
Parcells' first season as coach. The current record, however, was
built much differently.
	   ``This is a better team overall,'' a subdued Parcells said a day
after his most impressive victory as Jets coach. ``We have some
better players, we are playing a harder schedule.
	   ``Some areas we are not quite as good in: special teams and punt
returns. But overall, I am more confident in the defense, although
we did play well at the end of last year. And offensively, we have
more weapons.''
	   What these Jets have, thanks to a three-game winning streak and
five victories in six weeks, is more confidence than, well, perhaps
since the days of Joe Namath.
	   Their last two road games were at New England and Kansas City,
1997 division winners and considered among the elite of the AFC for
1998. New York won both of them, making dozens of clutch plays.
	   The Jets' division record is 3-0 heading into Sunday's home game
with the Bills. After that comes a visit to Indianapolis, the only
weak link in the AFC East.
	   ``If we continue to play good football like the last three
weeks,'' receiver Keyshawn Johnson said, ``I think we can do
something. I think we are a tough team that is going to fight until
the end.
	   ``We have veteran leadership here. We've got playmakers all
around them. We're very confident and poised in the huddle. We have
the opportunity to go somewhere if we just continue like this. If
we can get by Buffalo and Indy, you might start to see something
special.''
	   New York survived in the wind and rain of Arrowhead Stadium by
making special plays on a day when the elements and the Chiefs
defense took away such weapons as Johnson (one catch) and Curtis
Martin (30 rushes for 42 yards, worst outing of his career). Those
plays were made sporadically in '97, when the Jets lost three of
their last four to barely miss the playoffs at 9-7. They are coming
more often this year.
	   ``It shows the character of this team,'' resurrected quarterback
Vinny Testaverde said, ``to be able to go on the road in a tough
environment and bad conditions and be able to pull out a win in the
last seconds. We have a lot of heart on this team that is showing
up on Sundays.''

	   MANGROVE BIGHT, Honduras (AP) _ Most of the houses on stilts
looking out at the sea from Guanaja Island are no more.
	   Just 10 of 146 wooden houses barely still stand, ripped apart
last week by the winds and waves when Mitch was still one of the
strongest hurricanes to cross the Caribbean.
	   ``This island used to be the most beautiful of the Bay
Islands,'' Mayor Sherral Hawlock said Monday. ``Now everything is
gone.''
	   Six people were killed here when Mitch barreled through, wiping
out even the brightly colored flowers and greenery that once
covered this smooth island, leaving behind a barren landscape with
naked sticks poking out of the hills.
	   Most people were saved when they fled their homes to wait out
the storm in a protected canyon which runs across the island.
	   Many, including Octavila Paz, were in church when the storm
began picking up. The pastor organized everyone at Sunday services
and led them to safety.
	   For 48 hours, Paz and her four children and all the others
waited as the storm's eye hovered over the island. When the winds
had passed, they returned to the village to find their homes and
businesses gone.
	   For Paz, it was a grocery store she had built up over 15 years.
``Now I am wondering what we are going to do,'' she said.
	   Elia de Johnson, 45, came back to find that all she had left was
a mattress.
	   From Tuesday until the weekend, they lived without food or
water. With their boats destroyed, they couldn't even go fishing.
	   Finally help began arriving Saturday, then more on Sunday.
	   Cayman Bay Island Relief, a non-profit group from the Cayman
Islands, showed up with food, water, medical supplies and a team of
35 that included doctors and construction workers.
	   Also, the British frigate HMS Sheffield arrived with a
260-member crew and a helicopter that began assessing damage to the
various towns on Sunday morning. The only way to get from one town
to another is still by boat or helicopter.
	   The British crew also has provided a medical team and a group of
engineers who will work on restoring electricity to the island.
	   Elsewhere on Guanaja Island, the luxury resort of Posada del Sol
suffered estimated damages of dlrs 4 million.
	   Trapped in a hotel room there for 36 hours while Hurricane Mitch
destroyed almost everything around him, Jeremy Butler could only
marvel at the awesome noise.
	   As the last of the Posada del Sol guests finally left Honduras
Monday, they told of their experiences trapped right under one of
the worst hurricanes in memory.
	   ``What it sounds like is an incredible shrieking, a high
shrieking noise, but at the same time there's a noise like a
freight train going by or thunder,'' Butler said in the nation's
capital of Tegucigalpa. ``Or a 747 taking off.''
	   The marina, gym, the boats, are all gone, said the resort's
marketing director, Carla Flores Gomez de Matute.
	   ``It'll probably take six months to repair all the damage,'' she
said.
	   Considering they were right under a storm whose wind speeds had
reached 180 mph (290 kph) and that would eventually kill thousands
of people in Central America, the tourists at the Posada del Sol
were lucky.
	   Their building was made of sturdy concrete, they had food, water
and camaraderie. Among the guests were public works employees from
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who kept the electrical generator
operating.
	   By Thursday morning, they finally got out. What they found had
little semblance to the picturesque island they had remembered.
	   ``You couldn't walk because of all the clutter,'' said Marvin
Stahl of Waskom, Texas, who was on a dlrs 3,000 diving vacation
with his wife, Gloria. ``Tree limbs, the tiles from the resort were
all just thrown all over the place.''
	   ``I've never seen anything like it before. There is no foliage
on the island _ every tree, all the limbs are gone, all the leaves
are gone.''
	   As he headed to Tegucigalpa's airport early Monday, Stahl talked
of the need to help the island's 5,000 residents.
	   ``They need food,'' said Stahl, ``they need water, they need
medical care.''

Police kill two militants in shootout

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police Monday shot and killed two Islamic
militants wanted for a series of attacks that left 60 policemen and
civilians dead or injured, a police official said.
	   Two policemen were wounded in the shootout with the militants,
the official said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   The gunbattle began after police surrounded a house in which the
militants had taken shelter near the village of Galal in the
southern province of Minya, 190 kilometers (120 miles) south of
Cairo.
	   Police identified the slain militants as Mohammed Sayed Riyad,
30, and Nadi Younis Abdel-Atheem, 23.
	   Riyad is wanted for 22 attacks which resulted in the death or
injury of 40 policemen and civilians.
	   Abdel-Atheem is wanted for 10 attacks that killed or injured 20
police and civilians, the official said.
	   Muslim extremists have waged a campaign since 1992 to try to
overthrow Egypt's secular government and replace it with Islamic
rule. Their targets have included Coptic Christians, foreign
tourists and police.
	   Some 1,250 people have died in the violence, most of them police
and extremists.

Attack underscores rebel might ahead of Colombian peace talks

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with troop advance on besieged

envoy. CHANGES byline, no pick up &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Soldiers and elite police trudged on
foot through dense Colombian jungle Monday, trying to reach the
site of a weekend rebel attack where dozens of police officers were
feared dead.
	   Authorities have been unable to confirm reports that as many as
60 officers were killed in the 12-hour assault on a frontier police
post by an estimated 800 leftist guerrillas, who fired homemade
missiles from modified propane gas cylinders.
	   The assault Sunday in Mitu, the remote capital of southeastern
Vaupes state, near the border with Brazil, appeared to underscore
the guerrillas' growing military might in the runup to peace talks
with President Andres Pastrana to end Colombia's 34-year civil war.
	   Pastrana has promised to withdraw all troops from a large
southern region by Saturday to allow peace talks with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, whose guerrillas have been
piling up victories against ineffective and dispirited army troops.
	   The president, who was headed back to Bogota Monday evening
after cutting short a state visit to Venezuela, had yet to make any
statements about the rebel attack.
	   His peace envoy condemned the attack, but insisted that Pastrana
still planned to personally attend the opening of the peace talks,
planned for the coming weeks in the 16,200 square-mile area where
the army is pulling out.
	   ``It's regrettable that at a time when we're promoting peace
these kinds of actions occur, because instead of acts of war, what
Colombia needs are acts of peace,'' the envoy, Victor G. Ricardo,
said in a television interview.
	   It was feared some of the police officers may have been taken
prisoner by the rebels, who have held at least 248 police and
soldiers seized in battles during the past two years.
	   Pastrana has so far refused a guerrilla proposal to exchange the
men for 452 jailed rebels before peace talks begin.
	   The 200 troops advancing Monday toward Mitu were dropped by
helicopter about six miles from the town of 15,000 inhabitants, and
were proceeding carefully to avoid possible rebel counterattacks,
police said.
	   ``We know that there are ambushes and we know they are waiting
to confront our people,'' the police second-in-command, Gen. Luis
Ernesto Gilibert, told a news conference Monday. ``We have no
knowledge of what happened in the fighting, how many wounded and
how many dead we have.''
	   In their last radio contact at 2 p.m. Sunday, the 120-man police
garrison reported four officers killed and nine wounded.
	   The jungle town _ normally accessible only by air and water _
was cut off from communications when the rebels seized control of
the airport and blew up the phone company's microwave tower.
	   The guerrillas have not commented on the attack, which would be
the largest since an August offensive where 143 police and soldiers
were killed and 130 taken prisoner.

	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ A joint venture
between Amerada Hess Corp. and the Venezuela National Petroleum Co.

Supreme Court orders councils to accept Reform, Conservative
</HEADLINE>
members &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a ruling intended to ease the Orthodox
monopoly over local religious services, the Israeli Supreme Court
on Monday ordered religious councils in three cities to accept
Reform and Conservative candidates as members.
	   Reform leader Rabbi Uri Regev hailed the decision as a
``landmark victory for religious pluralism,'' but warned that the
battle for acceptance of Judaism's more liberal streams was far
from over.
	   The Supreme Court ordered Religious Affairs Minister Eli Suissa,
a member of an Orthodox Jewish political party, to recognize Reform
and Conservative candidates who were elected to the local religious
councils as full members by publishing their names on a revised
membership list within two weeks. Whether or not the lists are
published however, the Conservative and Reform members will
automatically become part of the councils.
	   ``After years of one delay after another, the court has finally
put its foot down with a concrete and binding ruling, a breach of
which will constitute contempt of court,'' Regev said.
	   The court also ordered the government to pay the petitioners'
court costs.
	   Regev warned, however, that he did not expect the religious
ministry to comply with the court's decision.
	   Spokesmen for the religious affairs ministry and the prime
minister's office were not immediately available for comment.
	   Reform and Conservative activists have spent years in court
fighting for acceptance. Although most Israeli Jews are not
observant, the Orthodox have control over marriage, divorce and
burial, as well as conversions. The two liberal movements are
currently fighting in the courts for the right to have their
conversions recognized in Israel by the controlling Orthodox
rabbinical council.
	   In the past, Orthodox officials have disobeyed court orders to
allow Reform and Conservative members to serve on religious
councils, and have forcibly removed elected officials from council
meetings.
	   Ehud Bandel, the president of the Conservative movement in
Israel, expressed hope that joint membership at religious councils
would soften Orthodox opposition to alternative branches of
Judaism.
	   ``I hope that they'll see at the meetings that our goals are to
advance religious services for the entire public,'' Bandel said.
``We're not, God forbid, against the Orthodox.''

Spice Girls go for record third Christmas No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls are counting on having their third
consecutive Christmas No. 1 single in Britain, but they don't want
people to read anything into the title of the new song _
``Goodbye.''
	   After a tumultuous year that saw Ginger Spice Geri Halliwell
depart the group and two other members announce their pregnancies,
the British pop queens are trying to stop rumors about a split
before they start.
	   ``Although the song is called, 'Goodbye,' the chorus is actually
'goodbye my friend, it's not the end,' '' said Melanie Brown, aka
Scary Spice. ``So for all those people who think we're breaking up,
we're not! It's a very sentimental song, and it means a lot to us.
It's about everything that happened this year, with Geri leaving
then being strong.''
	   Brown and Posh Spice Victoria Adams both are expecting babies
early next year. The group, which has sold 40 million albums
worldwide, also includes Sporty Spice Melanie Chisholm and Baby
Spice Emma Bunton.
	   ``Goodbye,'' written and recorded during the group's American
tour last summer, will be released Dec. 14. The Spice Girls hit No.
1 at Christmas last year with ``Too Much,'' and in 1996 with ``2
Becomes 1.''

Nurse sentence to 10-years in prison for injecting patients with
</HEADLINE>
poison &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A nurse accused of injecting 30 patients
with poison was sentenced on Monday to 10 years of hard labor by a
court retrying her case, police officials said.
	   Aida Nur el-Din was first sentenced to death on March 31 on one
charge of premeditated murder.
	   An appeals court in July ordered a retrial on grounds that the
trial court had failed to show that she had intended to kill the
patient.
	   The Alexandria Criminal Court found her guilty Monday of one
count of manslaughter and 13 counts of unintentional injury.
	   Another 16 counts, for which she had been tried and originally
convicted, were dropped because she did not inject the patients,
the official said, citing the court's decision.
	   Along with the prison term, Nur el-Din has to pay 3.15 pounds
(dlrs 0.98) to the Alexandria University hospital where she worked
as restitution for the cost of the medication used when she
injected the patients, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. She was also fined 500 Egyptian pounds (dlrs 147).
	   Nur el-Din's case received wide attention in Egypt after she
fell from the third story of a police station while being led to an
interrogation room following her arrest.
	   The 25-year-old nurse has said she was framed by hospital
officials trying to cover their own negligence.
	   The allegations provided grist to critics of the poor working
and health standards at government hospitals, and renewed
allegations by nurses nationwide that they are overworked,
underpaid and abused by doctors.

Iraq's UN envoy blames Washington for precipitating crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES throughout with interview with Iraq's
ambassador to the United Nations; Adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq's U.N. ambassador blamed the United
States Monday for forcing Iraq to stop cooperating with arms
inspectors by blocking any reference to lifting sanctions in a
review of Iraqi compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Nizar Hamdoon said Iraq still wants a ``comprehensive review''
which offers the prospect that crippling economic sanctions will be
lifted or eased if the Security Council finds that it has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``I think the ball is in the Security Council and the secretary
general's court,'' he said in an interview with The Associated
Press and Dow Jones Newswires.
	   His comments came as Security Council members begin discussions
on a draft resolution that would reiterate in a legally binding
document the council's demand that Iraq reverse its decision.
	   The sticking point, council sources said, would be whether the
council would simply repeat its statement Saturday that Iraq was in
flagrant violation of U.N. resolutions or was in ``material
breach'' of the resolutions _ language that could give the United
States and its allies the green light for military action.
	   The Security Council sent a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday outlining the framework of a ``comprehensive
review'' of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   But the letter did not meet Iraq's demand that a review should
mention the possibility of lifting sanctions. And when Baghdad
received ``the political message'' that the United States was
responsible for blocking any reference, it responded by banning all
dealings with U.N. weapons inspectors, Hamdoon said.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton on Monday pointedly left open the
possibility of a military response. He predicted that Iraq's
decision to stop all cooperation with arms inspectors will backfire
by stiffening the international community's resolve to compel Iraqi
disarmament.
	   The Iraqi ambassador called on the secretary-general to become
personally involved.
	   ``The ball right now should be in the secretary-general's court
because he is the man who has the trust of Iraq, and he should be
also the man who has the trust of the Security Council,'' Hamdoon
said.
	   Annan played a key role in defusing the last major crisis with
Iraq, which flared in February when the Iraqis refused to let
inspectors enter Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's palaces and other
sensitive sites. Annan flew to Baghdad and reached an agreement
with the Iraqis allowing inspections to resume.
	   But Annan's spokesman Fred Eckhard stressed that Annan would
follow the Security Council's instructions in trying to resolve the
current crisis.
	   ``It is primarily the council's responsibility,'' he said. ``He
does not see it as a matter of his credibility.''
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler called the crisis
with Iraq the most serious ever because Baghdad is directly
confronting the U.N. Security Council and banning monitoring of its
weapons sites.
	   ``I think that's what makes this the worst confrontation by Iraq
with the Security Council that we've yet seen,'' he said in an
interview on NBC's Today show.
	   Annan met Butler Monday and was told that technicians from the
U.N. Special Commission, which is charged with eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, were being allowed to maintain
surveillance equipment.
	   ``But this in no way constitutes an adequate monitoring
function, so monitoring activities are effectively blocked,''
Eckhard said.
	   The secretary-general also met U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott and held consultations with council members.
	   Annan called Iraq's announcement Saturday that it was cutting
off all dealings with U.N. weapons inspectors ``a total breach of
Security Council resolutions,'' and noted the council's demand that
Baghdad resume cooperation immediately.
	   ``I think the council as a whole has spoken very clearly and
they are going to remain engaged,'' Annan said.
	   Butler said the decision on whether to use force against Iraq is
up to the 15-member Security Council _ not just the United States,
which has said it will consider air strikes if Saddam doesn't back
down.
	   ``The Council has made binding international law. Iraq has to be
disarmed under that law,'' he said. ``If it refuses to comply and
do the things required _ and that's what we appear to have on our
hands now _ the council, of course, has to consider what steps it
will take to see that that law is enforced.''
	   Council members were meeting individually Monday with the new
council president, acting U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh. The full
council was unlikely to meet before Tuesday.

 &UR; Excerpts from four U.S. letters of assurances to Israel &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The following are excerpts from three letters
of assurances written to Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh and
signed by U.S. Ambassador to Israel Edward S. Walker Jr.
	   One letter is signed by U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross. The
letters, made public Monday by the Israeli government, are an
accompaniment to the Wye River Memorandum signed between Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at the White House on Oct. 23, 1998.
	   On a third Israeli redeployment:
	   _ On October 29, 1998 ``The U.S. made clear to both parties that
it will not adopt any position or express any view about the size
or the content of the third phase of Israel's further redeployment
...''
	   Palestinian statehood:
	   _ ``As regards to the possibility of a unilateral declaration of
statehood or other unilateral actions by either party outside the
negotiating process that prejudge or predetermine the outcome of
those negotiations, the U.S. opposes and will oppose any such
unilateral actions.''
	   The Palestinian charter:
	   _ ``The Wye River agreement specifies that the members of the
PNC (Palestine National Council) as well as the members of the PLO
Central Council, the Palestinian Council and the Heads of
Palestinian Ministries will be invited to a meeting which President
Clinton will attend.''
	   ``The purpose of this meeting of the PNC and other PLO
organizations is to reaffirm Chairman Arafat's January 22 letter to
President Clinton nullifying each of the Charter's provisions that
are inconsistent with the PLO's commitments to renounce terror and
to recognize and live in peace with Israel.''
	   ``This process of reaffirmation will make clear, once and for
all, that the provisions of the PLO charter that call for the
destruction of Israel are null and void.''
	   Permanent Status negotiations:
	   _''The U.S. is highly sensitive to the vital importance of the
permanent status issues to Israel's future. We recognize that the
security of the State of Israel and the Israeli public is at stake,
and the U.S. commitment to Israel's security remains ironclad.''
	   Israeli security:
	   _ ``Only Israel can determine its own security needs and decide
what solutions will be satisfactory.''
	   Arrest and trial of Palestinian militants by Palestinian
security:
	   _ ``We have had discussions with the Palestinians and they have
given us a firm commitment that there will be no `revolving
door'.''
	   Reduction of Palestinian police force, from the letter written
by U.S. envoy Dennis Ross:
	   _ ``The U.S. has been assured that it will receive all
appropriate information concerning current and former policemen as
part of our assistance program. It is also our understanding that
it was agreed by the two sides that the total number of Palestinian
Policemen would not exceed 30,000.''

monopoly over local religious services, the Israeli Supreme Court
on Monday ordered religious councils in three cities to accept
Reform and Conservative candidates as members.
	   Reform leader Rabbi Uri Regev hailed the decision as a
``landmark victory for religious pluralism,'' but warned that the
battle for acceptance of Judaism's more liberal streams was far
from over.
	   The Supreme Court ordered Religious Affairs Minister Eli Suissa,
a member of an Orthodox Jewish political party, to recognize Reform
and Conservative candidates who were elected to the local religious
councils as full members by publishing their names on a revised
membership list within two weeks. Whether or not the lists are
published however, the Conservative and Reform members will
automatically become part of the councils.
	   ``After years of one delay after another, the court has finally
put its foot down with a concrete and binding ruling, a breach of
which will constitute contempt of court,'' Regev said.
	   The court also ordered the government to pay the petitioners'
court costs.
	   Regev warned, however, that he did not expect the religious
ministry to comply with the court's decision.
	   Spokesmen for the religious affairs ministry and the prime
minister's office were not immediately available for comment.
	   Reform and Conservative activists have spent years in court
fighting for acceptance.
	   Although most Israeli Jews are not observant, the Orthodox have
control over marriage, divorce and burial, as well as conversions.
The two liberal movements are currently fighting for the right to
have their conversions recognized in Israel by the controlling
Orthodox rabbinical council.
	   In the past, Orthodox officials have disobeyed court orders to
allow Reform and Conservative members to serve on religious
councils, and have forcibly removed elected officials from council
meetings.
	   Ehud Bandel, the president of the Conservative movement in
Israel, expressed hope that joint membership at religious councils
would soften Orthodox opposition to alternative branches of
Judaism.
	   ``I hope that they'll see at the meetings that our goals are to
advance religious services for the entire public,'' Bandel said.
``We're not, God forbid, against the Orthodox.''

FDA approves genetically engineered drug for rheumatoid arthritis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURAN NEERGAARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ A genetically engineered drug won government
approval Monday to help some of the hardest-to-treat sufferers of
rheumatoid arthritis.
	   Immunex Corp.'s Enbrel can fight debilitating symptoms in
advanced rheumatoid arthritis patients _ and appears to cause fewer
serious side effects than older therapies.
	   Enbrel illustrates ``how the promises of biotechnology are being
fulfilled,'' said Food and Drug Administration Acting Commissioner
Michael Friedman. ``For some patients ... this product can
significantly reduce pain and swollen joints that have restricted
their normal daily activities for years.''
	   Enbrel is a ``major advance,'' said Dr. Michael Weinblatt of
Harvard University, who helped test the drug. ``This is the first
in a group of genetically cloned materials that have a targeted
mechanism of action,'' attacking rheumatoid arthritis in a way no
other medicine ever has.
	   Immunex said Enbrel, known chemically as etanercept, will be on
pharmacy shelves within days. Patients require injections of the
drug twice weekly, costing about dlrs 220 a week.
	   Enbrel does not cure rheumatoid arthritis; patients who stopped
taking it saw their disease immediately rebound.
	   But in a study of 234 patients with advanced disease, 59 percent
who took Enbrel for six months improved significantly, compared
with 11 percent who received dummy injections. More dramatically,
about 40 percent of Enbrel patients saw their disease symptoms cut
in half.
	   Adding Enbrel to standard treatment, the drug methotrexate,
worked better, helping 71 percent of patients who took both drugs,
compared with just 27 percent who took methotrexate alone.
	   Six years of rheumatoid arthritis had left Beckie Wilson of
Dallas unable to dress without help, in too much pain to play with
her two young children, even with problems brushing her teeth. She
joined a study of Enbrel two years ago, and within a month noticed
less-swollen joints.
	   Now, ``I am normal,'' said Wilson, who today exercises regularly
and has stopped taking most arthritis painkillers. ``Yesterday I
was riding bikes in the park with my daughter. It's been a definite
change in my life.''
	   Rheumatoid arthritis afflicts more than 2 million Americans.
This is not the type of arthritis common in the elderly because of
the wear-and-tear of aging. Instead, rheumatoid arthritis occurs
when patients' immune systems go awry and attack their joints,
causing inflammation and stiffness as rogue immune cells eat away
cartilage and eventually erode bone.
	   It mostly strikes women, usually between ages 25 and 50. Within
10 years, about half the patients are too disabled to work.
	   Today's best treatment is methotrexate, which attacks certain
immune cells responsible for much of the inflammation of rheumatoid
arthritis. It works well for many patients, but also causes
troublesome side effects, including diarrhea and occasional liver
toxicity.
	   Enbrel works very differently. It targets tumor necrosis factor,
or TNF, an immune system protein that also causes rheumatoid
inflammation.
	   Enbrel is a genetically engineered copy of a cell ``receptor,''
the spot where TNF normally hooks onto cells to do its damage. When
Enbrel is injected, it literally sops up excess TNF in patients'
blood before the substance can make its way to joints to do damage.
	   It appears to cause few serious side effects. About 37 percent
of patients suffered generally mild injection site reactions, such
as itching. The FDA did, however, tell Immunex to study Enbrel's
long-term effects, in case it affects the immune system enough to
increase patients' risk of infections or possibly even cancer.
	   The FDA approved Enbrel for adults, but noted that a small study
of 54 children ages 4 to 17 suggests it may offer equal help in
fighting juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, too. Immunex is completing
additional studies to prove that effect.
	   Enbrel is the latest in a sudden surge of promising new options
to treat rheumatoid arthritis: FDA approved Arava in September, a
chemical that works similarly to methotrexate; study results of
Centocor Inc.'s Remicade are due this month; and FDA's advisers
last week recommended approving a blood-filtering machine for
severe rheumatoid patients.
	   ``This is a good time to be a patient with rheumatoid
arthritis,'' said Weinblatt, advising patients to seek care from a
specialist familiar with the new therapies.

Iraq says U.S., Israel infiltrated U.N. inspection team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Baghdad on Monday accused the United States
and Israel of sending agents into Iraq as part of the U.N.
inspection teams.
	   In a speech to parliament, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf read out the names of four Israelis he said ``were
planted in the ... (U.N.) Special Commission and entered Iraq under
false names and passports.''
	   Iraq often accuses the inspectors of espionage and has said that
U.S. and Israeli intelligence agencies dominate the Special
Commission.
	   Al-Sahhaf's speech was broadcast on Iraqi television and
monitored in Cairo.
	   His remarks come amid Iraq's decision to end cooperation with
the U.N. monitors.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq's programs to build
weapons of mass destruction have been dismantled before crushing
U.N. economic sanctions can be removed.
	   Al-Sahhaf also said the United States and Israel have recruited
citizens of other nationalities, including Australians and Swedes
working as inspectors.

President suspends constitutional rights as death estimates soar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; By FREDDY CUEVAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Saying ``there are corpses
everywhere,'' President Carlos Flores Facusse on Monday suspended
constitutional rights to fight growing looting and appealed for
international help.
	   Officials estimated that at least 5,000 people had died and at
least 600,000 _ 10 percent of the nation's population _ had been
forced to flee their homes.
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin in
all of the national territory,'' the president said in a nationally
broadcast speech following the five-day passage of Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of the landslides or of
the waters,'' Flores Facusse said.
	   ``The most conservative calculations estimate the number of
deaths in the thousands,'' he said. ``And the number of deaths will
rise as we manage to reach isolated places.''
	   Dimas Alonzo, operations chief for the National Emergency
Committee, earlier estimated that ``more than 5,000 people'' had
died in Honduras in addition to hundreds, perhaps thousands in
Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala.
	   ``The floods and landslides erased from the map many villages
and households as well as whole neighborhoods of cities,'' Flores
Facusse announced.
	   He said many of the people isolated by the floods had remained
trapped on the roofs of their houses for five days awaiting rescue
that had not yet come.
	   In an already poor nation, ``Seventy percent of agriculture has
been lost,'' the president said. ``The great plantations of banana,
melon, coffee, watermelon ... and export other products no longer
exist.''
	   ``Honduras is mortally wounded, but do not agonize,'' he said.
``With the aid of other countries we will move forward with the
energy of our people.
	   ``To the international community, I ask for human solidarity,''
he said.
	   With looting a growing problem, the president announced he was
declaring a nighttime curfew and a ``state of exception'' _
equivalent to a state of siege _ which lifts constitutional limits
on searches, seizures, arrests and detentions for 15 days.
	   He called on authorities to ``act without thinking twice''
against looters. In the capital, some looters have been dressed in
military-type uniforms _ adding to the misery of people of this
city of 800,000, where long lines formed Monday outside bakeries
and gasoline stations.
	   David Wernet of Springfield, Massachusetts, who is attending
college in Tegucigalpa, said he watched from his window as thieves
stole at will.
	   ``You could see the same people come back four or five times,''
he said.
	   But there were also acts of compassion.
	   Local residents distributed thousands of meals to victims over
the weekend, some of them handled by foreign volunteers who found
themselves stranded in Tegucigalpa.
	   Twenty-one volunteers from the Tarrytown United Methodist Church
in Austin, Texas, were building a library in northern Honduras when
the storm forced them to evacuate.
	   ``If we hadn't been helping, we'd just be sitting around,'' said
Robert Durkee, one of the group's leaders.
	   While the president called for Hondurans to endure, many wept as
they took stock of the disaster.
	   Edna Elizabeth Sanchez and her family had fled their house on
Friday as the Choluteca River slipped its banks and spread through
much of the capital.
	   They returned Sunday to see what could be saved. They found a
lot of sand, a few bricks and a rusty tin roof panel.
	   ``Here exactly was my house. There's nothing left,'' she said.

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A plane crash in western Guatemala blamed
on the remnants of Hurricane Mitch killed 11 people, 10 of them
Americans, and injured another seven U.S. citizens, physicians said
Monday.
	   The crash Sunday of the C-47 cargo plane operated by the Living
Water Teaching Mission may have been caused by bad weather and the
lack of radar facilities, airport officials in Guatemala said.
	   The seven Americans injured were taken to a private hospital in
Quetzaltenango. Their injuries were not serious, said Francis
Canett Samayoa, a Guatemalan physician and member of the mission
who was not on the plane.
	   News of the crash reached the U.S. home churches of some of the
victims on Sunday. They were on an aid mission to distribute
medicines and medical care in the poverty-stricken northern
province of Quiche, Guatemala.
	   The crash occurred near the town of San Andreas Xecul, 60 miles
(100 kms) west of Guatemala City as the flight was pelted by rain
from former Hurricane Mitch, by then a tropical depression.
	   The mission left a week ago for the remote town of Playa Grande,
Quiche, 80 miles (120 kms) north of Guatemala City, and crashed
while trying to return Sunday.
	   Bill Mickler, pastor of the Victory Christian Center, a
nondenominational charismatic church in Lafayette, Indiana,
confirmed the death of Indiana missionary Melvin Hughes, 57.
	   He said a second member of his church, 18-year-old Ross Douglas
of Lafayette, was injured.
	   Physicians at the Jose Felipe Flores Hospital in Guatemala said
the other dead included James Zircle and his son, James Zircle Jr.,
Thomas Vander Pool, Susan Aldridge, Dale Graff, Willard Granger,
Kevin Brittian, John Ronald Bryson and Christopher Brian Hanbirger.
	   No home towns or states were immediately available for those
victims.
	   Also killed was the mission's Guatemalan pilot, Raul Emilio
Jacobs Weller, 48.
	   The injured were listed as Erica Brittian, 33; Sharon Malone,
32; Allen Dudan, 50; John Eperson, 40; Christian Bucker, 36; Sean
Edwards and Ross Douglas. They were being cared for at a private
hospital in Quetzaltenango, 70 miles (110 kms) west of Guatemala
City.
	   The Living Water _ ``Agua Viva'' in Spanish _ is jointly
headquartered in Coral Mills, Texas, and in Quetzaltenango. It has
worked in Central America for 20 years.
	   The deaths are among 100 caused by Mitch in Guatemala, which has
suffered flooding and mudslides. Officials have said the death
count may exceed 7,000 in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El
Salvador.

Hunt for Argentine championship down to two teams; Brazil's
</HEADLINE>
Corinthians keeps winning &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The hunt to capture Argentina's
national soccer championship is coming down to two teams: Boca
Juniors and Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata.
	   With 31 points, Boca holds a slim four point advantage over
Gimnasia, but Maradona's old club team is showing no signs they're
looking over their shoulder.
	   Boca blanked a visiting Estudiantes 3-0 Sunday amid fans
cheering and singing that the championship was imminent. After
struggling last week, Martin Palermo returned as Boca's preeminent
offensive threat.
	   He scored on a penalty kick in the 14th minute and fed Fernando
Navas a clever back healed pass in the game's final minute _ a play
which sent the boisterous crowd rushing forward in the stands.
	   Looking to catch Boca during the season's remaining six games,
Gimnasia played to a important 3-2 win over River Plate Saturday.
	   Brazil's Corinthians managed to keep its lead in the standings
with a 3-2 victory over Vitoria. However, Corinthians coach,
Wanderely Luxemburgo, had difficulty keeping his cool.
	   Luxemburgo was ordered off the field near the end of the first
half after he protested what he claimed was a missed call by one of
the referees, Claudio Vinicius Cedeira.
	   Cedeira later drew the ire of Vitoria fans, who threw rubbish
and pored onto the field after a controversial penalty kick was
awarded to Corinthians. The melee forced the game to be suspended
for 10 minutes.
	   Palmeiras and Santos _ the teams nipping at the heels of
Corinthians in the standings _ all kept up pressure on the leaders
with weekend victories. Palmeiras defeated Parana 3-2 and Santos
downed Goias 3-1.
	   Both teams, based in Sao Paulo, are just two points behind
Corinthians.
	   Meanwhile, Flamengo kept alive hopes of winning one of the two
places up for grabs in the second phase of the championship with a
2-0 win over America-MG.
	   Iranildo's blast from 30 yards out helped seal the victory, but
the teenager will miss the upcoming game against Parana next week
thanks to yellow cards. He saw his third in as many weeks on
Sunday.
	   Flamengo - Brazil's most popular team _ will need a win next
week plus losses by Gremio, Aletico-MG, Vasco and Cruzeiro for an
opportunity to be one of the eight teams to advance to the next
round.
	   Chile's Colo Colo, on the strength of two goals by Marcelo
Espina, got a difficult win on the road Sunday, beating Osorno 3-0
to stay four points ahead of Universidad de Chile.
	   Universidad's Flavio Maestri matched Espina's effort, scoring
two goals in a 3-1 win over Rangers. Teammate Pedro Gonzalez, whose
18 goals make him Chile's most potent striker, helped finish off
Rangers.
	   With six games remaining, next week could prove pivotal for both
Colo Colo and Universidad.
	   Colo will face off at home with Universidad Catolica, winner of
eight straight while Universidad heads out to Valparaiso, a Chilean
coastal city, to square off with the struggling Wanderers.

forcing Krajicek to postponed minor arthroscopic knee surgery which
he had planned.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SELECTED AGAIN &QC; 
	   Lindsay Davenport is beginning to dominate the Chase Player of
the Month award. The 22-year-old Davenport won in October, an
unprecedented third consecutive month and fourth time since the
awards' inception in January 1997. Davenport reached the final in
Filderstadt, Germany, ousting Martina Hingis as No. 1 in the world
in the process, then captured the title at Zurich, Switzerland. The
monthly winner is selected by a panel of international tennis
journalists and dlrs 1,000 is donated to the winner's favorite
charity by the Chase Manhattan Bank.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SIDE BY SIDE &QC; 
	   Doubles partnerships don't get much more star-studded than the
duo that took the court at the Eurocard Open in Stuttgart, Germany.
Boris Becker and Andre Agassi have won 88 singles titles between
them, but lost in the opening round to doubles experts Sebastien
Lareau and Alex O'Brien 6-4, 4-6, 6-4. Agassi and Becker had teamed
once before, at the Paris Indoor in 1992, but they have yet to win
a match. Becker owns 15 career doubles titles and Agassi has one.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SELLOUT CROWDS &QC; 
	   Bolstered by sellout crowds over the weekend at the Seat Open in
Luxembourg and the Bell Challenge in Quebec, Canada, the Corel WTA
Tour worldwide attendance reached topped the 3.5 million mark for
the second consecutive year. ``This has been a breakthrough year
with regard to on-site attendance and worldwide popularity,'' tour
chief executive office Bart McGuire said. Over the last 10 years,
overall attendance is up 31 per cent, a rate surpassed in
professional sports by only NASCAR and the NBA in the same period.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SPECIAL TROPHY &QC; 
	   Anke Huber won the inaugural Seat Luxembourg Open before there
was a trophy. So this year, Huber was presented with a special blue
and white, 12-inch, hand-crafted crystal memento worth almost dlrs
1,500 to commemorate her victory two years ago.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; SO LONG, LEO &QC; 
	   One of Mexico's all-time great players, Leo Lavalle, retired
after last week's Mexican Open. The 31-year-old, who won one
singles titles and five doubles titles in his career, along with
reaching the 1991 Wimbledon doubles final, announced his retirement
prior to the tournament. Lavalle upset second-seeded Alberto
Berasategui 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) in the opening round before losing to
eventual champion Jiri Novak 6-3, 7-6 (7-1).
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; STILL IN COMMAND &QC; 
	   John Newcombe and Tony Roche have been reappointed captain and
coach, respectively, of Australia's Davis Cup team. The two had
been challenged because Mark Philippoussis fell out with them and
refused to play Davis Cup tennis, but they hope to have him back
next year alongside U.S. Open champion Pat Rafter. Newcombe and
Roche have been in charge of Australia's Davis Cup team since 1994.

McGwire home run balls set for the auction block
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Home run balls hit by Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa soon will be going, going, gone.
	   Starting Tuesday with McGwire's 50th home run ball, auction
houses will begin selling the balls. Christie's in New York will
auction No. 50, valued at about dlrs 15,000.
	   An auction house in suburban Clayton will sell McGwire's first
home run ball of the season, from an opening-day grand slam off
Ramon Martinez, on Nov. 12. That ball is estimated at dlrs 10,000
to dlrs 12,000.
	   Though no date has been set, Creative Properties Management
Group has contracted with the owners of home run balls 63, 64, 68,
69 and 70 _ considered the crown jewel of sports memorabilia. The
suburban company based in Sunset Hills also has Sosa's 64th and
66th home run balls.
	   Michael Barnes, managing partner of Creative Properties, said
offers for each of the balls are in six figures.
	   No. 70 is the catch of the lot, however.
	   ``To be competitive, you need a bid above seven figures,''
Barnes said.
	   The dlrs 93,000 that actor Charlie Sheen paid for the ball that
squirted between the legs of Red Sox first baseman Bill Buckner in
the 1986 World Series is regarded as the record for a single
collectible baseball.
	   The record price for any sports collectible item: a Honus Wagner
card sold in September 1996 by Christie's for dlrs 640,500. The
item most likely to bring the biggest bid next week at Christie's:
another Wagner card with an estimated value between dlrs 350,00 and
dlrs 450,000.
	   Creative Properties says it is fielding a hundred calls a day,
from the curious to collectors to corporations. A few have
expressed interest in the possibility of buying the entire lineup
of baseballs, though no figures have been discussed.
	   Only written offers are accepted. Bidders who stipulate that the
balls will be put on public display at, say, a museum or the
Baseball Hall of Fame, may have the inside track, Barnes said.
	   The company has not decided whether the balls will be sold at
auction or privately, or when. Barnes said all the owners retained
the right not to sell. He anticipates a sale no later than the
start of the 1999 season.

Iraq considering extending oil-for-food phase rather than renew
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq may try to extend the current phase
of the U.N. ``oil-for-food'' program rather than agree to another
six-month phase which would imply that U.N. sanctions would remain
in place, an Iraqi official said Monday.
	   The extension would allow Iraq to continue exporting oil beyond
the Nov. 25 end of the current phase until it reaches the dlrs 5.2
billion of oil sales allowed for by the Security Council.
	   Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell oil
in six-month increments to buy badly needed food and medicine for
its 22 million people suffering under U.N. sanctions.
	   Baghdad has consistently complained that the program is used to
politically justify U.N. sanctions, which have crippled its
economy. By submitting a new six-month plan for distributing food
and medicine after Nov. 25, Iraq would essentially be acknowledging
that sanctions would remain in place for another six months.
	   Considering the current crisis over arms inspections, an
extension of the current phase of the program gives Iraqi leaders a
politically expedient option, the Iraqi official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``They have a real sensitivity in getting involved in anything
that makes it look like the sanctions are indefinite or
continuing,'' said the official.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has raised the
possibility informally with Benon Sevan, executive director of the
U.N. program that oversees the distribution of humanitarian aid to
Iraq, another diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   If it agrees, the council would likely seek assurances that
additional revenue is spent on food, the diplomat said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   The eight-year-old U.N. oil embargo on Iraq cannot be lifted
until the council is certain Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The United Nations began the oil-for-food program in 1996.
	   Earlier this year, the council agreed to more than double the
amount of oil Iraq could sell over six months, to dlrs 5.26 billion
between May 30 and Nov. 25. However, because of low crude oil
prices and production limits, Iraq is expected to generate only
dlrs 3.3 billion in this phase.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's parliament unanimously endorsed a
government decision Monday to halt the work of U.N. arms inspectors
and one top official branded the monitors as a ``threat to Iraqi
security.'' In Britain, Prime Minister Tony Blair warned Iraq that
the West was ready to use force if Iraq failed to cooperate with
the inspectors. In Baghdad, the 250-member National Assembly, which
is dominated by President Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, gave its
expected approval Monday to the government decision. In Washington,
U.S. President Bill Clinton predicted that Iraq's decision to stop
all cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors would backfire and only
stiffen the international community's resolve to compel Iraqi
disarmament. He pointedly left open the possibility of a military
response. (IRAQ-UN)
	   CHINANDEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Overwhelmed by death and chaos,
Central American officials on Monday estimated more than 7,000
people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Hurricane Mitch.
As Nicaraguan officials here struggled to account for 1,500 people
feared buried by a mudslide, Honduran President Carlos Flores
Facusse de Honduras made an emotional appeal for international aid
and announced he was suspending constitutional liberties to combat
looting. ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or
of the waters,'' the president said in a nationally broadcast
speech. ``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.'' ``I ask the international
community for human solidarity,'' he said. And the same was true
across the border in Nicaragua. As many as 1,500 people were buried
near this northwestern town when the crater lake of the Casitas
Volcano collapsed. (MITCH)
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. envoy Christopher Hill met with
top officials in Belgrade on Monday, trying to jump-start the
stalled effort to get Serbs and ethnic Albanians to agree on a
political settlement for Kosovo. Hill held separate talks with
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic and European Union envoy
Wolfgang Petritsch. He plans to continue his shuttle diplomacy in
Kosovo's capital, Pristina, on Tuesday. Hill, the U.S. ambassador
to Macedonia, is leading international efforts to bring the two
sides closer to a political solution for the secessionist Serbian
province, where hundreds of people have been killed and an
estimated 300,000 displaced this year in the Serb authorities'
crackdown on militants. As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal,
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic
agreement by Monday with the ethnic Albanians on an interim
settlement leading to self-rule. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South African troops weren't
sufficiently prepared when they entered Lesotho for a military
intervention last month, their commanders told a committee in
parliament Monday. Meanwhile, a convoy carrying 800 South African
soldiers rumbled out of the neighboring kingdom on Monday, reducing
the troop strength of the intervention force by almost one-quarter.
The withdrawal came after South Africa's armed forces chief, Gen.
Siphiwe Nyanda, announced the situation in Lesotho had stabilized.
South African troops crossed into the mountainous kingdom on Sept.
22 to quell an army mutiny and unrest linked to the May election,
which the ruling party won by a landslide but which opposition
parties claimed were rigged. Botswanan soldiers joined the
intervention, waged on behalf of the Southern African Development
Community, a day later. Dozens of people died in what commanders
had thought would be a peaceful intervention. (LESOTHO-SOUTH
AFRICA)
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Soldiers and elite police trudged on
foot through dense Colombian jungle Monday, trying to reach the
site of a weekend rebel attack where dozens of police officers were
feared dead. Authorities have been unable to confirm reports that
as many as 60 officers were killed in the 12-hour assault on a
frontier police post by an estimated 800 leftist guerrillas, who
fired homemade missiles from modified propane gas cylinders. The
assault Sunday in Mitu, the remote capital of southeastern Vaupes
state, near the border with Brazil, appeared to underscore the
guerrillas' growing military might in the runup to peace talks with
President Andres Pastrana to end Colombia's 34-year civil war.
Pastrana has promised to withdraw all troops from a large southern
region by Saturday to allow peace talks with the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, whose guerrillas have been piling up
victories against ineffective and dispirited army troops.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rose sharply for a third straight session
Monday as signs of economic weakness failed to impede the latest
push in Wall Street's autumn rebound. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 114.05 points _ or by 1.3 percent _ to 8,706.15 for a
three-session gain of 334 points and the first close above 8,700
since mid-August. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Income growth slowed to a crawl in September,
but Americans dipped into their savings and kept right on spending.
The savings rate _ savings as a percentage of after-tax income _
was minus 0.2 percent, the worst performance since 1959 when the
government began tracking the rate on a monthly basis, the Commerce
Department said Monday. On an annual basis, the rate hasn't been
negative since the Depression year of 1938. So far this year, the
savings rate has been running at a positive 0.6 percent, down from
2.1 percent in 1997 and 2.9 percent in 1996. Negative saving
occurs, the department said, when consumers finance spending
through credit cards, home equity credit lines and other loans, by

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Intent on scaling back bloated
production facilities, Dutch electronics giant Royal Philips
Electronics NV said Monday it will close about a third of its
factories worldwide. Philips spokesman Ben Geerts said the company
had already announced in March that it would examine its industrial
infrastructure. At that time, ``we had 269 factories and we will
have reduced this to 266 by the end of 1998,'' Geerts said. The
company, Europe's largest consumer electronics group, ``built too
big a production capacity for requirements,'' Philips President Cor
Boonstra was quoted as saying in Monday's editions of the Financial
Times of London. (NETHERLANDS-PHILIPS)
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Blaming economic turmoil
spreading from Asia into the world's markets, South Africa on
Monday cut its economic growth predictions. The gloomy news is a
further blow to an economy already hit by high unemployment and the
strains of emerging into the global market place after years of
isolation during apartheid. Delivering his mid-term budget policy
statement to Parliament, Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said the
South African economy would grow just 0.2 percent in the fiscal
year 1998-99, down from the 3 percent predicted before the crisis
began. Manuel also said the budget deficit, a figure keenly watched
by investors, would rise to 3.9 percent of gross domestic product
in 1998-98 from an original 3.5 percent forecast. (SOUTH

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree Monday
permitting the cash-strapped Russian government to auction off up
to 5 percent of one of its most valuable assets _ the natural gas
monopoly Gazprom, the world's largest gas company. Yeltsin, who was
recovering from his latest illness at the Black Sea resort of
Sochi, signed the order approving the auction and allowing foreign
investors to take part. No date was set. However, the Interfax news
agency later quoted unidentified officials as saying that the
government may decide not to sell a stake in Gazprom this year
because its stock price has fallen sharply. If the auction goes
ahead, no more than 3 percent of the company will be sold, it
added. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Dresdner Bank on Monday became the
second major German bank in days to announce trading losses on the
world's financial markets, recording an operating profit drop over
the first nine months of nearly 27 percent. The bank blamed
financial crises in Asia and in Russia for the losses, but also
noted it lost 240 million marks (dlrs 150 million) invested in the
collapsed U.S. hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management. The bank,
Germany's third-biggest, recorded a loss of 57 million German marks
(dlrs 35.6 million) in the third quarter, compared to a profit of
632 million marks (dlrs 395 million) over the same period last
year. (GERMANY-DRESDNER BANK)
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Dell Computer Corp. has officially opened it
sales and manufacturing plant in the southeastern Chinese city of
Xiamen, the company announced Monday. The Xiamen plant will make
Dell's OptiPlex desktop computers, Latitude notebooks and PowerEdge
servers for the China market. The official opening of the Xiamen
site follows Dell's August launch of direct sales in nine cities in
China, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Xiamen. Dell has
also begun to sell its computers over the Internet in China on a
Chinese- and English-language Web site. (CHINA-DELL COMPUTER)

and a museum on Mount Athos. Some items may have moved as

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Michael dresses as a cop in a new video
that makes light of his arrest last spring in a park bathroom.
	   The video for the song ``Outside'' opens with a soft-porn
parody, then switches to Hollywood as police in helicopters descend
on couples performing sex acts in public places, including a ship,
a truck and a rooftop, USA Today said Monday.
	   There's a brief re-enactment of Michael's arrest April 7, with a
public restroom that morphs into a disco. Another scene has two
male police officers kissing passionately.
	   The video premieres Wednesday on MTV.
	   The British pop star pleaded no contest to committing a lewd act
in a public bathroom, paid a dlrs 810 fine and was ordered to
undergo counseling.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Placido Domingo will see you at the opera _
in Los Angeles AND Washington.
	   Domingo, one-third of the Three Tenors, will become artistic
director and co-manager of the L.A. Opera in the year 2000, the Los
Angeles Times reported Monday. Domingo, 57, will remain head of the
opera in Washington.
	   ``Becoming artistic director at L.A. Opera feels less like a
major change in my life there than a kind of upgrading,'' Domingo
said from Washington, where he is appearing in the season-opening
production of ``Fedora.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Thieves in a hotel lobby made off with a
bag filled with dlrs 18,000 worth of jewelry belonging to Gina
Lollobrigida.
	   The 71-year-old Italian actress had checked out of the hotel
Sunday and was waiting in the lobby for a taxi to the airport when
two men walked past her bags just inside the exit.
	   One picked up a black cosmetic case, while the other blocked him
from view. The man with the bag then jumped into a car and took
off.
	   Ms. Lollobrigida, who was in Munich for a TV appearance, told
the Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper she had already written off as
lost forever a gold necklace with rubies, a pair of gold earrings
and other jewelry in the bag.
	   But she's offering a reward for two notebooks also inside the
case. They were stuffed with private addresses and business cards
and were ``an especially bitter loss,'' she said.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Spice Girls are counting on having their third
consecutive Christmas No. 1 single in Britain, but they don't want
people to read anything into the title of the new song _
``Goodbye.''
	   After a tumultuous year that saw Ginger Spice Geri Halliwell
depart the group and two other members announce their pregnancies,
the British pop queens are trying to stop rumors about a split
before they start.
	   ``Although the song is called, 'Goodbye,' the chorus is actually
'goodbye my friend, it's not the end,' '' said Melanie Brown, aka
Scary Spice. ``So for all those people who think we're breaking up,
we're not!''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ The Prince of Wales started his first
visit to this small Alpine nation Monday, visiting Slovenia's
tourist sites and meeting with officials.
	   Slovene President Milan Kucan invited Prince Charles to visit
the former Yugoslav republic, which gained independence in 1991.
	   In addition to visiting the countryside, the prince will be
briefed about Slovenia's political and economic situation. Slovenia
is eager to become part of NATO and the European Union.
	   Prince Charles is to spend Tuesday in the capital Ljubljana,
before continuing to Romania, Bulgaria and Macedonia, another
former Yugoslav republic.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   OPORTO, Portugal (AP) _ The fashion model fiancee of Brazilian
soccer star Ronaldo has fulfilled a teen-age dream by sharing the
catwalk with Canadian supermodel Linda Evangelista.
	   ``I've admired Linda, Claudia Schiffer and Cindy Crawford ever
since I started modeling at 14. I never thought I'd be in a fashion
show with one of them,'' Susana Werner, 21, told reporters late
Sunday in this northern city.
	   The Brazilian model admitted that having a superstar boyfriend
had helped her career.
	   ``My career turned international after I started dating
Ronaldo,'' she said.
	   Werner and Evangelista were in Oporto, Portugal's second largest
city, to add a little glitz to the country's top fashion show,
known as ``Portugal Fashion.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   MOUNT ATHOS, Greece (AP) _ Rare icons and other religious
objects will be on permanent exhibit at the first museum on Mount
Athos, the all-male Christian Orthodox enclave in northern Greece.
	   The exhibit was inaugurated last week in ceremonies to mark the
1,000-year anniversary of the Mount Athos community, where women
and most female animals are banned, the Macedonian Press Agency
reported Monday.
	   The objects displayed at the Xenophon monastery were part of an
exhibition opened last year in Salonica. Other items, including
Byzantine coins, are expected to be added to the museum collection
later, the agency reported.

Fire bomb thrown into pro-North Korean group's head office

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A bottle filled with burning gasoline was thrown
into the grounds of the headquarters of a pro-North Korean
residents' group in Japan early Tuesday, but no one was injured,
police said.
	   The motive for the Molotov cocktail attack was unclear. But
police were investigating possible links with the surge in
harassment against the Korean ethnic minority that has followed
North Korea's launching of a rocket over Japan in August, spokesman
Tatsuya Arisawa.
	   Tuesday's fire bomb was found flaring on the front garden of the
General Association of Korean Residents in central Tokyo and did
not damage any property, Arisawa said.
	   The association has recently complained about receiving
envelopes containing razor blades and letters with threats, as well
as about ultra-rightists shouting slogans near Korean schools.
	   On Oct. 15, a charred body was found after a pre-dawn fire
occurred at the association's branch office in Chiba, just east of
Tokyo. Police suspect arson.
	   The North's launch, which Pyongyang says was to put a satellite
in orbit, unnerved and angered many Japanese. Japan and North Korea
have no official diplomatic ties, but trade is being carried out
through the association.
	   About 640,000 Koreans live in Japan, many of them descendants of
workers forcibly brought here during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule
over the Korean Peninsula. They continue to be victims of
discrimination in job offers, marriage and social treatment.

Row over Palestinian security plan emerges before Cabinet debate

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A Palestinian action plan to fight
terrorism threatened to stall the Israeli Cabinet's approval of the
land-for-peace deal Tuesday.
	   The accord, signed in Washington last month by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, was to
have taken effect Monday but the sides agreed to a delay of several
days at Israel's request. The Israeli Cabinet was scheduled to
debate the agreement Tuesday.
	   Netanyahu said he needed both Cabinet and Knesset approval
before he could implement the accord which calls for Israel to
carry out a phased troop withdrawal from 13 percent of West Bank
territory in exchange for Palestinian measures against terror
groups and their infrastructure.
	   For Netanyahu, the security guarantees plus a set of written
U.S. assurances, are the key selling points of his agreement to
hardliners in his coalition.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said all
``the necessary plans were provided on time.''
	   But Monday, Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan said a
Palestinian action plan on security omitted several agreed-upon
details. Bar-Illan could not specify which details were missing but
said that unless a revised document was submitted by 9:00 a.m.
(0700 GMT), the Israeli Cabinet would not debate the accord Tuesday
as scheduled.
	   Palestinian leader Saeb Erekat said the document was a matter
between the Palestinians and the United States and not Israel.
	   The United States, which brokered the deal after eight days of
negotiations in eastern Maryland, has been trying to reinforce the
interpretations of each side.
	   In the set of letters to Israel signed by U.S. Ambassador Edward
Walker, the United States said it would oppose a unilateral
Palestinian declaration of statehood, as Israel's does. It said it
would recognize Israel's right to determine alone the size of a
future pullback, but backed the Palestinian position in saying it
was Israel's ``responsibility to implement,'' the pullback rather
than renegotiate it.
	   Erekat said the United States had given a set of assurances to
the Palestinians as well. ``We have assurances that the Americans
are willing to vouch for us,'' Erekat said.
	   In a telephone call earlier Monday, Netanyahu promised Arafat
that their land-for-security agreement would be carried out as
efficiently as possible. Arafat accepted the delay without protest.
	   Israel said it would attempt to meet the target date of Nov. 16
for its first troop pullback from the West Bank.
	   Despite the show of good will between the two leaders Monday,
violent clashes over the construction of a Jewish settlement in
east Jerusalem injured three Palestinians and five Israeli
policemen Monday.

U.S. envoy holds Kosovo talks

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Building on the agreement that
averted NATO strikes in Serbia, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill has
begun trying to get Serbs and Albanians to settle their disputes
peacefully.
	   Hill held separate talks with Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic and European Union envoy Wolfgang Petritsch Monday
after arriving from the Macedonian capital, Skopje. Hill planned to
visit the Kosovo capital of Pristina on Tuesday to continue the
talks.
	   Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, has led international
efforts to bring the two sides closer to a political solution for
the secessionist Serbian province, where hundreds of people have
been killed and an estimated 300,000 displaced this year in the
Serb authorities' crackdown on militants.
	   As part of last month's Kosovo peace deal, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledged to reach a basic agreement by Monday
with the ethnic Albanians on an interim settlement leading to
self-rule. But Hill said Monday was not a formal deadline.
	   Hill characterized Monday's talks with Milutinovic as informal,
saying they talked about a draft political settlement for Kosovo.
	   In Kosovo, temperatures dropped to near freezing and a stiff
wind brought the first winter weather for refugees struggling to
return to their homes.
	   People along a central road north of Malisevo, 40 kilometers (25
miles) southwest of Pristina, complained that Serb police were
preventing them from returning to their villages. Several reported
that police shot at them when they attempted to return to family
homes.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close the province's ethnic
Albanian leadership, claimed that the Serb military on Monday
shelled the village of Jablanica, 55 kilometers (35 miles)
southwest of Pristina, for the third straight day.
	   Efforts to put as many as 2,000 international monitors on the
ground in Kosovo proceeded slowly. The monitors will determine
whether the Serb leadership is keeping its promises, including
ending the crackdown and allowing refugees to return home.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
is putting the mission together, expects to have most of the
monitors in place by year's end. The arrival of about 50 Britons
and 70 Americans in Kosovo later this week will increase the
force's size to more than 200, OSCE officials said.
	   Shaun Byrnes, head of the American observer team within the
larger monitor contingent already in Kosovo, said the total U.S.
observer presence in Yugoslavia now numbers 140, including those in
Kosovo and the newer arrivals in Belgrade.
	   The threat of NATO airstrikes pressured government authorities
to sign on to the agreement. In Paris on Monday, judicial officials
said that a Brussels-based French NATO commander, Pierre Bunel, has
been arrested for allegedly supplying information on the planned
strikes to Serb authorities.
	   A spokesman for the American delegation to the OSCE, Charles
Walsh, confirmed that a private mercenary firm was awarded a
contract by the U.S. State Department to provide the approximately
150 U.S. verifiers.
	   DynCorp, based in Reston, Virginia, uses the services of former
U.S. Army soldiers and officers and has hired out some to the
international police force in Bosnia over the past three years.
	   A group of specialists from the company already has arrived in
the Balkans.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Colombian President Andres Pastrana
cut short a two-day state visit to Venezuela Monday because of
renewed guerrilla fighting in his country.
	   Venezuelan officials said Pastrana, who arrived Monday morning
in Caracas, would return to Bogota by mid-afternoon.
	   On Sunday, at least 800 rebels from the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, attacked a police garrison in the
remote state capital of Mitu. Police reported four officers killed
and nine wounded but officals feared the death toll was higher.
	   The Mitu attack comes a week before the government's promised
Nov. 7 deadline for a troop withdrawal from much of southern
Colombia _ 16,200 square miles (42,120 square kilometers) _ for 90
days to get peace talks under way. FARC is the hemisphere's largest
and oldest rebel group.
	   Pastrana's visit to Caracas was aimed at strengthening economic
ties between the neighboring nations, whose relationship has been
strained in the past over border disputes, guerrilla incursions and
unwanted emigration

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A week after Brazil brokered peace
between Peru and Ecuador, a state firm is to sell dlrs 2 million of
arms and parts to both countries, a newsweekly reported Monday.
	   Imbel, which manufactures weapons for Brazil's army, has closed
a deal to sell FAL rifles to each is awaiting foreign ministry
approval, said the magazine Isto E'.
	   Imbel's president, General Armando Paiva Chaves, told the
magazine that negotiations for weapons were initiated by Peru and
Ecuador.
	   Brazil's foreign ministry had ``information'' about the sale but
was not prepared to comment at this stage, said spokesman Bernard
Klingl by telephone from Brasilia.
	   Last Monday, the ministry hosted the signing of a peace treaty
between Peru's Alberto Fujimori and Ecuador's Jamil Mahuad after 57
years of border hostilities. The peace treaty was negotiated by
Brazil, The United States, Argentina and Chile.
	   ___
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Prisoners staged a rebellion in a
Brazilian jail Monday, taking eight youths and a guard hostage,
police said.
	   The group surprised guards at 8am local time (1000 GMT), seizing
one of them along with eight adolescent prisoners also at the jail,
said military police spokesman Carlos Morine.
	   Dozens of police officers circled the jail in Barueri, 25 miles
(40kms) west of Sao Paulo, and negotiators were brought in, Morine
added. Prisoners were demanding to be transfered.
	   Some 200 prisoners are in the jail which has a capacity for just
60, TV Globo reported. The younger prisoners had been due to be
transfered to a different jail Monday.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ A shark attacked and fatally
wounded a surfer at a popular tourist destination in northeastern
Brazil, TV Globo reported Monday.
	   Brazilian Claudio Florencio de Freitas, 22, died in hospital
after the attack off the Boa Viagem beach in Recife, 1,370 miles
(2,200 kms) northeast of Rio, said the station.
	   ``The shark came from nowhere and pounced on him,'' said
Freitas' friend, Elson Do Nascimento, in a televised interview.
	   Freitas is the second person to be killed by a shark off the
same beach this year.
	   In five years, at least 27 swimmers and surfers have been
similarly attacked in the same state of Pernambuco. Nine have died.
	   ___
	   CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ The Virgin Islands
police department has put two officers on leave while investigating
a complaint that they assaulted two tourists from Cincinnati, Ohio.
	   Police commissioner Ramon Davila said Monday he has asked the
Federal Bureau of Investigation to oversee the investigation
because a police assault might violate federal civil rights laws.
He would not name the officers.
	   Witnesses said the tourists were driving near the Christiansted
police station and stopped in traffic to ask for directions,
according to Davila. The police officers, who were off duty, blew
their horn to indicate the tourists should stop blocking traffic.
	   Davila said one of the visitors made a derogatory gesture at the
officers. The tourists claim the officers then pulled them over and
assaulted them.

Report: Japanese woman sues to regain her daughters in North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese woman who says she was brainwashed in
North Korea to become a spy has filed a lawsuit demanding the
return of her two daughters from the isolated communist state,
Kyodo News service reported Tuesday.
	   In the lawsuit, filed in Tokyo District Court against the leader
of an ultraleftist terrorist group called the Japanese Red Army,
the woman alleges she was forced to marry a Red Army member who was
in North Korea in 1977, Kyodo said.
	   Their two daughters were kept in North Korea as hostages, when
the woman was forced to return to Japan in 1984 to work as a spy
for the Red Army in North Korea, said the report, without
identifying the woman.
	   Nine members of the Red Army were behind the hijacking of a
Japan Airlines jet in 1970. They released the passengers in Seoul,
but the plane continued to North Korea.
	   The lawsuit says the woman entered North Korea as a tourist in
February 1977, but was detained by the North Korean government and
then brainwashed, according to Kyodo.
	   The Tokyo court office was closed Tuesday for a national holiday
and could not be reached for comment.
	   The Red Army, formed in 1971, claimed responsibility for a
number of violent attacks, mostly in the 1970s.

Top Tupac Amaru leader at large in Peru captured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Police have arrested the top leader of the
leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement still at large at a
hideout in Peru's central jungle, President Alberto Fujimori said
Monday.
	   Fujimori called the arrest of Comrade Joel a ``tough blow'' to
the rebel group, which gained world attention when its members
raided the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima in December 1996
and held 72 hostages for more than four months.
	   The standoff ended in a bloody commando raid that freed the
hostages, but killed all 14 rebels and three commandos. One hostage
died on his way to a hospital.
	   Fujimori, speaking to reporters as he left a meeting with top
military chiefs, did not give the rebel's name or date of capture.
	   But local news media reported the captured rebel was Remigio
Huaman Ore, head of Tupac Amaru operations in the jungle, and that
the capture took place last week.
	   Huaman was captured near the village of Pichanaki in the
department of Junin, 165 miles (270 kilometers) northeast of Lima,
along with 40 AKM rifles and other arms, Fujimori said.
	   The fighting ability of the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru rebels was
badly damaged by the bloody rescue raid in April. Most of its
members are in jail.
	   Intelligence sources say that all that remains of the Tupac
Amaru rebels are a few dozen young fighters in Peru's jungle.
	   Three Tupac Amaru leaders are still at large, two of whom are
living abroad, Fujimori said.
	   Peru's government had also announced this weekend the capture of
a top leader of the Maoist Shining Path rebels. Jenny Rodriguez
Neyra, the Shining Path's number three leader, was captured in
Peru's northern jungle.
	   The Shining Path are a larger and more deadly rebel group than
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.

Quick verdict expected in Gucci murder trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A verdict is expected Tuesday evening in the
murder trial of slain fashion heir Maurizio Gucci's ex-wife and
four alleged coconspirators. The prosecution has asked for the
maximum sentence in Italy: life imprisonment.
	   The presiding judge, Renato Samek Ludovici, told reporters that
the court _ himself, a second judge and five citizens _ planned to
wrap up their deliberations a few hours after the defendants make
their final statements Tuesday.
	   Gucci, 46, was shot to death March 27, 1995, outside his Milan
office. He was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, who founded the
fashion company known for its leather goods and double ``G'' logo.
	   Maurizio Gucci was the last member of the family to hold a stake
in the company. But after a long history of family discord, he sold
out for dlrs 120 million in 1993.
	   Almost two years after he died, in early 1997, his ex-wife
Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli was charged with premeditated murder,
allegedly to gain control of Gucci's fortune.
	   Also charged were her longtime psychic advisor, Giuseppina
Auriemma, the doorman of a seedy hotel, the indebted owner of a
pizzeria and an unemployed auto worker.
	   All but Gucci's ex-wife and the pizzeria owner, who is accused
of pulling the trigger, have confessed to roles in the slaying.
	   With its sordid courtroom revelations about greed, betrayal and
shameless social climbing, the five-month trial has aired a seamy
side of Milan, the glamorous capital of Italy's fashion industry.
	   Prosecution witnesses testified that Reggiani Martinelli wasn't
satisfied with her dlrs 860,000 a year in alimony and wanted
control of her ex-husband's entire fortune.
	   The defense admits Reggiani Martinelli threatened Gucci and
repeatedly sought someone to kill him, but says she never went
through with the plan. It says Auriemma, a Neapolitan of humble
background, had Gucci killed, then blackmailed Reggiani Martinelli.
	   In the psychic's eyes, ``Patrizia Reggiani Martinelli was a
golden cow, to be milked for money,'' defense lawyer Gianni Dedola
said in his closing arguments last week.
	   Auriemma admitted arranging Gucci's murder but testified that
she did it at Reggiani Martinelli's behest.

Developing countries urged to do more to combat global warming
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs and UPDATES with Argentina's effort to discuss
voluntary quotas for developing nations is blocked. ADDS quote from

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina called on developing
nations Monday to do more to reduce greenhouse gases, opening the
biggest U.N. climate conference since a global warming treaty in
December.
	   Late Monday, developing nations, led by Indonesia and China,
blocked Argentina's effort to add a discussion of voluntary quotas
for poorer nations to the conference agenda.
	   The Argentine move was supported by the United States which is
looking for a bigger committment from developing nations to fight
heat-trapping gases.
	   One of the U.S. negotitators, Melinda Kimble, said she wasn't
discouraged by the lack of support for the measure. Instead, she
called the opening day of the two-week summit, ``one of the best
days I've experienced in climate conference negotiations.''
	   Kimble said the issue may be considered again and now ``remains
in the hands of the chair,'' referring to Maria Julia Alsogaray,
who is heading the host Argentine delegation.
	   Kicking off the two-week summit of 163 nations, Alsogaray,
Argentina's environmental secretary suggested the agenda should
include debate of ``voluntary'' quotas for developing nations.
	   In her opening remarks, Alsogaray, acknowledged that ``the
industrialized world is to a large extent responsible for this
critical present condition of climate change.''
	   But she hinted that countries like Argentina should do more.
	   ``We, (the) developing nations, do have the necessary conditions
_ and ethical duty _ to embrace social, economic and technological
development models,'' said Alsogaray at the Buenos Aires convention
center.
	   History was made last year in Kyoto, Japan, when governments set
2012 as the deadline for cutting back on greenhouse gases in the
United States, Japan, the 15-nation European Union and 21 other
industrial nations.
	   Nonetheless, summit participants say progress at developing
specifics for last year's momentous agreement will be crucial at
the Buenos Aires conference.
	   The Kyoto accord would require the European Union to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases 8 percent
below 1990 levels, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6
percent. The treaty only calls on developing nations to restrain
emissions as best they can.
	   Many developing countries argue their economies can't assume the
burden of energy restraints that even voluntary quotas would
require. They point out industrialized nations in the North loaded
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide to begin with.
	   The United States, which hasn't yet signed the Kyoto treaty,
backs Argentina's move for voluntary quotas. Washington says it
wants to see a bigger commitment from the developing world.
	   Arizal Effendi, an Indonesia delegate, led off opposition to
voluntary quotas, saying ``developing countries are doing as much
they can.'' He exhorted industrialized countries to achieve their
reductions first.
	   Delegates from India, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Tanzania joined
Indonesia in opposing voluntary quotas. Representatives from
Australia, Russia, the United States, and Samoa spoke in support of
Argentina.

The Japanese toilet: high-tech and more than a little daunting

<TEXT>
	   It's got gadgets galore. But with its push-button control panel,
whirring sprayers and automatic dryer, a state-of-the-art Japanese
toilet can be daunting.
	   Here's a quick primer on the popular ``Washlet'' line:
	   _CLEANSING. The pressurized water sprayer features a telescoping
nozzle to direct the cleansing stream of warm water. All models
come with ``soft start,'' i.e. the spray begins at low pressure and
increases in intensity. More advanced designs offer a pulsating,
massage spray.
	   _COMFORTABLE. Standard equipment includes a heated seat and a
slam-proof lid. A built-in-the-bowl deodorizing filter, standard on
all but the entry-level Washlet, can be set to deodorize the air
during or after use. Upscale models offer remote-control flushing
and timers to control the seat temperature and other functions.
	   _HYGIENIC. All Washlets come with a self-cleaning spray nozzle
and an antibacterial coating on the seat. On the top-of-the-line
model, the seat and cover are opened and closed by remote control
so the user never has to touch unhygienic surfaces.
	   _EXPENSIVE. Prices range from 74,000 (dlrs 650) for a
bidet-equipped seat that fits on an existing toilet bowl to 437,000
(dlrs 3,800) for the ultimate model. A hand-held travel bidet goes
for 11,000 yen (dlrs 95).

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ For 14 years, labor lawyer Patricia Navarro
handled some of Mexico's hottest television stars. Today, she
represents dozens of workers laid off by the broadcasting giant
Televisa.
	   Navarro gets more than 30 phone calls a day from recently laid
off Televisa employees who are in fights over severance pay.
	   ``People are terrified,'' she said. ``It used to be a good
company to work for. After those salaries and benefits, it's not
easy finding anything that comes close.''
	   Middle class people in Mexico and all around the globe are being
squeezed out of once-comfortable lifestyles _ and in many cases
their jobs _ by the crisis in an increasingly globalized economy.
	   In recent years, developing nations have begun toppling
protectionist trade barriers and opening up their economies to
their regions and the world.
	   But while free trade policies have increased commerce among
nations, many national economies are now more vulnerable to the
world economy's ups and downs.
	   And when an economic crisis hits like the one that has rippled
around the world over the past year, middle class professionals are
often the first to be squeezed as interest rates soar and
international companies trim payrolls.
	   ``Traditionally, the middle class was a family where the father
worked and supported the entire family,'' said Luis Feld, a
39-year-old taxi driver in Buenos Aires, Argentina. ``Now the
entire family is working, including the mother and the oldest
child.''
	   As the global economy struggles, much of the world's population
is being re-divided into just two classes: a financial elite and a
working class.
	   ``In order to stay competitive, companies all over have to slash
costs. This affects the whole world,'' said Antonio Castro, an
analyst at Oxford Economic Forecasting in Mexico. ``The middle
class is being absorbed into the working class to the point that in
some cases it has practically disappeared.''
	   For folks once accustomed to annual vacations or nights on the
town, that means simpler dinners at home and not buying a dream
house or a washing machine.
	   ``I still go for designer labels, but now I wait for sales,''
said Grace Wong, 28, a Hong Kong bank manager.
	   Ivan Choy, a political scientist at Hong Kong's City University,
said that attitude illustrates a trend even in places that haven't
been hit by hard times. ``People still have a lot of savings, but
they're not willing to spend because of growing unemployment'' and
increasing instability in global markets, he said.
	   After suffering years of turmoil under the late dictator
Ferdinand Marcos, middle class Filipinos who were just beginning to
enjoy modest prosperity are being pinched.
	   Edna Marie Bartolome, a freelance writer in Manila, is now more
careful about what she buys, avoiding the shopping mall because
``you'll end up spending for something you don't really need.''
	   In hard-hit Indonesia, a middle class that emerged only in the
past two decades is rapidly withering as banks and factories go
bust.
	   In South Korea, it's common to see homeless people in suits and
ties wandering around public parks and railway stations.
Unemployment is at a 32-year high of 7.6 percent, with 1.65 million
people jobless in a nation of 44 million.
	   Many of South Korea's new jobless belonged to the middle class,
and those who still have jobs have seen their incomes drop sharply.
	   ``It's a mess,'' said Kim Jung-hee, a bookstore owner who had to
cancel plans to send her daughter to the United States to study
English literature. ``Our income has dropped nearly 40 percent.''
	   In Singapore, layoffs have risen to record levels. Many of the
newly unemployed are finance professionals: brokers, analysts,
researchers. Real estate agents are losing work amid a depressed
property market.
	   The trend has particular implications for developing nations in
Latin America, Asia and Africa where democracy is just beginning to
take hold.
	   In some countries, worsening unemployment and recession could
fuel social discontent and instability, political analysts say.
	   Groups could channel unhappiness into protests challenging
government policies. In extreme cases, frustrations could lead
people in some countries to opt for authoritarian regimes.
	   ``Mexico, which is at the threshold of democracy, had a better
income distribution when authoritarianism was in full swing in the
1960s and 1970s than it does now,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a professor
at the prestigious Colegio de Mexico and a visiting scholar at
Stanford University. ``Average Mexicans could ask themselves why
they need to have a democracy.''
	   In South Korea, economic woes are eating away at support for
President Kim Dae-jung. His former approval ratings of 80 percent
have dropped below 50 percent as more people lose jobs and homes.
	   The economic crisis has seriously affected political stability
in Indonesia. The United Nations predicts that by next year,
two-thirds of the country's 140 million people will be living in
poverty, pretty much wiping out the nascent middle class.
	   The squeeze comes as Indonesian President B.J. Habibie struggles
to assert control over a still shaky government.

MEXICO CITY: shaky government.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Habibie took power in May, after the autocratic President
Suharto was forced to step down when 1,200 people died in rioting
triggered in part by inflation of more than 80 percent and mass
unemployment.
	   Habibie has promised democratic reforms, but he has also become
the target of protests as the crisis deepens.
	   ``This economic crisis is like a cancer. It could attack the
body of Indonesia until it dies,'' said Daniel Sparingga, a
professor at Airlangga University in Indonesia's second biggest
city, Surabaya.
	   In China, there has been little impact so far on the minuscule
but growing middle class of white collar workers employed by
foreign joint ventures and private enterprises.
	   There are, however, pockets of hardship as the crisis hits
China's exports and foreign investment.
	   Latin Americans worry they may be next.
	   In Argentina, one of the region's most developed countries,
people are working harder to maintain the higher standard of living
that long set them apart from their neighbors.
	   Middle class Brazilians are steeling themselves for a new round
of austerity measures made public by recently re-elected President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Most have stopped buying on credit amid
soaring interest rates.
	   Mexicans fear a repeat of 1995, when a steep devaluation of the
peso sent interest rates soaring to nearly 110 percent. Millions of
people lost jobs and millions more saw their debts mushroom because
of compounding interest assessments.
	   ``People who defaulted in 1995 owe six to eight times the amount
they borrowed,'' said Jose Maria Imaz, a businessman and member of
Mexico's El Barzon, a group of thousands of middle class debtors.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo is proposing a dlrs 55 billion bank
bailout that would use taxpayers' money to pay for loans that were
defaulted on during that period.
	   Surging interest rates have some Mexicans worried that another
debt crisis is around the corner. The Mexican Banking Association
is urging consumers not to take out new loans or use credit cards _
just in case.
	   Under pressure from international investors, the Televisa
network began slashing costs after longtime chairman Emilio
Azcarraga Milmo died last year.
	   Once one of Mexico's largest employers, it has laid off about
6,000 workers, sold corporate jets, cut executive pay and closed
its New York and Los Angeles offices to slash dlrs 100 million in
costs.
	   ``We really lived in a golden era,'' said Genoveva Carreon, a
sales representative who was let go after 35 years at Televisa.
``These new times are very dramatic.''

Puerto Rican police return newborn kidnapped from maternity ward
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HUMACAO, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Puerto Rican authorities returned a
missing baby to her tearful parents Monday and charged a
21-year-old police academy candidate with kidnapping the infant
from a maternity ward in July.
	   Odalys Cruz Maldonado was reunited with her parents, Mayra
Maldonado and Miguel Cruz, after officials found her in the home of
21-year-old Aeleen Silva Santiago. Silva Santiago's mother had
tipped off investigators.
	   Police said the baby was healthy and showed no signs of abuse.
	   Silva Santiago was arraigned Monday in the eastern town of
Humacao on charges of robbery and kidnapping, which carries a
possible life sentence. She did not enter a plea and was imprisoned
in lieu of dlrs 200,000 bail.
	   Officials said Silva Santiago, the daughter of a police officer,
had recently applied to enter the Puerto Rican police academy and
had taken the entrance exams.
	   She was transferred to the Ryder Hospital in Humacao after her
own baby died six months into her pregnancy, police superintendent
Pedro Toledo said.
	   Police allege she approached Cruz and Maldonado in the hospital
on July 12 and told them they had won a supply of diapers and baby
food in a contest.
	   She took the 3-day-old baby to another room under the pretense
of photographing her, then put her in a carrying bag and left the
hospital, police claimed.
	   Silva Santiago had told relatives she gave birth prematurely,
Toledo said.
	   The baby was found in Silva Santiago's house in Cidra, about 20
miles (30 kilometers) from the hospital.

	   CHINANDEGA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Overwhelmed by death and chaos,
Central American officials have estimated that more than 7,000
people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Hurricane Mitch.
	   As Nicaraguan officials here struggled to account for 1,500
people feared buried by a mudslide, Honduran President Carlos
Flores Facusse de Honduras made an emotional appeal Monday for
international aid and announced he was suspending constitutional
liberties to combat looting.
	   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' the president said in a nationally broadcast speech.
``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.''
	   ``I ask the international community for human solidarity,'' he
said.
	   And the same was true across the border in Nicaragua. As many as
1,500 people were buried near this northwestern town when the
crater lake of the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud
and debris onto villages below.
	   ``It looked like a line of helicopters flying really low and
coming at us. You could see houses, trees, everything being
covered,'' said Ricardo Antonio Garcia, a 23-year-old farmer whose
leg was amputated after being crushed in the mudslide.
	   Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said the slide
apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people and that some 600 other
people died elsewhere in the country.
	   ``We perhaps will never know how many people died,'' he said.
	   In Honduras, ``more than 5,000 people'' probably died, Dimas
Alonzo, operations chief for the National Emergency Committee, told
a local radio station. He said the exact number would never be
known.
	   Doctors said Monday that 10 Americans were among 11 people
killed when a plane operated by the Living Water Teaching Mission
crashed Sunday in rains in Guatemala, where at least 100 people
have died due to Mitch.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard said it has searched a Colorado-sized
section of the Caribbean for 31 people missing since Tuesday aboard
a 282-foot (80-meter) tour schooner, the Fantome, operated by
Windjammer Barefoot Tours of Miami.
	   Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after
Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25
inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period. It was still
bringing rain Monday to southern Mexico and Guatemala.
	   Flores Facusse said ``the floods and landslides erased from the
map many villages and households as well as whole neighborhoods of
cities.
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin
throughout the national territory,'' the president said.
	   He announced a ``state of exception'' suspending constitutional
liberties to help officials fight looting and vandalism.
	   The president said 70 percent of the nation's crops had been
destroyed. Chiquita Brands International announced from its
headquarters in Cincinnati that it had suffered massive damage to
its plantations.
	   ``Our first priority is literally to save lives,'' said Chiquita
President Steve Warshaw. ``We have had several thousand people
stranded on rooftops.''
	   AP photographer Victor Caivano, who visited Guanaja, said only
10 of the 146 houses in the town of Mangrove Bight there survived
the storm, which hovered over the island for two days. The island,
where flowers once abounded, was a desolate gray, with naked sticks
of trees jutting out of the mud.
	   Floodwaters receded in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on
Monday, but some residents carried machetes and guns because of
reports that looters with automatic rifles had attacked several
houses.
	   All four bridges across the Rio Choluteca, which splits the city
of 800,000 people, were damaged and remained out of service Monday.
	   Many victims have waited days without aid.
	   In Chinandega, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of the
Nicaraguan capital, Managua, Garcia said relatives pulled him from
the debris after the mudslide Friday. He and 40 others were taken
to a one-room, hilltop shack overlooking the village of Rolando
Rodriguez.
	   ``We thought that help would come but it never did,'' Garcia
said.
	   He said a 3-year-old girl beside him was so badly injured she
could not move. ``When she asked me for water, I would drink some
and give it to her from my mouth.''
	   By the time rescuers finally arrived Sunday, three of the
injured had died. But the 3-year-old girl survived.
	   Miguel Rostran Laguna, 42, who was in a hospital bed beside
Garcia, said that from the door of the shack, ``All you could see
was mud where the village had been. Nothing is left of Rolando
Rodriguez.''
	   It was unclear how many residents of Rolando Rodriguez and
nearby villages had escaped. By early Monday, soldiers had found
360 bodies, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval said.
	   The international Red Cross on Monday tripled its appeal for
assistance to those hit by Mitch, to dlrs 7.4 million.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the U.S. government was
providing dlrs 2 million in food, medicine, water and other
emergency relief supplies.
	   ``We'll be looking at what else we can do,'' Clinton said.
	   At least one rescue effort led to additional deaths: the mayor
of the Honduran capital and three others died Sunday in a
helicopter crash while surveying flood damage. Tegucigalpa Mayor
Cesar Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely presidential
candidate in 2001 elections.
	   Officials in neighboring El Salvador reported 148 dead and106
missing.

	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Six Venezuelans charged in Barbados
last month with using phony credit cards to steal dlrs 24,000
appeared in court Monday, but their lawyers said they are not ready
to move to trial yet.
	   The five men and one woman did not enter a plea during the
hearing, and their case was postponed until Nov. 9.
	   The group was arrested after they fled a bank in southern
Christchurch and led police on a high-speed car chase on Oct. 24.
	   Police claim they used the phony credit cards to make cash
withdrawals at least six banks. They fled the bank in Christchurch
after employees there became suspicious of the cards, police said.
	   The six defendants are Edwin Enrique Faure Naruvez, 25; Jose
Alexander Gonzales Alvarado, 28; Eduardo Jesus Hurrada Montero, 26;
Armando Jose Hurrada Montero, 29; Enedia Lisbeth Torres Romero, 25;
and Alfonzo Tomas Crimente Lopez, 28.
	   Officials have not released their home towns.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ They're talking stadiums vs. schools in
Maryland, lotteries in the South, abortion in California, ethics in
Las Vegas, and crime in Kansas.
	   Elections will be won or lost Tuesday based on issues far
removed from the maelstrom of Washington politics or President bill
Clinton's admitted sexual liaison with Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``Don't tell me what the Washington establishment says will move
voters,'' California's Republican gubernatorial candidate Dan
Lungren recently grumbled. ``Tell me what Californians say will
move them.''
	   If polls are accurate, few Americans will be moved by the
Lewinsky investigation. It may give die-hard partisans more reason
than usual to vote, but nearly two thirds of all Americans say
Clinton's behavior will not be a factor in their Election Day
decisions.
	   ``If it's not Lewinsky that's making a difference, and I doubt
that it is, I think people are concerned about not rocking the
boat,'' said Henry Graff, political science professor at Columbia
University. ``They're concerned about education, Social Security,
the environment and the economy _ a whole host of issues.''
	   So it is t in California, partly because he
allowed Democratic foe Gray Davis to seize the issue while Lungren,
the state's attorney general, talked about crime.
	   Maryland Republican Ellen Sauerbrey, in her rematch with
Democratic Gov. Parris Glendening, is running blistering television
ads that accuse the incumbent of spending money on sports stadiums
instead of schools.
	   TAXES: House Republicans pumped dlrs 10 million into last-minute
television ads, including several that attacked Democrats on their
tax records. ``Call Lydia Spottswood,'' said an ad aimed at a
Wisconsin Democrat. ``Tell her to stop supporting tax increases.''
	   Wisconsin Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold is the target of one of
the year's prickliest tax-and-spend ads. It features his opponent,
Rep. Mark Neumann, denouncing a government cow-gas survey while a
goofy-looking scientist scurries behind him trying to capture the
bovine emissions. ``This smelled like government waste to me,''
declares Neumann.
	   ETHICS: Shelley Berkely, a Democrat running for Congress in
Nevada, watched her formidable lead collapse beneath the weight of
six national Republican ads questioning her ethics. ``Garbage,''
she called them recently.
	   Illinois Democrats have condemned Secretary of State George
Ryan, the front-running Republican gubernatorial candidate, for
giving drivers' licenses to unqualified applicants; one ad blames
him for several fatal auto accidents.
	   ABORTION: An abortion-rights group is running a television ad
critical of New York Republican Sen. Alfonse D`Amato, who voted
against a federal law protecting clinics against anti-abortion
violence. A nurse wounded in a clinic bombing says in the ad, ``How
could D`Amato vote against a law that protects women from tragedies
like mine?''
	   The Colorado ballot includes two anti-abortion proposals.
	   SOCIAL SECURITY: Both parties worked to protect themselves
against the potent senior citizen's lobby. Ronnie Shows, a
Mississippi House candidate, adopted a typical Democratic tactic:
His TV ad denounced Republican privatization plans by blending
footage of a frenzied stock exchange floor with a narrator saying,
``Wall Street investors are making millions risking our future.''
	   CRIME: Republicans traditionally call Democrats soft on crime. A
national Republican mailing in Kansas says, ``Defending criminals
is Dennis Moore's bread and butter ... Moore defends brutal
murders!'' It does not mention that Moore, the Democratic
challenger to Rep. Vince Snowbarger, is a former prosecutor.

 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs and UPDATES with widely reported death toll, first
on the scene account by Red Cross workers, and reported clashes
with soldiers trying to retake town &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Government forces trudged through dense
jungles and skirmished with leftist rebels as they tried to retake
a frontier town where as many as 60 police were feared killed in a
weekend guerrilla attack.
	   Authorities have been unable to confirm reports that as many as
60 officers were killed in the 12-hour assault on a frontier police
post by an estimated 800 leftist guerrillas, who fired homemade
missiles from modified propane gas cylinders.
	   The only humanitarian worker to reach the scene Monday, a
Colombian Red Cross official who flew into Mitu, said guerrillas
seized 45 of the 120 officers who were manning the police post at
the time of Sunday's 12-hour barrage by an estimated 800 rebels.
	   The official, Wolfgang Tornbaum, told the Radionet radio station
he encountered no wounded police in the town, but he could not
confirm whether the remaining officers had been killed or had fled.
	   The makeshift bombs fashioned from hollowed out propane gas
cylinders had ``exploded continuously over the police post. It was
completely burned down,'' said Tornbaum.
	   The assault Sunday in Vaupes state seemed to underscore the
guerrillas growing military might in the runup to peace talks with
President Andres Pastrana to end Colombia's 34-year civil war.
	   Pastrana has promised to complete a troop withdrawal from a
large southern region by Nov. 7 to allow peace talks with the FARC,
which has been piling up victories against an ineffective and
dispirited army.
	   The president, who returned to Bogota Monday afternoon after
cutting short a state visit to Venezuela, had yet to make any
statements about the rebel attack that prompted his early return.
	   His peace envoy condemned the attack, however, but insisted that
Pastrana still planned to personally attend the inauguration of the
peace talks planned for the coming weeks.
	   ``It's regrettable that at a time when we're promoting peace
these kinds of actions occur, because instead of acts of war what
Colombia needs are acts of peace,'' the envoy Victor G. Ricardo
said in a television interview.
	   A force of 200 soldiers and police were dropped by helicopter
Monday about 6 miles (10 kilometers) from Mitu, and were advancing
carefully toward the town to avoid possible rebel ambushes, police
said.
	   Skirmishes between the contingent and rebels began Monday
afternoon near Mitu and were continuing, Gen. Freddy Padilla of the
Army's Seventh Brigade said in a radio interview.
	   The guerrillas have not commented on the attack, which would be
the largest since an August offensive where 143 police and soldiers
were killed and 130 taken prisoner.

Mexican peasants demand justice in Chiapas massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ACTEAL, Mexico (AP) _ Farm workers in the southern state of
Chiapas gathered Monday for a traditional Day of the Dead ceremony
in memory of 45 Tzotzil Indians massacred in December, and accused
the government of having planned the killings.
	   Speaking before a visiting delegation of 20 observers from the
London-based Peace Council, town leader Antonio Gutierrez said that
the massacre ``was coordinated by state and federal authorities
that are still at large.''
	   The Tzotzil Indians were killed Dec. 22 by members of a
pro-government paramilitary group in the hamlet of Acteal, less
than a mile from a state police station.
	   The victims belonged to a group that sympathizes with leftist
Zapatista rebels, who staged a brief armed uprising in Chiapas in
1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights.
	   State authorities were unavailable for comment on Gutierrez'
accusations. More than 150 people, including state officials and
police officers, have been charged or are under investigation in
connection with the massacre.
	   The Day of the Dead is a holiday in which Mexicans traditionally
visit the graves of friends and relatives and leave offerings of
food and drink for the deceased.
	   The victims are buried side-by-side in a common grave in the
village of Acteal.
	   ``We ask for your intervention ... so that justice, liberty,
human rights and peace can be reinstated in Chiapas,'' Gutierrez
told members of the Peace Council, a non-governmental rights
organization.

Iraq considering extending oil-for-food phase rather than renew
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq may try to extend the current phase
of the U.N. ``oil-for-food'' program rather than agree to another
six-month phase which would imply that U.N. sanctions would remain
in place, an Iraqi official said Monday.
	   The extension would allow Iraq to continue exporting oil beyond
the Nov. 25 end of the current phase until it reaches the dlrs 5.2
billion of oil sales allowed for by the Security Council.
	   Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell oil
in six-month increments to buy badly needed food and medicine for
its 22 million people suffering under U.N. sanctions.
	   Baghdad has consistently complained that the program is used to
politically justify U.N. sanctions, which have crippled its
economy. By submitting a new six-month plan for distributing food
and medicine after Nov. 25, Iraq would essentially be acknowledging
that sanctions would remain in place for another six months.
	   Considering the current crisis over arms inspections, an
extension of the current phase of the program gives Iraqi leaders a
politically expedient option, the Iraqi official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
	   ``They have a real sensitivity in getting involved in anything
that makes it look like the sanctions are indefinite or
continuing,'' said the official.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, has raised the
possibility informally with Benon Sevan, executive director of the
U.N. program that oversees the distribution of humanitarian aid to
Iraq, another diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   If it agrees, the council would likely seek assurances that
additional revenue is prioritized to maintain Iraqis are getting
enough food, the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The eight-year-old U.N. oil embargo on Iraq cannot be lifted
until the council is certain Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction.
	   The United Nations began the oil-for-food program in 1996.
	   Earlier this year, the council agreed to more than double the
amount of oil Iraq could sell over six months, to dlrs 5.26 billion
between May 30 and Nov. 25. However, because of low crude oil
prices and production limits, Iraq is expected to generate only
dlrs 3.3 billion in this phase.

<TEXT>
	   WOLFSBURG, Germany (AP) _ Appealing to nostalgia for the
rattling, bug-topped Volkswagen Beetle adored by millions,
Volkswagen on Monday introduced a svelter, quieter version of the
1960s classic to the European market.
	   Already a huge success in the United States, Volkswagen hopes
the retro-looking New Beetle with a smile-shaped hood will help the
company shed its image of building reliable, but staid, cars.
	   The reworked Beetle features a Golf engine under its curved
hurt, eliminating the familiar rattle. An electronic stabilization
system and airbags _ and a flower-holder on the dashboard _ also
are new.
	   The company has received about 200,000 requests for the car from
European customers, said Volkswagen spokesman Fred Baerbock. About
half of those were in Germany.
	   The company plans to manufacture 120,000 New Beetles this year
and 160,000 in 1999, said Tony Fouladpour, a Volkswagen spokesman
in Detroit.

Hurricane turns diving vacation into nightmare for U.S. tourists

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Trapped in a hotel room for 36
hours while Hurricane Mitch destroyed almost everything around him,
Jeremy Butler could only marvel at the awesome noise.
	   ``What it sounds like is an incredible shrieking, a high
shrieking noise, but at the same time there's a noise like a
freight train going by or thunder,'' he said. ``Or a 747 taking
off.''
	   For 36 hours, Butler and about 25 other guests were prisoners in
their rooms while Hurricane Mitch ripped apart the tiny Honduran
island of Guanaja. As the last of them left Honduras Monday, they
told of being trapped under one of the worst hurricanes in memory.
	   Considering they were caught under a storm whose wind speeds
reached 180 mph (290 kph) and went on to kill thousands of people
in Central America, the tourists at the Posada del Sol were lucky.
	   Their building was sturdy concrete. They had food, water and
camaraderie. And among the guests were public works employees from
Fort Lauderdale, Florida, who kept the electrical generator
operating.
	   And when they weren't sure how long they would be stranded, they
managed to hitch a ride with the president of Taca Group, a major
Latin American airline, who happened by.
	   As they headed to the airport in Tegucigalpa, the Honduran
capital, they were more eager to talk about the need to help the
5,000 island residents devastated by the storm than their own
experiences.
	   ``They need food, they need water, they need medical care,''
said Marvin Stahl of Waskom, Texas, who was on a dlrs 3,000 diving
vacation with his wife, Gloria.
	   The couple had heard about Hurricane Mitch before leaving for
Guanaja on Oct. 25, but didn't worry because forecasters predicted
it would head north. The first signs of a serious storm came the
next day, when waves became rough and the hotel started boarding
its windows. By then, the last regular flight had left.
	   By last Tuesday night, the storm was quickly approaching with
wind speeds of 150 mph (249 kph).
	   ``We were in the bar and the windows blew out,'' said Tamara
Ebert of Madison, Wisconsin.
	   Ebert, the Stahls and Butler went to one room with another
couple. Ebert's father, William Thompson of Indianapolis, Indiana,
stayed in his own room, reading a magazine.
	   That was the worst night. The guests could hear crashing tree
limbs, roof tiles and big concrete blocks, and the shrieking wind.
	   ``Every time we'd get one of those real heavy blasts, the
pressure was so incredible your ears would pop,'' Thompson said.
	   Thompson and some of the others said they weren't too worried
about getting killed. Butler, of San Juan Islands, Washington,
wasn't so sure.
	   ``There were big overhangs on the roof,'' he said. ``What I was
afraid of was the wind would come under the beams and rip the whole
roof off.''
	   By Wednesday morning, tensions eased. The building was still
standing; they were safe.
	   There was little to do then but wait.
	   By Thursday morning, they got out. What they found had little
semblance to the picturesque island they had last seen.
	   ``All the trees, the tree limbs, the tiles from the resort were
all just thrown all over the place,'' Marvin Stahl said.
	   ``I've never seen anything like it before. There is no foliage
on the island - every tree, all the limbs are gone, all the leaves
are gone.''
	   On Saturday, a plane arrived with room for 15 passengers. The
Stahls, Thompson, Ebert and Butler were left behind.
	   They were told a plane would come back for them later that day _
but it didn't. So Sunday, they waited at the air strip and hoped a
plane would come.
	   It did _ carrying Taca Group president Federico Bloch, who was
flying around Honduras on a small plane to examine storm damage.
Bloch saw the stranded Americans and offered a ride to Tegucigalpa.
From there, they left for home Monday morning.
	   They were eager to go home and sleep in their own beds. They
left Honduras with memories of frightening moments, but new
friendships.
	   ``It's something we've lived through that after you've lived
through it, you wouldn't trade anything for having had the
experience,'' Marvin Stahl said. ``But you hope you never live
through anything like that again.''

As winter weather arrives, villagers struggle to return

	   BOBOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Murat Kryeziu died three months ago.
Now, he finally will be buried.
	   Family members who fled from the Serb attack that killed Kryeziu
on July 28 returned to their central Kosovo home over the weekend
and recovered his bones at the spot where he fell.
	   Serb police snipers in the village prevented them from coming
back sooner, they said. Now they wait for a funeral date from the
local Muslim cleric, the bones stored in a canvas bag.
	   The rituals and routine of daily life _ such as burials and
winter planting _ are on hold in Kosovo as tens of thousands of
ethnic Albanian refugees struggle to make it home after months on
the run.
	   With winter's biting cold arriving Monday, dropping the wind
chill factor below freezing, pressure has increased for faster
progress on removing the obstacles for the refugees to return.
	   ``At the absolute latest, we need things to be stable before it
starts to snow,'' said Anthea Webb of the U.N. World Food Program.
	   Many of the estimated 50,000 people who were living in the open
have left the hillsides and valleys for shelter in villages. But a
large number remain unable to reoccupy their dwellings, either
because they fear Serb forces still in the region or their homes
are too badly damaged.
	   Serb police and Yugoslav soldiers have withdrawn in large
numbers under threat of NATO airstrikes. But enough remain to keep
up a visible presence in much of the southern Serbian province.
Serbia is the larger of two republics comprising the remainder of
Yugoslavia.
	   An international force of 2,000 unarmed observers is being
created to travel throughout Kosovo and verify if Serb forces are
complying with Western demands to cease hostilities and let
refugees come home. But the mission, organized by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, will take weeks or even
months to become fully operational.
	   With the fear of Serb forces still paralyzing, Western officials
are pushing for creation of a civilian police force comprising
Albanians and Serbs to make people more confident about getting on
with normal life.
	   Until then, the delay threatens the rural cycle of planting and
harvesting, with winter crops requiring immediate attention.
	   ``All the people I've spoken to so far said they haven't planted
crops yet,'' Webb said. ``They say they don't have seeds, or money
to buy seeds, or the confidence to plant.''
	   Refugees complain of shooting, arrests and general harassment
intended to intimidate them from going home.
	   In Bobovac, a devastated village 30 miles (50 kms) west of
Kosovo's capital, Pristina, Sadbere Kryeziu told how her uncle,
Murat, 53, died in the Serb shelling that sent the family fleeing
in July.
	   Her father tried several times to return to gather the remains
of his brother, she said.
	   ``Every time he came, they shot at him,'' Sadbere said of Serb
police who occupied houses. After the police withdrew last week,
the family moved back on Saturday and found Murat's remains where
he died.
	   Another Bobovac man killed in the July attack also must be
buried, and the planned joint funeral will take place when the
man's son returns from Germany, probably this week, villagers said.
	   Meanwhile, Kryeziu's family spent Monday cleaning debris from
the yard and trying to prepare for winter. They claim Serb police
looted the village, taking their cache of flour and other goods
from houses.
	   ``There is no electricity,'' said the niece, Sadbere, 25. ``At
least we have a roof.''
	   That's an improvement at least over the fate of Fate Kryeziu,
who hunched her shoulders in the morning cold and pointed out her
house, now little more than a hulk of burned brick, on the other
side of the village.
	   ``I come just to see and cry,'' said Kryeziu, 60, a widow not
related to Murat Kryeziu who has no children and stays at her
brother-in-law's house in another village. ``It's better to die
than to see this happening to you.''

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ As government reinforcements sought to
retake a besieged frontier town, the Red Cross said Monday that 60
police were killed and as many as 45 were taken prisoner when
guerrillas overran its police post over the weekend.
	   Authorities have been unable to confirm reports that as many as
60 officers were killed in the 12-hour assault on a frontier police
post by an estimated 800 leftist guerrillas, who fired homemade
missiles from modified propane gas cylinders.
	   About 200 soldiers and police slogged through dense jungles and
skirmished with the rebels Monday afternoon on the outskirts of the
town of 15,000 inhabitants in Vaupes state, near the Brazilian
border, army officials reported.
	   Colombian Red Cross workers, who flew into Mitu on Monday,
estimated 60 police died in the 12-hour barrage by 800 guerrillas
from the FARC, the country's largest rebel group.
	   They said the police barracks and a nearby farmers' bank had
been burned to the ground as a result of the shelling with more
than 200 makeshift missiles fashioned from hollowed out gas
cylinders.
	   ``It's difficult to get an exact count (of the dead)'' Red Cross
spokesman Walter Cotte told The Associated Press. The rough
estimate, said Cotte, was put together based on contacts with
hospital workers and others in Mitu as well as ``what we could see
in the streets.''

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Residents armed themselves with
machetes and pistols and authorities suspended constitutional
liberties to fight looting that erupted as the death toll from
former hurricane Mitch surged above 7,000.
	   Officials estimated at least 5,000 Hondurans had died and
600,000 _ 10 percent of the nation's population _ had been forced
to flee their homes. The devastation led to chaos in the nation's
capital, with long lines of people trying to get fresh water, food
and medicine.
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin in
all of the national territory,'' the president said in a nationally
broadcast speech following the five-day passage of Hurricane Mitch.
	   ``There are corpses everywhere, victims of landslides or of the
waters,'' the president said in a nationally broadcast speech.
``The most conservative calculations of the dead are in the
thousands, not in the hundreds.''
	   ``I ask the international community for human solidarity,'' he
said.
	   The scene was grim as well in neighboring Nicaragua, where as
many as 1,500 may have died in mudslides when the crater lake of
the Casitas Volcano collapsed, sending a wall of mud and debris
onto villages below.
	   ``It looked like a line of helicopters flying really low and
coming at us. You could see houses, trees, everything being
covered,'' said Ricardo Antonio Garcia, a 23-year-old farmer whose
leg was amputated after being crushed in the mudslide in northwest
Nicaragua.
	   Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said the slide
apparently killed 1,000 to 1,500 people and that some 600 other
people died elsewhere in the country.
	   In Honduras, ``more than 5,000 people'' probably died, Dimas
Alonzo, operations chief for the National Emergency Committee, told
a local radio station. He said the exact number would never be
known.
	   Many parts of Honduras remained cut off almost a week after
Mitch barreled into the Bay Island of Guanaja with 180 mph (290
kph) winds. The storm pounded across the isthmus, dropping up to 25
inches (63 centimeters) of rain in a six-hour period, before
dissipating Monday in southern Mexico.
	   Flores Facusse said ``the floods and landslides erased from the
map many villages and households as well as whole neighborhoods of
cities.''
	   ``We have before us a panorama of death, desolation and ruin
throughout the national territory,'' the president said.
	   He announced a two-week ``state of exception'' suspending
constitutional liberties that allows authorities the right to seize
property, detain suspects and unlimited searches to help officials
fight looting and vandalism. People were ordered off the streets
between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.
	   Virtually all of Honduras suffered flooding, from the lowland
marshes on the Atlantic Coast to the mountains, hills and plateaus
of the interior.
	   Floodwaters receded in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa on
Monday, but some residents carried machetes and guns because of
reports that looters with automatic rifles had attacked several
houses and businesses.
	   All four bridges across the Rio Choluteca, which splits the city
of 800,000 people, were damaged and remained out of service Monday.
	   Many victims have waited days without aid.
	   To the south in northwestern Nicaragua, Miguel Angel Ortiz told
of waiting three days with his family on a hilltop under pouring
rain after a wave of mud, trees and rocks came crashing down on the
village of El Ojochal.
	   Running to the top of a hill, they were among the few in the
village lucky enough to get out in time.
	   Help never came and they finally walked out Monday because of
hunger and thirst.
	   Ortiz, 33, and his family made their way to Chichigalpa, where
doctors attended to survivors in an elementary school.
	   ``There was no food, no water and a lot of disease, a lot of
death,'' Ortiz said. ``We needed to get out of there.''
	   By early Monday, soldiers had found 360 bodies out of the
mudslide stricken area, where as many as 1,500 people may have
died, army spokesman Capt. Milton Sandoval said. Local civil
defense officials said they planned to go into the disaster area on
Tuesday and begin burning bodies to cut down on the risk of
disease.
	   The international Red Cross on Monday tripled its appeal for
assistance to those hit by Mitch, to dlrs 7.4 million.
	   In Washington, President Clinton said the U.S. government was
providing dlrs 2 million in food, medicine, water and other
emergency relief supplies.
	   ``We'll be looking at what else we can do,'' Clinton said.
	   At least one rescue effort led to additional deaths: the mayor
of the Honduran capital and three others died Sunday in a
helicopter crash while surveying flood damage. Tegucigalpa Mayor
Cesar Castellanos, 49, had been seen as a likely presidential
candidate in 2001.
	   A plane crash in western Guatemala blamed on the remnants of
Mitch killed 11 people, 10 of them Americans, and injured another
seven U.S. citizens, doctors said Monday.
	   Bad weather and lack of radar may have caused the crash Sunday
of the C-47 cargo plane operated by the Living Water Teaching
Mission, airport officials in Guatemala said.
	   The plane went down near the town of San Andreas Xecul, 60 miles
(96 km) west of Guatemala City, as it was pelted by rain.
	   The U.S. Coast Guard said it has searched a Colorado-sized
section of the Caribbean for 31 people missing since Tuesday aboard
a 282-foot (80-meter) tour schooner, the Fantome, operated by
Windjammer Barefoot Tours of Miami.
	   Officials in neighboring El Salvador were assessing the impact
of floods caused by the storm. The National Emergency Committee
listed 148 dead, 106 missing and 27,000 homeless. But its own
regional affiliate in San Miguel province reported 125 dead there
alone.
	   Guatemala reported storm-related 100 deaths. Mexico reported
one.

Newspaper: Saddam keeps arsenal secret from senior staff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has a chemical and
biological weapons arsenal that he keeps secret from even his most
senior advisors, an Iraqi defector was quoted Tuesday as saying.
	   Abbas Al-Janabi, the former private secretary to Saddam's son,
told The Guardian that Saddam has mislead senior officials into
thinking the weapons have been destroyed.
	   ''Even (Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister) Tareq Aziz doesn't know
where the weapons are,'' Al-Janabi, who defected last spring and
lives in hiding, said in the newspaper's Tuesday's edition. ''He
thinks they are finished. He is important outside Iraq but he is
nothing in his own country.''
	   On Saturday, Iraq banned U.N. weapons inspection teams from
working in the country after the U.N. Security Council refused to
lift economic sanctions. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Security Council demanded that Iraq reverse its ban on the
inspectors, and warned that lack of compliance could result in
force being used.
	   But Iraq's Parliament on Monday unanimously endorsed the
government's decision, even as the United States and Britain said
that the West stood ready to use force.
	   Al-Janabi, 50, worked for the Iraqi national news agency and was
later appointed editor of the daily newspaper Babel. After
defecting with his family, he spent three months in the United
States being interviewed by the CIA. He says he lives in hiding in
Europe, to prevent reprisals from the Hussein family.

Climate summit cool to debating Third World role against global

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ A U.S.-backed proposal for the
developing world to assert a bigger role in combating global
warming has won a cool reception at a United Nations climate
summit.
	   Developing nations led by China blocked efforts Monday to add
discussion of voluntary quotas for poorer nations to the agenda of
the conference, the biggest gathering since a landmark global
warming treaty in Kyoto, Japan.
	   The issue of poorer nation participation in arresting global
warming is one of the touchiest under the 1997 treaty.
	   Spurred on by China and other foes of voluntary commitments, the
163 summit nations decided by consensus Monday to block the issue
from even reaching the agenda as they kicked off their two-week
conference.
	   ``To say the least, we are disappointed that it appears that
countries will not have an opportunity to explore this matter in
any detail,'' U.S. negotiator Melinda Kimble told delegates.
	   But she later told a news conference she was heartened when
Argentina sought to advance the issue at all.
	   ``What we are beginning to see, with the issue of developing
nations, is a debate on the next steps,'' said Kimble, a U.S.
acting assistant secretary of state. ``This is very much a step
forward.''
	   Before their work concludes Nov. 13, the 163 assembled nations
are to debate several contentious issues meant to put Kyoto's words
into deeds.
	   History was made last December in that Japanese city when
governments set 2012 as the deadline for cutting back on greenhouse
gases in the United States, Japan, the 15-nation European Union and
21 other industrial nations.
	   Although the cuts currently apply only to those 38 nations,
greenhouse emissions in India and China are expected by 2015 to
exceed those of the biggest polluter, the United States.
	   Many scientists believe the Earth is gradually warming because
of five gases, chiefly carbon dioxide from power plant and
automobile consumption. Critics say dire warming scenarios remain
unproven and don't warrant potentially costly shifts away from
fossil fuels.
	   After industrial nations agreed in Kyoto to slash greenhouse gas
emissions, U.S. officials arrived here with hopes the conference
would produce further agreements on implementation that would make
the pact easier to sell to a critical Congress.
	   The United States is not among the 38 signatories of the accord
so far, and a Republican-led Senate remains skeptical, absent
greater efforts by the developing world.
	   Yet many developing countries argue their economies can't assume
costly greenhouse gas reductions that quotas would require. They
point out industrialized nations in the North loaded the atmosphere
with carbon dioxide to begin with.
	   Argentina's delegate, Maria Julia Alsogaray, said
	   ``The industrialized world is to a large extent responsible for
this critical present condition of climate change,'' Argentina's
delegate, Maria Juia Alsogaray, said. But she said developing
nations have an ``ethical duty.''
	   The Kyoto accord would require the European Union to reduce
emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases 8 percent
below 1990 levels, the United States by 7 percent and Japan by 6
percent.

Hunter says season might not start until January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On the day before the National Basketball
Association season was supposed to begin, union director Billy
Hunter said it might be 1999 before it actually does.
	   ``My gut tells me that in January we could be playing. I would
anticipate the season would start around the first part of
January,'' Hunter said Monday after representatives of the owners
and players met for about 2 1/2 hours at a Manhattan law office.
	   No more talks are scheduled until Wednesday, and Hunter said the
sides have retreated from an earlier plan to have full negotiating
teams present.
	   Hunter's pessimistic outlook was in response, he said, to a
growing misperception that a deal could be imminent.
	   ``It has been reported that there's strong possibility an
agreement can be reached this week,'' Hunter said. ``I don't know
where that information came from, but I can indicate that I don't
see any possibility at all of reaching an agreement this week and I
can't say how soon it will be. I want to get that message out
there.''
	   NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik responded: ``We agree with
Mr. Hunter that we are not close.''
	   If Hunter's gut feeling is correct and the lockout lasts at
least another month, it will cost the players about dlrs 400
million in lost salaries.
	   Owners, too, are losing money, and Hunter expects pressure to
come from the television networks, sponsors and some of the owners
to cut their losses and get a deal done before it's too late to
have a viable regular season.
	   Commissioner David Stern and Granik have indicated that anything
less than a 50-game season was unacceptable. The first month of the
season has already been canceled, leaving each team with about 68
games.
	   ``In January, it becomes much more urgent. We're either going to
play, or something extreme is going to happen one way or another,''
Hunter said. ``I'm sure some players are hurting, but pain,
pressure and anxiety is on other side, too. At the boiling point,
when people realize basketball is going to take a hit, then
rationality will set in and we'll have a deal.''
	   Last week, both sides agreed on a loose framework for a new
labor pact that included a number of years under a ``luxury tax''
and an equal number of years under an ``escrow tax'' _ if the
luxury tax failed to curtail the percentage of basketball-related
income devoted to player salaries.
	   The biggest sticking point is what the percentage should be
after the system has been in place for a few years. The players are
asking for 60 percent of revenues; the owners are offering 50.

Human rights chief says improvements are too slow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. human rights chief Mary Robinson
complained Monday that implementation of programs to improve human
rights remains ``too slow and unbalanced.''
	   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly, Robinson called for
``a global alliance for human rights'' including governments,
international organizations, voluntary groups, academic
institutions, local communities, the media and the corporate
sector.
	   ``There is no country whose human rights record cannot be
improved,'' she noted.
	   During the past five years, Robinson said, ``we have witnessed
two horrific genocides, millions of victims of famine and
malnutrition, millions of refugees and internally displaced,
victims of epidemics _ many of then children _ who have been
deprived of medical care, the continued practice of torture...''
	   But she said there has also been a growing perception ``of the
human rights dimension of basic problems of our societies'' and an
increasing human rights constituency.
	   Robinson called on the international community to address major
problems which affect human rights including poverty, famine,
malnutrition, poor housing, lack of health care and illiteracy.
	   She also urged the development of programs to eradicate racism,
trafficking in women and children, summary and arbitrary
executions, torture and involuntary disappearances.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A plane crash in western Guatemala blamed
on the remnants of Hurricane Mitch killed 11 people, 10 of them
Americans, and injured another seven U.S. citizens, doctors said
Monday.
	   Bad weather and lack of radar may have caused the crash Sunday
of the C-47 cargo plane operated by the Living Water Teaching
Mission, airport officials in Guatemala said.
	   Mission founder Rev. James Zirkle, 57, died in the crash, as did
his son James Jr., one of the aircraft's pilots.
	   ``It was part of the price paid to get the Gospel out,'' said
Chuck Arrington, a nephew of the reverend, speaking from the home
of relatives in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma.
	   The plane went down near the town of San Andreas Xecul, 60 miles
(95 kilometers) west of Guatemala City, as it was pelted by rain
from former Hurricane Mitch, by then a tropical depression.
	   The seven injured Americans were taken to a private hospital in
Quetzaltenango. Their injuries were not serious, said Francis
Canett Samayoa, a Guatemalan physician who was a member of the
mission but not aboard the plane.
	   The plane and its passengers were on an aid mission to
distribute medicines and provide medical care in the
poverty-stricken northern province of Quiche. The plane was
returning from Playa Grande, 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of
Guatemala City.
	   Bill Mickler, pastor of the Victory Christian Center, a
nondenominational charismatic church in Lafayette, Indiana,
confirmed the death of Indiana missionary, Melvin Hughes, 57.
	   He said a second member of his church, 18-year-old Ross Douglas,
also of Lafayette, was injured.
	   Physicians at the Jose Felipe Flores Hospital in Guatemala said
the other dead included Thomas Vander Pool, Susan Aldridge, Dale
Graff, Willard Granger, Kevin Brittian, John Ronald Bryson and
Christopher Brian Hanbirger.
	   No home towns or states were immediately available for those
victims.
	   Also killed was the aircraft's Guatemalan pilot, Raul Emilio
Jacobs Weller, 48.
	   The injured were listed as Erica Brittian, 33; Sharon Malone,
32; Allen Dudan, 50; John Eperson, 40; Christian Bucker, 36; Sean
Edwards and Ross Douglas.
	   The deaths are among the 100 in Guatemala caused by Mitch.
Officials have said the death count from the storm may exceed 7,000
in Central America.
	   The Living Water _ ``Agua Viva'' in Spanish _ is based in Caddo
Mills, Texas, and in Quetzaltenango, 70 miles (115 kilometers) west
of Guatemala City. It has worked in Central America for 18 years.
	   Zirkle founded Living Water in 1980 after graduating from Rhema
Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow. Zirkle moved the ministry
from Broken Arrow to Caddo Mills, Texas in 1994, he said.
	   ``He had a passion. He wanted to help people. He was very driven
in his compassion to help people,'' Arrington said of the elder
Zirkle.
	   Zirkle lived in Guatamala. His two adult daughters and their
families are active in his mission work, which extends across
Central America. The missions mix evangelism with the delivery of
medical help and supplies, said Arrington, who used to work for the
ministry.

Canett Samayoa, a Guatemalan physician who was a member of the
mission but not aboard the plane.
	   The plane and its passengers were on an aid mission to
distribute medicines and provide medical care in the
poverty-stricken northern province of Quiche. The plane was
returning from Playa Grande, 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of
Guatemala City.
	   Bill Mickler, pastor of the Victory Christian Center, a
nondenominational charismatic church in Lafayette, Indiana,
confirmed the death of Indiana missionary, Melvin Hughes, 57.
	   He said a second member of his church, 18-year-old Ross Douglas,
also of Lafayette, was injured.
	   Physicians at the Jose Felipe Flores Hospital in Guatemala said
the other dead included Thomas Vander Pool, Susan Aldridge, Dale
Graff, Willard Granger, Kevin Brittian, John Ronald Bryson and
Christopher Brian Hanbirger.
	   No home towns or states were immediately available for those
victims.
	   Also killed was the aircraft's Guatemalan pilot, Raul Emilio
Jacobs Weller, 48.
	   The injured were listed as Erica Brittian, 33; Sharon Malone,
32; Allen Dudan, 50; John Eperson, 40; Christian Bucker, 36; Sean
Edwards and Ross Douglas.
	   The deaths are among the 100 in Guatemala caused by Mitch.
Officials have said the death count from the storm may exceed 7,000
in Central America.
	   The Living Water _ ``Agua Viva'' in Spanish _ is based in Caddo
Mills, Texas, and in Quetzaltenango, 70 miles (115 kilometers) west
of Guatemala City. It has worked in Central America for 18 years.
	   Zirkle founded Living Water in 1980 after graduating from Rhema
Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow. Zirkle moved the ministry
from Broken Arrow to Caddo Mills, Texas in 1994, he said.
	   ``He had a passion. He wanted to help people. He was very driven
in his compassion to help people,'' Arrington said of the elder
Zirkle.
	   Zirkle lived in Guatamala. His two adult daughters and their
families are active in his mission work, which extends across
Central America. The missions mix evangelism with the delivery of
medical help and supplies, said Arrington, who used to work for the
ministry.

Foreign investors in nationalized banks to be protected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will offer foreigners who take
a stake in three nationalized banks up to a seven-year guarantee on
non-performing loans at those failed institutions, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   Kitti Patpong-pibul, deputy governor of the Bank of Thailand,
said his bank would decide on a case-by-case basis whether to make
guarantees to foreign investors in three banks, according to The
Nation newspaper.
	   The government plans to sell three nationalized commercial
lenders by the end of this year under the terms of a bank sector
recapitalization plan announced on Aug. 14.
	   The sale comes in wake of the country's worst financial and
economic crisis in modern times.
	   The guarantees would apply to foreign buyers taking a
controlling stake in Bangkok Metropolitan Bank PCL, Siam City Bank
PCL and Radhanasin Bank PCL.
	   Authorities have said as much as 75 percent of each bank's
shares could be sold to foreigners. Thus far, foreign investors
have been slow to move in, fearing huge losses at the nationalized
banks for the foreseeable future.

Milutinovic will coach MetroStars in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SECAUCUS, New Jersey (AP) _ Former U.S. national team soccer
coach Bora Milutinovic, who took over the New York-New Jersey
MetroStars late last season, will return in 1999, a source said
late Monday.
	   ``It's Bora,'' a source close to the U.S. Major League Soccer
team, who asked not to be identified, told The Associated Press.
The source did not know terms of the deal.
	   MetroStars spokesman John Neves would not comment, but the team
has scheduled a news conference Tuesday in New York to introduce
its coach.
	   Milutinovic replaced Alfonso Mondelo as the MetroStars coach in
mid September.
	   Working on a handshake agreement, he coached the team to a
shootout win over New England in the final game of the regular
season and then in the playoffs, where Columbus eliminated New
York-New Jersey in two straight games.
	   The Serbian-born Milutinovic was rumored to be a candidate for
the U.S. National coach, a job that eventually was given to DC
United's Bruce Arena.
	   Milutinovic is the fifth MetroStars coach in less than three
years. He has a reputation for turning around a team's fortunes on
short notice.
	   He is the only coach in history to guide four different teams
into the second round of the World Cup, including Nigeria into the
second round of this summer's World Cup before it was eliminated by
Denmark. He also led Mexico to the second round in 1986, Costa Rica
in 1990 and the United States in 1994.
	   He headed the U.S. team until 1995, when he said he was fired
for not taking a larger role in player development.

Hollywood agent defends film against environmental protests
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Thai agent is defending the shooting
of a Hollywood movie against protests from environmentalists who
say a tropical island will be deluged by tourists, a newspaper said
Tuesday.
	   Despite an outcry, the Thai government has permitted 20th
Century Fox to film ``The Beach,'' starring ``Titanic'' heartthrob
Leonardo DiCaprio inside a national park early next year.
	   Santa Pestanji, the local production coordinator for the movie,
was quoted in The Nation as saying there would be ``minimal or no
environmental impacts on the island and coral reefs around it.''
	   He said the Hollywood film crew were friends of the environment
who ``love and care about natural resources more than the Thais.''
	   The filming has set off a controversy because southern
Thailand's Phi Phi Island is a national park which already attracts
large crowds and illegal tourist developers.
	   A high-profile Hollywood movie, environmentalists say, would
only increase tourism and the filming itself would disturb the
fragile tropical ecosystem.
	   The film-makers plan to replant some 100 coconut trees and
temporarily remove some vegetation to broaden one of the island's
beaches for a football playing scene.
	   Under an agreement with the Thai government, which approved the
shooting last month, 20th Century Fox will place a 5 million baht
(dlrs 132,000) deposit as guarantee against any damage inflicted on
the environment.
	   It will also contribute 4 million baht (dlrs 105,000) to the
Forestry Department.
	   ``The film, starring DiCaprio, will improve Thailand's tourism
industry and bring a lot of money to the country. The public and
media should not attack it,'' Santa was quoted as saying.
	   He said 20th Century Fox had threatened to change the location
of the shooting if there was a strong public reaction against it.
	   Santa has acted as production coordinator for virtually every
major Hollywood film shot in Thailand in recent times.

Down with cold, Se Ri Pak skips Japan Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Se Ri Pak, exhausted and sick after a
tiring homecoming, will skip this week's Japan Classic, the
next-to-last official LPGA tournament.
	   Pak's decision leaves her with only the Tour Championship and
gives the 21-year-old South Korean only a slim chance to surpass
Annika Sorenstam in the points race for LPGA Player of the Year.
	   ``She is very disappointed but she decided to honor her doctor's
advice,'' Shim Moon-bo, a public relations official for Samsung,
Pak's corporate sponsor, said Tuesday.
	   Since arriving in Seoul last Tuesday for a week's visit, the
20-year-old LPGA star rookie has attended numerous promotional
events for Samsung and been besieged by the media.
	   She became ill late Saturday after playing in rain in the second
round of the Korea LPGA. She has since been bedridden at Seoul's
Samsung Hospital, where she is being treated for a cold and
exhaustion.
	   Pak skipped the final round of the Korea LPGA on Sunday. On
Monday, she passed up having South Korea's second highest sports
medal pinned on her by President Kim Dae-jung.
	   ``Pak is recovering fast. And she will meet the rest of her tour
schedule,'' Shim said, adding that she will leave for the United
States around Saturday to prepare for the Tour Championship, Nov.
19-21.
	   Sorenstam is not playing in the Japan Classic either, and Pak
had hoped to use both the Japan Classic and the Tour Championship
to cut into her almost 40-point deficit for Player of the Year.
	   A victory at the Tour Championship is worth 60 points, which
gives Pak a slim chance of overcoming her 185.99-225.89 deficit
against Sorenstam in the Player of the Year points system.
	   With dlrs 1,077,498 in winnings, Sorenstam also is more than
dlrs 200,000 ahead of Pak in the money list.
	   Pak rose to fame by winning four victories on the LPGA Tour,
including the U.S. Women's Open and the LPGA Championship.

Singapore bank cuts prime lending rate, others to follow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ One of Singapore's big four banks cut its prime
lending rate by half a percentage point effective Tuesday, paving
the way for other local institutions to follow suit.
	   United Overseas Bank reduced the rate it charges its best
customers to 6.5 percent, its third cut in less than two months and
the highest single cut since local banks began lowering their
lending rates recently.
	   The Singapore stock market reacted jubilantly, with the
benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index rising 4.4 percent in the
first 15 minutes of trading before giving up some of its gains.
	   Singapore's other three major local banks _ Development Bank of
Singapore, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. and Overseas Union Bank _
are expected to match UOB's move, just as in the previous two
rounds of rate cutting.
	   Singapore's three-month interbank rates have plunged to near
three-year lows of 2 percent, pulling down the prime lending rate
in the process, according to market observers.
	   Local banks usually adjust their prime rate when it exceeds the
interbank rate by 2 to 3 percentage points.
	   In early October, the major local banks lowered their prime
rates by a quarter percentage point to 7 percent, following an
identical cut in early September.
	   The gradual lowering of lending rates is expected to aid
businesses in need of capital and alleviate homeowners' mortgage
payments, which had risen to relatively high levels during the
economic crisis.
	   Mounting global pressure for lower interest rates and faltering
domestic demand for loans will continue to put pressure on
Singapore's prime lending rate, said analysts.

Indonesian Muslims gather in show of political unity
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Staffing

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of Muslim clerics,
politicians and students gathered at Indonesia's largest mosque
Tuesday in a rare show of unity amid ongoing political turmoil and
economic crisis.
	   ``Muslims must unite morally for the sake of Indonesia,'' said
Haji Ali Yasie, who chairs the Indonesian Ulama Association, or
MUI.
	   Organizers say 15,000 Muslim representatives took part in the
peaceful gathering at Jakarta's huge white-domed Istiqlal Mosque.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslims,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation.
	   Ali told reporters that the meeting was called to foster
cooperation among competing Islamic groups, including dozens of
Muslim-based political parties formed recently to contest
parliamentary elections next May.
	   The elections are to be first held since protests and riots
forced former President Suharto to quit last May, ending 32
authoritarian years in power.
	   Suharto's successor President B.J. Habibie has promised the
elections will be conducted democratically under new reforms to be
debated by Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly next week.
	   The assembly is Indonesia's highest legislative body and there
are fears that next week's meeting could trigger a wave of
protests.
	   Students and others claim most of its delegates are holdovers
from the Suharto era and have no intention of supporting real
democratic change.
	   Adding to the instability is the worst economic crisis to befall
Indonesia in 30 years.
	   High inflation, mass unemployment and growing poverty have
brought misery to millions and have resulted in sporadic rioting
and looting since May.
	   Habibie, Suharto's longtime friend and former loyal subordinate,
has also been the target of student protests.
	   Habibie is among several likely candidates for the presidency to
be decided by the assembly in December 1999.

Tourists to spend dlrs 52 million during Asian Games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Organizers expect tourists in Bangkok
during next month's Asian Games to spend at least 2 billion baht
(dlrs 52 million), promising much needed cash for the ailing
economy.
	   A release from organizers of the 13th Asian Games received
Tuesday said the Dec. 6-20 event coincided with the high tourism
season.
	   Struggling through an economic crisis, Thailand is eager to earn
as much from tourism as possible in coming months and offset some
of the costs of the 43-nation Games.
	   Hotels, airlines and travel agencies have been reporting heavy
bookings for December and early 1999.

Abducted Chinese-Filipino businessman freed after ransom payment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Kidnappers freed a Chinese-Filipino
businessman unharmed in central Cebu province after a ransom was
paid, a police official said Tuesday.
	   Regan King, manager of a heavy equipment company owned by his
father, was released Monday night after his family paid 2 million
pesos (dlrs 50,000) to his abductors, said Panfilo Lacson, chief of
the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Task Force.
	   Lacson did not disclose other details but said authorities were
attempting to arrest the kidnappers. King was seized at gunpoint by
four men and forced into a car in Cebu city on Oct. 21.
	   Several people, including an Italian priest, remain in the hands
of kidnap gangs, especially in the southern region of Mindanao,
where many Muslim separatist guerrillas and bandits have been
implicated in abductions.
	   President Joseph Estrada has launched a high-profile campaign
against kidnappings and scored a major victory last month with the
rescue of several victims and the arrest of their alleged abductors
in Manila.

Dissident trial resumes with legal wrangling

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of Malaysian dissident
Anwar Ibrahim was to resume Tuesday with wrangling over legal
technicalities before the first witness testifies against the
ousted deputy prime minister.
	   Anwar arrived in court in a blue police truck, flanked by escort
vehicles, for the second day of his trial to face charges of abuse
of power and illicit sex.
	   Riot police with shields and tear-gas launchers stood guard
across the street from the red-bricked High Court at Independence
Square, where Anwar led a huge anti-government protest just hours
before his arrest on Sept. 20.
	   Hundreds of foreign reporters and human rights activists have
flocked to the Malaysian capital to observe the trial, which has
come to represent the demand for political reforms and greater
freedom of speech and assembly.
	   Anwar's case generated international concern after he appeared
with a black eye and bruises during his arraignment. He accused
police of beating him on the night of his arrest.
	   Anwar faces five counts of corruption and five counts of illegal
sex. He denies the charges and says they were cooked up to
undermine his challenge to the 17-year leadership of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Mahathir said he sacked his handpicked successor because he was
morally unfit to lead the Southeast Asian nation.
	   During the opening day Monday, his defense attorneys lost the
first round. They argued the four graft charges were invalid
because the lower house of Parliament had repealed the special
anti-corruption law under which he was charged before the criminal
charges were filed against him.
	   High Court Judge Augustine Paul dismissed the request, saying
that the law was still under review by the upper house of
Parliament so it was still on the books.

China to spend dlrs 36 million to get pandas to socialize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China plans to spend more than 300 million yuan
(dlrs 36 million) on a plan to encourage different groups of giant
pandas to mix with each other and prevent inbreeding, an official
report said Tuesday.
	   Human encroachment has seriously destroyed the endangered
animal's habitats, cutting pandas off from each other and stopping
the exchange of genes from one group to another, the Xinhua News
Agency said.
	   In response, Xinhua said 17 ``green corridors'' will be created
in the provinces of Gansu, Sichuan and Shaanxi where pandas live to
promote ``communications'' between the animals.
	   The corridors will be converted from farmland and roads and
planted with trees and bamboo, Xinhua said.
	   The giant panda is native only to China, with only about 1,000
surviving in the wild. The shrinking of their habitat and poaching
have devastated the species. The animal also suffers from a low
reproductive rate.

65 percent of rural population have no access to clean water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ About 65 percent of Vietnam's rural
residents do not have access to clean water and 80 percent lack
safe sanitation facilities, UNICEF said.
	   The estimations were based on a recent survey in nine provinces
by UNICEF and some government agencies. About 80 percent of
Vietnam's 78 million people live in the countryside.
	   Since 1983, UNICEF has invested dlrs 30 million to build 183,000
new water sources for 20 million people throughout the country,
UNICEF official Waldemar Pickardt said Monday.
	   He said UNICEF hopes to spend dlrs 4 million to dlrs 5 million
over the next two years on improving the water supply and
sanitation facilities for the 1,000 poorest communes in 23
provinces.
	   The government has set a target of supplying clean water to 80
percent of the rural population by the year 2000.
	   Pickardt said whether the target can be achieved is very much
dependent on investment by the government and donor countries.

China's economy-boosting spending thwarted by poor planning:
</HEADLINE>
Official &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A recently issued Chinese government bond
intended to finance infrastructure projects and fuel economic
growth hasn't been fully implemented due partly to poor local
planning, according to a senior finance ministry official.
	   As of the end of September, only one-third of a recently issued
100 billion yuan (dlrs 12.10 billion) bond for infrastructure and
flood rebuilding has been invested in projects, Tuesday's China
Securities News quoted Lou Jiwei, vice minister of finance, as
saying.
	   Lou blamed the low level of investment on complicated
procedures, rushed planning and a lack of land available for
construction, the state-run newspaper said.
	   China has stepped up investment in construction of housing,
roads and other infrastructure to help stimulate lagging economic
growth and ward off the malaise afflicting most of its neighbors.
	   However, questions remain over whether such spending can be put
to productive use given China's track record for inappropriate and
inefficient investment, particularly by local officials.
	   Lou urged local governments to prevent misuse of the bond funds,
which were issued under special circumstances that won't be
repeated each year, the report said.
	   The government has said it will invest dlrs 1.2 trillion over
the next three years to maintain annual economic growth of 8
percent _ the level thought necessary to create enough jobs and
maintain social stability.

Prosecution recommended for 72 in biggest smuggling case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The Police Ministry has recommended
prosecution of 72 people on charges of smuggling and graft in
Vietnam's biggest smuggling scam.
	   Most of the 49 state employees accused in the case are Customs
officers in four provinces, including Ho Chi Minh City, the
Liberated Saigon newspaper said Monday.
	   The smuggling ring, involving the Tan Truong Sanh private
company, was uncovered in October 1997 when police raided an army
warehouse rented by the company and discovered a huge amount of
smuggled electronic goods.
	   Police estimated the ring smuggled in goods worth nearly 400
billion dong (dlrs 29 million) in the previous two years.
	   Tan Truong Sanh allegedly collaborated with corrupt Customs
officers to declare electronic goods, which are subject to import
duty of up to 60 percent, as materials like yarn assessed at only
zero percent to 5 percent.
	   The company also rented warehouses from some army units and
police to hide the smuggled goods.
	   The government has tried to crack down on smuggling, which
threatens fledgling local industries, but the problem continues to
be rampant.

Singapore launches ambitious program to train workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore unveiled an ambitious five-year plan
on Tuesday to try to teach half its work force skills needed to
become more competitive in business.
	   ``Knowledge and skills of a work force will become the key
competitive factors for success,'' said Manpower Minister Lee Boon
Yang, after announcing that 200 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 123
million) had been earmarked for the training program.
	   The program will ensure literacy, develop communication skills
and encourage creativity and problem-solving. It also seeks to
boost efficiency and develop workers' organizational and leadership
qualities.
	   Singapore has long sought to mold its populace into a
world-class work force. Programs since the 80s have trained about
400,000 mostly blue-collar workers.
	   The latest plan aims to give them ``the foundation for lifelong
learning,'' said Lee, for fast evolving industries that require
constantly new approaches and techniques.

Report: Indonesia's ruling party finally apologizes for mistakes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Long criticized for its role in
keeping former authoritarian President Suharto in power for three
decades, the ruling Golkar Party has finally apologized for past
political ``mistakes,'' Indonesian media reports said Tuesday.
	   Protests and riots forced Suharto to quit in May amid a deep
economic crisis.
	   But until now, the Golkar Party had steadfastly refused to
apologize for being part of the old autocrat's regime, which has
been accused of corruption and human rights abuses.
	   The Jakarta Post said the party's deputy chairman Marzuki
Darusman announced a change of policy at a political seminar in the
capital on Monday.
	   ``I want to apologize on behalf of Golkar for all of the
mistakes it made in the past,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   Darusman said Golkar needed to rebuild its relations with the
Indonesian people, the report said.
	   During Suharto's era, Golkar was only one of three political
parties allowed to contest what were tightly controlled elections
every five years.
	   It has overwhelmingly dominated Parliament since 1972. At the
most recent election in 1997, it won more than 70 percent of the
vote.
	   However, Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, has
promised to institute political reforms and to hold fresh
democratic elections next May.
	   The reforms are to be discussed next week by the People's
Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative body.
	   Many critics have questioned how far Habibie and the assembly
will push the reform process.
	   Nevertheless, it is certain that Habibie will allow many new
political parties to contest the ballot.
	   Many analysts say Golkar will probably lose its huge
parliamentary majority at the May election, largely because of its
past record.
	   This is even though it has undergone extensive reform within its
own ranks in order to cut its links with Suharto's legacy.
	   It has dumped Suharto as its patron and has purged its ranks of
many of his closest aides.

Jezabeel wins Melbourne Cup after a betting plunge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand mare Jezabeel justified
a big betting plunge when it scored a fighting victory in the Aust
dlrs 2.8 million (U.S. dlrs 1.75 million) Melbourne Cup at
Flemington on Tuesday.
	   Jockey Chris Munce picked Jezabeel back up after fellow-mare
Champagne fizzed past him with 200-meters (yards) to the post.
	   The five-year-old Jezabeel was heavily backed for the
3,200-meter (two-mile) handicap event by punters on course and its
price closed in from 14-1 on Monday to 6-1 at the start.
	   The buildup to the race was dominated by the presence of seven
non-Australasian horses, including overnight favorite Faithful Son.
	   ``When (Champagne) shot past me I thought he'd got me beat _ I
was just glad it was not one of the Europeans,'' said Munce.
	   British horse Persian Punch finished third behind Champagne,
closely followed by compatriots Taufan's Melody and Yorkshire in
fourth and fifth.
	   But Faithful Son, ridden by star jockey Frankie Dettori faded in
the straight and was seventh in the 24-horse field in its first run
over the 3,200 meters (two miles).
	   Faithful Son is owned by the world's No.1 racehorse owner Sheikh
Mohammed bin Rasheed Al Maktoum of Dubai, who attended the race,
and trained at his Godolphin operation in England by Saeed bin
Suroor.
	   Punters nationwide spent about Aust dlrs 150 million (93
million) on the race through betting agencies and on course and
millions more were spent in office sweeps.
	   The host state of Victoria has a public holiday for the race
which is always held on the first Tuesday in November. In other
states the nation almost comes to a standstill to watch the race on
television.
	   There were a record seven non-Australasian entrants in this
year's Cup, with five from Britain and two based in Singapore. The
decision to allow one of internationals, Yorkshire, into the race
ahead of two better qualified locals drew widespread criticism.
	   Bart Cummings, who has won a record 10 Melbourne Cups as
trainer, said a quota should be placed on the imports.
	   ``One could be invited from the UK, one from Europe, one from
Asia and one perhaps from the USA. That would be four and that
should be quite adequate,'' Cummings said.
	   Racing Victoria's international racing manager Les Benton said
the inclusion of overseas horses was the right decision.
	   ``I think (it) is fantastic for Australia,'' Benton said. ``It
ensures that our race is recognized internationally.''

preparing itself for an invasion of millions of insects that are
eating up villagers' crops, an agriculture official said Tuesday.
	   Hordes of brown plant hoppers are on the outskirts of
Phitsanulok, 335 kilometers (208 miles), north of Bangkok, said
Supoj Luangarun, the provincial agriculture officer.
	   ``In terms of damage, we are not in a critical stage and we will
not reach it as long as the public takes proper preventive
measures,'' said Supoj.
	   Provincial authorities are moving about rural areas working long
hours to educate villagers on how to combat the rice-eating pests.
	   Farmers, who will be harvesting their fields in about six weeks,
are told to use non-toxic eradication methods, like installing
lights to attract the insects before killing them and flushing
affected crops with water.
	   They are instructed to use pesticides as the last resort for
fear the chemicals might pose a health hazard to the general
public, he said.
	   Supoj said the planting of rice varieties that do not have a
natural resistance to pests and fewer predators have contributed to
the rapid rise in numbers of hoppers.
	   While fried grass hoppers are popular snacks among rural Thais
the brown plant hopper does not appeal to their taste buds.
	   ``This doesn't help the situation,'' Supoj said.
	   The last infestation occurred eight years ago, when the insects
were so numerous that residents of the city had problems driving.
	   The hoppers are attracted to city lights but do relatively
little damage in urban areas.
