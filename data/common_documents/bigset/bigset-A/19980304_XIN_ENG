<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Peaceful Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday called for a
peaceful solution to the current ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia's
autonomous province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told a press conference
that Athens was concerned over the Kosovo crisis and hoped to end
it through dialogue with respect to the rights of ethnic Albanians
and the unity and sovereignty of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis had discussed the
issue with his Albanian counterpart Fatos Nano by telephone, and
Foreign Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis had also met with the
Yugoslav embassy's charge d'affairs in Athens.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman described Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos's coming visit to Belgrade, scheduled on Friday, as "a
good opportunity" for further consultations.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo heightened on March 1 after an escalation of
a larger armed conflict between Serbian police and local ethnic
Albanians, during which four policemen and 16 Albanians were
killed with another two policemen injured.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority which has been
seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Greece has said that it opposed Kosovo's independence from
Yugoslavia and respected the borders of Yugoslavia, coupled with
prospects for wide-ranging autonomy for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In January, Greece offered to host a meeting between Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, Albanian Prime Minister Nano and the
leader of the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Ibrahim Rugova, to help
resolve the Kosovo problem.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Israel Attempts to Evade UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Tuesday that Israel's proposal to withdraw
from south Lebanon is intended to bypass U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The Likud move is an attempt to evade legitimate (U.N.)
resolutions and draw attention away from its continued violation
of U.N. Security Council resolutions on the Middle East in general
and the Palestinian cause in particular," the AL chief told the
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid pointed out that the Israeli suggestion to pull
out of south Lebanon if security is guaranteed by the Lebanese
government, "completely runs contrary" to the Security Council
Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
"The resolution clearly stipulates full Israeli withdrawal from
south Lebanon and western Bekaa and Lebanon's complete sovereignty
over its lands," he added, quoted by MENA.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted in 1978 after Israel first invaded
Lebanon, calls on it to "immediately cease military action against
the integral territory of Lebanon and to withdraw its forces
without delay from all Lebanese territory."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that
Israeli troops were prepared to withdraw from south Lebanon on
condition that Beirut cooperates on security arrangements in the
area.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel did not want a "unilateral withdrawal which
would increase Hezbollah attacks in northern Israel."
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer "security zone" in south
Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern residents from cross
border guerrilla attacks. The Lebanese resistance movement has
been fighting to end Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's New Cabinet Criticized by Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's opposition Grand
National Party (GNP) said the cabinet members appointed Tuesday by
President Kim Dae-jung are unqualified for their posts.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the new cabinet are old faces short of
administrative experience and professional expertise needed for
their jobs, said the GNP, which occupies 161 seats at the
299-member National Assembly, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
President Kim assigned 12 of the 17 cabinet posts to members of
his National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and its coalition
partner, the United Liberal Democrats (ULD).
</P>
<P>
The appointment of the 12 politicians shows that President Kim
did not take the candidates' professional expertise into
consideration and failed to recruit new figures, spokesman Maeng
Hyung-kyu for the GNP said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The appointments had been delayed by legal disputes over the
nomination of Kim Jong-pil as prime minister. Kim Jong-pil was
finally named as acting prime minister in the new cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the ruling camp defended President Kim, saying
that he appointed the politicians so that they can support his
reform programs when the nation has been sustaining a deepening
financial crisis and political instability.
</P>
<P>
"The president also considered the fact that the National
Assembly is controlled by the opposition," Kim's spokesman Park
Jie-won said. And Kim made the choice so that his minority ruling
coalition parties can maintain a wider political base.
</P>
<P>
He said the president tried to ensure a balance in the regional
background of the candidates by appointing five each from the
southwestern Cholla and southeastern Kyongsang areas.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung is the first president from South Korea's
southwestern part, whose people say they have been discriminated
against by a succession of governments headed by people from the
southeast.
</P>
<P>
Of the 17 cabinet ministers appointed, six are in their 60s, 10
in 50s, and one in 40s.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges EU to Pressure Turkey Ahead of Cyprus' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday urged the European
Union (EU) to exert more pressure upon neighboring Turkey and
northern Cyprus ahead of the beginning of Cyprus' accession talks
with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Greek government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas while commenting on the recent statements by Turkish Deputy
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Turkish Cypriots leader Rauf
Denktash calling for recognition of the northern Cyprus, which
unilaterally declared independent in 1983, but it has been
recognized by no countries except Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the two men for repeating their desires and
subverting the framework set for the resolution of the Cyprus
problem by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
supported by Athens.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided last year to include Cyprus to the list of
countries waiting to join the group, and the accession
negotiations will begin this year, but his did lead to the
opposition by northern Cyprus and its supporter Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Greece has expressed its opposition to the equal participation
of Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus' accession talks with the EU, saying
that it wants them to be involved in the negotiations with two
conditions, namely this would not lead to the recognition of
northern Cyprus and not create obstacles to the island's accession
to the EU.

<HEADLINE> France Welcomes UN Resolution, Sends Envoy to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- France Tuesday welcomed the newly
adopted United Nations Security Council resolution on Iraq, and
sent a presidential envoy to Baghdad in a further step to push
Iraq fully implement its agreement with U.N. Secretary-General.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret said
that the U.N. Resolution 1154 is "very balanced" and France is
"entirely satisfied" with it.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that the resolution "excludes any idea of
automatic strike" against Iraq if it fails to implement its
agreement with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is clear: It is for the Security Council to
evaluate the behavior of a country, in this case Iraq, to make if
need be the statement of possible violations and fix in
consequence the decisions," she said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general of the French Foreign Ministry Bertrand
Dufourcq, who is carrying a letter from President Jacques Chirac
to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, is expected to arrive in
Baghdad Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"In the wake of the Security Council vote, the envoy of
President Chirac will stress the importance France pays to the
complete and rapid application of the agreement reached on
February 23... which is adopted by the Resolution 1154," said the
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Chirac said that Iraq has the right to return to
the international community on the condition that it plays the
game according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
"The envoy will also raise the perspective of the lifting of
sanctions as soon as Baghdad has fulfilled its obligation in terms
of elimination of weapons of mass destruction," she added.

<HEADLINE> Bank Employees Continue Strike Across Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Major Kenyan banks remained
closed Tuesday, the fourth day of the strike of bank employees
who demand an immediate scrapping of the newly-introduced
low-interest benefit tax.
</P>
<P>
The Standard Bank Ltd, Barclays Bank, Commercial Bank of Kenya,
Development Bank of Kenya, Delphis Bank, Blashara Bank, and Post
Bank were all closed with a notice saying they could not operate
due to the strike by a number of their employees.
</P>
<P>
More than two hundred people formed long queues under the hot
sun outside the National Bank of Kenya, which still opened but
"extremely goes slow" because of lack of enough staff, an
eyewitness told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It was said about 50 affiliate members of the Kenya Union of
Commercial Food and Allied Workers took part in the strike
Tuesday, putting more pressures on the government as customers
were suffering.
</P>
<P>
The Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU) and the Kenya
National Chamber of Commerce and Industry have asked the
government to quickly resolve the dispute, warning the strike
could bring the economy to a "grinding halt."
</P>
<P>
The strikers were demanding the government to quickly rescind
the new 22 percent interest rate imposed on employees' loans and
allowances, saying the tax contradicted the government's policy
of asking bankers to lower their interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Most branches of the 53-member Kenya Bankers Association have
took part in the strike since last Friday across the east African
country.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of All Banks Shopstewards Committee (ABSC) Jacob
Opiyo, at the beginning of the strike, vowed that
employees of all banks would continue with the strike until the
Ministry of Finance scrapped the new tax rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) Friday accused the
ABSC of misleading its members, saying that under the Income Tax
Act, the general policy in Kenya has always been that all
remuneration provided to employees are taxable.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Friday, the KRA said that the 22 percent
rate is far below what the Kenyan public is paying for commercial
loans where the interest ranges between 30 and 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tussle between the government and bank employees on the
issue of taxation has been going on for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
The new rate of tax ranging from 15 percent to 22 percent is
based on the average 91-day treasury bill rate for the relevant
quarter.

KATHMANDU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A Nepali aircraft carrying Prime
Minister Surya Bahadur Thapa Tuesday made a safe emergency landing
at the capital's international airport, the official RSS news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off at 10:30 a.m. for Biratnagar, about 250
kilometers southeast of Kathmandu. Thapa was flying there to
inaugurate a seminar, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
But the plane could not land in Biratnagar because its nose
wheel developed a technical snag. As the airport there has no
emergency landing facilities, the plane flew back to Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft landed at the Tribhuvan International Airport,
suffering some damage, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister and 48 other passengers were evacuated
without injuries, it added.

<P>
It said a nine-member committee is investigating the accident.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Security Council Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government expressed
endorsement here Tuesday to the U.N. Security Council Resolution
on Iraq and warned that severe consequences will follow if Baghdad
fails to comply with the resolution.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in a statement issued
Tuesday afternoon that Britain "Welcomes Security Council
Resolution 1154 adopted overnight in New York. It is a clear
endorsement by the United Nations of the agreement made by
Secretary General (Kofi Annan) during his recent visit to Iraq".
</P>
<P>
"The Resolution is an expression of the Security Council's
determination to ensure full Iraqi compliance with all the U.N.
Resolutions in place to deal with Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook, whose country is the staunchest American ally in the
latest U.N.-Iraq crisis, warned: "Should Saddam break his
agreement with the United Nations, the Resolution makes clear that
severest consequences will follow."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC Radio interview, Cook said: "The ball is now
in Saddam Hussein's court. If he wants to return normality to the
lives of people in Iraq all he has to do is to comply with the
undertakings he has given."
</P>
<P>
"But if he breaks them, then there will be entirely different
consequences," Cook added. But he declined to spell out what
action might be contemplated should Iraq again flaunt the United
Nation's wishes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair told
reporters that British troops in the Gulf Region will remain in
combat position until it was clear that Iraq would accept the
latest U.N. Resolution on Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Vernon Jordan, a close friend
of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Tuesday appeared before a federal
grand jury investigating accusations that Clinton asked former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky to deny their alleged affair.
</P>
<P>
Arriving at the U.S. District Court Tuesday morning, Jordan
refused to answer reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
White House Press secretary Mike McCurry said "luckily, someone
who knows the facts" will be testifying. He described Jordan as
a "truthful and honest man."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the truth will help the president, McCurry said,
"Absolutely."
</P>
<P>
McCurry denied the Lewinsky case had strained the friendship
between Clinton and Jordan, but he said they no longer discuss it
for legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is investigating why Jordan
helped Lewinsky get a job while she was providing an affidavit in
Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Jordan had said Clinton and Lewinsky assured him there
was no sexual relationship between them, and that Clinton's
private secretary, Betty Currie, asked him to help Lewinsky find a
job.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's attorney, William Ginsburg, reportedly said his
client sought Jordan's help in early November, before she knew she
would be a witness in the Jones case.

<HEADLINE> Crop Yields Drop Sharply in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Major crops from the January
harvest in Somalia have been drastically reduced by heavy rains
and floods caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon, said
a World Food Program (WFP) harvest assessment report.
</P>
<P>
Maize production has fallen to an alarming 11 percent of last
year's so-called Deyr harvest, while the overall sorghum crop
dropped by half, said the report issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A normal level of production is 20 times greater than the
current harvest. War, drought and now floods have made this level
of production impossible," Burk Oberle, WFP Country Director for
Somalia, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Although farmers cultivated more land last year, the harvest
was almost destroyed by torrential rains and widespread flooding
of the rivers," Oberle noted.
</P>
<P>
"People in the Lower Juba and Shabelle areas are still
suffering intensely, and will need our help until at least June
when the next harvest starts to come in," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The WFP is currently operating one C-130 Hercules, one Buffalo
aircraft, one helicopter and two boats for the Somalia operation.
Since the end of November last year, it has delivered 7,200 tons
of food to the Somali flood victims.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. agency also made appeals last month for 12.8 million
U.S. Dollars for the emergency flood operation in southern
Somalia. Now the shortfall totals four million Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Zimbabwe Remains Calm Despite Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Situation in Zimbabwe is calm
despite the country's trade union Tuesday started its two-day
national mass stay-away from work, the Zimbabwean News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Most of the urban centers in the country were closed Tuesday
as workers heeded a call from the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) to stay at home for two days in protest against
rising prices of basic commodities and unpopular government taxes
and levies.
</P>
<P>
The central business district in the capital Harare came to a
standstill. Most banks and schools were closed with heavy
presence of riot police at main roads leading in and out of the
city center.
</P>
<P>
In Bulawayo, the country's second largest city, virtually all
private businesses stopped Tuesday morning as workers
overwhelmingly heeded the call by the ZCTU for a national strike.
</P>
<P>
But there is no sign of the promised heavy police and army
presence around businesses and the situation might remain the
same because there were no indication of a possible outbreak of
violence, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
In the central city of Gweru, business also came to a halt in
the city center and at the industrial sites as most shops
remained closed.
</P>
<P>
The police are on full alert and are patrolling the streets in
both the low and high density suburbs to ensure that no violence
takes place during the strike.
</P>
<P>
Most of the workers in the eastern border city of Mutare
responded to the trade union's call for the strike, resulting in
a partial closure of industry and commerce. Police and soldiers
were deployed in the city to ensure the protection of property
and human life.
</P>
<P>
The ZCTU declared February 27 as a deadline for the government
to scrap the 2.5 percent sales tax, five percent development levy
and 15 percent tax on pensions.
</P>
<P>
In January, thousands of residents in the capital city Harare
and towns staged the demonstrations in protest against rising
prices. Some of them looted, destroyed properties, causing
million of Dollars losses.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- An Ugandan medical officer said
malaria cases in Uganda increased this year compared to last
year's 28,700, according to a local press report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Geofrey Kabagambe, Director of Medical Services of Kabarole
District, disclosed that 36,629 cases of severe malaria were
registered in the district between November 1997 and January 31
this year. About 102 of these died and 60 percent of the dead are
children below five, he added.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the problem to the increase in mosquitos
following the flooding caused by the El-Nino weather phenomenon.
He also blamed the local people for failing to take preventive
measures.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Provide $1.6 Million for S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's Flanders Province
will provide 1.6 million U.S. Dollars for South Africa's
educational, cultural and technological development over the next
two years.
</P>
<P>
The projects will also cover the areas of arts, science and
sport, according to delegations from South Africa and Flanders,
which were meeting in Pretoria this week to work out a program
under a cooperative agreement signed in October, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Gert Grobler, South African Foreign Department's Chief
Director for Europe, said the two sides had a very constructive
and fruitful round of discussions, South African Press
Association reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Director-General of the Flanders Department of Cooperation,
Administration and Foreign Policy, Diane Verstraeten, said that
the projects included an exchange program for students studying
science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The money would also be used to train South African
non-governmental organizations which provide aids to the youth,
and sport and recreation organizations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-five percent of the projects were expected to be
realized within two years with the funding of the Belgian
province, and the rest would be catered for by the South African
government, Verstraeten said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the cooperation fund, Flanders will give another 25
million Rand (5.07 million Dollars) in grant to South Africa this
year.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch-speaking province donated 70 million Rand (14.2
million Dollars) for South African development projects from 1995
to 1997, with 30 million Rand (6.1 million Dollars) last year
alone.
</P>
<P>
Belgium ranked among South Africa's top 10 trading and
investment partners.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Firms Which Closed to Be Punished: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government Tuesday
said it would punish those companies and financial institutions
that closed their business on the first day of a nationwide
stayaway.
</P>
<P>
Industry and Commerce Minister Nathan Shamuyarira told a news
conference here that the two-day work boycott called by the
Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) was illegal and business
people who closed their premises denying employees to chance the
work would be censured.
</P>
<P>
"The government is going to punish those companies which
closed their premises today and, therefore, denied workers who
wanted to work the opportunity to do so," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He, however, did not say what punishment would be taken or
what legislation the government would invoke to deal with those
businesses that defied the call by the government to ignore the
work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
Most commercial banks, building societies, financial
institutions, post offices, light and heavy industries, retail
shops and chain stores in Harare and other towns closed their
doors as thousands of workers responded to the ZCTU call.
</P>
<P>
The minister said parastatal bodies such as post offices that
closed on Tuesday would face disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of the work boycott, the government would
now not negotiate with ZCTU.

MOGADISHU, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leaders Tuesday
announced here that they have overcome what they called the snags
that hindered their efforts in pursuing the Cairo peace agreement
and the establishment of an inclusive administration for
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
However, the faction leaders did not specify the obstacles
they met.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing at Hotel Sahafi in the capital Tuesday,
Ali Mahdi Mohamed, a major faction leader, expressed his sorrow
over the delay for a quick understanding among the concerned
faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added that during this period the faction
leaders have been busy holding consultative meetings for
shortening the gap between them.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mahdi Mohamed has declared that the Mogadishu politicians
will from Tuesday work so closely together and that the Nation
Coordination Committee (the Cairo signatories) can start
fulfilling their duties.
</P>
<P>
Husseion Mohamed Aidid also said at the meeting that they have
now unified their ideas in restoring peace and the Somali dignity
in general.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed the administration for the capital will be
completed in eight days time, adding that the pacification of the
capital will be given priority so as to open the main facilities
of the air and sea ports which have been closed since 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Tuesday, the faction leaders have also for
the first time said they will unite the programs broadcast on the
factional radioes that operated in the capital during the civil
war.
</P>
<P>
Since their arrival in Mogadishu after signing the historic
Cairo peace deal late December last year, the faction leaders
have managed to abolish the green lines that divided Mogadishu
for the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
They have also facilitated the return of life around the
deserted former front lines.

<P>
ANKARA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces seized 47
kilograms of pure heroin in an operation against drug trafficking
in eastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that acting on a tip-off, the security forces
gave a "warning" to two suspected drug smugglers near Dolucikin
village of Gurpinar town of Van province at small hours Tuesday
morning and an armed clash broke out between the security forces
and the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
After the half-hour-long exchange of fire, the security forces
slightly wounded the two smugglers and confiscated the heroin on
two horses, the agency said, adding that the wounded smugglers
had been taken to Van State Hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a key transit route of drugs to Europe from the "Gold
Crescent" area overlapping Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran. In
1996, the police seized 4.4 tonnes of heroin, or 40 percent of the
world's total haul.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Tries to Ease Refuge Crisis in Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said Tuesday the agency is seeking
159 million U.S. Dollars to help hundreds of thousands of
refugees in five Great Lakes countries.
</P>
<P>
The funding will finance UNHCR's ongoing programs both to
repatriate and reintegrate about 400,000 refugees living in
Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of
Congo, she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The money will also be used in projects to rehabilitate health
centers, schools, water projects, forestry and crop and livestock
production.
</P>
<P>
In the last two years, more than 1.3 million Rwandan and
175,000 Burundi refugees already returned home. Now Tanzania is
the largest host country with 260,000 Burundi and 70,000
Congolese exiles.
</P>
<P>
During her recent trip to the region, Ogata promised continued
help for refugees from Congo-Brazzaville who fled to neighboring
Kinshasa during a five-month civil war last year.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR funding requirements are part of a consolidated U.N.
inter-agency appeal for 550 million U.S. Dollars announced Friday
by the Office of the Co-ordinator for Humanitarian Affairs in New
York.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
announced that it will proceed to important lay-offs of public
sector's employees, the Rwanda News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The lay-offs are scheduled to begin on April 1, Rwandan Prime
Minister Pierre Celestin Rwigema told reporters on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"This decision is aimed at developing the economy and to
increase salaries of government workers," said
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The workers who will be affected by this measure include those
without qualification, the aged who must retire and those the
prime minister labeled as "indisciplined at work."
</P>
<P>
Soon after the 1994 genocide, the Rwandan government was
advised by the World Bank not to recruit more than 50 percent of
the pre-genocide employees.
</P>
<P>
However, the government failed to abide by this advice and
hired 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Labor Joseph Nsengimana proposed to
the workers who will lose their jobs to look for other
professions and to form associations that the government could
support.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Shoot Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. nation-wide sales of
new homes shot up 10.3 percent in January, the biggest increase in
more than four years, the Commerce Department reported here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
New single-family homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 877,000, the second-highest level on record, according to
the department.
</P>
<P>
The increase, from a rate of 795,000 in December, was the most
since September 1993. The level matched November's and was
exceeded, in records stretching back to 1963, only by the 880,000
rate in March 1986.
</P>
<P>
The bullish new home sales rate in January, powered by
double-digit gains in the West and South, provided a fast start
for builders in 1998. However, some economists don't expect this
year to match the strong growth in 1997, when a 19-year high of
803,000 homes were sold.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed the growth was mainly stimulated by low
mortgage rate. In January, mortgage rates dropped to four-year lows
as investors pulled money from troubled Asian economies and poured
it into the relative safety of U.S. financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The monthly sales also may have been helped in many parts of
the country by El Nino, which has caused flooding and mud slides
in California but given much of the rest of the nation an
unusually mild winter.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, new home sales skyrocketed 19 percent in the West
to an annual rate of 238,000 and 13.1 percent in the South to a
rate of 405,000. They edged down 1.4 percent in the Northeast to a
rate of 72,000 and 1.2 percent in the Midwest to 162,000.
</P>
<P>
The median price of a new home, meaning half sold for more and
half for less, was 148,000 dollars in January, up 2.1 percent from
a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Goldenberg Corruption Case Goes to Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Notorious Goldenberg corruption
case, connected with high-level Kenyan governmental officials and
a thorny issue for foreign donors, returned to court Tuesday when
defense lawyers demanded a fast trial against years of delays.
</P>
<P>
"My client was first accused in 1994 and we have waited till
today to learn what the prosecution wants to hurl at us," said
Aurelio Rebelo, defense counsel for chief defendant Kamlesh
Pattni of Golderberg International Ltd, according to Kenya News
Agency's reports.
</P>
<P>
However, Director of Public Prosecution Benaro Chunga said
Tuesday that delays are normal in such cases as defense lawyers
tried hard to get the termination of charges through preliminary
applications both before the trial court and the high court which
took a lot of time to finalize.
</P>
<P>
Pattni, former Treasury Permanent Secretary Wilfred Koinange
and two former senior officers at the Central Bank were accused
of the theft of 5.8 billion Shillings (about 97 million U.S.
Dollars) from the Kenyan government in the guise of gold and
diamond exports in 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, the four accused Tuesday pleaded not guilty at
Nairobi Magistrates' Court to a total of 15 counts including
theft, fraud and forgery at the beginning of the trial,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
After the prosecution's opening statement, Chief Magistrate
Uniter Kidullah adjourned the case until Wednesday
when the prosecution is due to call its first witness.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) cited corruption and the
failure to bring the Goldenberg scandal to court as one reason
for suspending a 205-million-Dollar aid package to the east
African country in mid last year.
</P>
<P>
The Goldenberg International Ltd used a 1974 law designed to
promote exports to make allegedly fraudulent applications for
compensation payments from the government-run Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed with George Saitoti, then
vice-president and now serving as Minister for Planning and
National Development, the company was given a monopoly of gold
and diamond exports and a 35 percent bonus meant to compensate
exporters in advance of payment by export customers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore Golderberg was paid 185 million Shillings by the
government even though the country has no diamonds and produces
little gold.

ABU DHABI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein bin Talal
arrived here Wednesday afternoon on a two-day visit, the official
Wam news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Hussein will hold talks with president of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and other UAE senior officials on
"further boosting bilateral relations," the agency said.
</P>
<P>
He will also discussed with them the latest developments in
the Gulf region, in particular the accord signed between Iraq and
the United Nations last week on peacefully resolving the crisis
over U.N. arms inspections in Iraq, it added.
</P>
<P>
Wam gave no more details, but informed sources here said that
the Jordanian king will focus his discussions on improving
relations and expanding trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has generally been left out in the cold by the UAE and
the other Gulf countries since the 1990's Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, because the king then sided with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf war which drove Iraqi troops out of Kuwait,
Amman made effort to mend fences with the oil-rich Gulf states.
King Hussein has visited the region except Kuwait several times.

LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua)-- The British company that helped to

that it has produced the human blood clotting agent Factor IX from
the milk of transgenic sheep.
</P>

PPL Therapeutics said in a statement that the success "will be

</P>
<P>
Factor IX, which is essential in the blood clotting process,
can be used to treat haemophiliacs, who often have deficiencies in
the protein.
</P>
<P>
The commercial production of Factor IX from the milk of
transgenic sheep, which is genetically engineered to carry the
human gene, will provide a cheap and safe source of the protein.
</P>
<P>
PPL, one of world's leading companies in the production of
human proteins in the milk of transgenic animals, has also used
genetically engineered sheep to produce AAT, a human protein used

<P>
MAPUTO, March 3 (Xinhua) -- With only 400 native doctors for

<HEADLINE> UN Chief on Council's Approval of UN-Iraq Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- It has been a tough period
for all and he is very pleased by the unanimous approval by the
United Nations Security Council of the deal he negotiated with the
Government of Iraq, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on
Wednesday in a statement issued by his spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is a chance for Iraq to comply with the Security
resolutions and give free unrestricted access to the United
Nations Special Commission ((UNSCOM)). The United Nations has
taken certain obligations in the way it deals with Iraq and Iraq
has undertaken to fulfill its obligations," Annan said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
"I hope this is a new chapter. I trust that if both sides were
to honor their engagements that we have entered into, we will be
moving into a period when Iraq will complete its obligation and
the Council can being thinking of lifting the sanctions and Iraq
will be admitted back into the world of Nations," the UN chief
said.
</P>
<P>
On February 13, Annan negotiated the Memorandum of
Understanding with Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, which ended
the latest crisis over UN weapons inspection in Iraq and avoided a
possible American military strike against Iraq. The UN chief
received a hero's welcome in the Headquarters of the United
Nations when he came back to his office form Baghdad.

<P>
LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth Ministerial Action
Group (CMAG) began its meeting on Nigeria's transition to civil
rule program Monday in London, with Britain proposing another
CMAG visit to Nigeria to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are Stan Mduenge, the CMAG chairman and
Zimbabawean Foreign Minister, British Foreign Office Minister
Tony Lloyd, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworth and the
foreign ministers of Babados, Botswana, Ghana, Malaysia and New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Axworth reportedly said that the entire transition program was
tailored toward self-succession, without necessarily
accommodating the views of the opposition or providing a
conductive atmosphere for them to participate.
</P>
<P>
He noted that with just a few months to the August 1
presidential election, credible candidates are yet to indicate
any interest to contest.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG was put in place shortly after Nigeria was suspended
from the Commonwealth in November 1995, following its execution
of nine minority activists for murder.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG visited Nigeria in November 1996.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Clashes With Cameroun in Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria denied media reports
Tuesday that its troops clashed with Camerounian soldiers on the
disputed Bakassi Peninusla at the weekend, saying that it is a
propaganda by the Camerounians.
</P>
<P>
Briefing defense correspondents in Lagos, Acting Defense
Spokesman Colonel Godwin Ugob said the Nigerian troops on the
peninsula have been calm and that there was no exchange of fire.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian newspapers Tuesday carried a report by the British
Broadcasting Corporation that Nigerian troops took a surprise
attack on the peninsula at the weekend, killing at least seven
Camerounian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the report is false and unfounded and that
it is a propaganda employed by the Camerounians when the issue is
approaching resolution.
</P>
<P>
Report of the clash came just as the International Court of
Justice at the Hague resumed hearing on the Bakassi dispute
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroun both claim sovereignty over the Bakassi
Peninsula in the Guinea Gulf, which is of the size of about 1,000
square kilometers and is believed to be rich in oil resources.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have had several clashes over the peninsula
since 1994. Cameroun filed the case to the international court in
1995.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Said to Block Israeli Troop Pullback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli army
intelligence officer claimed on Tuesday that Hezbollah has warned
the Lebanese government against reaching any security arrangements
with Israel for its withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the officer, who was not identified, made
the statement in a briefing to Knesset's (parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
The officer said the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God,
contends that the Lebanese army is to defend Lebanon, not Israel,
in an effort to prevent the Lebanese government from meeting
Israeli demand.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that it will pull back from south Lebanon if the
Lebanese government promises to curb cross-border attacks on
Israel by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish states carved out a "security zone" in south Lebanon
in 1985 manned with 1,500 soldiers and 2,000 South Lebanon Army
militiamen, for what it called protecting its northern areas from
attacks by resistance forces, which have been fighting to end
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli officer said Hezbollah has been stepping up its
actions recently against the background of an up-heating debate in
Israel over troop withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli presence in south Lebanon has been costly, with
hundred of its troops having been killed. Last month, another nine
soldiers lost their lives in clashes with resistance forces,
putting more pressure on the government for a unilateral pullback.
</P>
<P>
So far, Lebanon has reacted with a resounding no to Israel's
offer, the Israeli officer said, terming this as the result of
Syrian attitude.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government maintains that Israel's proposal on
troop pullback is nothing new and that Lebanon will accept nothing
less than an unconditional withdrawal by Israel, as stipulated in
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that Syria, a main power in the Israeli-Arab
peace process whose 40,000 troops are now stationed in Lebanon,
does not allow Lebanon to conceive peace unilaterally with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Syria is holding the situations in south Lebanon as a leverage
for getting back its territory the Golan Heights, which was
captured in 1967 by Israel, he added.

LUSAKA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Tourism Minister Amusa
Mwanamwambwa said here Tuesday that there are about 76,440
crocodiles in Zambia's seven rivers,
</P>
<P>
He told parliament that there are 15,000 in Luangwa, 13,200 in
Kafue, 16,800 in Zambezi, 12,480 in Luapula, 9,600 in Chambeshi,
2,160 in Lusupa and 7,200 in Kabompo.
</P>
<P>
Only one census had been conducted since 1965, he said, adding
that it will cost the government 50 million Kwacha (about 33,000
U.S. Dollars) to carry out a census on the crocodile population
in the major rivers of the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged crocodile farmers to take advantage of the
population of the reptiles and harvest some of them from
over-populated rivers.
</P>
<P>
There are some people killed by crocodiles every year in
Zambia. The minister has directed wild life scouts to kill
crocodiles which are terrorizing people in various places in the
country.

<P>
KAMPALA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's parliament Tuesday
passed a censure motion against Jum Muhwezi, State Minister for
Education.
</P>
<P>
In a parliament session chaired by Speaker James Wapakhabulo,
the parliamentarians voted 148 for and 91 against the motion in a
secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
The motion was raised on the ground of corruption, violation
of code of Uganda People's Defense Forces (UPDF) and blackmailing
parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
Muhwezi was an officer of UPDF, Uganda's armed forces, before
shifting to the post of state minister.
</P>
<P>
Some parliamentarians accused Muhwezi for engagement in
business with foreigners, which is in violation of the code of
UPDF.
</P>
<P>
Muhwezi is the first high ranking official and parliamentarian
censured by parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan authorities have repeatedly reaffirmed its
decision to fight corruption. Early this year, Ugandan President
Yoweri Museveni asked all officials to declare publicly their
estates, the estates of their spouse and children.

Despite the approval by the Security Council of the United

Iraq has kept complaining that what limits its oil export
capacity are the old oil pipelines and lacking of spare parts of

sanctions.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan stressed Tuesday that the resolution and discussions
of the United Nations Security Council is very clear that "we
should give this resolution a chance."
</P>
<P>
Asked by reporters if there is any ambiguity in the council's
resolution as to the use of force and if there is room for the
United States to act unilaterally to launch any strike against
Iraq without coming to the Security Council, the secretary-general
said, "We should give this agreement a chance to work and there
are expectations on all sides that the engagements and the
understanding will be honored."
</P>
<P>
Answering the question about the "severest consequences" in the
council's resolution, Annan said, "I think the implication there
is that any policy of patience and diplomatic approaches do have a
limit. If one breaks it time and time again, there may be a price
to pay, and I hope this will not be necessary."
</P>
<P>
"I think that in 1991 Iraq had not had this experience. Today
there is history. The Iraqi leadership and the Iraqi people
remember what happened in 1991 and subsequent bombardments. And I
think they knew what would have happened if they had not complied
this time. There can be no vision without a sense of history. And
I think that history has played an important role here," Annan
added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council Monday unanimously adopted
a resolution, endorsing the Memorandum of Understanding reached by
the U.N. chief and the Iraqi government on February 23, which
ended the latest standoff between the United Nations and Iraq over

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects US Criticism of Anti-drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday rejected the
criticism of the United States that it has not been fully
cooperative in stopping international drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-narcotics Campaign Headquarters issued a statement
saying the United Nations and the International Police have
confirmed and lauded Iran's measures in combating drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
"Any judgement regarding the anti-narcotics measures by
countries should be done by international organizations," the
statement said, quoted by Iran's official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, though terming
Iran's anti-drug efforts as "encouraging" on Thursday, said it has
not been cooperating fully to stop international drug shipment.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Iran has spent 350 million U.S. dollars
to cut off narcotics transit routes in the eastern frontiers and
built walls along its borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan, where
the drugs was planted, harvested and processed.
</P>
<P>
Evidences have showed Iran's political resolves to combat
narcotics and drug trafficking, the statement argued.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian anti-drug officials have said that Iran has
captured an average of 160 tonnes of various narcotics each year
over the last years.
</P>
<P>
Iran is one of the key routes used by traffickers to ship drugs
produced in the "Golden Crescent" overlapping Iran, Pakistan and
Afghanistan to Europe, and it has witnessed a serious social
problem triggered by drug abuses.
</P>
<P>
To tighten the screw on drug smuggling, Iran passed a strict
anti-drug law in January 1989 to slap the death penalty to those
who are caught with 30 grams of heroin or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that more than 3,000 drug smugglers have been
executed and hundreds of thousands of drug addicts jailed in Iran
since the law took effect.

<HEADLINE> U.S. CBO Projects 8 Billion U.S. Dollars Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The Congressional Budget Office
(CBO) of the United States projects an 8 billion U.S. dollar
surplus for this year, the first time the U.S. government would
record no a deficit since 1969, according to an AP report here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The CBO, Congressional nonpartisan, official budget analyst is
expected to release the information later in the day. It will be
the first official projection of budget surplus for this fiscal
year which runs through September 30.
</P>
<P>
CBO was also forecasting surpluses of 9 billion dollars for
1999, 1 billion dollars for 2000, 13 billion dollars for 2001, 67
billion dollars for 2002 and 53 billion dollars for 2003.
</P>
<P>
The projections come as some lawmakers from both parties and
the administration are debating on whether to use surpluses to pay
for tax cuts or spending boosts this year or enhancing Social
Security. The projection could dampen those people's expectations
since the surpluses for the next two years would be such a small
fraction of an annual budget exceeding 1.7 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the White House said it expected a 10 billion
dollar deficit this year but a 9.5 billion dollar surplus for
1999. The next updated White House projection is not due until the
Summer.

<P>
NAIROBI, March 3 (Xinhua) -- As the strike by Kenya's bank
employees entered the fourth day Tuesday, major Kenyan banks
fired over 15,000 strikers who had been demanding to immediately
scrap the new tax on their soft loans and allowances.
</P>
<P>
Each bank employee received a letter of dismissal that listed
contractual obligations for the decision, the Kenya Television
Network (KTN) reported Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Central Organization of Trade Unions (COTU),
organizer of the strike, said it is discussing whether to call a
general strike in support of bank workers.
</P>
<P>
The bank workers from at least 53 banks across this eastern
African country launched the strike Friday, vowing they will not
return to work until the government calls off the decision on the
new tax hike.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday night, Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae met
representatives of the Kenya Bankers Association on the crisis,
urging them to prepare a memorandum for presentation to
parliament.
</P>
<P>
It was said that about 50 affiliate members of the Kenya Union
of Commercial Food and Allied Workers took part in the strike
Tuesday, putting more pressures on the government as customers
complained.

<P>
Earlier, both the COTU and the Kenya National Chamber of
Commerce and Industry have asked the government to quickly
resolve the dispute, warning the strike could bring the economy
to a "grinding halt."
</P>
<P>
The strikers were requesting the government to quickly rescind
the new 22 percent interest rate imposed on employees' loans and
allowances, saying the tax contradicted with the government's
policy which asks bankers to lower their interest rates.
</P>
<P>
However, the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) argues that under
the Income Tax Act, the general policy in Kenya has always been
that all remuneration provided to employees are taxable.
</P>
<P>
The new rate of tax ranging from 15 percent to 22 percent is
based on the average 91-day treasury bill rate for the relevant
quarter.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Severest Consequences Mean Military Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Tuesday
that "the severest consequences" in a U.N. Security Council
resolution meant Iraq would face military strikes if it failed to
live up to an agreement on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"The United States clearly has stated, and the president has so
stated, that any reneging on the commitments Iraq has acknowledged
will lead to severest consequences, which very clearly means
military action," White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said President Bill Clinton was expected to comment
later Tuesday on the Security Council resolution passed Monday
night containing the warning to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I expect the president will... talk about the importance of
the Security Council resolution, talk about the imperative of
compliance by Iraq and talk about the consequences that can arise
if there is failure to comply," he said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin also said "the severest
consequences" in the Security Council resolution was "the clearest
possible threat to use force that the Security Council has taken
since this crisis began last year."
</P>
<P>
"The world is now supporting a strong, clear threat that
military force will ensue if Iraq violates this agreement, and
that's why we think this resolution was so important," Rubin told
reporters at a regular briefing.

LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe ended
mixed Tuesday, with London and Paris retreating from their recent
record-breaking rally while Frankfurt extending Monday's gains and
ending at new record high.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index of leading British shares fell from

<P>
BAGHDAD, March 3 (Xinhua) -- French president's special envoy
Bertrand Dufourcq arrived here Tuesday evening to stress the
importance France attaches to the complete and rapid compliance by
Iraq with the U.N.-Iraq accord.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq, secretary general of French foreign ministry, told
reporters upon arrival at Saddam internation Airport that he
would deliver a letter from President Jacques Chirac to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Chirac said in his letter to Saddam that
Iraq has the right to return to the international community on
condition that it plays the game according to the rule.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq, on his second visit to Baghdad within a month, said
he would tell the Iraqi officials the importance to completely
implement the agreement signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and Iraq on February 23.
</P>
<P>
He will raise the perspective of the lifting of sanctions as
soon as Iraq has fulfilled its obligation in terms of elimination
of weapons of mass destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on Monday which
approves the agreement and warns of the "severest consequences"
if Iraq violates the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Dufourcq visited Baghdad as French president's special envoy
early last month to help find a diplomatic solution to the
then standoff between Iraq and the United States over U.N.
weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
France played an important role in blocking a U.S.-led air
strike on Iraq and helping reach the U.N.-Iraq accord on resuming
inspections for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Says Ties With Egypt Key to Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The normalization of relations
with Egypt is key to stability in Sudan, a Sudanese official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Aziz Shaddu, a member of the Sudanese National Assembly
(parliament), was quoted by local media as saying Egypt's role in
peace negotiations between the Khartoum government and the
Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) led by John Garang, would
contribute to a rapprochement between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sudan calls for the participation of Egypt and Saudi Arabia in
the IGADD, the Inter-Governmental Authority for Drought and
Development which is mediating between Sudanese government and the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The IGADD is composed of Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea and
Sudan. Sudan hopes Egyptian and Saudi participation would ease the
mediation process since Khartoum is at odds with Uganda, Ethiopia
and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA is a main rebel faction in southern Sudan which took
up arms in 1983 to press for greater autonomy for the southern
third of the Africa's largest country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides sat at the negotiating table late last October in
the Kenya capital city Nairobi under IGADD sponsorship. But the
talks failed to reach conclusive results. Another round is
scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained since
Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir took power in 1989 in a military
coup and installed an Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral ties reached their lowest point in 1995 when
Cairo accused Khartoum of involvement in an assassination attempt
on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
Sudan denied the charge.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen
announced Tuesday that the U.S. military will begin vaccinating
36,000 American troops in the Gulf this month against the deadly
anthrax biological agent as a "prudent action."
</P>
<P>
He said he had decided to begin the mass innoculations at the
request of Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S.
forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The decision to vaccinate all the 1.4 million military men and
women in uniform was made in December, but the program wasn't
expected to go into practice until this coming summer.
</P>
<P>
But the program was accelerated, and will begin this month with
the forces now in the Gulf region due to the ongoing crisis with
Iraq, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
"After a careful review, I have concluded that vaccination
against anthrax is a safe, prudent force protection measure,"
Cohen said in a statement issued at the Pentagon.

<HEADLINE> Report: Hate Groups Growing in United States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of organized hate
groups in the United States grew last year, mostly through new
chapters of established white power organizations, the Southern
Poverty Law Center said in a report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The research group based in Mongomery, Alabama, said 474 hate
groups and their chapters engaged in some form of racist behavior
in 1997, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The center used a different methodology to count the groups so
previous numbers cannot be directly compared. But if the old
methodology had been used, the latest figures would represent a 20
percent increase from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Most of the newer groups, according to the center, come from a
growth in the number of chapters of groups like the Ku Klux Klan
and churches belonging to the Christian Identity movement, whose
followers cite the Bible as the source for their racist views.
</P>
<P>
The growth in hate groups has been fueled by the Internet and
rock music touting white power and advocating violence against
minorities, the report said. It said there are 163 Web sites that
advocate racial hatred; less than three years ago, there was one.
</P>
<P>
The report said one chapter of the Ku Klux Klan, the American
Knights, expanded from one to 12 chapters last year and that
racist and neo-Nazi Skinheads made a violent comeback in Denver,
Los Angeles and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Poverty Law Center, which was founded in the 1970s
to battle racial bias, won major legal fights against the Ku Klux
Klan and other white supremacist groups. More recently it has been
tracking hate crimes and the spread of racist organizations across
the United States.

<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded 17,491,896 futures and
options contracts last month, according to figures released
Tuesday by the exchange.
</P>
<P>
Average daily volume amounted to 874,595 futures and options
contracts, representing an average daily nominal turnover of
206.53 billion pounds (338.70 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The LIFFE said that since the beginning of the year, it has
traded 38,299,022 futures and options contracts as against
34,757,306 in the same period in 1997, an increase of 10 percent.
Average daily nominal turnover increased by 18 percent from 174.83
billion pounds (286.72 billion dollars) in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
LIFFE Chief Executive Daniel Hodson said, "Following a record
January, February has been yet another high volume month. As we
move towards European Economic and Monetary Union in January 1999,
there is increasing interest in short term interest rate futures
(STIRS), with volumes up 47 percent this year."
</P>
<P>
He added that the LIFFE is dominated in the STIRS area,
increasing its market share of European STIR contracts from 81
percent a year ago to 90 percent.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Chinese Economy to Surpass Eight Percent Growth in 1998 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Xinhua Writer Wang Weiping
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China's 1998 economic growth rate
is expected to surpass eight percent, with inflation remaining at
around three percent.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hong, director-general of the State Statistical Bureau,
said that this year's goals for economic growth will "be
completely achieved." The country's economy will continue to
develop along the track of "high growth and low inflation".
</P>
<P>
Continuing stable political and social environments will be
beneficial to economic expansion. The central government has
announced an overall objective of "seeking development through
stability", a move which fully indicates greater flexibility in
terms of policies, the currency, finances and investments,
according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Strong material conditions which will further promote economic
growth include consecutive bumper harvests over the past three
years and the alleviation of "bottlenecks" related to energy, raw
materials, and transportation. Foreign currency reserves are also
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The fact that pressures from commodity price hikes are
obviously easing offers an ideal macroeconomic environment for
deepening reforms, expanding the opening drive and promoting
economic development, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Bao Kexin, director of the Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation Department under the State Planning Commission noted
that the financial crisis in Southeast Asia and the Republic of
Korea will have only a "limited" negative influence on the
Chinese economy."
</P>
<P>
While exports to the region will definitely be challenged,
great potential remains for the domestic market, especially the
rural market.
</P>
<P>
Bao also noted that massive personal savings deposits held by
Chinese citizens offer excellent conditions for supporting
national economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Calls for Restraint Over Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Hungary Wednesday urged the
conflicting parties in the recent ethnic violence in Yugoslavia's
autonomous province of Kosovo to exercise restraint.
</P>
<P>
Only through negotiations can the conflict have a peaceful and
permanent end, and the possibility to resolve the crisis lies
inside Yugoslavia, said a Foreign Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the violence in Kosovo, the statement said Hungary,
as a neighbor of Yugoslavia, wishes stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo heightened on March 1 after an escalation of
armed conflict between Serbian police and ethnic Albanians, during
which four policemen and 16 Albanians were killed, and two other
policemen injured.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians, who account for 90 percent of the population
in Kosovo, have been seeking independence from Yugoslavia since
1981.

<P>
Increases in total investments, exports and consumer demand,
the three major indicators of economic growth, will approach 10
percent respectively in 1998, according to information
released during the economic work conference held at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must also be made to actively use existing economic
entities by restructuring assets. The installment payment system
should be adopted, rural markets should be expanded, and export
should be increased, said Qiu Xiaohua, general economist with the
State Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said that achieving an eight percent economic growth rate
will signal a 600 billion yuan increase in social demand.
</P>
<P>
In terms of investments, consumption and export demand,
as the last two categories will witness limited marginal rises
the emphasis will be placed on the increase of investment demand.
</P>
<P>
Measures should be adopted to ensure China's aggregate
investment increase by over 400 billion yuan during 1998. This
will require fully considering the appropriateness of steering
private savings deposits of over five trillion yuan into
investments, said Qiu.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that increasing investments should be closely
combined with adjusting the economic structure. Emphasis will be
placed on increasing investments in the agriculture, water
conservancy, public utilities, transportation and environmental
protection sectors, as well as the construction of housing and
technological upgrades.
</P>
<P>
Investors should gain an increasing awareness of risk factors,
and redundant construction should be prevented, according to Qiu.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to restructure some
2,000 medium to large state-owned enterprises, or a third of the
total number of loss-making enterprises in China, and over two
million workers will face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of last year show that some 12
million workers had been dismissed from their jobs, with some 4.8
million people finding new jobs during the year.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Re-elected President Promises to Do Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Israel's President Ezer Weizman
Wednesday promised to do his best to serve the country after being
re-elected for a second five-year term by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a secret balloting, Weizman won a clear majority of 63 votes
in the 120-seat Knesset (parliament) and defeated the challenger
Shaul Amor nominated by the ruling Likud party.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of the results by Knesset
Speaker Dan Tichon, Weizman said in a televised speech that he was
happy with the result, but would not "jump for joy," because what
he was caring about was how to serve the country better.
</P>
<P>
President of Israel is mostly a ceremonial figure. He is meant
to detach from politics and acts as a representative of the whole
nation, regardless of his political, social, religious and
cultural affiliation.
</P>
<P>
But Weizman, a dovish who strongly supports to advance the
Middle East peace process, has been involved in political affairs
more deeply and widely than any of his predecessors and in
disputes with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Weizman has been criticizing the hardline policy of the
rightwing Likud-led coalition on the peace talks with Arab
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He has annoyed Netanyahu so much that he faced a strong
opposition to his effort to seek a second term. The prime minister
went so far as to break with Israel's tradition that an incumbent
president will not be challenged as long as he is intended to seek
a re-election.
</P>
<P>
The two candidates represent different parts of the Israeli
culture. Weizman helped create the Air Force of Israel. As a
general-turned-politician and former defense minister, he played a
key role in negotiating peace with Egypt and called for a revival
of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Amor has for years been mayor of Migdal Haemek, a development
town in northern Israel. He does not have his opponent's links
with the political and military establishments and has regarded
himself as a representative of "second Israel."
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Weizman succeeded in re-election, Netanyahu made
a courtesy call to him, during which they pledged to work together
for the benefits of the country.
</P>
<P>
Observers here have interpreted this as conducive to the
political stability of the country and helpful to move the Middle
East peace process back on track.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) expressed on Wednesday its strong support for
the latest United Nations resolution on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The support was expressed at a meeting of the North Atlantic
Council, the executive body of the western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The council said it supports U.N. Security Council's insistence
on compliance by Iraq with its obligations under the Memorandum of
Understanding and relevant Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 1154 to
warn Iraq of "several consequences" if it fails to live up to the
U.N.-brokered agreement on weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also stated that Iraq's compliance with its
obligations will allow the U.N. Security Council to work toward
lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations currently has more than 400 people in Iraq,

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China's existing buyer's market is
gaining increased integration with the rest of the world,
according to information released today by the State Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The dependence level of China's market on the international
market has jumped from ten percent to around 40 percent over the
past five years.
</P>
<P>
The statistics bureau reports that market expansion has been
accompanied by intensified competition, with the lack of necessary
demand needed to fuel economic restructuring becoming increasingly
apparent and prices falling in favor of buyers.
</P>
<P>
The government has removed price controls on over 90 percent of
commodities over the past five years, with less than five percent
of goods remaining under government control at the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese market exhibited increasingly obvious
characteristics of buyer's market between 1993-1997. Statistics
for 1997 revealed excessive supplies for 31.8 percent of 613 types
of products, with balanced supply and demand for 66.6 percent of
total products. Only 1.6 percent of products were subject to
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Consecutive bumper harvests over the past five years have also
helped to increase supplies and prevent rising prices.

<HEADLINE> China Capable to Cope with Complex Economic Situation: Zhu Rongji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China's
collective leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core is fully
capable to cope with various complicated situation in national
economic development, Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks when referring to the financial crisis in
some Asian countries and the Chinese government's measures to
avoid the negative impact to China in a panel discussion with
members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC), China's top advisory body.
</P>
<P>
China can maintain the good momentum of steady, fast and
healthy economic growth as long as it can "earnestly implement the
various principles and policies already defined by the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council", said the vice-premier, who is
also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Joining discussion with members of the on-going First Session
of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee this afternoon, Zhu also

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputy Calls for Developing Water-Efficient Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Wang Guangping, a peasant deputy
to the Ninth National People's Congress, presented his
water-saving rice cultivation technique to the Ministry of Water
Resources today.
</P>
<P>
Wang is here to attend the first session of the NPC due to open
here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Wang began to work as a peasant in his hometown in east China's
Anhui Province after graduation from senior middle school in 1980.
As his hometown is a dry area, Wang tried to grow paddy rice under
plastic sheets and achieved initial success.
</P>
<P>
In the following year, he expanded his experimental plot to 1.3
ha. Though the fields received little rain for two months, Wang
gathered in a good harvest.
</P>
<P>
The 20-plus water conservancy experts present at today's
discussion all expressed appreciation for Wang's technique.
</P>
<P>
There is a shortfall of 30 billion cubic meters of water in
China each year. Water for agricultural use constitutes 80 percent
of the country's total water consumption. Water-efficient farming,
therefore, is a matter of the greatest importance, according to an
expert present at the discussion.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he would raise three proposals at the NPC session
including one on developing water-saving farming.

<HEADLINE> Nordic Farmers to Lose in EU Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Swedish farmers stand to lose
1.5 billion kronor (about 190 million U.S. dollars) in subsidies
if the European Union (EU) works to reform agricultural policy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, said a press report here Wednesday, Hans Jonsson,
head of the Swedish farmers' association, is lobbying against the
agricultural reform proposal pending EU discussion on March 18.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would slash subsidies for meat by 30 percent, on
grain by 20 percent and dairy products 15 percent, but leave corn
silage -- an important crop in Germany and France -- intact.
</P>
<P>
As Sweden and Finland can not grow corn silage because of the
climate, their farmers said they will be disproportionally
affected by the cuts and should be compensated by the EU.
</P>
<P>
If the EU proposal goes ahead, Finnish farmers could lose an
amount of subsidies equal to their Swedish neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Awaits Increased Investment From Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province offers sound
infrastructural, policy, economic, cultural and geographical
advantages and is fully prepared for a substantial increase in
investments from its neighboring province across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Liang Maogan, director of the Provincial Office on Taiwan
Affairs, made the remarks today during an interview with reporters
from the Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome Taiwan investments in all areas and industries so
long as they are introduced in strict accordance with related laws
and policies," according to Liang.
</P>
<P>
Local departments are adopting measures to further improve the
investment environment and efficiency in serving investors from
Taiwan, said Liang. "We must ensure Taiwan investors obtain
deserved economic returns and will extend the greatest possible
effort to protect their legal rights."
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of Taiwan-funded projects are currently
earning profits. Official statistics show that some 120-odd local
companies established with funding from Taiwan have increased their
capital by more than one billion US dollars since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The province has approved 5,032 Taiwan-funded enterprises, with
total contracted capital of 9.6 billion US dollars and actual
investments of 5.6 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liang pointed to the complimentary economic cooperation between
the two provinces, and noted that Fujian offers abundant natural
and labor resources, while Taiwan offers superiority in terms of
funding and technology. He added that Fujian also offers abundant
supplies of raw materials and a vast market in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan investment in Fujian has yielded enormous benefits for
both sides, said Liang. He also stressed that Fujian has benefited
greatly from the current reform, opening up and the modernization
drive initiated by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
Fujian was once a poverty-stricken area due to political and
military factors, but has since recorded notable economic
progress. Statistics for inland provinces during 1997 show that
the province ranked 12th in gross domestic product, seventh in per
capita income, and fifth in foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has also recorded monumental achievements in developing
local infrastructure. The province has constructed various
types of roads stretching a total of 47,000 km, 99 berths,
four airports, and a large telecommunications network with
over four million telephones.

<HEADLINE> Ice Dance Rules to Be Changed: ISU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The standing rules for ice dance
will be changed to solve the problem of "stable results" in the
scoring system, Ottavio Cinquanta, president of the International
Skating Union (ISU) said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ISU has been criticized for many years for excessively
rigid judging with positions seldom changing after the
compulsories.
</P>
<P>
At last month's Nagano Olympics there was no change in the
final order of the first 19 of the 24 couples. The only switch
involved couples placed 20th and 21st, one of whom fell and
dropped a place in the free dance.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the remedy for this problem is to introduce
changes in the rules, thereby giving the skaters and the judges
more specific references." said Cinquanta.
</P>
<P>
Cinquanta said he was confident that introducing new technical
rules imposing, for example, certain specific elements in the free
dance together with other technical amendments would help move the
sport on to another level.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Students Call for Release of POWs by Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Scores of Kuwait National
Union of Students and families of the Kuwait Prisoners of Wars
demonstrated in front of British Embassy Wednesday, calling for
early release of Kuwaiti POWs by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This is the second demonstration of this kind in a week. Women
organizations held similar demonstrations in front of the
U.S. embassy last week calling the U.S. government to work for an
conclusion of the POWs issue.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain were the two major countries
which help Kuwait drive out the Iraqi occupation forces in 1991
and have built up their military power in the Gulf following the
standoff between the U.N. and Iraq over arms inspections in the
past few weeks, preparing for a possible air strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators urged Britain to help force Iraq to release
the Kuwaiti POWs held in Iraqi jails since the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the demonstrators, after carrying out
peaceful demonstrations in which women and children held
pictures of their beloved ones, delivered a letter to be
transferred to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The letter was received by the British Ambassador Graham
Boyce.
</P>
<P>
The Students Union called on Blair to make "more efforts
and more pressure on the Iraqi regime to release our sons
and brothers."
</P>
<P>
The letter also said "we are calling on the international
society for more efforts to end this human tragedy and to
return the smile to every mother, wife and son in Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insisted that 625 people went missing in the final
days of Iraq's seven-month occupation, more than 550 are
Kuwaitis, besides Saudis, Iranians, Egyptians, Syrians, Indians
and Lebanese. But Iraq denies it still holds any Kuwaitis it
detained at that time.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis say most of the detained were missing in
fighting between the government forces and rebels in the weeks
after the Gulf War or in other post-war turmoil in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Oil Pipeline Along Ancient Silk Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China will build a long oil
pipeline along the ancient Silk Road, according to a delegate to
China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Dai Mingzi, head of Xinjiang Petroleum Administrative Bureau,
who is in Beijing to attend the annual session of the National
People's Congress (NPC) as a deputy to the NPC, said the new
international "oil road" will extend 3,000 kilometers from Karamay
in northwest China's Xinjiang Autonomous Region and end in
Khazakstan.
</P>
<P>
When completed in eight years, the pipeline, which will cost
2.3 billion US dollars to build, is expected to transport 25
million tons of oil to China annually.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline's domestic section starts from Korla, north of the
Tarim Desert. After arriving at Lanzhou, a major petrochemical
industrial center in Gansu Province, the pipeline will go east to
Central China's Henan Province in one direction and to southwest
China's Sichuan Province in another.
</P>
<P>
China's northwest provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai and
autonomous regions of Ningxia and Xinjiang together have one third
of the country's total oil reserves. The region is expected to
produce one fifth of China's total oil output in three years.
</P>
<P>
Khazakstan, which borders China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region, is widely considered to be the world's new energy center
in the next century. The country has plans to build itself into
one of the world's six largest petroleum producing countries,
hence the construction of the international oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai, the 428-km pipeline from Korla to Shanshan
within Xinjiang was completed last May and preparations are in
full swing for the construction of the pipeline from Xinjiang's
Shanshan to Luoyang in Henan and Pengzhou in Sichuan.

<HEADLINE> Garment Industry Earns 70 Percent of Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's garment industry
contributes more than 70 percent to the country's export earnings,
Mostafa Golam Quddus, the newly-elected president of the
Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association
(BGMEA), said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The industry, which employs some 1.4 million workers, generates
the most job opportunities in the country, Quddus told reporters.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of the employees in the industry are women,
fostering women's empowerment and emancipation, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 2,600 garment factories in Bangladesh and they
are mainly located in the capital city of Dhaka, Narayanganj,
almost 20 kilometers south of the capital, and Chittagong in the
southeast of the country, M. M. Jahangir, secretary of BGMEA, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Most of the garments produced in Bangladesh are exported to
North America and Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-97 fiscal year which ended on June 30, 1997, the
garment industry earned some 3.4 billion U.S. dollars out of the
country's total export earnings of 4.4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Blizzard-Hit Area in Tibet Needs Better Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An official from a blizzard-hit
area in China's Tibet Autonomous Region said he will submit a
proposal on improving infrastructure in his native place to reduce
losses brought about by blizzards.
</P>
<P>
Kanggyin, commissioner of the Nagqu Prefecture of Tibet, said
he will submit such a proposal to the the First Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) to which he is a deputy.
The session is scheduled to open tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Since last September, successive blizzards have hit the
Nagqu grassland area, and 260,000 people have suffered from heavy snow
falls, Kanggyin said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, disaster relief has been well
under way with assistance from the State Council, local
governments and people in other areas of the country, as well as
troops stationed in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Relief materials, such as food, clothes and fuel, which were
sent by the government or donated by domestic and overseas
organizations and people, have been sent to blizzard-hit herdsmen,
Kanggyin said.
</P>
<P>
No one has been found dead as a result of the cold or hunger,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Nagqu areas is hit by blizzards almost every year. To
reduce losses, anti-disaster infrastructure needs to be built,
such as highways, housing for herdsmen and shelters for animals,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, the local economy needs to be diversified, he said.
</P>
<P>
If anti-disaster infrastructure can be improved with an
investment of tens of millions of yuan, hundreds of million yuan
of losses can be avoided, he said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Clarifies Stand on Rushdie Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government would not
support carrying out the death sentence on British writer Salman
Rushdie, the local Iran Daily Wednesday quoted a senior Iranian
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the fatwa (verdict by Islamic leader) on Rushdie is
irrevocable, Iran will not support implementing the terms against
the British author and people associated with him, Mohammad
Hossein Fadaiefar, Iran's Foreign Ministry director general for
social-political affairs, has said in an interview with the daily
which was published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fadaiefar's statement was regarded as a new signal for the
European Union (EU) which demanded a written assurance from the
Iranian government over Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
The EU lifted a 10-month ban on ministerial contacts with Iran
last week, but still expressing concerns over Iran's stance on
various issues, including the Rushdie case.
</P>
<P>
Late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini issued
the death sentence on Rushdie in February 1989 for his
controversial novel "the Satanic Verses" which was believed to
have insult the Islamic prophet Mohammad.
</P>
<P>
On the 9th anniversary of the issuing of the fatwa, Iranian
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi reiterated last month
that the fatwa "is irrevocable and will remain in the history."
Iranian Majlis (parliament) Speaker Nateq Nouri called on Muslims
to carry out the death sentence on Rushdie "to teach a lesson to
those who oppose god and the divine prophets."
</P>
<P>
During the past years, the Iranian government announced it
would not dispatch commandos to kill Rushdie, but refused to
offer written assurance to the EU.
</P>
<P>
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson recently
confirmed that the Iranian government had no plan to carry out
Khomeini's fatwa on Rushdie after she held several talks with
senior Iranian officials in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Robinson was quoted by Los Angeles Times as saying that Iranian
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told her the Iranian
government could not annul the fatwa, but would not carry it out.

<HEADLINE> HK Legislature Approves Immigration Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) Wednesday approved a bill to abolish the
port of first asylum policy for Vietnamese illegal arrivals in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the Immigration (Amendment) Bill 1998, there will
be no more special treatment for Vietnamese illegal arrivals in
Hong Kong and they will be treated in the same way as those
illegal arrivals who are from any other country.
</P>
<P>
The special provisions in Part IIIA of the Immigration
Ordinance provided for special treatment of Vietnamese people
arriving in Hong Kong without valid travel documents, including
detention, screening, review of screening decision and removal
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Peter Lai, secretary for security, said at a PLC meeting here
Wednesday afternoon that after amendment, it should be clear that
"Part IIIA of the Immigration Ordinance shall not apply to
Vietnamese illegal arrivals intercepted and detained on or after
January 9, 1998, being the day on which the bill was gazetted."
</P>
<P>
The amendment has been made with regard to changed
circumstances in Vietnam, the nature of recent illegal arrivals
and widespread calls in the community for scrapping the port of
first asylum policy.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are a total of 1,194 Vietnamese refugees,
1,230 Vietnamese illegal immigrants and 690 Vietnamese migrants in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Two other bills, one about road traffic (validation of
collection of fees) and the other concerning the protection of the
harbor, were also adopted by PLC members during the PLC meeting
after second and third readings.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a series of bills covering inland revenue, stamp
duty, dutiable commodities and air passenger departure tax were
introduced at the PLC meeting by Secretary for Treasury Kwong
Ki-chi for first and second readings.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, government officials answered a dozen of
questions raised by PLC members on various policies.

<HEADLINE> More Retail Participation in HK Stock Market: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A survey, mostly conducted in
September last year, has found that 16 percent of Hong Kong adults
were stock investors, defined as those who held or had traded
listed stocks during the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
This represented a 60 percent growth in retail participation
since 1994, according to the survey findings released Wednesday by
the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the stock exchange said one out of four
households had at least one investor and that one-third of all
investors had invested in the market for the first time during the
previous two years.
</P>
<P>
"First-time investors tended to be less well educated than
longer-term investors, more prepared to take risks and had shorter
investment time frames," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He said a lack of investor understanding of the securities
market had emerged from the survey and that investor education
would be a major priority of the stock exchange this year.
</P>
<P>
"More than 10,000 people attended investment seminars organized
by the exchange in the second half of last year and additional
resources will be allocated to this activity in its 1998-1999
budget," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that investors were trading more
frequently, making an average of 10 transactions during the past
12 months, compared with four in 1994 when the previous survey was
conducted.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the typical retail investor was a male
white-collar worker in his late 30s with secondary or higher
education and a monthly income of about 22,500 HK dollars (2,885
U.S. dollars). New investors were younger and less well educated.

<HEADLINE> HK Companies Remain Competitive at European Fairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong companies
participating in recent winter fairs in Europe have shown their
continuing competitiveness in overseas markets by winning business
worth at least 1.27 billion HK dollars (163 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
More than 300 companies organized by the Hong Kong Trade
Development Council (TDC) took part in six major international
consumer goods trade fairs in Germany, Italy and France in January
and February this year, said the TDC.
</P>
<P>
They won confirmed orders worth nearly 445 million HK dollars
(57 million U.S. dollars) in addition to business valued at a
further 827 million HK dollars (106 million U.S. dollars) under
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong representatives at these trade fairs managed to keep
the edge amid strong Asian competition and were happy with the
results despite initial fears that currency devaluation elsewhere
in Asia might make exports more difficult, the well-known trade
promotion body noted.
</P>
<P>
"The amount of orders can be taken as a strong sign of
confidence in Hong Kong," said Lore Buscher, TDC's director for
Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Among the international buyers at Premiere '98 in Frankfurt was
Steven Lorenzetti, national marketing manager of an
Australia-based firm. "I don't think the Asian financial crisis
will have any effect on our business with Hong Kong in the short
term... We want added value, something different in colors and
fabrics, so that's why we buy from Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the Nuremberg Toy Fair, Hong Kong exhibitor Jane Lam, who
participated in the fair for the second time, was "surprised to
receive so many inquiries and make such good business."
</P>
<P>
"We had expected this time it would be rather tough in
Europe..., but none of our fears came true," she said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total exports to Europe amounted to 239 billion HK
dollars (31 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Consultation on Macao Transition Smooth: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Consultation on a number of issues
concerning Macao's transition has proceeded smoothly, a senior
Chinese official of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG)
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief of the Chinese side of the JLG, made these
remarks to reporters on Wednesday after a closed-door meeting with
his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio Carlos. The meeting was a
preparation for a plenary session scheduled to be held in Beijing
on March 10.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have started technical consultations on the
nationality issue of some Macao residents and on assets transfer
and the localization of the civil service has achieved new
progress since the last plenary session late last year, Han said.
</P>
<P>
Consultation on the transfer of archives and the setting up of
a Portuguese-language school is continuing and the two sides have
also stepped up efforts in dealing with Macao's renewal of
membership in international bodies and application of
international conventions in Macao, Han said.
</P>
<P>
"Macao has entered its final stage of transition," said Han.
"Time is limited but the task remains arduous. It is our historic
mission to make the utmost efforts on the major issues concerning
Macao's transition, and seek timely and proper resolution through
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Carlos said the localization of the civil service has made new
progress. The Portuguese side has promised to have all leadership
and heads of government departments basically localized by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed a wide range of issues concerning
Macao's transition that will be further discussed in the upcoming
plenary session. The JLG convenes three plenary sessions each
year, in Macao, Beijing and Lisbon respectively.

<HEADLINE> Customs Cracks Down on Smuggling of Pirated, Pornographic VCDs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Pirated and pornographic VCD
smugglers may find it more difficult to bypass the "great wall"
established by customs officials as China is taking stronger
measures to control the VCD market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junxiong, an official with China's General Administration
of Customs, today told Xinhua that the nation's ability to fight
pirated and pornographic VCD smuggling has been significantly
strengthed.
</P>
<P>
Now, he said, nearly 300 inspection posts have been established
at ports; a satellite network can quickly inform all major customs
offices about a smuggling case; and the work of seizing on-sea
smugglers has been greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
Satistics from the administration show that more than 5 million
smuggled VCDs had been seized in 1997, among which more than 80
percent were pirated VCDs.
</P>
<P>
According to local observers, this figure also reflects the
determination of the Chinese government to protect property rights.
</P>
<P>
"In the crackdown on smuggled VCDs, successful cooperation has
been achieved between customs in both Guangdong Province and the
Hong Kong Special Administration Region," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, through exchanging information and joint actions,
two illegal VCD production lines and more than 2 million smuggled
VCDs have been seized."
</P>
<P>
At present, the official added, all customs offices in China
have opened hot lines for accusations of smuggling and a
nationwide information network has been formed.
</P>
<P>
He said that, so far, the largest smuggling case of pirated and
pornographic VCDs was discovered on Dec. 12, when the Jiangmen
Customs in Guangdong Province seized 1.47 million smuggled VCDs
from a batch of waste plastic.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, an increase in the number of VCD
players, which was estimated by experts to exceed 50 million this
year, and the high profit margins of VCD smuggling make it
difficult for China's customs officials to tackle the smuggling
problem.
</P>
<P>
However, the official emphasized, "China has confidence to
win the battle in the end."

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Editorial Hails Opening of NPC Session (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thursday edition of the
People's Daily, China's leading newspaper, will carry an editorial
hailing the opening of the First Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
The article, titled "Looking forward into the future and striving
for new achievements," describes the NPC session as "another
major event in China's political life" following the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) convened last
September.
</P>
<P>
It points out that this year's NPC session is an important one
since it will hear and examine a government work report and other
important reports, discuss and approve a plan of institutional
restructuring to be submitted by the State Council, and elect or
confirm new leaders of the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
"This session will hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, turn the magnificent goal set by the 15th National Party
Congress for China's development into state will, and provide
effective political and organizational guarantees for further
mobilizing the Chinese people to strive for an all-round
advancement of the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the 21st century," it says.
</P>
<P>
It notes that the past five years since the First Session of
the Eighth NPC have witnessed remarkable successes for China's
reform, opening-up and socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"Experience of the five years has proved that Deng Xiaoping
Theory and the Party's basic line are great guidelines for our
nation's prosperity and advancement, that the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core is a strong, powerful and
diligent collective leadership with pioneering spirit, and that
intimacy and unity between various ethnic groups across the
country are a basic guarantee for the success of various causes,"
it comments.

<P>
It says that in the past five years, people's congresses at all
levels, along with their standing committees, have exercised their
powers according to law, made great efforts to improve China's
democracy and legal system, and played a vital role in various
aspects of the Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
It praises the people's congress system as "a great
creation" by Mao Zedong and other Chinese revolutionary veterans
by combining the basic theory of Marxism with China's specific
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Practice in nearly half a century since the founding of New
China and in the two decades of reform and opening-up has proved
that the people's congress system is a good system which suits
Chinese realities, promotes national prosperity and makes the
Chinese people owners of their country," it says.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that the next five years, which will be the
term of office for the Ninth NPC, are of critical importance for
China's development.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1998 is the first year for us to implement the
guidelines of the 15th National Party Congress, we have extremely
arduous tasks in reform and development this year, with many
problems and difficulties to solve and overcome. Our performance
in 1998 will have a significant impact on the next few years,"
says the article.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it says, it is necessary to further expand socialist
democracy, improve the socialist legal system, uphold and develop
the people's congress system, and take effective measures to
guarantee democracy in elections, decision-making, management and
supervision.
</P>
<P>
"Only by so doing can we bring people's wisdom and strength
into full play and mobilize them to strive for the attainment of
our goals," it says.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges US to Withdraw Forces from Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
Wednesday called on the United States to withdraw its forces from
the Persian Gulf, saying that the U.S. presence there has
threatened security in the region.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC) at Ahvaz, the capital of southwestern province of
Khuzestan, Khatami stressed that Iran along with other countries
in the region can preserve security in the absence of aliens.
</P>
<P>
The Persian Gulf is not a place for the showdown of foreign
forces and the U.S. fleet, and the U.S. forces should leave the
region immediately, the Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that presence of the U.S. forces in the Gulf is
an insult to the regional states because they themselves can
preserve the security of this region.
</P>
<P>
The United States has mounted up its military buildup in the
Gulf following a crisis between Iraq and the United Nations over
arms inspections. It still warned to launch military strike on
Iraq if Baghdad failed to comply with the U.N. Security Council
resolutions and the accord signed with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan late last month.
</P>
<P>
Khatami arrived at Ahvaz Tuesday afternoon on an inspection
of the province.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The GSM network, China's second
largest public telecommunications service provider, is expected to
cover the country's major cities by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrates that China United Telecommunications
Corp. (China Unicom) continues to treat the expansion of mobile
telecommunications as a priority task in 1998, according to Unicom
General Manager Li Huifen.
</P>
<P>
The GSM network development will focus on the Yangtze River
Delta, the Pearl River Delta and the Bohai Sea Rim, Li said.
</P>
<P>
She said its mobile telecommunications network is set to plug
in 750,000 new subscribers this year and serve six more cities.
</P>
<P>
Long-distance telephone service is the second focus on Unicom's
agenda, she said.
</P>
<P>
Optical cables run by Unicom as far as 10,000 kilometers with a
capacity of 51,500 lines are ready to begin operations.
</P>
<P>
To date, Unicom GSM service is available in 80 cities in China,
with a capacity of 1.23 million lines. Its subscribers exceed
500,000.
</P>
<P>
The optical cables under construction total 9,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Unicom also expects to expedite the development of local
telephone service. While absorbing more local subscribers in
Tianjin in northern China, it plans to complete local networks in
Chongqing and Chengdu in southwestern China with a combined
capacity of 50,000 lines.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Old Revolutionary Base Go in Line with Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- In Yan'an, the sacred place of
China's revolution, many local farmers have laid down their hoes
and run modern joint-stock businesses, according to a deputy to
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Ninth NPC is to open tomorrow at the
Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"The shift of people's mentality was not plain-sailing anyhow,"
said Liu Xiaowen, mayor of Yan'an City and a deputy to the Ninth
NPC.
</P>
<P>
Yan'an was the final destination of the Red Army's Long March
under the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Before
the founding of new China in 1949, Yan'an had been the
headquarters of the CPC for 13 years.
</P>
<P>
And in the beginning of the country's reform and opening to the
outside world in late 1970s, many people in Yan'an still kept to
the mentality of planned economy.
</P>
<P>
"The competition mechanism was not easy to introduce and reform
was hard to carry out," the 52-year-old mayor said. However, as
time goes by, local farmers have familiarize themselves with the
market economy, and market-oriented companies have cropped up.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials of the central CPC leadership have showed
great care for the people in the old revolutionary area, Liu
Xiaowen said. Over the past several years, major senior Party
officials have paid visits to Yan'an.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the central government sets aside approximately
100 million yuan (12 million US dollars) for Yan'an.
</P>
<P>
The locals have changed their traditional way of production and
life style. They have better transportation, medical and
educational conditions, and farmers have adequate food.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the GDP of Yan'an, with a population of two million,
reached 6.5 billion yuan, and the net income of farmers was 1,050
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city has more than 500 enterprises involving petroleum,
chemical, coal and electricity industries. Their total annual
output value each was 3.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the city has been active in fostering
cooperation with foreign countries and international institutions,
Liu Xiaowen said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong NPC Deputy Pledges to Perform Duty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- "I will try to be worthy of the
trust Hong Kong people have placed in me and work together with
other deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) to
perform our sacred duties," a Hong Kong deputy to the Ninth NPC
said here today.
</P>
<P>
This sentiment was expressed by Deputy Ng Chack-tim.
</P>
<P>
"I think the current NPC session is of special significance for
Hong Kong deputies because all the deputies from the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) were elected by an electoral
body entirely composed of Hong Kong residents and Hong Kong
deputies have formed an independent delegation for the first time
for the coming session of the NPC," said Ng, who is head of the
Hong Kong delegation to the Ninth NPC First Session which is to
open here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
As a deputy to the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth
NPCs, Ng has witnessed how China has
traveled from chaos to stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"I feel a great honor to be a deputy elected by Hong Kong
residents and have a strong sense of having returned to the
embrace of the motherland," Ng said.
</P>
<P>
"All the deputies from the HKSAR are fully aware of their
responsibilities as people all over the world will follow closely
how we participate in the deliberation and administration of state
affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The First Session of the Ninth NPC is of great significance for
China's reform and further development, he said, since the session
will turn the blueprint worked out at the 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) into a program of action.
</P>
<P>
He said deputies from Hong Kong have their own advantages.
Since Hong Kong is an international financial, trade and
information center, Hong Kong deputies have a better idea of the
rules and characteristics of a market economy, are well informed
and lively in thinking, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This has made it possible for them to raise constructive
ideas and proposals, thereby contributing to reform and the
establishment of a socialist market economy in interior areas,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm confident of the success of the congress session," he
said.

Research Center, a major genetic research institution in China,
was established here today.
</P>
<P>
Approved by the State Science and Technology Commission, the

the gene relating to human disease from the functional gene, the
establishment of a gene-testing system and the study of the
biotics relating to human genome.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, the center will strive to establish an
experimental system on the study of the structure and function of
human genomes, and explore genes relating to such main diseases in
China as liver ailments, leukemia, angiocardiopathy and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
The research center was organized by the China National Center
for Bio-engineering Development and the Shanghai Science and
Technology Commission as well as universities, research
institutions, hospitals and enterprises in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Presidium of Ninth NPC First Session Has Wide Representation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The 177-member Presidium of the
First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), which
was elected this morning at the session's preparatory meeting, has
wide representation of Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Presidium include leaders of the Communist Party
of China (CPC) and the state, such as Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Zhu
Rongji, Li Ruihuan, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of China's eight non-Communist parties and the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and patriotic
personages without party affiliation occupy 13 seats in the
Presidium.
</P>
<P>
The Presidium also consists of relevant leaders of central
Party, government and military bodies and people's organizations,
deputies from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
and Macao, deputies from national pillar industries and from
science and technology, social sciences, culture, education,
public health, sports, and religious circles.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese, workers, farmers, officers and men of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) and armed policemen also have their
own representatives in the Presidium.
</P>
<P>
In defining the identity of the Presidium members, the new term
"deputies from national pillar industries" has replaced the old
terminology of "deputies from the economic circles", and the
former phrase of "labor models" has been divided into "workers"
and "farmers". The new definitions are believed to be more
scientific and reasonable.
</P>
<P>
Among China's 55 ethnic minorities, those with comparatively
large population have contributed 18 members of the Presidium,
about 10 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The Presidium members also include heads of the delegations to
the NPC session from China's 32 provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities directly under the central government and of the
PLA delegation.
</P>
<P>
Ng Hong-mun, an NPC deputy from Hong Kong who was elected head
of the Hong Kong SAR delegation yesterday, is also in the Presidium.
</P>
<P>
Reports say that the draft list of candidates for the posts of
the Presidium members and secretary-general of this session
indicates the outcome of repeated discussions and consultations by
relevant sides, with approval after discussion by the chairman and
vice-chairmen of the Standing Committee of the Eighth NPC.
</P>
<P>
The duty of the Presidium is to preside over the NPC session.

<HEADLINE> Cataracts Top Cause of Blindness in Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese health official said
here today that cataracts are the top cause of blindness in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Cataracts were the most dangerous threat to Chinese people's
eyesight, especially the old, Liu Keling from the Ministry of
Health said at an international symposium for preventing blindness
which started Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the country's more than six million blind people,
2.5-to-3 million are cataract sufferers, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
Health authorities are now shifting their medical focus to
surgical treatment for cataract patients.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 1.75 million cataract patients underwent
surgery from 1988 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government is seeking international
cooperation and exchanges with foreign countries and worldwide
health organizations, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, Chinese doctors focused on curbing trachoma, an
eye infection that was then the first cause of blindness, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
The government also set a goal of holding blindness to 0.3
percent of the population by 2000.

<HEADLINE> Think Tanks: Major Japanese Firms' Earnings to Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading Japanese companies are
expected to see, for the first time in four years, their profits
declining in fiscal 1997, two private Japanese think tanks said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The combined unconsolidated pretax profits of 461 companies
listed on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, said the
Nikko Research Center, will drop 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline is likely the result of the companies' expected 8.5
percent drop in profits in October-March, or the second half of
the business year, said the affiliate of the Nikko Securities Co.
</P>
<P>
And behind the downward trend is the laggard Japanese economy
and of the fallout from Asia's economic crisis, it said.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the Okasan Economic Research Institute, of the
Okasan Securities Co., said the combined pretax profits of leading
firms would be down 0.2 percent this fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> A Summary of Israeli President's Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli president, head of
the Jewish state, is elected for a five-year term by a
majority of Knesset (Parliament) in a secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
The president, who is largely a ceremonial figure in
Israel, can be re-elected for only one more consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
The president appoints senior state officials in positions of
special importance and independence, including the state
comptroller and the governor of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The president accredits Israel's envoys to foreign countries
and accepts the credentials of foreign diplomats serving in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
He signs every law enacted by the Knesset and treaties
and agreements with foreign countries and accepts the
credentials of foreign countries that have been ratified by
the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The president maintains constant contact with the government
through regular meeting with government officials, weekly
briefings on government sessions, and receiving regular,
comprehensive information from the various government agencies.
</P>
<P>
The president has exclusive power to pardon or commute the
sentences of civilians and soldiers. Because of the exalted
status of his position, the president represents not only
Israel but the entire Jewish people.
</P>
<P>
As much, he assumes a lengthy series of duties and
activities beyond those spelled out in law. The president
maintains contacts with Diaspora Jewish leaders and high-ranking
visitors from overseas and acts to enhance Jewish and Zionist
education for Diaspora youth in order to encourage their
immigration to Israel.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Ezer Weizman, who was re-elected president on
Wednesday, has been making special efforts to disseminate
information on the history of the Jewish communities of which
Israel's population is composed.
</P>
<P>
He also displays particular interest in social relations
among population groups and strives to improve them by working
with a broad, diverse spectrum of communities in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Chinese Citizens Prefer Traditional Family Pattern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese citizens still choose
to form a family in the traditional way -- a husband, a wife and
children, according to a survey announced by today's Beijing Youth
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Some 5,138 families participated in the survey in 10 major
Chinese cities: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Nanning,
Wuhan, Xi'an, Jinan, Shenyang and Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that 48 percent of the respondents said that
they love the traditional pattern. Such a family pattern is more
popular in Beijing and Shanghai, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three percent of the respondents chose the pattern of a
family consisting of husband, wife, children and parents.
</P>
<P>
Only 310 people, or 6 percent of the respondents, chose the
"Double Income No Kids" (DINK) family pattern, according to the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Among those who prefer DINK, 35 percent said raising children
takes much time and affects the quality of their life; 34 percent
do not want children for economic reasons; and 12 percent said
they are too busy with work to have children.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reveals that 27 percent of those who stated a
preference for DINK would have children if their economic
conditions improve in the future.

<HEADLINE> New CPPCC Advisors Praise Work of Predecessors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Eighth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
China's top advisory body, has performed good services for the
country's reform, opening-up and modernization drive and
contributed greatly to China's peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
This view was shared by the 2,195 members of the Ninth CPPCC
National Committee, which opened its first annual session Tuesday,
during their panels today on a work report by the Standing
Committee of the previous CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
The members agreed that China's current good situation has
created favorable conditions for the smooth development of various
kinds of work of the Eighth CPPCC National Committee, and that the
correct leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee has provided a basic guarantee for the constant progress
of the work of the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that it was under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping Theory that the Eighth CPPCC National Committee has
scored tremendous achievements, and that Deng Xiaoping should be
regarded as founder of the CPPCC work in the new period of reform
and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
They also attributed the successes of the Eighth CPPCC National
Committee to the work of the CPC Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core, which has always attached great importance to
the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
"We are especially satisfied with the fact that Jiang Zemin and
other leaders of the central authorities have attended the CPPCC
annual sessions every year, and have often joined in the panel
discussions to heed our opinions," said Member Zhao Wei.
</P>
<P>
Many members noted that the Eighth CPPCC National Committee has
given full scope to the role of members from Hong Kong and Macao in
promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and has
contributed to Hong Kong's smooth return to China and long-term
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Member Chen Ling, deputy director of the Taiwan affairs office
of east China's Fujian Province, expressed the hope that the
current CPPCC National Committee would give full play to the role
of the 40-plus members who are Taiwan natives, and allow them to
contribute more to developing relations across the Taiwan Straits
and advancing the country's peaceful reunification.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Welcomes U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos Wednesday
welcomed a resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council
unanimously endorsing an agreement signed last month between the
United Nations and Iraq over U.N. weapons inspections in the
country.
</P>
<P>
This breakthrough has restored the primary role of the United
Nations in resolving international conflicts, Ramos said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz signed the agreement on February 23 to resolve
a crisis resulting from Iraq's refusal to let U.N. weapons
inspectors into certain facilities and subsequent U.S. threat to
lead a military strike against the country.
</P>
<P>
With the final approval of the U.N.-Iraq agreement by the U.N.
Security Council, Ramos expressed the hope that peace and
stability will return to the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also called on Iraq to fully cooperate and comply with
the agreement reached with the United Nations to ensure a lasting
peace in the region and pave the way for the eventual lifting of
the sanctions the United Nations imposed on Iraq after the Gulf
war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that despite these positive developments, the
Philippine government will continue to closely monitor the
situation, "with the hope that peace and stability in the region
will be permanent."

<HEADLINE> Gulf States to Hold Joint Military Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states are preparing to hold joint military exercises as a
routine check on their collective defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, the first one in the year, will take place in
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in "the next few days," the UAE's
official Wam news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"A number of troops" from the six GCC states, namely the UAE,
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Oman and Kuwait will take part in
the scheduled war game code-named "Peninsula Shield-6," according
to Wam.
</P>
<P>
The military exercises are aimed at "supporting the process of
joint work to strengthen friendly ties" among the GCC states,
Wam said.
</P>
<P>
It gave no further details, but an informed source from the UAE
Defense Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Xinhua
that the maneuver will focus on training the newly-structured GCC
collective troops named Peninsula Shield and improving the group
members' cooperation in protecting communication safety.
</P>
<P>
The GCC chiefs of staff worked out last October two military
projects known as "projects on tightening military cooperation and
defending communications safety."
</P>
<P>
The two projects included setting up a common radar network for
naval and air surveillance and an early warning aerial system
covering all the GCC states.
</P>
<P>
The projects also included plans for raising the strength of
the Peninsula Shield, established in the early 1990 from 4,000 to
25,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a political, economic and defense alliance was set up
in 1981. In the past years, it held military exercises annually as
one of the ways to improve its self-defense capabilities.
</P>
<P>
However, due to their relatively limited human resources, the
GCC states still remain seriously reliant on a large foreign
military presence to protect their security.
</P>
<P>
The United States keeps the largest troops in the oil-rich Gulf
region and it has some 20,000 service members and 30 combat and
support ships in the area.

first being denied a penalty and then having Vladimir Jugovic sent
off in the 67th minute for a second bookable offence.

"It seems to me that the referee really went over the top, "
said Zoff, the goalkeeper of former Italian World Cup winning

Coach Sven Goran Eriksson concentrated on the moment when
Giuseppe Pancaro went down in the penalty area after a tackle by
Bernard Diomede at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
"On Pancaro, it was clearly a penalty," said the Swede. "I
really didn't like the way the referee handled a match which was
as important as this one. And no referee in Italy would have done
what he did over Jugovic.
</P>
<P>
Jugovic himself was bitterly disappointed at what he thought
was a mis-carriage of justice.
</P>
<P>
"I only stood in front of the ball because the free-kick should
have been taken two meters further back," said the Yugoslva
midfielder, who now misses the return leg in Burgundy in a
fortnight's time.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Taiwan
industrialists have invested in the past few years in east China's
Fujian Province where the investment environment has kept
improving.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Fujian approved 456 Taiwan-funded projects involving
1.2 billion U.S. dollars of investment from Taiwan, a 89-percent
rise over the previous year, said Zhang Jiakun, a deputy to the
Ninth National People's Congress. Zhang is here to attend the
NPC's first session due to open tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 Taiwan-funded projects have been built in
Fujian since 1983 and businesses from Taiwan have actually
invested a total of 5.6 billion US dollars in Fujian, according to
Zhang, who is also vice-governor of Fujian.
</P>
<P>
Owing to the fact that more large Taiwan enterprises have come
to Fujian to invest, average investment from Taiwan in each
Taiwan-funded project increased from less than 1 million US
dollars in 1988 to 5.9 million U.S. dollars in 1996, said Weng
Fulin, who is mayor of Fuzhou as well as an NPC deputy.
</P>
<P>
Also, Taiwan investors have started more than 1,000
agricultural projects in Fujian involving close to 1 billion US
dollars in Taiwan investment money, according to Zhang Jiakun.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Interior Minister Criticizes Judiciary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri Wednesday criticized head of the Judiciary Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi for making "illogical, harsh and angry speeches"
over certain issues.
</P>
<P>
"I suggest Mr. Yazdi, as the highest judicial official in the
country, to speak with dignity, caution and to base his speeches
on laws," Nouri said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in Iran that a government minister
launched open criticism against a senior official like head of
the Judiciary, particularly after the new government of President
Mohammad Khatami came to power last August.
</P>
<P>
Nouri stressed that an ordinary judge should not make
"emotional, harsh and angry speeches."
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Yazdi showed harsh attitude to and
even threatened local reporters when they asked questions about
some judicial issues.
</P>
<P>
Nouri expressed hope that Yazdi would keep the dignity of his
post with "self-restraint" and pay more attentions to the
country's judicial issues to defend the people's rights instead
of concentrating on certain cases, such as the embezzlement case
related to the Tehran Municipality.
</P>
<P>
The embezzlement case of Tehran Municipality became a hot
issue between the two rival political factions. The left-wing
faction attacked the judicial bodies for politicizing the case in
order to weaken the government of President Khatami while the
right-wing faction even called for arrest of Tehran Mayor
Gholamhussein Karbaschi who was allegedly involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister praised the Tehran Municipality for its
achievements in the city's reconstruction during the past eight
years, though he stressed that any one who violated the country's
laws should be punished.

<HEADLINE> BJP Fails to Win Majority to Form Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
has emerged as the largest political force in India but failed to
win the majority to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
As the counting of votes in the general elections is near the
end, the BJP and its allies have secured 254 out of the 535
contested seats in the first three phases of the four-phase
elections to the Lok Sabha (the Lower House of the Parliament),
but failed to get the necessary 273 seats to form the next
government.
</P>
<P>
BJP's opponents, the Congress and its allies, won 167 seats
while the United Front got 167 and others 17.
</P>
<P>
The final results may not be declared in two or three days due
to some irregularities in certain constituencies.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Election Commission announced Wednesday
that the commission had withheld the counting of votes in a
constituency in the eastern state of Bihar because of certain
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
The commission ordered fresh polling at two stations on
Thursday and the counting process would resume only after the
repolling.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said President Kocheril Raman Narayanan
was unlikely to take a decision on government formation before the
formation of the new Lok Sabha which is expected only after March
10.
</P>
<P>
Intense efforts are now under way among major political forces
in the country to form a new central government.
</P>
<P>
BJP spokeswoman Sushma Swaraj said Wednesday that her party has
already identified supporters among the 39 independent groups to
muster a simple majority of 273 in the 545-member Lok Sabha.
</P>
<P>
BJP's National Executive Committee is scheduled to meet in
Delhi on Friday to finalize its strategy to form the next
government, said BJP General Secretary Venkaiah Naidu.
</P>
<P>
He added that the meeting would also discuss and work out a
common minimum program of BJP and its allies in the event of a
BJP-led government.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected MPs of the BJP and its allies would also meet
on Saturday to formally elect Atal Bihari Vajpayee as their leader
before staking claim to form the government.

relations have become more complicated. Facing the new situation,
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) has protected
workers' economic interests, political status and democratic
rights.
</P>
<P>
Fundamentally, he said, the ACFTU has focused on safeguarding
the legitimate rights of the workers, arousing their initiative,
and carrying out the tasks set by the CPC and government.
</P>
<P>
Trade union organizations at various levels should place
priority on caring for the wellbeing of laid-off workers and help
them reemployed so as to facilitate the reform of the state-owned
enterprises.

Manila, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Despite the Asian currency crisis,
the Philippine economy remains one of the most stable in the
Asia-South Pacific region, Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar
Bautista said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Citing surging investment and brisk exports, Bautista said the
country's economy will grow from 3 to 5 percent this year.

<P>
The Philippines registered some 700 billion pesos (17.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in domestic and foreign investments last year while
its exports reached nearly 30 billion dollars, according to
Bautista.
</P>
<P>
Despite the "fine" performance of the country compared with
other Asian countries at this point in time of the economic
turmoil in the region, Bautista asked Filipinos to adopt
belt-tightening measures until the full recovery of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Due to the current currency crisis, the Philippine economy is
expected to slow down considerably in 1998 and 1999.

MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said
Wednesday that the Philippines welcomes the decision of King
Norodom Sihanouk to return to Cambodia in April because he is an

</P>
<P>
At his weekly press conference, Ramos said he received a letter

"King Sihanouk plays a very important role in unifying the

<HEADLINE> A Look at Weizman's Military, Public Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Ezer Weizman, an air force
general and politician, was re-elected Israeli president by the
Knesset (Parliament) for a five-year term on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Born in Tel Aviv in 1924 and raised in Haifa, Weizman is the
second president in his family, following in the footsteps of his
uncle, Chaim Weizman, the renowned scientist and Zionist leader
who was Israel's first president between 1949 and 1952.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's extensive military career began when he joined
Great Britain's Royal Air Force during World War II, serving
in Egypt and India.
</P>
<P>
After the war, he served in the Air Service, the
predecessor of the Israel Air Forces (IAF), and was one of
the founders of the IAF when it was formed as an integral
part of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in 1949.
</P>
<P>
In 1956, Weizman was appointed commander-in-chief of the IAF,
and 10 years later he became head of the IDF operation
branch and deputy chief-of-staff responsible for the IAF.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's political career began in 1969 with his appointment
as minister of transport. A high point of Weizman's public
service came during his tenure as minister of defense between
1977 and 1980, when he was instrumental in the process leading to
the signing of the peace treaty with Egypt.
</P>
<P>
He fostered close personal relations with Egyptian leaders
and played a pivotal role in the Camp David negotiations.
</P>
<P>
In 1984 Weizman founded a political party, Yahad, which ran on
a dovish platform in the elections to the 11th Knesset, gaining
three seats. In the national unity government formed after these
elections, Weizman served as minister without portfolio and a
member of the inner cabinet.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 he was appointed coordinator of Arab affairs, a
position which enabled him to promote his long-time interest
in assisting Israel's Arab sector.
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 elections, he ran Labor's campaign and
subsequently became minister of science and development in a
new national unity government, serving in his position until
March 1990.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Weizman resigned from the Knesset over what he
regarded as lack of progress in the Arab-Israeli peace
process. And in 1993, he was elected Israel's seventh
president by the Knesset.

<HEADLINE> Aerial Ads Being Discouraged in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The people of Guangzhou, the
capital of China's Guangdong Province, were attracted recently to a
luminous lighter-than-air object filling the urban sky.
</P>
<P>
The airship was an airborne advertisement for Finland's Nokia,
the telecommunications giant, and was the first instance of a
Guangzhou company using this form of advertising. And it really
got the attention of a lot of people, some of whom even wondered
whether it was a UFO.
</P>
<P>
This style of advertising style, however, is running into
trouble, according to a Guangzhou Civil Aviation Administration
official, because of the possible effect on civil aviation
operations if the airship's altitude and area of operation are not
been strictly defined.
</P>
<P>
These kinds of airships used for advertising need to be
approved by the aviation department, the official said. And some
people in the advertising profession say that although the device
is quite new and interesting, it can not be used
indiscriminately.

<HEADLINE> China Bars Entry of Hazardous Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China has stopped foreign garbage
from entering the country after more than a year's effort of
inspecting imported waste.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that commodity inspection departments examined
more than 5.6 million tons of imported waste last year, which was
worth 1 billion U.S. dollars. The result showed that most abided
by relevant regulations and contracts.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Administration for the Inspection of
Import and Export Commodities (SAIIEC) said that 99.59 percent of
the imported waste met quality standards, up 2.09 percent over
1996.
</P>
<P>
Importing recyclable waste such as metal, paper and plastics
has helped ease the shortage of some raw materials, the official
said. However, a number of lawbreakers have transported hazardous
wastes to China as recyclables in recent years.
</P>
<P>
A leading official with the SAIIEC said that China will
continue to step up inspection of imported wastes, and will refuse
to approve those failing to meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
He added that the SAIIEC will conduct spot checks of imported
wastes at ports of entry, and will leave unqualified waste to
local customs offices and environmental protection departments.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Passengers,Freight Handled by Uganda Aviation on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) --International and domestic
passengers and freight handled by Uganda Aviation greatly
increased during the period from 1991-1997.
</P>
<P>
International passengers received by Uganda Aviation increased
from 61,160 in 1991 to 165,300 in 1997, while domestic passengers
via Entebbe Airport increased from 2,440 to 14,600, and freight
from 1,300 tonnes to 12,700 tonnes in the same period, according
to statistics issued recently by the Uganda Civil Aviation
Authrity (CAA).
</P>
<P>
The CAA attributed the freight transport increase mainly to the
development of non-traditional exports such as fish and flowers.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's traditional exports are coffee, tea and cotton. But
in the recent years, its non-traditional exports developed rapidly.
Flower exports grew from 31 tonnes in 1994 to 1,860 tonnes
last year, while fish export went up from 2,970 tonnes to 5980
tonnes in the same period.
</P>
<P>
CAA Board Chairman Francis Omaswa said that the CAA planned to
establish a new cargo center, aircraft maintenance hangers, a
general aviation terminal, a fuel storage and distribution
services, in-flight catering center and airline support functions
in next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Olmaswa said that the CAA has injected six billion Uganda
Shillings (some 54 million U.S. Dollars) to rehabilitate
upcountry aerodromes.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem bothering CAA is the problem of
possible bird accident, he noted. Some 70 percent of the birds
involved in accident is from a nearby livestock veterinary
experimental farm.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Chief Calls Poverty Alleviation National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Poverty alleviation is basically
a national responsibility because problems concerning poverty
differ from country to country, said Naeem U. Hasan,
secretary-general of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC), Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike economic cooperation, you cannot have a treaty, you
cannot have a common program on poverty alleviation because
although the seven SAARC countries are basically poor and the
South Asia region one of the poorest in the world, the questions
and issues on poverty differ from country to country," Hasan said
in an interview with Xinhua at the Kathmandu-based SAARC
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, the main concern of most SAARC countries
is education. But for Sri Lanka and the Maldives, it is no problem
as the literacy rates there are quite high.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said another major problem concerning
poverty in South Asia is the overgrowth of population and it is
especially true for India and Pakistan which both have a growth
rate of almost 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
"For these reasons, you cannot have one SAARC common policy. It
has to be national programs to be introduced," he said. "What we
do together as SAARC is to basically exchange information and
expertise and we try to replicate the successful programs in other
countries. This is the basic philosophy and basic approach of
SAARC to poverty issues."
</P>
<P>
Hasan said that in accordance with this philosophy and
approach, the SAARC Secretariat launched in 1996 the "SAARC Seven
Sisters: District Development Coordination and Improved Poverty
Project Design."
</P>
<P>
Under the project, district-level fora were established in each
of the member countries to periodically review and monitor the
poverty-alleviation programs there and identify the best
practices.
</P>
<P>
Except Bhutan, all the other SAARC members -- Bangladesh,
India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- participated
in the project.
</P>
<P>
SAARC also has a three-tier institutional mechanism which meets
regularly to review and follow up its poverty-alleviation
projects, Hasan said.
</P>
<P>
The mechanism comprises meetings of planning secretaries at the
first tier, of other related secretaries at the second and of
ministers of finance and planning at the third, the career
diplomat from Pakistan said.
</P>
<P>
In poverty alleviation, SAARC also has very close relations
with some international organizations like the U.N. Development
Program (UNDP) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and
the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
"We have some common programs, for example the UNDP in
Kathmandu has a special unit for SAARC-UNDP cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
South Asia is one of the poorest regions in the world with more
than 400 million of its 1.2 billion people live in destitution.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985 to promote regional cooperation in
economic and social development, placed poverty alleviation high
on its agenda at its sixth summit in 1991.
</P>
<P>
At the seventh summit in 1993, SAARC voiced its commitment to
eradicating poverty in South Asia preferably by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The group adopted an agenda of action which included a strategy
of social mobilization, and a policy of decentralized agricultural
development, small-scale labor-intensive industrialization and
human development.
</P>
<P>
At the following two summits in 1995 and 1997, the leaders of
the seven countries reaffirmed their commitment to poverty
alleviation and the year of 1995 was designated as the SAARC Year
of Poverty Eradication.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said that in the past years, the literacy rate in South
Asia has been rising and most countries in the region are
conscious of controlling the population.
</P>
<P>
And in their national programs, these countries gave more and
more importance and allocation to the social sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
In efforts to alleviate poverty, attention should be paid to
education, especially that of women, control of population,
stronger rural development programs for food security and income
generation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general acknowledged that it is a "difficult
exercise" to wipe out poverty from South Asia by 2002. "I think
the deadline we have in mind is basically to give importance to
this subject and try to collectively and individually remove
poverty as early as possible," he said.

<HEADLINE> Women Playing Important Role in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The women's status in the Tibet
Autonomous Region has been raised remarkably, said Tibetan
pediatrician Yexi Yangcog based on her own experience.
</P>
<P>
Being a deputy to the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC)
from Tibet, she is currently in Beijing to attend the First
Session of the Eighth NPC, which is to open tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in the early 1950s, her
parents and grandparents were all serfs toiling and suffering at
the bottom of Tibetan society. Both her parents were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
"It is the Communist Party that brings about fundamental
changes to my destiny," the pediatrician at the Tibet Autonomous
Regional People's Hospital said.
</P>
<P>
In 1965, Yexi was enrolled into the Capital Medical Sciences
University in Beijing, and became the first-generation of college
students from Tibet. Later she turned out to be a well-known
doctor on pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
Beginning 1988, Yexi Yangcog has been serving as a deputy to
the Lhasa City People's Congress and deputy to the Tibet Regional
People's Congress, the supreme power organ of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, she was elected into the Standing Committee of the
Tibet Autonomous Regional People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"My present political status can never be anticipated by my
ancestors," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to traditional law codes in old Tibet, ordinary
Tibetans were classified into nine grades in three categories.
Women were not allowed to be involved in political and
military affairs, and their life was worthless, Yexi said.
</P>
<P>
Following the democratic reform in 1959, Tibetan women have
been protected by the Chinese Constitution, and they have obtained
equal political rights with men, he said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 20,000 Tibetan women are working
in governmental departments as officials, and they make up 32.3
percent of the total cadre ranks.
</P>
<P>
Women deputies in people's congresses at various levels in
Tibet account for 10.53 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Many female NPC deputies from Tibetan had set forth proposals
for the development of river, airport and highway projects,
Yangcog said. All the projects have been or are being carried out.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tibetan women are now working, among in other trades
and occupations, as county magistrates, township heads, judges,
procutorators and lawyers.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway with World Trade Organization Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) believes
that China's latest proposal on tariffs and quotas in the
negotiations for its entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO)
makes it possible to finish an agreement on market access this
spring, the International Business Daily has reported.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission deemed that 75 percent of the multilateral
protocol for China's WTO access has been concluded, which
constitutes significant progress in China's WTO efforts, according
to the article.
</P>
<P>
The opening of China's service industry will be one focus of
the negotiation, the daily quoted an EU newspaper as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the last four years China has shown
initiative and flexibility in the negotiations on import tariffs,
quotas, agricultural compensation and opening-up of the service
sector.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1997, China has lowered its general level of
import taxes from 34 percent to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The commodities subject to quota have reduced to 350 from
1,200, and quota limits will disappear in 2005 when EU lifts its
control on China's exports of garments, shoes, porcelain and toys.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 12,000 businesses have foreign trade rights in
China now compared to 14 in 1979 when China began its economic
reform and opening-up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
China's compensation on farm produce has been controlled
within 20-to-25 percent, and will reach 15 percent before 2005.
</P>
<P>
As for China's opening of its service sector, the EU
Commission is interested in a proposal China made last November
which touched upon distribution, judiciary, accounting, banking
and insurance.
</P>
<P>
The EU hoped that the negotiations on China's service industry
would speed up in the first half of this year, and began to draft
the rest of the protocol, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission was also satisfied with China's
strengthening of the protection of intellectual property rights,
the article said.

<HEADLINE> 1stadd: Weizman Re-elected Israeli President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- In a Knesset (Israeli
Parliament) vote for state President, incumbent Ezer Weizman
defeated the ruling party Likud candidate Shaul Amor and won a
second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon announced that Weizman, who enjoys
strong public support, gained an absolute majority of 63 votes in
the 120-seat-Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's victory was mainly attributed to the backing of
opposition Labor party that was satisfied with Weizman's strong
support for the peace process with the Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Weizman's dovish views frequently angered
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In nominating Amor,
the Likud broke with a tradition that a president who wishes
to serve a second term is never opposed.
</P>
<P>
But because the ballot is secret, and members of the
government coalition can sometimes be persuaded to defect or
abstain. Therefore, Weizman also got some votes from the ruling
party members.
</P>
<P>
Israel's president is a largely ceremonial figure. Weizman was
elected Israel's seventh president by the Knesset for a five-year
term in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, 73, is the second president in his family, following
the footsteps of his uncle, Chaim Weizman, a renowned scientist
and Zionist leader, who was Israel's first president.
</P>
<P>
The presidential inauguration is scheduled for May 18.

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: Weizman Reelected Israeli President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- In a Knesset (Israeli
Parliament) vote for state President, incumbent Ezer Weizman
defeated the ruling party Likud candidate Shaul Amor and won a
second five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon announced that Weizman, who enjoys
strong public support, gained an absolute majority in the
120-seat-Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Tichon said that 119 legislators took part in the secret
ballot -- 63 votes for Weizman, 49 votes for Likud member Amor and
7 white ballots were cast. He noted that the presidential swearing
ceremony will take place in May.
</P>
<P>
At the presidential residence in Jerusalem, Weizman told
reporters that he was happy about the outcome though he was not
"jumping for joy."
</P>
<P>
Weizman said the role of the President comes with much
responsibility and he intends to continue to fill that role.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased that the people of Israel have stood by
him, noting that they did push him to the victory.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent president's victory was also attributed to the
backing of opposition Labor party that was satisfied with
Weizman's strong support for the peace process with the
Palestinians and Syria.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Weizman's dovish views frequently angered
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In nominating Amor,
the Likud broke with a tradition that a president who wishes to
serve a second term is never opposed.
</P>
<P>
But because the ballot is secret, and members of the
government coalition can sometimes be persuaded to defect or
abstain, Weizman obviously also got some votes from the ruling
party members.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that it was Netanyahu's democratic right to
support the candidate of his choice. He also stressed that he and
Netanyahu would find a way to work together.
</P>
<P>
Israel's president is a largely ceremonial figure. Weizman was
elected Israel's seventh President by the Knesset for a five-year
term in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, 73, is the second president in his family, following
the footsteps of his uncle, Chaim Weizman, the renowned scientist
and Zionist leader who was Israel's first President.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Peace Process to End Within Days, UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Behrooz Sadry, Deputy
Representative of the United Nations to Angola, said here Tuesday
night that the peace process in the country is to end in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
Sadry made the remark at a press conference after a meeting
between the former rebel force UNITA (the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola) and the UN Observation Mission.
</P>
<P>
He said that his talks with UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi was
very positive, creating good prospect for the accomplishment of
the peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The February 28 peace deadline, which Angolans have failed to
meet, he said, had thrown the peace process into dilemma, but his
talks with Angolan President and UNITA leader have brought
forward series of new peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
The government and the UNITA are studying ways to implement
the Lusaka Peace Protocol, he said.
</P>
<P>
No new deadline has been set for the peace process, Sadry
said, adding that March 13 would be an important day for Angola's
peace process as the UN Observation Mission is scheduled to hand
over a report to the UN Security Council over the development of
peace process in the country by that day.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the joint peace process committee would hold
a meeting to discuss the development of peace process in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The sabotage activities by the UNITA forces have destroyed the
peace process originally set to end on February 28.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 3 (Xinhua) -- American women are launching
new businesses because they are inspired by an entrepreneurial
idea, according to a national survey today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the National Foundation for Women
Business Owners, also found that women start their own business
because of frustration with their previous work environment.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of the women surveyed said that they start
their own enterprises because they recognize opportunities to
implement entrepreneurial ideas.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-one percent of the women with prior private sector
experience cite the desire for more flexibility as the major
reason for leaving their corporate position, while 29 percent
cite "glass ceiling" issues.
</P>
<P>
While the businesses started by men are most likely related to
their previous ones, most of women either started a business
totally unrelated to their previous jobs or turned a personal
interest into a business pursuit, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
The study also found that women business owners are more likely
to have started a business than to purchase one as compared with
men.

KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Britain has assured ASEAN
member countries Europe will not be forced to pressure Myanmar
over Yangon's alleged human rights abuses in return for Europe's
help for Asian economic recovery, the Malaysian national news
agency Bernama reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no leverage or linkage between the two," said British
Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek
Fatchett, who is on a one-day visit here as personal emissary of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and special representative of

According to Bernama, Fatchett said earlier in a statement read
out at the news conference that it was in Europe's interest to
help Asian countries deal with their financial difficulties
because "they are our problems too."

human rights abuses in Myanmar a central issue at the Asia-Europe
Meeting (ASEM) in London next month, Bernama said.

<HEADLINE> Water Diversion Between China's Longest Rivers Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Legislators from east China's
Shandong Province today urged the central government to carry out
as early as possible an ambitious project of water diversion
between the two longest rivers to ease water shortage in northern
China.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the project to divert water from the
Yangtze to the Yellow River at an earlier date will give an
ultimate solution to the grave water shortage by Shandong and
other northern provinces," said Wang Xia, a Shandong deputy to the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze is the longest river in China, followed by the
Yellow River. Due to the sharp contrast in climatic and
environmental conditions in northern and southern China, the
former has an abundance of water sources, while the latter has
been frequented by flow stoppage since 1972.
</P>
<P>
Though a coastal province, Shandong only ranks 26th in China in
terms of water resources. Experts predict that the province could
be short of five to six billion cubic meters of water by 2010.
</P>
<P>
Shandong relies heavily on the Yellow River, which runs through
the province before it is emptied into the Yellow Sea, in water
supply. Since the early 1990s, the river has contributed on
average 7.3 billion cubic meters of water each year, about 40
percent of Shandong's annual consumption.
</P>
<P>
But last year the Yellow River scored a record 226 days of flow
stoppage in Shandong, affecting 1.3 million hectares of cropland
and causing a loss of 13.5 billion yuan (1.6 billion US dollars)
to the province.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that the Shengli Oilfield, China's second largest
petroleum producer at the estuary of the Yellow River, had to cut
oil production simply because of water shortage.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, who is also deputy director of the water
conservancy bureau under the Shandong provincial government, the
water diversion project, once completed, will annually provide
three to nine billion cubic meters of water supply for Shandong
alone.
</P>
<P>
The project will also benefit Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei
Province to the north of Shandong, he added.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the first-phase engineering of the project,
to divert water from the lower reaches of the Yangtze in east
China's Jiangsu Province to the Yellow River in Shandong through
an upgraded ancient canal, would cost 7.5 billion yuan (900
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Given huge economic returns it could bring, the project is not
very costly," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said he is planning to submit a bill concerning the project
to the first annual session of the Ninth NPC scheduled to open
here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite sure that I shall obtain the support of more than 30
fellow lawmakers required for a bill submission," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Keen to See Asian Economies Stabilized, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
keen to see stability restored in Asia's economic and financial
markets and expects next month's second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
in London would make a positive difference on the issue, said a
senior British official here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was very much in Europe's interest to help Malaysia and
other Asian countries face financial problems, said British
Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Derek
Fatchett in a statement issued by the British High Commission.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said that Europe was not "just fair-weather friends",
Asia's problems were Europe's problems too.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully engaged in their resolution, not least through
our contribution toward international financial institutions, and
I fully expect involvement of our private sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU was keen to see stability and confidence
returned to the Asian markets as the first crucial step to solving
the problem.
</P>
<P>
"With our visit, we want to send a clear message not just to
the ministers we meet but to the financial markets and to the
people of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want ASEM II, which is scheduled from April 2 to 4 in
London, to make a positive difference on this issue," said
Fatchett who will be reporting to EU foreign ministers on his
discussions with Malaysian leaders after his return.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett is on a day's visit here as personal emissary of
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the special representative
of the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to call on Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim later Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett is accompanied by Jim Cloos, an aide of European
Commission President Jacques Santer and a senior British Treasury
official on his Southeast Asian trip.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to visit Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand
after his Malaysia tour.

PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The World Health Organization (WHO) has recognized criticism
from some humanitarian groups that it adopted a discriminatory
policy in Afghanistan toward women in 1997, after the Taliban banned
women from going to hospitals. The criticism was confirmed by a WHO
report based on the result of an investigative mission in
Afghanistan, which said that the WHO adopted ``an attitude of
collaboration'' with Taliban.
</P>
<P>
-- Hardly had the ink dried from the signings on the resolution
of U.N. Security Council adopted Monday evening on Iraq when a
polemic on the exact meaning of the terms used in the resolution
resumed. The United States said that the term ``severest
consequences'' includes military reprisal.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The number of people living on minimum social benefits in
France increased by 70 percent in 15 years to stand at 3.3 million,
as one in six French families are living under poverty line.
Meanwhile, the French government spends 2,300 billion francs (380
billion U.S. dollars) each year on social aid.
</P>
<P>
-- Winston Churchill once said: ``The Balkans have an annoying
tendency to produce more history than it can consume.'' One firebox
comes after another in the region: After Croatia and Bosnia, Kosovo
could sink in its turn into war. In order to prevent a new
conflagration in the Balkans, the British Foreign Secretary will fly
to Belgrade as representative of the European Union to discuss
Kosovo.

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- China's retail prices of
commodities in 1997 rose by 0.8 percent over the previous year
with their growth rate dropped by 5.3 percentage points, the State
Statistics Bureau announced today.
</P>
<P>
The consumer prices of households went up by 2.8 percent, with

</P>
<P>
This was attributed mainly to rational macro-economic policies
and to the consecutive harvest in agriculture.
</P>

Meanwhile, a buyer-oriented market has taken shape. The
strengthened role of market mechanism has also played a positive
role to some extent in curbing the price increase.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Refuses to Meet EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has refused to meet European Union External Affairs
Commissioner Hans van den Broek who will arrive here later
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Mail Wednesday quoted a spokesman for the European
Commission delegation in Cyprus as saying that a request for a
meeting between van den Broek and Denktash had been turned down
by the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Turkish Cypriot leader refused to meet Britain's
special envoy for Cyprus Sir David Hannay, who paid a 24-hour
visit to the island.
</P>
<P>
Van den Broek is due to arrive on the island Wednesday night
for talks with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Foreign
Minister Iaonnis Kasoulides on EU accession talks with Cyprus due
to begin on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Denktash told Turkey's private NTV television that he had
nothing to discuss with van den Broek.
</P>
<P>
Denktash was quoted as saying that Turkish Cypriots would never
agree to join the EU which excludes Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He said the debate on EU membership had been initiated in
order to "sabotage" the U.N.-led negotiations between the two
sides on the island.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on President Clerides' inaugural speech on Saturday,
in which he invited the Turkish Cypriot leader to build a common
homeland, Denktash said "if you invite me as a citizen of the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and President Denktash, the
doors to negotiations will open."
</P>
<P>
He warned that if Clerides rejected the invitation to talk
between two states and if Cyprus' accession to the EU took place,
then the island would be divided in two.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-controlled
south and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third in the
wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, which was only recognized by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit last December reaffirmed a decision to start
accession talks with Cyprus on March 31, a move denounced by
Denktash who took retaliatory measures, including suspension of
bicommunal contacts with the Greek Cypriot side since last
December.

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Beihai, a coastal city in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, has entered a period of
steady economic growth, a senior party official from the city said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The opening to traffic of the Naning-Kuming railway has given
an impetus to the development of Beihai, said Cen Hongping, a
deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress and secretary of
the Beihai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), who is here to attend the first session of the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Preferential treatments granted to Guangxi by the Central
Government and rich marine and tourist resources make Beihai a
hot spot for overseas and domestic investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of multinational corporations have recently signed
investment contracts worth billions of US dollars with the city,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Work on a thermo-power plant costing 8 billion yuan has started
this year; a project for separating oil from gas has started
operation; and a project to expand the Beihai Airport is near
completion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The property market, generally acknowledged as a barometer of
economic performance, is fast recovering in Beihai. Prices on the
local real estate market have soared 30 percent and the number of
apartment purchases has doubled this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city played host to 2.6 million Chinese and overseas
tourists last year, up 40 percent over the previous year. The
tourist market this year is booming, he said.
</P>
<P>
High-tech, information and service industries have also
developed rapidly in recent years in Beihai, he said.

CANBERRA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares closed higher
Wednesday, with a surge by BHP shares following the resignation of
managing director John Prescott propelling the market off morning

Associate Director of Macquarie Equities Lucinda Chan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin, Li Ruihuan Join Scientists in Panel Discussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin and senior
official of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
(CPPCC) Li Ruihuan this morning joined some scientists
attending the ongoing First Session of the Ninth CPPCC National
Committee in their panel discussions.
</P>
<P>
After listening to speeches of scientists, Jiang Zemin, also
general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, said that at the turn of the century science and
technology are playing an increasingly bigger role in economic
expansion around the world.
</P>
<P>
The trend highlights a rapid momentum of new and high
technologies with information technology as the key sector, closer
combination of economy and science and technology, new production
management and organization as the result of a new
technology-economy system, and greater attention to fostering
scientific and technological personnel, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Facing such a situation, all countries, big nations in
particular, are losing no time to map out their development
strategies geared to the 21st century," Jiang Zemin said.
</P>
<P>
"We must have a profound assessment of the great impact of
science and technology, especially high technology, on the overall
national strength, social and economic structure and the people's
life," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on scientists to be fully aware of both challenge and
opportunity brought about by the new technology revolution so as
to boost China's science and technology. Without scientific and
technological innovations, the national economy will be subjected
to others' control, and the economic gap cannot be narrowed.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party and government have been placing great
emphasis on the promotion of scientific and technological
advancement, Jiang said, adding that since the reform and
opening-up was initiated, a series of correct policies for
revitalizing the country with science and education have been
worked out.
</P>
<P>
In this sense, the president underlined the combination of
economy and science and technology, the development of both basic
and high-tech researches, and a proper selection of technological
projects of strategic significance to China's economic and social
progress, he said.
</P>
<P>
Talented professionals serve as the key factor for the growth
of science, technology and economy. Therefore, the social mood in
which knowledge is valued and the talents are respected should be
nurtured, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The state will exert more efforts to improve the working and
living conditions of intellectuals, protect intellectual property
rights and set up an incentive mechanism favorable to the talented
personnel, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, who presides over the meetings of executive
chairmen of the presidium of the First Session of the Ninth CPPCC
National Committee, said at the end of the panel that the speeches
of the scientists will be collected and forwarded to relevant
departments for study and reference.

</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Statistics Bureau (SSB) attributed the
upbeat performance in crops to increased investment and broader
application of agro-sciences and technology.
</P>
<P>
SSB figures indicate that cotton output registered a slight
increase in 1997 to chalk up 4.3 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, crop structures further improved along with an
increase in the output of high-quality, brand and speciality
agro-products. Sustained growth was registered in the output of
sugar, tobacco, tea and fruit.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by market demand and supply, the output of oil crops
and hemp, however, declined.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, China's farmland irrigation made remarkable headways
as 1.21 million ha of land was converted to cultivated farmland
with effective irrigation systems. And water-saving irrigation
systems expanded by 1.23 million ha of land, saving 10 billion
cubic meters of water in the year.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture has been listed top priority in China's investment
scheme. China attracted more than three billion US dollars of
foreign funds to its agricultural sector last year.
</P>
<P>
China plans to produce 490 million tons of grain and about 4.3
million tons of cotton this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Investment Structure Sees Positive Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Positive changes had taken place
in China's investment structure as the government made efforts to
boost basic industries and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB), investment in
basic industries and infrastructure, such as agriculture, energy,
transportation, and telecommunications, soared in 1997.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the investment indicates that input into
agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishery and water
conservancy totalled 47 billion yuan in 1997, up 40 percent from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, investment in the energy industry shot up by 21.7
percent to 357.5 billion yuan, and that in transportation and
telecommunications sectors by 14.8 percent to 328.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A SSB spokesman said at a press conference today that growth of
investment in China's western areas accelerated thanks to
government efforts to spur the local development.
</P>
<P>
China's fixed assets investment rose 10.1 percent in 1997 to
2.53 trillion yuan and its efficiency improved.
</P>
<P>
China completed and put into operation 81,181 projects in 1997
through capital construction or technical upgrading, representing
55.8 percent of all projects under construction, up 1.6 percentage
points from 1996.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Slumps on Weak GDP Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar slumped
following the release of disappointing national accounts figures
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar began the day on a softer tone, under
pressure from lower gold and commodity prices, and weaker Asian
currencies.
</P>
<P>
Its spirits were further dampened by the weaker-than-expected
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank foreign exchange dealer Nick Volanakis said
the weak data and falling Asian currencies weighed heavily on the
Australian dollar, which slipped half a U.S. cent to close at
67.82 U.S. cents, from 68.36 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics said GDP(A) rose 0.5
percent, slightly lower than economists' forecasts which had
centered on a rise of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
A 6.5 percent fall in spending on non-dwelling construction and
a drop of 3.7 percent in expenditure on equipment led to the
lower-than-expected outcome for GDP(A).
</P>
<P>
Economists said strong domestic demand was countered by
weakness in external trade, which clawed back two thirds of
domestic growth.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to hold the view that barring a currency collapse,
the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is more likely to ease rates
than raise rates in the foreseeable future and this is the bias we
retain on our monetary policy call," economist Richard Yetsenga
said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yetsenga said the tone of recent RBA writings gave the
impression that the central bank sees a lower Australian dollar as
a more reasonable market/policy response to the type of problems
facing the Australian economy at present than lower interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
"As such we retain the view that the Australian dollar will at
least re-test the recent lows or make new lows over the next three
to six months," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar fell to 85.25
Japanese yen from 85.80 at the close here Tuesday, and to 1.2272
Deutsche marks from 1.2420.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Lost 140 Million Rand in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Banks in South Africa lost
nearly 140 million Rand (28 million U.S. Dollars) in armed
robberies last year, local daily the Citizen reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The heavy loss is 31.5 million Rand (6.3 million dollars) more
than the amount lost in 1996, the Council of South African Banks
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The statistics released at a media conference Tuesday revealed
that the banking industry had recorded an increase in both the
number of incidents, and the amounts of money involved in
robberies.
</P>
<P>
A total of 465 robberies netting 139.9 million Rand (28
million dollars) took place last year, compared to 408 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the 465 incidents last year, 103 were bank-related
cash-in-transit robberies involving 64.8 million Rand (12.9
million dollars)
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the South African banking industry
has ever released official bank robbery statistics, which,
political analysts said, was designed to draw attention to the
seriousness of the crime being committed with a view to
addressing the trend.
</P>
<P>
According to Bob Tucker, chief executive of the council, South
Africa's banks have used remote central control TV systems, time
delay locks on vaults, rapid response teams, undercounter cashier
safes, metal detectors, double lock doors, sophisticated bulk
cash containers and guards to protect staff, clients and cash.
</P>
<P>
"Despite spending more than 400 million Rand (80 million
dollars) to protect money, it is increasingly found that the
harder it is for the thieves to access cash, the more violent
their methods become," Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
As security strategies became more successful, robbers would
move on to the next weak link in the whole cash chain, including
retail operations, pension payouts and sports events where large
amounts of cash were collected, Tucker said, noting armed bank
robberies had become big business for big syndicates.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Chiefs Own 96% of Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambian chiefs own 96 percent of
land of the country, Lands Minister Samuel Miyanda has said.
</P>
<P>
The Post Wednesday quoted him as telling parliament Tuesday
that the government owns only the remainder.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the traditional rulers have recommended that
14,000 hectares in their areas be given to investors but the
government has refused and instead settled on 2,500 hectares.
</P>
<P>
He announced that his ministry will start looking at the
chiefs' boundaries to sort out the quarrels over this issue.
</P>
<P>
The last agreed note on boundaries for the chiefs was in 1940s
and nothing else ever since.
</P>
<P>
"A substantial amount of land was given out last year to
Zambians and not foreigners. There is also a special
consideration for women and vulnerable groups. We are very gender
sensitive, for example, out of 103 plots from the Lusaka South
Forestry Reserve, 33 plots have been offered to women," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that a new land circular is coming next
month which will spell out the process to be followed when
allocating land.
</P>
<P>
"My ministry will do everything possible to avail land to
Zambians to enable them to have shelter and grow food for
themselves. This is the only way we can make people rich. If
people remain poor we can not claim to have developed their
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is said that there are over 200 traditional leaders across
the country.

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Work on the seepage-proof walls of
the cofferdams up and downstream in the second phase of the Three
Gorges Water Control Project is progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Chen Xiaolin, a woman chief engineer
and deputy head of the Three Gorges Project headquarters, who is
now in Beijing to attend the First Session of the Ninth People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
On the latest developments in the construction of the project,
Chen said the temporary shiplock at the Three Gorges Project began
to be filled with water on February 28, marking a significant
progress since the damming of the Yangtze River in early November
1997. It is expected to be navigable on the first of May this
year.
</P>
<P>
Technicians and workers have tackled a series of technical
problems in building the two seepage-proof walls which cover a
total construction area of 83,500 sq. m with the maxim designed
depth of 74 m. So far, 30,000 sq. m. have been completed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, concrete has been poured into the foundation pit of

<HEADLINE> Ranariddh Sentenced to Five-Year Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian deposed First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh was sentenced to a five-year
imprisonment on Wednesday by the country's Military Court on
charges of illegally purchasing and transporting weapons and
destabilizing the state.
</P>
<P>
The trial went ahead in the absence of all the three accused,
including General Nhiek Bun Chhay, the prince's top military
commander, and Thach Suong, chief of the prince's bodyguard
unit. They were sentenced to four and two years respectively, but
Thach Suong had got a probation.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh, who is currently in Bangkok, has been in exile since
being ousted after heavy fighting between the forces loyal to him
and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen last July.
</P>
<P>
Nine people appeared in court as a witness and some weapons as
a material evidence were displayed. The trial was held at the hall
of the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's trial, along with a second hearing scheduled for
March 17, is part of a Japanese-brokered peace plan aimed at
allowing the prince to return to Cambodia in time to participate
in July's elections.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh has to obtain a pardon from his farther, King Norodom
Sihanouk, to clear the way for his participation in the upcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
The charges against the prince arose from last May's seizure of
2.8-ton shipment of weapons and ammunitions on arrival at
Sihanoukville Port, addressed to Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The prince's cabinet in Bangkok issued a statement on the eve
of the trial, condemning the court as politically controlled and
predicting a conviction for Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The statement declared that the FUNCINPEC party would not
recognize and would flatly reject all of the trials of Prince
Ranariddh on Wednesday and any other trials in the future.

<HEADLINE> Australian Exporters Need to Work Harder Amidst </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian exporters will have to
work harder than ever to penetrate markets and establish a
competitive advantage in East Asia as well as in other markets,"
said the Trade Outcomes and Objectives Statement 1998 released
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The severe deterioration in trading conditions in East Asia
would have an adverse impact on Australian exports to the region.
Lower export earnings resulting from the Asian downturn would
affect domestic activity, creating lower corporate profitability
and higher input costs, the 265-page report said.
</P>
<P>
"The consequent slowing in output growth will affect
employment, though not until later in 1998-99 given the lags
between output variations and employment," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Tabling the document, Trade Minister Tim Fischer said in
parliament that the government saw the need to maintain momentum
for economic reform and trade liberalization as an imperative.
</P>
<P>
"The government is committed to Asia for the long haul,"
Fischer said, adding "We are talking to Australian businesses and
putting in place practical measures to assist Australian companies
over coming months."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar's depreciation, related to Asia's
currency woes, would have a modest impact on consumer price
inflation, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Overall import prices were set to rise, as most of Australia's
imports came from countries against whose currencies the
Australian dollar had depreciated. "This will have a modest impact
on consumer price inflation," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Suppliers of raw and intermediate goods, making up the bulk of
exports, are expected to be hit the hardest in Australia, the
report added.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Economic Growth Fails to Reach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Economic activity in Australia
slowed in the last three months of 1997, failing to meet
expectations that the growth would surpass the four percent
barrier, figures released Wednesday showed.
</P>
<P>
National accounts released by the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) showed that the country's annual economic growth
was 3.6 percent in 1997, well below the 4.1 percent growth
anticipated by financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The ABS survey found the economy as measured by average gross
domestic product grew by 0.5 percent, seasonally adjusted, in the
December quarter.
</P>
<P>
The quarterly rise was the lowest since the March quarter last
year and less than half the 1.1 percent recorded in the September
quarter survey.
</P>
<P>
The factors leading to the slowdown were falls in farm and
manufacturing production, wholesale trade, a decline in
investment, a slump in exports and reduced corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
Australia's annual economic growth rate was slightly below the
federal government's mid-year review forecast for 1997-98 of 3.75
percent.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Ruling Party Slams Trade Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The ruling party Tuesday
condemned the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU)-led mass
stayaway by workers and called on "patriotic" workers to report
for work Wednesday, according to the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF)
Secretary for Commissariat and Culture Moven Mahachi said ZANU
(PF) and the government were committed to solving economic
difficulties facing the country through dialogue as the stayaway
was "being instigated by self-seekers who employ intimidatory
tactics in order to foster lawlessness in the country."
</P>
<P>
"These uncalled for ultimatums, threats and work boycotts can
only succeed in hurting the workers themselves, our peasantry and
the nation as a whole," said Mahachi in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi, who is also the defense minister, said it was no
secret that the government was facing economic problems, but
these were being exacerbated by "directionless bigots" bent on
hurting the people they "purportedly represent for a few,
ill-gotten pieces of silver from their marauding masters."
</P>
<P>
He said the workers should not be woodwinked by a few
individuals whose goal was to grab at every opportunity to
undermine the democratically elected government and form their
own party to oppose the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said the ZCTU had developed a culture of
confrontation, anarchy and violence. The stayaway was
detrimental to the national economy hence the need for the labor
movement to engage in meaningful dialogue with the government on
their demands.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the difficulties being faced by most Zimbabweans
to the liberalization of the economy, introduced by the
government as part of the structural adjustment program in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"It is this difficult path Zimbabwe had to inevitably take in
order to keep in step with all other countries around. The only
noble way to iron out differences and disputes is through
peaceful means, and that is through dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the country's industry was said to
have suffered from the stayaway organized by the ZCTU to press
the government into scrapping a 2.5 percentage sales tax effected
late last year, remove developmental levy, reduce the prices of
all basic commodities and other demands affecting the workers.
The two-day national strike started Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Consensus Reached on Institutional Restructuring: NPC Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- It is high time China carried out
a government restructuring program since the current government
structure is not well adapted to a socialist market economy,
according to an NPC session spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Zeng Jianhui conceded that China's government
institutions have been plagued by unwieldiness and staff
redundance. Separation of the functions of the government from
those of the enterprise has proved to be difficult, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The current government structure is ill-adapted to the need of
a socialist market economy and restructuring is,
therefore,imperative," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Conditions are now ripe for launching a restructuring program
since a consensus has been reached on the need for such a
program," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the focal points of the upcoming NPC session is to
examine a restructuring program proposed by the State Council, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the program, he said, is to establish a highly
efficient, well-coordinated and standardized administrative
system.
</P>
<P>
Government functions will be altered to make sure that the
government will no longer be able to meddle with enterprises'
daily operation, he said.

KATHMANDU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A new international convention
for child labor elimination is to be adopted in 1999, it is
disclosed at a press conference held here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The draft convention on the most intolerable forms of child
labor is currently under discussion, said a press release issued
by the Global March Against Child Labor '98.
</P>
<P>
The global march team, which started in Manila, Philippines on
January 17, arrived in Nepal on 26 February and in Kathmandu
Tuesday after touring Hong Kong, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand,
Malaysia, Singapore and Bangladesh.

<P>
During its week-long travel throughout Nepal, the 63-member
team including 30 children and 33 adults from 12 countries and
regions attended press meetings, mass rally, culture and talk
programs, exhibitions and other activities.
</P>
<P>
The march has captured the support of thousands of people and
organizations along the way, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
The global march against child labor, the greatest ever
mobilization of its kind, aims to mobilize worldwide efforts to
protect and promote the rights of all children, especially the
right to receive a free, meaningful education and to be free from
economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely
to be damaging their physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social
development, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Two other parallel march teams, which originated from Cape
Town, South Africa and Rio De Janerio, Brazil respectively, are
winding their way through Africa, Latin America, North America and
Europe.

<P>
The march will culminate in June at the opening of the
International Labor Conference in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The press release said in the world today, about 250 million
children are the victims of child labor exploitation, of which
South Asia accounts for 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
And in Nepal, there are at least one million child workers and
40,000 are bonded laborers.
</P>
<P>
Children from different countries told the press conference
that they want to go to school, play and have a rest instead of to
work.
</P>
<P>
A total of 120 members of Nepal's parliament have pledged their
solidarity and commitment in the global march.
</P>
<P>
The team is scheduled to march toward India Thursday, then
toward Pakistan and some European countries.

<P>
NANNING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Work has begun on a 7.7-kilometer
(km) section of a double-track railway from Luchuan to Meipo in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The project is one part of the project to double-track the
railway line running from Litang in the Guangxi region to
Zhanjiang in neighboring Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of more than 400 million yuan, double-tracking of the
318-km Litang-Zhanjiang railway line has been under way
since last year and should be finished by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The line is believed to be the most convenient passageway
linking the country's southwest inland areas with south coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
Along with the speedy economic development of southwest China,
the single-track Litang-Zhanjiang line cannot meet the
fast-growing traffic demand.
</P>
<P>
The double-tracking of the railway line is expected to give an
impetus to economic development in Guangxi as well as in southwest
China.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: A Little Square Blanket of Uygur NPC Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Sadik Karihaji, a deputy of Uygur
ethnic group to the First Session of the Ninth National People
Congress (NPC), performed five religious services a day in his
room at the Jingxi Hotel in western Beijing since his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the green square blanket inlaid with a yellow lace
at his bedside, Sadik said, "The blanket is used specially to
perform services and I have brought it here whenever I come to
attend a NPC session."
</P>
<P>
Sadik, 66, has been serving as an imam at the Aitika Mosque in
Kashgar, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, for
three years.
</P>
<P>
He bought the pure-wool blanket when he was elected a deputy
to the Eighth National People's Congress in 1993 for the first
time. Today, the blanket still looks neat, simple yet elegant,
though it has been used on many times.
</P>
<P>
His roommate, Yusuyin Yusut, secretary of Xinjiang's Yusuin
Township Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC),
witnesses what Sadik does everyday.
</P>
<P>
"China practices a policy of freedom in religious belief.
so everyone is free to believe or not to believe in religion,"
Yusuyin said.
</P>
<P>
"As a member of the Communist Party, I myself don't believe in
religion. And the Koran doesn't compel anyone to join in the ranks
of believers either," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sadik leads more than 2,000 Moslems to eulogize Allah at the
25,000-sq-m mosque in his hometown daily and, on every Friday, as
many as 10,000 believers flock to the mosque for the service.
During Islamic festival, his recitations can reach more than
70,000 attendants through audio amplifiers.
</P>
<P>
He is concurrently president of a Koran school, which has 140
students.
</P>
<P>
"Our lawful rights and interests are protected by the
government," Sadik said. Islam encourages its followers to work
hard and honestly, and become, which complies with the relevant
government policy.
</P>
<P>
In the capacity of a NPC deputy from the religious circle,
Sadik pays attention all the more to poverty-alleviation measures
that are included in the government report. As he does not know
the Han or Chinese Language, he got a copy of the government
report in Uygur language.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I know, quite a number of imams deputies from Gansu
and Henan provinces and Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, where
Moslem people live in compact community, will not suspend their
religious services during the NPC session," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 16 vessels are waiting
to discharge their cargo at the already congested port of
Mombasa, causing huge losses, according to the Kenya Ports
Authority (KPA).
</P>
<P>
Shipping lines said Tuesday that they were losing some 100
million Kenyan Shillings (about 1.7 million U.S. Dollars) every
week due to the current ship congestion and cargo build-up at the
port which has more than 3,500 uncollected container boxes.
</P>
<P>
Captain B. Healy of African Liners Agencies Ltd. said that
some of the waiting vessels arrived on February 22, the Daily
Nation Wednesday quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Officials from shipping lines blamed the congestion problem at
the port on a massive breakdown of handling equipment while KPA
officials stated that the build-up of cargo and vessels at the
port was due to the rehabilitation work going on at one berth.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to alleviate the congestion, KPA has converted
four berths, which are supposed to handle conventional cargo, to
handling containerized goods, KPA official said.

<P>
TIANJIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Northern China's largest port,
Tianjin, expects to increase the use of investment from
multinationals to make itself into their international production
base.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, 199 multinationals had decided to invest
8.3 billion US dollars in 311 projects in the city. As a result, a
number of small and medium-sized enterprises have grown up
providing them with parts valued at 7.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is one of China's leading coastal cities in terms of
overseas investment. By the end of 1997, it had 11,522
overseas-funded enterprises, with overseas investment worth nearly
20 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Improved investment and other conditions provide a good way to
attract more investment from multinationals, according to
Vice-mayor Ye Disheng.
</P>
<P>
Of the US's ten biggest companies, six have put investment in
Tianjin, and some, like Otis and Motorola, have used Tianjin as an
Asian production base.

the U.S., Britain, France and Germany this year and increase the
use of overseas funds in automobiles, electronics, chemicals,
metallurgy, and textiles.

<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-hwa, chief executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, will attend the First
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) scheduled to
open tomorrow, according to an NPC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Tung will be present at the congress in a non-voting
capacity," NPC session spokesman Zen Jianhui told a press
conference this morning. "This will help him acquire a better
understanding of the country's conditions and better implement the
'one country, two systems' policy."
</P>
<P>
Responding to a Hong Kong reporter's question about whether or
not there are any differences in obligations and duties between
Hong Kong deputies and their mainland counterparts, Zeng said
that, like their counterparts in the mainland, deputies from Hong
Kong will participate in the work of China's top legislature and
take part in the administration of state affairs.
</P>
<P>
They also have the same rights and obligations as their
mainland counterparts when the NPC is or is not in session, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong deputies can take part in drafting motions on
amending the Basic Law of the HKSAR and be on election committees
whose functions are to elect the HKSAR chief executive and HKSAR
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman pointed out, according to the policies
of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong, NPC deputies,
from the mainland and Hong Kong alike, do not have the right and
obligation to exercise supervision over the work of HKSAR
government, nor can they interfere with HKSAR's affairs within the
scope of its administrative autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Automobile Rental Services Becoming Popular in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Automobile rentals have gained
popularity in north China's Tianjin Municipality since
September.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said four major corporations, together with
numerous small companies, are offering rental services in the
city. Automobiles for rent at these companies include Daihatsu
mini-vans and Xiali-brand cars, both manufactured in the city,
and Santana-brand cars, which are made by Shanghai Volkswagen
Corp., a Sino-German joint venture.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming majority of the customers rent automobiles for
private purposes. A customer may rent a Daihatsu mini-van for a
day at a price of 70 yuan to 80 yuan, or spend 100 yuan or so to
rent a Xiali-brand car for a day, but Santana cars have fewer
customers as they are more expensive, said Li Fan, general manager
of the Lease Service Center of China, Agricultural Machinery
Corp., Huabei Branch.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, his center has 250 cars of 17 types for
rent. On an average day, 60 percent of the fleet is rented,
he said. But that climbs to more than 90 percent during holiday
periods.
</P>
<P>
For instance, during this year's Spring Festival, which fell on
Jan. 28-30, automobile availability at Li's center was unable to
meet demands.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the boom in auto leasing service to changes
in people's attitudes as Tianjin opens wider to the outside
world.

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Blindness Prevention Program in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
emphasize the prevention of blindness among rural residents in
regions inhabited by ethnic minority groups and border areas.
</P>
<P>
The information was released from an ongoing three-day
international symposium on preventing blindness in China, which
opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ministry of Health official Liu Keling said at the
symposium that Chinese urban residents enjoy better medical
conditions for treating eye diseases than those living in rural
areas, where the incidence of eye diseases is higher because of
cultural and hygienic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that one-third of the country's more than 2,400
counties have no ophthalmologists or are not capable of operating
on patients with eye diseases.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has done a great deal to resolve this
problem. Each year, medical groups are sent to rural areas and
border areas to perform eye operations and publicize the knowledge
about eye diseases, in addition to providing medical instruments
and helping train medical workers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has actively cooperated with the World
Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies in
preventing blindness, and has plans to equip 100 county-level
hospitals with ophthalmology departments, more than 10,000
ophthalmological workers and 4,000 eye doctors by the year
2001.

<HEADLINE> Top Seed Philippoussis Advances in Scottsdale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Mark Philippoussis of
Australia advanced to the second round of the Franklin Templeton
Classic men's tennis tournament by beating Argentina's qualifier
Franco Squillari, 6-2, 7-5, in Scottsdale, the United States on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The big-serve Australian did not use his powerful service -- he
just fired 10 aces including a cannon of 220 kilometers per hour
(137 mile per hour) -- but the quality groundstrokes to blow out
his left-hander opponent.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis, ranked 13th in the world, who beat Michael Chang
in Memphis final last month, broke in the third game in the first
set and the 11th in the second, which was enough for him to see
off his 92nd-ranked contester in one hour.
</P>
<P>
Philippoussis next faces Tommy Haas, who defeated
country-fellow German Michael Joyce 6-2, 6-2 in another
first-round match.
</P>
<P>
But the tournament lost Boris Becker of Germany who had pulled
out of the tournament because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
The former world number one was scheduled to play Germany's
Nicolas Kiefer, current German number one player who ranked 28th
in the world and seeded fourth in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
Becker, six-time Grand Slam singles champion, lost his doubles
first-round match with partner Thomas Messmer to Americans Dave
Randall and Jack Waiter, 6-2, 6-0 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old, ranked 66th in the world currently, will be
replaced by Scott Draper of Australia, ranked 80th in the world.

<HEADLINE> Service Sector Leading Contributor of Shanghai Revenues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, an economic powerhouse
in China, registered 73.39 billion yuan in revenues last year,
55.4 percent of which were from the local service sector.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the service sector replaced the local
industry as the largest contributor to the city's coffers,
according to the Municipal Bureau of Finance.
</P>
<P>
This is a great change from the years before 1990, when more
than 70 percent of local revenues came from the industrial
sector. The change also reflects local efforts to restructure
economic setups.
</P>
<P>
The service sector now accounts for 45.5 percent of the local
gross domestic product (GDP), partly because of the speedy
development of local finance-related and insurance businesses
during recent years.
</P>
<P>
Financial revenues collected from local finance and insurance
businesses were 17.7 billion yuan last year, 2.1 times the 1996
figure.
</P>
<P>
Local service sectors such as domestic trade, transportation,
postal and telecommunications, tourism and real estate also
maintained a fast-growing momentum.
</P>
<P>
Transportation, postal and telecommunications, and tourism paid
more than two billion yuan in taxes in 1997, up more than 20 percent
from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Because of further improvement of the local economic framework,
the service sector is expected to account for 60 percent of local
revenues by the turn of the century, with industry accounting for
39 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>

India`s general election is inching towards the finale, the race
for formation of a new government has geared up among major
political players in the country,

Bharatiya Janata Party(BJP) and its allies secured 248 seats while
the Congress and its allies won 167, the United Front got 92 and
the remaining 18 went to others.
</P>
<P>
As expected, non of the major forces in India's political arena
passed the crucial figure of 273 in the Lok Sabha(the Lower House
of Parliament) to form a government independently.
</P>
<P>
To get the majority for government formation, both the BJP-led
alliance as well as the Congress and the United Front have geared
up their efforts to seek new allies in smaller parties and groups.
</P>
<P>
BJP General Secretary and Spokesman Venkaiah Naidu vowed
Tuesday to form the next government, saying that "what we need is
just about 20 more MPs and there are groups and parties which are
committed to anti-congressism."
</P>
<P>
BJP leaders said it had already identified new allies who would
not want to see the Congress at the center.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Congress and the main constituents of the
outgoing United Front favored a coalition of all secular forces to
keep the BJP, Labeled "communal forces", and its allies out of
power.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both the Congress and the United Front spoke in
conciliatory terms vowing to form a government jointly.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Indian President Kocheril Raman Narayanan
was busy studying the complicated situation and preparing for an
exercise that would give the country a measure of political
stability.
</P>
<P>
"With a hung House, the ball is now in the Presidents court",
said the Times of India in its front page article.
</P>
<P>
With political stability for the country as his watch word,
President Narayanan is understood to be pondering over various
permutations and combinations whereby he can swear in a government
at the center that will last long enough.
</P>
<P>
The president is already in touch with the Attorney-General
Ashok Desai and other experts on constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan is believed to favor the participation in the
government by all parties so that none has the licence and the
advantage to pull it down.

<HEADLINE> Northern Chinese Railway Repays World Bank Loans On Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A railway line in China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region introducing a new system of independent
operation and responsibility for profit and loss has been able to
repay the World Bank loans on time.
</P>
<P>
The 945-km Jining-Tongliao railway is China's longest raiway
line operated in the form of Sino-foreign joint venture. It was
built by Inner Mongolia and China's Railway Ministry with 150
million U.S. dollars (1.2 billion yuan) in WB loans. It began
service on December 1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to a company executive, the operator had originally
expected to start repayment of the loans in 1995 and pay back the
total amount by 2009, based on the fact that the railway runs
through the backward pastureland area in Inner Mongolia which had an
anticipated severe shortage of freight for about five years.
</P>
<P>
However, The introduction of the new responsibility system has
given free rein to the management advantage and the operator had a
good economic performance. As a result, the company repaid the
loans as planned for three years running. Last November, the
company paid back 121 million yuan of the principal and the
interest to the WB.
</P>
<P>
The company carried 4.8 million tons of goods and achieved a
rough balance of profit and loss in the first year of operation
and reported an increase of 2.5 million tons in freight volume,
and earnings of 530 million yuan in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese City Using Foreign Loans For Urban Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The capital of Hainan Province,
China's largest special economic zone, is using more foreign
government loans to improve its infrastructure, which is not
meeting its rapid economic growth needs.
</P>
<P>
The Mipu Waterworks project for improving the water supply and
protecting underground water resources is one example. It got
moving again after being delayed because of a shortage of funds
after it got a German government loan for 7.3-million Deutsch
marks. It is now at the installation stage and will increase the
clean water capacity to 240,000 tons per month.
</P>
<P>
A bridge connecting Haidian Islet to the city proper will use a
50-million-US-dollar loan provided by the Japanese
government. Twenty-three domestic and foreign companies are
expected to compete in the public bidding.
</P>
<P>
The Meishe River, which runs through the city and is seriously
polluted, is another example. Pollution treatment has long been
delayed, again due to lack of money, and has aroused serious
complaints, but the first phase of treatment of the 5-km
watercourse is about to begin with the help of 4.9 million US
dollars from the Republic of Korean government.

<HEADLINE> Nazarbayev: Kazakhstan Sees Agreement with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh president Nursultan
Nazarbayev said Tuesday that Alma Ata and Moscow should agree this
year on economic measures to improve trade.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said at a meeting on Tuesday with visiting Russian
Minister of Cooperation with CIS Countries Anatoly Adamishin that
a series of documents on improving mutual cooperation were signed
when Russian government leaders visited Kazakhstan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
These documents laid sound foundation for the economic
integration of the two countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries plunged by 14.3 percent in 1996
due to their different taxation policies, but Nazarbayev claimed
the issue should be solved this year.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Kazakhstan were still at odds over the payback of
rent on Baikonur Cosmodrome owed to Kazakhstan by Russia, which
totals 460 million U.S. dollars, and the 27.5 million dollar debt
for the use of Kazakh facilities for military tests.
</P>
<P>
But Adamishin said he believed the problem could be solved to
both sides' satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that an identical stance on the legal status
of Caspian Sea would be helpful in finding a solution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the government heads of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) scheduled for mid-March will make the
future of CIS clearer, said Adamishin. Currently all member states
wanted the CIS to continue but thought reforms should be made with
economic integration and a regional common market taking
priority.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Service Sector Attracted To Southern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's service sector has
begun to move into Guangzhou, the capital of nearby Guangdong
Province, because of Guangzhou's human resources, low rents and
housing costs, management environment, and common language.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong multinationals like Cathay Pacific Airways, Hong Kong
and Shanghai Banking Corp., and Bank of East Asia have moved their
information databases and logistic support to Guangzhou, buying or
renting office buildings there.
</P>
<P>
The transfers will help regional companies lower production
costs, improve competitiveness, and help develop business in the
mainland, economists say.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of computers has made it possible for
large businesses to separate counter services and offices, so that
finance, transport, communications, and consulting businesses can
move to major mainland cities, with Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Shanghai,
and Beijing being the favorites.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, Hongkong manufacturers moved a large number of
factories to the mainland, particularly the Pearl River Delta in
Guangdong Province, stimulating local economic growth, but
higher-level cooperation is now the preferred pattern.

<HEADLINE> Belarussian President Says CIS Leaders Obstruct Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said Tuesday that heads of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) have become a major obstruction to
accelerating CIS development.
</P>
<P>
The ITAR-Tass news agency reported that Lukashenko made the
remarks in Minsk, the capital of Belarussia, during an
international meeting on problems and prospects in the CIS.
</P>
<P>
He said the loose alliance of former Soviet republics was a
failure. The disintegration of the Soviet Union was the biggest
disaster of geopolitics in the 20th century. It has also caused
catastrophic economic results. The destruction of the former
union's combined efforts result in a loss of more than 10 billion
U.S. dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
But the CIS has failed to play a constructive role in
preventing or softening the bad results, the Belarussian president
said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko also complained that the CIS nations have different
views on NATO's eastward expansion. None of the members of the
CIS, except Russia and Belarussia, have expressed opposition to
the NATO expansion publicly.
</P>
<P>
The CIS was formed after the former Soviet Union disintegrated
in 1991. The CIS united all former Soviet republics except the
three Baltic nations.

LOS ANGELES, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Both Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo
Inc. claimed Tuesday that they had the biggest chunk of soft-drink
sales in the Arab market.
</P>
<P>
"Coca-Cola Co. has taken market leadership in the Middle East
and North Africa region, an area long dominated by competition,"
Coca-Cola company said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Coca-Cola products now represented 38
percent of total regional sales, while Pepsi has only 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
PepsiCo spokesman Keith Hughes, however, said his company has
46 percent of total regional sales, adding that in the market of
the Middle East -- the Gulf states and the eastern Mediterranean,
including Jordan and Lebanon -- "We have roughly 73 percent
vs. their 22 percent."
</P>
<P>
Arab countries boycotted Coca-Cola products until late 1980s
because of the company supplied its financial support for Israel.
The company returned to the Arab market following the start of
current peaceful negotiations between Israel and Arab leaders in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola said it had invested 400 million U.S. dollars in the
Arab market over the past five years and plans to spend 200
million U.S. dollars more in the region in the next three years.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. business failures jumped
16 percent last year after two years of little change, according
to a survey conducted by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Corp.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, business failures totaled 83,384 in 1997, as every
industry group except mining and wholesale companies posted an
increase, the survey said. The number of business failures
climbed 19 percent to 20,089 from 16,879 in California.
</P>
<P>
The number of business failures should rise in the next few
years, as more new companies enter the market, said Joseph Duncan,
chief economic advisor for Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, adding that stiff
competition is expected ahead.
</P>
<P>
He said that even though the number of failures is now
approaching the high levels reached during the recession of the
early 1990s, the economic impact is subdued because company
liabilities, or debt, remain at low levels.
</P>
<P>
Liabilities from the failures soared 27 percent to 37.4 billion
U.S. dollars nationwide while rising 5.1 percent in California to
5.71 billion U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will give support to the
Asia-Europe Fund proposed by Britain, Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
said during a meeting with visiting British Foreign Secretary
Derek Fatchett Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fund will top the agenda of the second summit of
Asia-Europe meeting in London next month, the Nation newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Prime Minister Chuan stressed that such a
fund should include a guarantee facility for private-sector
liquidity flow.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett also held a separate meeting with his Thai counterpart
Surin Pitsuwan, during which Surin also highlighted that the
proposed fund should reflect more dynamism and concreteness to
help reduce the private sector's financial burden by providing
export guarantees and liquidity support.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett said that Britain would contribute 5 million Pounds
(8.3 million U.S. dollars) to the fund. He added that the proposal
has obtained support from Scandinavian countries including Sweden
and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary said he will make the proposal at
the EU ministerial meeting in Edinburgh on March 13.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett's trip to Thailand as the emissary of British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and the 15-member European Union (EU) was part
of a fact-finding mission, which will also take him to Malaysia,
Indonesia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He also came here to launch the "UK in Asia" campaign which
aimed to strengthen political and economic ties between the United
Kingdom and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Turmoil in Asia would be a key issue at the Asia-Europe summit
meeting since Asia's problems were now Europe's problems, he said
at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett also told Prime Minister Chuan that Britain, which is
Thailand's largest trading partner in EU, was considering helping
roll over Thai private-sector debts.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A reform plan aiming to make the
Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) a self-regulating body won
approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Board,
a newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The SEC Tuesday approved amendments to encourage market reform,
under a program funded by a 300-million-U.S. dollar loan from the
Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
A key objective of the reform is to increase the independence
of the SEC and to make SET a self-regulating organization.
</P>
<P>
The number of SEC directors from the civil service will be
limited, the Bangkok Post newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also approved other changes, including rules
encouraging development of the provident fund sector, fairer
treatment for clients of securities brokerages, establishment of
more credit-rating agencies, improved disclosure of financial
information and higher penalties for insider trading.
</P>
<P>
The SEC announced that local securities firms would be allowed
to open more branch offices to better service investors.
</P>
<P>
There are now 139 brokerage offices, consisting of 41 head
offices, five branch offices and 93 representative offices.
</P>
<P>
The amendments passed by the SEC board will be forwarded to the
cabinet for formal approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, March 3 (Xinhua) --The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina will not
intervene in the latest Kosovo conflict as their mandate is
restricted to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, said a Stablization
Force (SFOR) spokesman Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian News Agency quoted Luois Garneau as saying that
events in Kosovo were cause for concern in the international
community, but the NATO headquarters, and not SFOR, were
responsible for analyzing the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We do not have plans to station our soldiers in Kosovo. It is
not our job but the NATO's," he said, adding that the current
mandate excludes involvement in Kosovo or Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Tension in Kosovo was raised on March 1 after an escalation of
an armed conflict between Serbian police and local ethnic
Albanians, leading to the deaths of four policemen and 16
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority which has been
seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981.

<HEADLINE> More Arable Land Protected in South China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
has taken effective measures to protect its arable land, resulting
in increasing 60,000 hectares of arable land in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
Each resident in Guangdong possesses an average of 0.03 hectare
of arable land, less than half that of the whole country. With the
development of city construction and industrial exploitation,
arable land tends to decrease.
</P>
<P>
To cope with such a situation, Guangdong Province has set up
special organizations responsible for land resources management
and set aside 37,000 hectares of land previously not for farming
use for agricultural purpose.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the provincial government has invested 50 million
yuan annually to encourage land exploitation. Favorable policies
were instituted to encourage people to exploit arable land.
</P>
<P>
Those who exploit arable land can use and benefit from it, and
are free from agriculture taxes for three-to-five years.
</P>
<P>
The province also established agricultural development
centers. Until now, Guangdong had conceived 100 projects to
develop arable land, and is concentrating on exploiting
wasteland.

provided Indonesia with a 20 billion yen (158 million U.S.
dollars) quick disbursement loan to support the country's human
resource development, sources at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The new loan, in the form of a sector program loan, was handed
over Indonesia Tuesday by Japanese Ambassador here, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The loan supplements a 195.2 billion yen (1.5 billion U.S.
dollars) overseas development assistance package announced by
Japan during the Consultative Group for Indonesia's (CGI) sixth
meeting in last June in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Part of the new loan would be used to finance small projects
for education and human resources development training, social
welfare and health care.
</P>
<P>
the loan is payable in 30 years, including a grace period of 10
years, with an interest rate of 2.2 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the largest single creditor to Indonesia. For the
1997/98 fiscal year (starting from April 1), Japan pledged 215.2
billion yen in new loans through the CGI creditor consortium to
Indonesia, despite its plan to slash its official development
assistance (ODA) worldwide by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia received 190.1 billion yen in Japanese ODA loans in
1996/97 and 170.1 billion yen in 1995/96.

<HEADLINE> Southern Chinese Gulf Area Economically Active Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Coastal parts of China's Beibu Gulf
in Guangdong and Hainan provinces and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, which suffered from a bubble economy in the
1990s, especially in real estate, are beginning to be active
again.
</P>
<P>
Hainan had only 4.3 percent economic growth in 1995, one of the
country's lowest figures, but last year, the economy of the island
province, which is China's largest special economic zone, grew 6.7
percent and it is expected to average 8 percent over the next
three years.
</P>
<P>
The rosy outlook is due partly to a southwestern seaway that is
taking shape in the area, according to Tao Bohua, a research
fellow at the Hainan Beibu Gulf Research Institute, who says that
the economy in the area has bottomed out and is beginning an
upward movement.
</P>
<P>
The official opening of the Nanning-Kunming Railway in 1997
also greatly raised the gulf's economic status, especially among
coastal regions, and port cities are improving infrastructure for
better development. Guangdong's Zhanjiang Harbor now has 18
million tons in annual handling capacity, and Guangxi's Fangcheng
has increased its handling capacity to 8.5 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Girls In Southwestern China Get Assistance In Returning To School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The women's federation of China's
poorest province has helped 11,000 girls who dropped out of school
resume their studies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The southwestern province has gotten funds for special classes
for the girls, most of whom are from minority groups, in 30
poverty-ridden counties. Last year, there were 136 new 'Spring
Bud' classes, as part of this national program to educate girls.
</P>
<P>
The poverty relief program gets help not just from local people
and the government. One soldier in northwest China's Gansu
Province sent 1,000 yuan by mail to ten Miao minority girls to
help them continue their education, said Li Guihua, of the Guizhou
Women's Federation. Australia also plans to help support 150 poor
girls, she said.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou still has four million poor people living below the
poverty line, and has tried everything to help girls who have
dropped out even though it lacks funds, Li said, and collected
500,000 yuan (about 60,000 US dollars) in 1997, providing funding
for 7,000 more girls than the year before.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Celebrates National Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria celebrated its national day
on Tuesday and the 120th anniversary of independence from the
Ottoman Empire with a declaration of its own sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
President Peter Stoyanov told a gathering of senior officials
and foreign dignitaries in Sofia that the new national ideal is to
"build an independent, proud, sovereign Bulgaria in the family of
European nations."
</P>
<P>
"The historical conditions are favorable, as never before, to
realize this new Bulgarian national ideal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today Bulgaria faces new challenges and, unlike 120 years ago,
we can easily free ourselves from the predetermining of our fate
by the great powers," he added.
</P>
<P>
On March 3, 1878, Russia and Turkey signed the San Stefano
peace treaty, putting an end to the Russo-Turkish War and
emancipating Bulgaria after nearly 500 years of rule by the
Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria would also try to build economic prosperity and to
protect Bulgarians living abroad, Stoyanov added.
</P>
<P>
The president also paid his respect to the thousands Bulgarians
and Russian, Romanian, Finish, Ukrainian and Belarus soldiers and
officers who gave their lives for Bulgaria's liberty.
</P>
<P>
The national holiday was marked with religious ceremonies being
held in almost all Eastern Orthodox churches.
</P>
<P>
The celebrations started with a flag raising ceremony in front
of the monument to the unknown soldier in Sofia where President
Stoyanov and Parliamentary Chairman Yordan Sokolov laid wreaths.

<HEADLINE> Soros Considering Investing in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- George Soros, the U.S. financier
accused by some Asian countries of triggering the region's
financial crisis, is hunting for bargains in Thailand, a newspaper
report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Soros is one of several U.S. investors considering pumping 650
million dollars into the Thai Nakornthai Strip Mill.
</P>
<P>
A Soros fund last week also bought a five-percent stake in the
Thai electronics company GSS Array Technology PCL, which makes and
exports consumer electronics components, the Bangkok Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
Soros runs a group of hedge funds that include the
8.4-billion-dollar quantum fund, the world's biggest.
</P>
<P>
Soros' funds scaled down their investments in the region after
the currency crisis began in Thailand last July. Investors in Asia
and elsewhere tend to place great faith in his judgment.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's stock market, for example, rocketed in December
after Soros said he was comteplating new investment there.
</P>
<P>
Soros has not publicly expressed an opinion on the health of
Thailand's financial market. But despite Soros' reported intention
to invest in Thailand and purchase of some of the GSS Array's
stake, Thailand's stock market ended mixed Tuesday and GSS Array's
price fell six baht to 184 baht a share.
</P>
<P>
The price, however, reflected a 27-percent gain since February
20 when Soros's Quantum Emerging Growth Fund reported to the stock
exchange of Thailand that it had bought about one million GSS
Array shares at 145 baht apiece.
</P>
<P>
Nakornthai Strip Mill's stock also declined Tuesday, closing
at 8.20 baht a share, down 0.20 baht.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asian leaders, notably Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, accused Soros of sparking Asia's economic crisis
by speculating on regional currencies and stampeding investors
into a sell-off.

<HEADLINE> New Voting System Guarantees Deputies' Lawful Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua)-- A new electronic voting system to
be put to use at the forthcoming National People's Congress (NPC)
is highly reliable, and above all, confidential, according to a
senior technician serving the congress.
</P>
<P>
"The software of the system is designed to make it impossible
to track down any individual deputy's voting options," said Tao
Mingguo who is in charge of revamping an earlier obsolete
conference management system at the Great Hall of the People, the
venue of the counntry's high-level Party and government meetings,
including annual NPC sessions.
</P>
<P>
"Use of the system will allay concerns of some deputies who
feared that their voting choices could be monitored and traced,"
said Tao. "The confidential nature of the system ensures that
duputies'lawful rights be fully protected."
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC is to convene its first session from March 5 to
through 19, during which deputies will elect or confirm new
government leaders, including the president, the premier and
ministers, through secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the voting system, updated conference facilities
include a registration system, a vote-casting system and a
display system.
</P>
<P>
For the display system, two 150-inch color projection screens
have replaced old monochrome display boards at both sides of the
podium of the central meeting hall, which can not only show the
voting results but also pictures, photos and documentaries.
</P>
<P>
"The Great Hall of the People now has a first-class
computerized conference management system," said Tao.
</P>
<P>
A computer system serving the congress has also been updated.
The system with a dozen terminals in the Great Hall of the People
has more than 10 data banks which make accessible to deputies a
large amount of information covering national laws and
regulations, major national and provincial economic statistics and
namelists of central and local government officials, among others.
</P>
<P>
An official with the NPC information center said that technically
people can access the Internet through the computer system. "Hopely the
day will soon come when deputies can browse the Internet through our
system," he said.

<HEADLINE> Alatas Denies Rumors on US Military base in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has denied rumors that
the United States is planning to have a military base in
Indonesia, arguing that allowing a foreign power to set up such a
base would violate a national political principle.
</P>
<P>
"There has not been and there never will be such a request. It
there is, it is clear that Indonesia will reject it," official
Antara news agency Wednesday quoted Foreign Ministry Ali Alatas as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's foreign policy does not allow any foreign military
base within the country. "It's only a rumor ... there is no
foreign military base," the minister said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense and Security Minister Edi Sudradjat also
denied the reports that the United States has set up naval bases
in Biak and Natuna islands.
</P>
<P>
"That is a forbidden policy. Indonesia is a sovereign nation,
so it is impossible for foreigners to install military bases," he
said Tuesday on the sidelines of the People's Consultative
Assembly's session here.
</P>
<P>
Some reports said earlier that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
special envoy Walter Mondale, who arrived here on Monday for a
two-day visit, would discuss political issues including setting up
military bases here with the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
Mondale, Former vice president in Jimmy Carter's
administration, met with President Soeharto here Tuesday. They
only talked about the economic crisis in Indonesia and bilateral
relations during their 90-minute meeting.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Float Global Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government would
issue 500 million U.S. dollars worth of global bonds late this
month to boost the country's gross international reserve.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer Wednesday quoted acting Finance
Secretary Cecilia Soriano as saying that Manila has chosen two
U.S.-based investment banks, Morgan Stanley and JP Morgan, to
float the bonds.
</P>
<P>
Soriano said that while the terms of the flotation have yet to
be finalized, the fresh government borrowings would likely carry a
maturity of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
She added that proceeds of the bond float would be deposited
with the central bank to beef up the country's gross international
reserve which currently stood at 9.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A healthy gross international reserve level assures the market
of sufficient liquidity in times of a financial crunch.
</P>
<P>
Soriano said that the bond issuance would serve as a benchmark
for future investors to follow, expressing confidence that there
would be a strong appetite for Philippine debt papers in the
global market.
</P>
<P>
After the government's bond float, two Philippines companies,
the National Power Corp. and the Development Bank of the
Philippines, would also float bonds for refinancing purposes.
</P>
<P>
The government last entered the foreign capital market for
fresh borrowings when it successfully issued Samurai bonds in
Japan two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Playing Bigger Role In Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment has become a
major force in the 13.9 percent economic growth in east China's
Fujian Province, according to one local government official.
</P>
<P>
The official said that a one percent increase in foreign
investment can increase Fujian's gross domestic product (GDP) --
the value of goods and services -- by 0.84 percent.
</P>
<P>
The province now ranks 12th in the nation in overall economic
strength and seventh in per capita GDP. It has 22,000
foreign-backed firms, with 23 billion US dollars worth of overseas
investment, and about 30 percent of the top 100 industrial firms
in the province have been helped by foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The technological level was also raised and nearly a half of
the technical improvement projects in the cities of Fuzhou,
Xiamen, and Quanzhou involved foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded firms have also contributed to the province's
exports. In 1997, they exported 6.4 billion US dollars worth of
goods, accounting for 56 percent of the province's total.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan Jointly Release New PC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The first product of the alliance
between Legend and Hitachi made its debut last week in Beijing,
with executives from both companies promising more to come,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Legend, China's top PC maker, and Japan-based Hitachi released
a compact PC called Wentian - meaning "probing heaven". The
alliance, established last September, has caught the attention of
the world's IT sector.
</P>
<P>
Although it looks standard and follows the Windows-Intel
structure, the new PC is noteworthy for its compact design, which
gives the impression that it integrates many characteristics of
both desktop and notebook PCs.
</P>
<P>
With monitor and host combined in a single unit, the computer
is only 19 centimeters in depth, occupying 60 percent less space
than a traditional desktop.
</P>
<P>
The computer is targeted first at customers such as financial
institutions and hotels, which need both space and quality.
</P>
<P>
The computer has an Intel 200 MHz processor and Fax/Modem card
and a self-adaptable card for accessing with the Internet. They
are two models: a 13.3-inch and a 12.1-inch.
</P>
<P>
Legend was responsible for design and integrating the
components into a workmanlike computer. Hitachi's contribution
centered on the liquid crystal screen, which is claimed to enable
high quality display, to reduce radiation - which a desktop
monitor cannot do, and to save energy by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
This kind of screen is usually used in notebook
computers. Legend is also responsible for marketing the computer
in the Chinese market under the Legend brand and Hitachi for the
overseas market, using the Hitachi name.
</P>
<P>
Although the No.1 player in China's PC market, Legend is not in
the forefront of the world's IT development and has no foot-hold
in the production of key computer components.
</P>
<P>
Collaborating with Hitachi could allow Legend to feel the pulse
of technological advance in the world's IT industry and to prepare
for future challenges.
</P>
<P>
For Hitachi, the hope is that partnership with Legend will help
it expand production and strengthen its presence in the computer
industry, where it has limited market penetration in terms of
traditional computers. The paper said.

Agriculture has also become a major place for Fujian-Taiwan
cooperation with the establishment of two trial zones in the field.

To further promote its cooperation with Taiwan, Fujian will
adopt more preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Province Sets Goals for Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan Province
is hoping to increase its agricultural output value by 5 percent
to 138.5 billion yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the provincial goals for agricultural
development this year. The goals also include an increase of 250
million kilograms (kg) in its grain output, which is estimated at
35.76 billion kg this year.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers' per capita income is projected at 1,680 yuan for
1998, local sources said.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, home of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, is one
of China's leading agricultural provinces. It is also the most
populous province in west China with 83 million residents,
accounting for 6.8 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Though the province only has 6 percent of the country's
farmland, with a per capita farmland acreage of 0.05 hectares, it
is the most reliable production center for grain and non-staple
foodstuffs for west China, The province also ships surplus grain
to other parts of the country annually after feeding its local
populace.
</P>
<P>
Local governments at various levels have always placed
agriculture ahead of all other economic work and have been
persisting in a policy of maintaining grain production, expanding
into a diverse economy and developing rural industry. Sichuan
reported a record grain harvest of 35.5 billion kg last
year.

PANAMA CITY, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Health Minister
Aida Libia de Rivera today urged her people to destroy the
breeding places of the aedes aegypti mosquito -- the carrier of
the deadly dengue illness.
</P>
<P>
"If Panamanians do not try to eliminate the breeding places, we

</P>
<P>
Dengue, transmitted by the aedes aegypti mosquito which breeds
in stagnant water, is a tropical disease with symptoms of severe
pains and high fever.

The Health Minister said that a recent survey showed around
25,000 potential mosquito breeding spots have been located.
Destroying them would prevent the disease spreading in Panama.

CHENGDU, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's oldest
irrigation system, at Dujiangyan in Sichuan Province, has
completed its annual renovation.
</P>
<P>
The system, which is 55 kilometers from Chengdu, the provincial
capital, is more than 2,400 years old. China did some
reconstruction work on it in 1986, and again in 1991, and it now
covers 667,000 hectares of arable land, from plains to hilly
areas, in the largest irrigated area in the country.
</P>
<P>
The irrigated area feeds 18 percent of Sichuan's people with 14
percent of its arable land, and 22.3 percent of the grain produced
in Sichuan comes from Dujiangyan area. Its industrial and
agricultural output accounted for 60 and 30 percent of Sichuan's
total respectively.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Geology
and Mineral Resources has Pledged to expand international
co-operation in the development of China's mineral industry this
year.
</P>
<P>
Such co-operation will focus more on the economic aspects,
rather than merely on technological exchanges, today's China Daily
quoted Minister Song Ruixiang as saying.
</P>
<P>
As part of this year's work schedule, the ministry plans to
continue tapping mineral resources in Africa, South America and
some of China's neighboring countries, Song said.
</P>
<P>
Minerals such as oil, copper, gold and sylvite will be the
targets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the influx of overseas funds to the resource-rich
but less developed western parts of China will be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
As for international co-operation in technological issues, the
work will target a geological study on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
an underground water tapping program in northwest China and an
extensive adoption of updated geological technologies, Song said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attracted 11.44 million yuan (1.37 million US
dollars) last year to explore 20 varieties of minerals such as
gold and diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The country's mineral trade volume in 1997 reached 34.63
million yuan (4.17 million US dollars), up 77 percent from 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Ronaldo's first-half goal gave Inter
Milan of Italy a 1-0 home victory over defending champions Schalke
04 of Germany in the UEFA Cup quarter-final first leg on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Atletico Madrid of Spain beat Aston Villa of England 1-0, Lazio
of Italy edged Auxerre of France 1-0, and Ajax Amsterdam of the
Netherlands lost to Spartak Moscow of Russia 3-1 in others.
</P>
<P>
In Milan, Ronaldo, the two-time Footballer of the Year, shot
past goalkeeper Jens Lehmann in the 16th minute with a left-footer
in the box after flicking passes with French international Youri
Djorkaeff.
</P>
<P>
The Germans, who beat Inter 4-1 in a penalty shootout in last
year's final, came close to level before halftime when striker
Martin Max's header bounced onto Gianluca Pagliuca's right-hand
post.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, subsititute Pierluigi Casiraghi scored the winner for
Lazio on his first touch after he rose from the bench for
midfielder Giorgio Venturin.
</P>
<P>
Casiraghi stole in when the French club's defenders misjudged
Czech Pavel Nedved's cross and rocketed into the net at the back
post in the 64th minute.
</P>
<P>
But the hosts had to scrap to hold onto their slim lead when
Yugoslav playmaker Vladimir Jugovic was expelled for a second
bookable offence two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
In Amsterdam, Alexander Shirko's double in 26th and 52th
minutes and Valery Kechinov's 84th-minute goal put Spartak the
driving seat in the two-leg playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Ajax had the better of the game but their finishes always fell
short while their opponents showed no mistake in fast
counter-attacks to pile up a 2-0 lead before Shota Arveladze
pulled one back for the hosts in the 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
In Madrid, Atletico dominated most of the possession and their
efforts were paid off by Italian striker Christian Vieri's penalty
in the 41 minites after Jose Luis Caminero was bundled by Ian
Taylor in the box.
</P>
<P>
Stan Collymore was subsituted after 51 mintes for a leg
injury.

BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The second phase of the China
Financial Data Communication Backbone Network has passed
acceptance tests, paving the way for the country's financial
institutions and banks to share information on line, today's
"China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing-based newspaper, so far, altogether
200 nodes of China's National Financial Data Communication Network
(CNFN) spreading among 166 cities have been installed and
connected.
</P>
<P>
CNFN has become China's biggest Frame Relay network with 400
Frame Relays, over 2,600 user ports and 80 Megabyte total band
width.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the backbone network including 34 nodes was
completed in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Since completion of the second phase on December 29, 1997, 101
users from eight financial institutions have used CNFN whose
monthly information processing reaches 370 billion bytes. The Bank
of China is a 24-hour customer of CNFN.
</P>
<P>
CNFN is capable of providing many applications including Local
Area Networks (LAN), IBM, SNA system networking, voice transfer on
Frame Relay, video conference transfers and virtual private
networks.
</P>
<P>
US-based Cisco, as the equipment provider of the first phase,
continued to participate in the second phase construction by
providing ATM facilities and network management system Strata View
Plus.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Cisco announced in Beijing the second stage of its
strategy to integrate data, voice and video traffic on a single
network infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
With multiservice support already built into its side area
network (WAN) systems, Cisco has added another piece of the total
solution by introducing new multiservice WAN access products and
outlined plans to continue its voice-over-IP product rollout.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that businesses will greatly reduce their costs
as network voice transfer enables them to pay long-distance calls
at a local phone rate. What's more, it provides better acoustic
effects, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Fast-track Setting Up of Loan-Loss Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
will fast-track the banks' compliance to set aside an additional
two percent of their loan portfolio as a reserve against bad
loans.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Star reported on Wednesday that this was
revealed by Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson, who explained
that the setting up of the loan-loss reserve is part of government
effort to strengthen the banking sector in response to a growing
threat of bank failures.
</P>
<P>
Singson said he is set to talk anew with Deogracias Vistan,
president of the Bankers Association of the Philippines, about the
fast-tracking.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the central bank regulated that the banks must set
aside the two-percent loan-loss reserve within two years as a rise
in the bad loans of banks has been noted.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Deputy Governor Alberto Reyes said the
non-performing loans of the country's 56 commercial banks went up
to five percent of their total loan portfolio as of the end of
last year from the 3.91 percent posted last September.
</P>
<P>
Reyes had warned that if banks' bad loans continue to rise by
the first quarter this year, the central bank would be forced to
go ahead with its plan to speed up the compliance of banks to the
two-percent loan-loss reserve.
</P>
<P>
However, local bankers had expressed opposition to the plan,
saying it would only add "aggravation to an already pressured
market".
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that although the plan would strengthen the
banking sector's ability against non-performing loans, it would
reduce the banks' liquidity and lead to higher interest rates that
are plaguing the country's economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Xihaigu Prefecture of Northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Automonous Region, one of the country's most
impoverished area, has experienced steady development
in the past year, thanks to relief efforts by the central and local
governments.
</P>
<P>
The eight-county prefecture, occupying 30,456 square kilometers
in the southern part of the region, has suffered from erosion,
hail, frost, flood and windstorms, which seriously hampered
agricultural and industrial production.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the region's government sent more than 3,200
cadres at all levels to the mountainous villages to help farmers
fight against natural disasters and escape poverty in 1997. For
another, the government greatly supported the prefecture's private
economy and promoted its economic cooperation with coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 130 million yuan was allocated to improve 20,000
hectares of farmland and dig 64,000 wells. Meanwhile, the
technology of maize plastic film was used on 32,000 hectares of
farmland, 14,000 hectares more than 1996.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the prefecture harvested 678 million kilograms of
grain in 1997. More than 200,000 farmers were able to rise above
the poverty line. This helped reduce the number of people below
poverty line in the area to half a million.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has developed a group of township-run
enterprises and individual household-operated firms, which are
mainly engaged in processing farm-related products.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, the prefecture had 45,000 private
enterprises and individual household-operated firms, which brought
in 720 million yuan of output value and sales.
</P>
<P>
To open wider to the outside, the prefecture signed more than
40 economic cooperation contracts with more than 10 provinces and
municipalities which brought in 200 million yuan of investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, overseas investment has boosted economic development
in this barren and mountainous area.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Recent statistics show that three
out of every 100 Shanghai children under the age of six suffer
from obesity, 6.24 times the rate for only a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the rise to the higher intake of calories and
carbohydrates, as well as the lack of adequate exercise.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the one-child policy some two decades
ago. Chinese parents have pampered children with affection and
allowed them to engage in overindulgence of nonnutritious foods.

Experts say the ratio of obese children will quite likely
continue to grow along with improving standards of living.

<HEADLINE> Two Million Shanxi Residents Rise above Poverty Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2.04 million poor
people living in rural areas of north China's Shanxi province now
have enough to eat and wear due to an anti-poverty program started
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
By 1993, Shanxi, a major coal producer in the country, had 3.81
million rural people suffering absolute poverty. These poor
people were mainly distributed in 50 counties of Taihang and
Luliang mountainous regions where natural conditions are harsh and
the agricultural foundation and infrastructure are poor.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, the central and provincial governments have
pumped in 2 billion yuan for poverty relief coupled with hundreds
of millions in funds raised by local governments at lower levels
for the same purpose.
</P>
<P>
With the funds, residents of the impoverished areas have been
working hard to rebuild infrastructures, plant trees and cash
crops, improve agricultural production conditions and start new
factories.
</P>
<P>
The province has also selected and dispatched more than 24,000
government officials at different levels to poverty-stricken
villages to help the poverty elimination effort, while mobilizing
all forces of the society to join the aid program.
</P>
<P>
So far, all people suffering absolute poverty in 18 of the
province's 50 poor counties have risen above the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
In February of 1994, the Central Chinese Government announced a
major poverty relief plan of concentrating manpower, material and
funds on helping the country's 80 million impoverished people get
enough to eat and wear in the seven years beginning in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Because of these concerted efforts, the country's poor
population has been reduced to 58 million.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Lower Drinking Limit for Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday called for legislation to get states to lower their legal
limit for drinking for drivers.
</P>
<P>
At a White House ceremony, Clinton announced his support for an
amendment in Congress, under which states would be required to
lower to 0.08 percent the blood-alcohol level at which a driver is
declared legally drunk.
</P>
<P>
Clinton instructed Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater to
come up with a plan to make 0.08 percent the legal limit on all
federal property.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "To people who disregard the lethal threat they
pose when they drink and drive, lowering the legal limit will send
a strong message that our nation will not tolerate irresponsible
acts that endanger our children and our nation."
</P>
<P>
Most states use a more lenient limit of 0.10 or higher, and the
organization Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) contends a
nationwide change to 0.08 would save hundreds of lives and prevent
thousands of injuries each year.
</P>
<P>
MADD representatives and highway safety advocates attended the
White House ceremony.
</P>
<P>
A recent MADD survey showed nearly seven in 10 Americans
favored a lower blood-alcohol limit. Researchers also said 53
percent of the 1,000 people surveyed said they considered drunken
driving to be the nation's No. 1 highway safety problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, more than 17,100 people died in alcohol-related
vehicle crashes nationwide, about 41 percent of all traffic
deaths, officials estimate. Of the total deaths, about 9 percent,
or more than 3,700, involved drivers with blood-alcohol levels
below the legal 0.10 percent limit.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the amendment said studies showed that up to 600
lives could be saved annually with a national 0.08 percent law.

WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed when a
small plane crashed in a remote area of Idaho Monday night, the
United Press International reported today.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank Tuesday
announced the approval of a 13.7 million U.S. dollar equivalent
credit for a second education project to support the government's
drive to enroll all school-age children in Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
This project will focus on children from rural areas, where
access to higher grade levels is highly constrained. The resources
will be used to construct and upgrade schools, improve teacher
training, and strengthen management support for the system.
</P>
<P>
The credit is provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary lending arm for
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 21.2 million
dollars. In addition to the IDA credit, the Swiss Development
Cooperation will contribute 5.5 million dollars and the remaining
2.0 million dollars will come from the government.
</P>
<P>
Other ongoing World Bank activities in Bhutan include the third
forestry project approved in 1993.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Appeals Emergency Assistance for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UNICEF request for 4 million U.S. dollars follows four
weeks of shelling and street combat in the capital city of
Freetown. Calm has been restored in the capital, but skirmishes,
ambushes and looting continue in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of basic infrastructure since last May's coup
d'etat has placed the country in a desperate situation.
Humanitarian programs in the relatively safe northern regions were
devastated by last month's fighting. Current assessment of living
standards in the southern and eastern areas of Sierra Leone reveal
grave health and nutritional conditions, according to UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
"Children have been specially affected," the coordinated UN
appeal says. "They have been exposed to acts of violence and
many were sent into battle as combatants, suffering deaths and
injuries." The trauma is even greater for those who have been
orphaned or displaced, the appeal says.
</P>
<P>
The recent fighting in the country is a continuation of the
civil strife that began in 1991, during which children were
commonly abducted and forced to join military units. By 1997,
children between the age of 7 and 14 reportedly constituted 80
percent of the rebel forces which helped to overthrow the
elected government.
</P>
<P>
Of more than 10,000 sierra Leoneans killed in the civil
conflict, half were children, and children comprise the majority
of the 20 percent of the population who were disabled by the
fighting.

WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Vernon Jordan, U.S. President
Bill Clinton's close friend, appeared for several hours Tuesday
before the grand jury investigating Clinton`s relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
After a day behind closed doors with the federal grand jury,
Jordan told reporters, "I answered all of their questions
truthfully and completely, to the best of my ability."
</P>
<P>
He said he'd return on Thursday for more questions.
</P>
<P>
On his friendship with Clinton, Jordan, a prominent Washington
Lawyer and longtime civils figure, said, "Let me reassure you that
ours is an enduring friendship, an enduring friendship based on
mutual respect, trust and admiration."
</P>
<P>
Earlier White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters he
thought that Jordan would "absolutely" give testimony helpful to
the president.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's attorney, William Hundley, said "there is no rift"
between Clinton and Jordan.
</P>

Hundley described his client Tuesday as "fine, cool" shortly
after Jordan arrived at the courthouse in the morning.

However, some senators expressed their reservations and

</P>
<P>
Although the resolution approved by the committee does not put
limits on future NATO expansion, several senators were expected to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Arms Sales Total 8.8 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States arms sales
totaled 8.8 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 1997, the lowest figure
in 10 years, the Arms Trade News reported in its February edition.
</P>
<P>
The figure, obtained by the Arms Trade News from the Pentagon's
Foreign Military Sales Program, also represents a 15 percent
decline from the 1996 sales due mainly to significant decrease of
purchases by some Middle East nations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's purchases were 25 percent lower than 1996 levels,
dropping over 350 million dollars to 1.06 billion dollars. Arms
acquisitions by Israel and Saudi Arabia were reduced by more than
40 percent from 1996. Israel's purchases totaled 525 million
dollars, down 358 million dollars and that of Saudi Arabia fell
more than 550 million dollars to 742 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Further, Kuwait acquisitions dropped 80 percent compared to
1996 levels with contracts valued at just 48 million dollars in
1997. Jordan also reduced its purchases in 1997 by 92 percent to
18 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other large drops in procurement of U.S. weapons last year came
in Denmark, down 76 percent to 32 million dollars, and Norway,
down 87 percent to 64 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Australia and some European nations increased
remarkably their arms imports from the United States in 1997.
Australia's acquisitions rose 66 percent to 288 million dollars
and Belgium doubled its contracts to 122 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
While France tripled its purchases to 102 million dollars in
1997, Spain's purchases were up more than six times its 1996
levels to a total of 828 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other traditional big purchasers of U.S. Arms were South Korea,
854 million dollars; Britain, 559 million dollars; Taiwan, 353
million dollars; Japan, 347 million dollars; Turkey, 339 million
dollars; Germany 325 million dollars. The Netherlands, 225 million
dollars and Greece 224 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.N. Resolution Provides Authority of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
Tuesday that Iraq should be under no illusion about the meaning of
a U.N. Security Council resolution, which warns Iraq of "the
severest consequences" if it fails to comply with an agreement on
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Iraq should be under no illusion. The
meaning of `severest consequences' is clear. It provides authority
of act if Iraq does not turn the commitment it has made into
compliance," Clinton said during an East Room ceremony about
combating drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
He said the Security Council vote Monday night on the
resolution set a clear message to Iraq that it must allow
inspections of suspected weapons sites "without obstruction or
delay, any place, any time, without any conditions, deadlines or
excuses."
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned Iraq that "no promise of peace and no policy of
patience can be without its limits."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the "severest
consequences" contained in the Security Council resolution meant
Iraq would face military strikes if it failed to live up to the
agreement it reached last week with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"The United States clearly has stated, and the president has so
stated, that any reneging on the commitments Iraq has acknowledged
will lead to severest consequences, which very clearly means
military action," McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin also said the severest
consequences in the Security Council resolution was "the clearest
possible threat to use force that the Security Council has taken
since this crisis began last year."
</P>
<P>
"The world is now supporting a strong, clear threat that
military force will ensue if Iraq violates this agreement, and
that's why we think this resolution was so important," Rubin told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
said the United States views the Security Council resolution as a
"green light" to attack Iraq if Clinton decides Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein wasn't living up to the agreement. His remarks came
as a majority of Security Council members said only the Security
Council had authority to determine if Iraq had broken its word.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen Tuesday announced in a
statement that the U.S. military will begin vaccinating 36,000
American troops in the Gulf this month against the deadly anthrax
biological agent as a "prudent action."
</P>
<P>
He said he had made the decision at the request of Marine Corps
Gen. Anthony Zinni, commander of U.S. forces in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"After a careful review, I have concluded that vaccination
against anthrax is a safe, prudent force protection measure," he
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Zinni Tuesday told the Senate Armed Services Committee that
U.S. forces in the Gulf remained ready to act if necessary. "They
understand the mission and they are prepared to do what it takes."

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Kosovo Parties to Start Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Tuesday called on all
parties in the Kosovo unrest to exercise restraint and settle
their disputes through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying "Turkey regrets
that the clashes in Kosovo resulted in a loss of life," according
to the semi-official Anatolia news agency.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale clashes between ethnic Albanian civilians and
Serbian riot police were reported since last week in the southern
Yugoslavian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At least 16 Albanians and four policemen were killed in the
bloody disturbances triggered by an alleged Albanian terrorist
ambush which claimed the life of a Serbian policeman on February
28.
</P>
<P>
Expressing concern over the Kosovo unrest, the statement urged
the parties to the conflict immediately start "a constructive
dialogue and find a peaceful and wise solution within the
framework of Yugoslavia's territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
The basic rights and freedoms as well as ethnic, religious and
cultural identities of all the peoples living in Kosovo should be
respected and guaranteed, it said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which had strong historical links with ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo, has been keeping a close military relationship with
Albania in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that Ankara was anxious that the Kosovo
unrest could spread to the whole Balkans which was termed as "a
hotbed of war" in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Russia and the European Union have voiced
their grave concern about the tensions in Kosovo, demanding the
Yugoslav government deal with it in a cautious and proper
manner.

<HEADLINE> British Government Considers Further Crackdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- The British government is
considering further strengthening the measures currently in place
for dealing with child pornography on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
A voluntary body called the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) was
set up by the government and industry over a year ago to tackle
the growing problem of illegal material, chiefly child
pornography, posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In its first annual report, the IWF said it had received 781
complaints referring to 4,300 items on the Net in the 12 months
since it established a complaints hotline.
</P>
<P>
Department of Trade and Industry minister Barbara Roche Tuesday
welcomed what the IWF has done but announced that the government
is to review the watchdog's role aimed at widening the work it
does.
</P>
<P>
"The Government is not complacent about illegal and harmful
material on the Internet and we intend to uphold the law on-line
as we do off-line." the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Almost 2,000 images of child pornography have been removed from
the Internet as a result of IWF's action, but as the IWF itself
acknowledged, the amount it catches is just a "very small
proportion" of the total available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated 70,000 pornography sites on the Internet
and more are added each day.
</P>
<P>
To remove more of those illegal materials more quickly, the IWF
plans to patrol the Net itself rather than wait for complaints
from the public on its e-mail hotline.
</P>
<P>
It is also proposing a ratings system for the Internet, similar
to that for classifying films and videos.
</P>
<P>
However, many child protection groups claimed that the IWF can
only help to remove a small amount of child pornography, they said
that a specialized police unit is still needed.
</P>
<P>
Last week, London's Metropolitan Police Force announced that it
is considering prosecuting companies which provide Internet
services but fail to filter out illegal pornography.
</P>
<P>
The police are concerned about specific discussion forums,
known as news groups, which they believed are used by paedophiles
to exchange photographs and videos. The police said that they want
these news groups banned.

<HEADLINE> World Drug Sales Rise 6 Pct in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Drug sales in the world's 10
biggest markets rose 6 percent to 166 billion U.S. dollars last
year, according to figures published Tuesday by IMS International,
a specialist market research company.
</P>
<P>
The company said that compared with recent years, last year's
rise of drug sales was modest, mainly due to Japanest government
cost-control measures which led to a 1 percent fall in drug sales
in Japan to 41.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that drug sales in Canada and the U.S. made the
biggest gains, rising 12 percent to 4.1 billion dollars and 10
percent to 66.5 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fastest growing market in Europe was Spain, where sales
increased by 10 percent to 4.9 billion dollars. Then followed the
UK and the Netherlands, with sales up 7 percent to 7.7 billion
dollars and 1.9 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
Italy and France came in the third and fourth place, with sales
up 5 and 4 percent to 8.7 billion dollars and 13.7 billion dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sales in Germany rose only 2 percent to 14.7 billion dollars as
a result of the German government's control in drug costs.
</P>
<P>
By medical area, the fastest growing sector was nervous system
drugs, with sales rising 12 percent to 23.5 billion dollars. The
biggest single market was heart drugs, with sales up 6 percent to
33.8 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iran Strives to Boost Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran is striving to rejuvenate its
tourism industry and raise tourism revenues to 1 billion
U.S. dollars next year from 260 million last year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Deputy Cultural Minister Mohammad Moezeddin, in an
interview with Xinhua, said the prospect for Iran's tourism is
bright.
</P>
<P>
Iran is not matched in the world in terms of historic sites,
pre-Islamic civilization dating back to some 20,000 years ago,
varied topographies and beautiful natural scenes, said Moezeddin,
who is also the managing director of Iran's Tourism Organization.
</P>
<P>
About 460,000 foreign tourists visited Iran during the Iranian
year from March 21, 1996 to March 20, 1997, and the country earned
about 260 million U.S. dollars, said the Iranian official.
</P>
<P>
Moezeddin believed that the tourism revenue in the current year
would surely exceed 500 million dollars, and Iran has expected to
earn 1 billion dollars next year, since more foreign tourists are
drawn to this country.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has worked out a package plan to bolster
tourism through encouraging private sector to invest in tourism,
introducing Iran's tourism resources to the world and expanding
cooperation with international tourist agencies, Moezeddin said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the claims that strict religious regulations have
obstructed the development of tourism in Iran, saying that many
western tourists have maintain that Iranian women with Hijab
(Islamic dress code) are wonderful sights for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Iran's goals to promote tourism are not only aimed at
increasing its revenues, but more importantly improving contacts,
exchanges and understanding between nations, Moezeddin said.
</P>
<P>
Through tourism nations will learn how to live with each other
peacefully, he pointed out.
